"掬起一捧水拍在自己臉上，周澤慢慢地抬起頭，看著鏡子裡的自己，略顯憔悴，作為一名急診科醫生，這種憔悴仿佛是一種標配。\n\n\n\n  「周醫生，有新病人馬上就到，好像是從樓上摔下來的，不知道是不是自殺！」護士王雅站在男衛生間門口喊道。\n\n\n\n  「知道了，馬上就來。」周澤回應了一聲，然後抽出紙巾將水珠擦乾淨開始往外走。\n\n\n\n  救護車很快就開入了醫院，擔架車上躺著的是一位身穿灰色唐裝的老者，老者不停地在咳嗽，不時有血沫子以及脾臟器官碎片被咳出來了，全身上下都是血污。\n\n\n\n  周澤馬上跑了過去一邊推擔架車一邊觀察傷者情況，同時對前頭的人喊道：「準備手術器械，快！」\n\n\n\n  傷者的情況很不好。\n\n\n\n  「我…………我…………不想死。」\n\n\n\n  老者睜著眼，看著自己身邊距離自己最近的周澤。\n\n\n\n  「放心，你不會有事的，我們會幫助你，你死不了。」\n\n\n\n  大部分垂危的患者，在這個時候都會說這種話，能真正平靜面對死亡的人，畢竟是少數，而作為醫生，在這個時候當然不是和傷者分析病情告訴你你有幾成把握能活下來的時候，傷者這個時候所需要的，是心理的慰藉。\n\n\n\n  「不…………不…………下面…………下面…………下面真的太可怕了…………」 \n\n\n\n  老者忽然攥住了周澤的手腕，一臉嚴肅地看著周澤。\n\n\n\n  「你穩定一下情緒，放輕鬆，你的生命不會有問題。」雖然手腕處有些生疼，但周澤還是沒有去嘗試掙脫掉。\n\n\n\n  「我不想……不想再下去了……他們……他們發現我了……我……他們發現了我……」\n\n\n\n  「嘶……」周澤忽然感受到手腕的一陣刺痛。\n\n\n\n  「周醫生，你的手！」身邊的小護士馬上喊道。\n\n\n\n  老者的指甲很長，而且不知道因為什麼原因，他的指甲是黑色的，是那種類似琥珀般通透的黑色，不像是有污垢在裡面聚集的樣子；\n\n\n\n  而此時，老者的指甲已經嵌入了周澤手腕的肉里。\n\n\n\n  「我不下去了……不下去了……不下去……哈哈……咳咳咳…………」\n\n\n\n  老者忽然挺起身子劇烈地咳嗽起來，緊接著，身體一顫，原本抓著周澤的手脫落下去，整個人失去了動靜。\n\n\n\n  「準備搶救！」周澤喊道。\n\n\n\n  老者被推入了急診室，有醫生護士開始對其進行搶救措施，同時電擊器也準備完畢。\n\n\n\n  「周醫生，我幫您處理一下傷口。」王雅這個時候走過來。\n\n\n\n  作為醫生，他們實際上並不擔心這點皮肉傷，他們最擔心的是萬一老者有其他的疾病，很可能讓醫生進入職業暴露的危險境地，畢竟老者手上剛剛有很多血，誰都不清楚他身上是不是有什麼傳染病。 \n\n\n\n  一些病，一點沾染上了，可能一輩子也就毀了。\n\n\n\n  傷口包紮好之後，急診室里走出來另一位醫生，對著周澤搖搖頭。\n\n\n\n  這意味著，人沒救過來。\n\n\n\n  大家的情緒都有些失落，但對於他們來說，這種事情，也已經見慣了，很快就會調整過來。\n\n\n\n  「周醫生，做個檢查吧。」王雅建議道。\n\n\n\n  「不了，我晚上還有點事情。」周澤搖搖頭，直接走到了更衣室那邊換了自己的衣服，然後走到醫院停車場開車離開。\n\n\n\n  車子剛開到江海大道高架下面，周澤的手機就響了。\n\n\n\n  「喂，我是周澤。」\n\n\n\n  「周醫生，孩子們都在等著你呢。」\n\n\n\n  「不好意思，吳校長，有個病人耽擱了，我現在馬上過去，讓小朋友們再等我一會兒。」\n\n\n\n  「好，好。」那邊很快掛斷了電話。\n\n\n\n  周澤又看了眼時間，已經晚上八點半，孤兒院的小朋友們平時都很早就睡覺。\n\n\n\n  紅燈變了綠燈，周澤踩下了油門，開了過去。\n\n\n\n  「嘟！！！！！！！！」\n\n\n\n  也就在此時，\n\n\n\n  一輛重卡闖紅燈開了過來，周澤只來得及側過頭看向車窗外那刺目的遠光燈， \n\n\n\n  隨即，\n\n\n\n  「砰！」\n\n\n\n  天旋地轉，\n\n\n\n  小轎車在重卡面前宛若一張嬌弱不堪的白紙直接被撞飛出去，在空中翻滾了好幾圈之後砸落在了地上。\n\n\n\n  …………\n\n\n\n  「額……」\n\n\n\n  周澤甦醒過來，\n\n\n\n  他發現自己的身體完全不能動，好像是被卡住了一樣。\n\n\n\n  同時，自己的眼睛也睜不開，他知道自己出了車禍，很嚴重的車禍，出於職業素養，他很想現在就檢查一下自己的受傷情況，但他沒辦法動彈。\n\n\n\n  四周，不時有其他車輛行駛而過的聲音，還有各種喇嘛聲。\n\n\n\n  我還在車禍現場麼，\n\n\n\n  我還在車子裡？\n\n\n\n  周澤在心裡想著。\n\n\n\n  很快，\n\n\n\n  警車的警笛聲傳來，還有消防車的聲音，\n\n\n\n  最後，讓周澤感到親切的救護車笛聲傳來。\n\n\n\n  周澤感知到自己的身體正在被挪動，附近的溫度稍微有些高，應該是在切割自己車子好把自己營救出來。\n\n\n\n  這種營救活動周澤參加過不少，對一些流程還是清楚的。 \n\n\n\n  可惜了，自己後車廂里的蛋糕，以及孤兒院孩子們的六一兒童節聚會，只能泡湯了。\n\n\n\n  「周醫生！」\n\n\n\n  熟悉的呼喚聲。\n\n\n\n  應該是院裡的陳醫生。\n\n\n\n  周澤在心裡長舒一口氣，至少，自己保下了一條命，這姑且也算是一場，飛來橫禍吧。\n\n\n\n  身邊還有幾名護士的聲音，因為附近太嘈雜，所以周澤聽得有些不清楚。\n\n\n\n  但接下來，陳醫生的一句話，讓周澤的心猛地陷入到了谷底！\n\n\n\n  「周醫生失去生命體徵了。」\n\n\n\n  不，\n\n\n\n  我沒死！\n\n\n\n  我還沒死！\n\n\n\n  我沒死啊！！\n\n\n\n  周澤在心裡拼命地吶喊！\n\n\n\n  他沒死，他還有意識，他沒死！\n\n\n\n  接下來，周澤感知到有人在對自己做心肺復甦，那一次次沉重的擠壓，他感受到了，卻沒辦法張開眼，也沒辦法去說話。\n\n\n\n  他沒死，\n\n\n\n  他希望他們快點發現他沒死！\n\n\n\n  但一通忙碌之後，\n\n\n\n  周澤聽到了幾名認識的護士哭泣的聲音， \n\n\n\n  陳醫生一拳打在了附近的車門上，顯得很是悲痛。\n\n\n\n  喂！\n\n\n\n  別放棄！\n\n\n\n  千萬別放棄！\n\n\n\n  我沒死！\n\n\n\n  我現在應該是假死狀態，\n\n\n\n  失血過多？\n\n\n\n  受傷嚴重？\n\n\n\n  但我真的沒死！\n\n\n\n  我應該還有呼吸的，我應該還有心跳的！\n\n\n\n  周澤在心底瘋狂地咆哮著。\n\n\n\n  但接下來，他感知到自己被抬到了擔架上，應該是被送入了救護車裡。\n\n\n\n  緊接著，就是救護車開動的聲音。\n\n\n\n  車廂里的護士們還在哭。\n\n\n\n  但這種哭聲在周澤耳中分外刺耳，\n\n\n\n  他還沒死，\n\n\n\n  哭什麼！\n\n\n\n  為什麼要哭！\n\n\n\n  你們再看看我，\n\n\n\n  再看看我，\n\n\n\n  再檢查一下，\n\n\n\n  我沒死啊！\n\n\n\n  救護車停了下來，\n\n\n\n  緊接著，周澤聽到了院領導的說話聲: \n\n\n\n  「小周人就這麼沒了？」\n\n\n\n  「車禍很嚴重，周醫生受傷過度，失血過多，已經確認死亡。」\n\n\n\n  「真的？人就這麼沒了？」另一位副院長還不相信。\n\n\n\n  「小周走了。」這是一位科室主任的聲音，「我剛剛又檢查了一遍。」\n\n\n\n  我沒死！\n\n\n\n  你們這幫庸醫！\n\n\n\n  我沒死！\n\n\n\n  你們這幫混蛋！\n\n\n\n  混蛋！\n\n\n\n  周澤在心裡不停地謾罵著，此時此刻，在他身邊的這幫人不再是他的同事，也不再是他的朋友，更不是他的領導和長輩，\n\n\n\n  他們居然認定自己已經死了，\n\n\n\n  但死人還能聽到聲音還有感知麼？\n\n\n\n  我沒死！\n\n\n\n  你們這幫混蛋，\n\n\n\n  畜生，\n\n\n\n  我沒死！\n\n\n\n  救我！\n\n\n\n  救我！\n\n\n\n  擔架車開始推動，四周靜悄悄的，而且溫度也在逐漸降低。\n\n\n\n  「小雅，你別太傷心了，院長說了明天院裡給周醫生開追悼會。」\n\n\n\n  「素琴姐，我只是有些不敢相信，一個人，就這麼沒了。周醫生多好的一個人啊，怎麼就這樣沒了。」 \n\n\n\n  「天有不測風雲，人有旦夕禍福，看開一點就好。」\n\n\n\n  兩個護士說完這些後，就離開了。\n\n\n\n  四周，\n\n\n\n  空蕩蕩的，\n\n\n\n  那種森然的涼意，\n\n\n\n  是那麼的清晰。\n\n\n\n  周澤不停地去掙扎，不停地想要去反抗，他想要醒來，他迫切地渴望發出自己的聲音。\n\n\n\n  但他現在的感覺，就像是鬼壓床一樣，任憑他不斷地努力，但自己的身體，卻根本不受自己控制了。\n\n\n\n  最終，\n\n\n\n  他有些絕望地放棄了，\n\n\n\n  他累了，\n\n\n\n  也疲憊了，\n\n\n\n  他知道自己現在在哪裡，\n\n\n\n  在醫院的，\n\n\n\n  太平間。\n\n\n\n  ………………\n\n\n\n  當周澤再度「醒來」時，是感知到自己臉上有一種淡淡的涼意，刺痛感也很清晰。\n\n\n\n  「妝化好了沒有？」有人在旁邊問。\n\n\n\n  「別急啊，等下，他整個人都被撞成這個樣子了，化妝哪裡有這麼快。」\n\n\n\n  「人家醫院都在催了，馬上要把他送去哀悼會那邊。」 \n\n\n\n  「要不你來嘛。」\n\n\n\n  殮妝師似乎有些生氣，化妝時更用力了，當然，她們面對的客戶是死人，死人自然不會說痛的，也不用擔心收到投訴，只需要讓活人看見成效就可以了。\n\n\n\n  周澤已經沒力氣掙扎了，\n\n\n\n  他就這樣安靜地待著，\n\n\n\n  承受著化妝筆在自己臉上不停按壓下來的刺痛感，\n\n\n\n  終於，\n\n\n\n  妝化結束了。\n\n\n\n  「行了，叫他們進來吧，我們活兒結束了。」\n\n\n\n  周澤感覺自己正在被換衣服，隨即，他被推了出去，醫院的護工將他抬送到了柔軟逼仄的空間裡。\n\n\n\n  這，\n\n\n\n  應該是冰棺。\n\n\n\n  然後，四周的一切嘈雜都在瞬間被隔離，\n\n\n\n  應該是蓋子被蓋上了。\n\n\n\n  抖動，\n\n\n\n  搖晃，\n\n\n\n  顛簸……\n\n\n\n  不知道過了多久，周澤終於又聽到了聲音，冰棺蓋子應該被打開了。\n\n\n\n  入耳的，\n\n\n\n  是哀樂。\n\n\n\n  院長拿著話筒在做講話，他在夸自己，在惋惜自己， \n\n\n\n  然後是副院長以及主任等等人。\n\n\n\n  周圍，\n\n\n\n  不時有腳步走過的聲音，\n\n\n\n  有人只是靜靜地走過去，看自己最後一眼，\n\n\n\n  有人還試圖喊自己幾聲，帶著哭腔，\n\n\n\n  這是在瞻仰遺容。\n\n\n\n  瞻仰，\n\n\n\n  我的遺容！\n\n\n\n  我沒死，\n\n\n\n  我真的沒死，\n\n\n\n  我還沒死！\n\n\n\n  沒死啊！\n\n\n\n  周澤在心底哀嚎著，\n\n\n\n  他又開始嘗試去努力，\n\n\n\n  但依舊沒辦法，\n\n\n\n  他只能聽得到，也能感受得到，\n\n\n\n  卻沒辦法說話，\n\n\n\n  也沒辦法睜開眼，\n\n\n\n  大家都認定他死了，\n\n\n\n  但他自己清楚，\n\n\n\n  他還沒死！\n\n\n\n  孤兒院的小朋友們也來了，在他身邊哭泣。\n\n\n\n  他們哭得很真誠，因為周澤自己也是從孤兒院裡走出來的孩子，也因此，工作之後，他的薪水大部分都捐獻給了孤兒院，這次出車禍，也是因為晚上趕著開車回孤兒院陪孩子們過六一兒童節。 \n\n\n\n  「小周啊，你安心地去吧，你這次，算是因公出事，你沒有家人，但你的賠償金醫院會給孤兒院的，你放心吧。」副院長站在周澤身邊說道。\n\n\n\n  隨後，\n\n\n\n  周澤感知到自己再次被隔絕起來，冰棺蓋子應該再度被閉合了。\n\n\n\n  然後又是一陣顛簸，\n\n\n\n  最後，停了下來。\n\n\n\n  冰棺蓋再度被打開，\n\n\n\n  四周，有些安靜，偶爾聽到人聲，卻不顯吵鬧。\n\n\n\n  有兩個人，一個抓著自己的肩膀一個抓著自己的雙腿將自己舉起來，然後放在了另一個冰冷的架子上，好像是鋼板。\n\n\n\n  這兩個人很熟練，非常非常的熟練。\n\n\n\n  周圍，隱約有依稀的哭聲。\n\n\n\n  周澤一開始還沒能分辨出自己又來到了哪個地方，\n\n\n\n  但在此時，\n\n\n\n  他忽然明白了，\n\n\n\n  王八蛋！\n\n\n\n  他們把自己送到了火葬場！\n\n\n\n  他們要燒了自己！\n\n\n\n  我沒死啊，王八蛋們！\n\n\n\n  艹你們祖宗！\n\n\n\n  我沒死！ \n\n\n\n  還沒死啊！\n\n\n\n  不要火化我，\n\n\n\n  不要火化我！\n\n\n\n  我真的還沒死啊！！！！！！！！！！！！！！\n\n\n\n  你們這幫畜生，\n\n\n\n  雜種！\n\n\n\n  狗娘養的！！！！！\n\n\n\n  這次，是周澤最發瘋的一次，也是最瘋狂的一次，\n\n\n\n  他知道，\n\n\n\n  一旦自己被火化了，\n\n\n\n  那就一點餘地都沒有了！\n\n\n\n  他將直接面對死亡！\n\n\n\n  徹徹底底地終結！\n\n\n\n  他不甘心，他真的不甘心，自己還不到三十歲，自己還沒成家，自己還沒有孩子，自己還有人生，自己還有好長的一段路可以走！\n\n\n\n  「媽媽，我剛看見這個叔叔的手動了一下。」一個小女孩怯生生地聲音在旁邊響起。\n\n\n\n  「啪！」一個小嘴巴子扇過去。\n\n\n\n  「別瞎說，等我回去收拾你。」女孩兒的母親斥責道。\n\n\n\n  周澤絕望了，\n\n\n\n  因為無論他如何掙扎，\n\n\n\n  如何在心底咆哮，\n\n\n\n  外面的人都無法感知到。 \n\n\n\n  他被放在了傳送帶上，\n\n\n\n  機器開始啟動，\n\n\n\n  他正在被往前推送，\n\n\n\n  他知道自己即將面對什麼，\n\n\n\n  也因此，他無比地恐懼！\n\n\n\n  不，\n\n\n\n  不，\n\n\n\n  不！\n\n\n\n  我沒死，我真的沒死！\n\n\n\n  不要燒了我！\n\n\n\n  不要燒了我！\n\n\n\n  沒人聽得到自己的呼喚，\n\n\n\n  他們只負責傷心，\n\n\n\n  只負責難過，\n\n\n\n  只負責將這個流程走完，\n\n\n\n  然後回家吃晚餐，明天繼續過。\n\n\n\n  終於，\n\n\n\n  周澤感知到自己似乎被推送進了一個滿是油渣味的狹窄地方，\n\n\n\n  緊接著，\n\n\n\n  有黏著的液體噴灑在了他的身上，\n\n\n\n  他知道這是什麼東西，\n\n\n\n  是汽油，\n\n\n\n  緊接著，\n\n\n\n  「滋滋……」\n\n\n\n  燙！ \n\n\n\n  非常燙！\n\n\n\n  疼，\n\n\n\n  劇烈的灼燒疼痛！\n\n\n\n  火，\n\n\n\n  火，\n\n\n\n  大火，\n\n\n\n  到處都是火…………",

    "content": "冷，\n\n\n\n  好冷……\n\n\n\n  周澤不知道為什麼這裡會這麼冷，\n\n\n\n  他行走在一條幽徑的小路上，小路的兩邊，開滿了鮮花，卻沒有絲毫浪漫美好的氣息，花朵嬌艷，像是一道道嘲諷，也像是圍觀的看客。\n\n\n\n  花開彼岸，人去往生；\n\n\n\n  周澤記得自己之前最後的記憶是火，大火，恐怖的火焰將自己完全吞噬，那令人心悸的炙熱溫度將自己烘烤成灰。\n\n\n\n  但轉眼間，\n\n\n\n  他卻來到了這裡。\n\n\n\n  在這條路上，其實還有許多人，\n\n\n\n  有老人，\n\n\n\n  有孩子，\n\n\n\n  也有年輕人和中年人，\n\n\n\n  有男有女，\n\n\n\n  大家穿的衣服各不相同。\n\n\n\n  有的人穿得很簡單，有的人穿著大紅大紫的衣服，臉上也畫著過分的腮紅。\n\n\n\n  大家都是踮著腳後跟在走路，\n\n\n\n  沒人說話，\n\n\n\n  也沒人發出其他聲音，\n\n\n\n  只剩下偶爾傳出的「擦擦擦」鞋底摩擦聲響。\n\n\n\n  周澤也在跟著所有人一起麻木地前行著，他不時地在張望，也在不時地回首，他隱約間意識到自己來到了什麼地方。 \n\n\n\n  他，已經死了；\n\n\n\n  而這裡，\n\n\n\n  是地獄。\n\n\n\n  這裡，是死者的世界，是亡者的歸宿，\n\n\n\n  自己，\n\n\n\n  終究還是死了。\n\n\n\n  他不知道該怎麼辦，也不知道該做出何種選擇，\n\n\n\n  他不想死，人，都是不想死的，但在這個地方，他完全不知道自己又該如何是好，他很迷茫，也很無助。\n\n\n\n  「咿呀……………………………………」\n\n\n\n  清冷的小調自遠處傳來，\n\n\n\n  周澤撇過頭，看見遠處走來一朵朵的鮮紅，而周圍其他人對此都熟視無睹，繼續麻木地踮著自己的腳後跟往前走去。\n\n\n\n  等近了之後，周澤看清楚了，那一朵朵鮮紅是一把把桃花紙傘，遠處，有一群女人，排著一條隊伍，撐著紙傘，婀娜走來。\n\n\n\n  她們身材高挑，體格風、、、騷，全都穿著紫色的旗袍，走動間，大腿的肉色不時露出，隱約的魅惑，讓人心悸。\n\n\n\n  女人們盤著髮髻，一絲不苟，甚至連她們的步履，都整整齊齊，仿佛世間最優秀的歌舞團，而且，她們已經排練了超過百年。\n\n\n\n  她們在走，\n\n\n\n  她們在行進， \n\n\n\n  從小徑的一端，走向另一端，\n\n\n\n  無巧不巧地，\n\n\n\n  自周澤面前經過。\n\n\n\n  精緻的妝容，雪白的肌膚，那哼出來的清冷長調，營造出了一種煙雨朦朧的老上海氛圍。\n\n\n\n  每個女人的手腕上，都戴著手鐲，顏色不一，大小也不同，襯托著她們的雪白皓腕，更令人目不暇接。\n\n\n\n  可惜，\n\n\n\n  她們不是行走在南大街商業步行區，\n\n\n\n  也不是金碧輝煌的高端會所瓦台，\n\n\n\n  她們腳踩著黃泉路，\n\n\n\n  掠過的是彼岸花海，\n\n\n\n  她們目不斜視，後者盯著前者，\n\n\n\n  最前者，\n\n\n\n  則目光空洞。\n\n\n\n  當最後一個女人自周澤面前經過時，\n\n\n\n  女人忽然側過頭，看向了周澤。\n\n\n\n  原本世界最美麗，\n\n\n\n  現在，\n\n\n\n  直接跳轉到另一種極端。\n\n\n\n  恐怖？\n\n\n\n  當然恐怖！\n\n\n\n  噁心？\n\n\n\n  當然噁心！ \n\n\n\n  但周澤，已經是一個死人了，人會被嚇死，但鬼呢？\n\n\n\n  女人看著周澤，\n\n\n\n  周澤也在看著女人，\n\n\n\n  二者目光短暫交匯，隨即，女人繼續往前走，身段搖曳，背影裊裊，旗袍的緊緻，將其秀美的身材勾勒得淋漓盡致。\n\n\n\n  「你們……要去哪裡？」\n\n\n\n  周澤下意識地跟著這一隊女人往前走，也就脫離了原本的隊伍。\n\n\n\n  而小徑上木訥行走的人，\n\n\n\n  卻沒有一個看向這裡，他們似乎不會思考，也沒有感知，而周澤，仿佛是其中的異類。\n\n\n\n  一行女人，步步生煙，一直在往前走，呢喃哼調，似淒似冰；\n\n\n\n  原本壓抑的環境，因為她們的出現，反而更讓人覺得蕭索。\n\n\n\n  周澤繼續往前走著，他跟著她們。\n\n\n\n  然後，周澤看見她們一個一個地走入了前面的水潭裡。\n\n\n\n  水潭不大，\n\n\n\n  宛如鏡面，\n\n\n\n  她們的進入，似乎打破了這種平靜，吹開了一層層漣漪。\n\n\n\n  最前面的幾個女人連頭都已經沒入了水面之中，後面的女人也在繼續跟著。\n\n\n\n  周澤走到了水潭邊，他沒有跟著一起下去，他只是站在邊上看著。 \n\n\n\n  這裡的一切，對於他來說都是一個絕對陌生的地方，任何人，一輩子，只有一次機會進來，而進來後，也就無法再出去了。\n\n\n\n  潭水中央，有東西浮出，\n\n\n\n  是一雙手，\n\n\n\n  甲紅手白，\n\n\n\n  纖細青蔥，\n\n\n\n  兩隻手翩翩起舞，如夢似幻，讓人的視線瞬間被其吸引，再也無法挪動開。\n\n\n\n  美，是吸引人的，而這種美，卻勾人心魄。\n\n\n\n  周澤的眼眸里，慢慢地顯露出迷醉之色，甚至連自己已經情不自禁地開始往前走都不知道。\n\n\n\n  先是腳面，\n\n\n\n  緊接著是膝蓋，\n\n\n\n  隨後腰部，\n\n\n\n  到最終，\n\n\n\n  水面沒入了脖子，\n\n\n\n  乃至於，整個人都進入了潭水之中。\n\n\n\n  潭水不冷，甚至很溫暖，水面清澈，能見度很高，當你進入這裡之後，你連窒息的痛苦感都沒有。\n\n\n\n  周澤看見了先前那一隊撐著紙傘的女人，她們在水面之下依舊裊娜動人，還在繼續地往前走著。\n\n\n\n  而距離自己最近的位置，\n\n\n\n  則有一位身穿著紅衣的女人，她站在水下，但雙手卻在水面之上起舞翩飛。 \n\n\n\n  周澤開始向這個紅色女人靠近，\n\n\n\n  不是因為美色，\n\n\n\n  也不是因為其他的虛妄影響，\n\n\n\n  而是因為，這個女人身上仿佛有著一種說不清道不明的魔力，讓你靠近，讓你貼近，讓你情不自禁。\n\n\n\n  終於，\n\n\n\n  周澤靠近了她，\n\n\n\n  而她的手，也慢慢地從水面上收了下來。\n\n\n\n  女人頭髮很長，也很茂密，在水波之中飛舞蕩漾，讓人看不清楚她的臉。\n\n\n\n  「終於…………又等到…………這樣子的人了…………」\n\n\n\n  女人聲音清脆，甜甜的，糯糯的，\n\n\n\n  迷人心酥。\n\n\n\n  女人美麗的雙手伸出來，搭在了周澤的肩膀上，這動作，很是親昵。\n\n\n\n  「你…………來陪我…………」\n\n\n\n  下一刻，\n\n\n\n  女人的頭髮開始飄散開，縷縷青絲開始吹拂在周澤的面龐；\n\n\n\n  美人拂面，這似乎是很有情調的一件事，但接下來，女人的頭髮卻化作了世間最為堅韌的鋼索，開始捆綁周澤的脖子。\n\n\n\n  「你來…………陪我…………」\n\n\n\n  頭髮披散，不再遮掩， \n\n\n\n  女人的面容終於顯露出來，\n\n\n\n  她沒有面容，\n\n\n\n  她的臉，是平的，沒有波瀾，也沒有褶皺，這是一場很平滑的臉，足以讓萬千少女去嫉妒和羨慕，\n\n\n\n  但她沒有鼻子，也沒有嘴巴，沒有眼睛，更沒有耳朵，\n\n\n\n  無面……女。\n\n\n\n  周澤感知到自己無法呼吸了，自己胸膛都快炸裂開來，同時，他的身體仿佛即將崩潰。\n\n\n\n  無面女的笑聲依舊清脆空靈，但在此時的周澤耳中，卻像是魔音貫耳。\n\n\n\n  周澤已經清醒過來，\n\n\n\n  他不知道在這個地方被以這種方式糾纏住到底意味著什麼，\n\n\n\n  但總之，\n\n\n\n  不會是好結局。\n\n\n\n  「你在這裡…………陪我…………！」\n\n\n\n  無面女繼續笑著，頭髮亂舞。\n\n\n\n  周澤下意識地伸出手，去抓住纏繞在自己脖頸位置的頭髮，他想要努力去將其掙脫。\n\n\n\n  無面女對他自不量力的表現感到很是有趣，\n\n\n\n  「你掙脫不了的，別掙扎了，能走到這裡來的，都有靈，有靈的人，我吞夠了，就有機會回去！\n\n\n\n  你註定， \n\n\n\n  將成為，\n\n\n\n  我的祭品！」\n\n\n\n  但就在話音剛落的瞬間，\n\n\n\n  無面女發出了一聲驚呼：「怎麼可能…………不可能…………」\n\n\n\n  周澤的十指指甲開始慢慢地變長，漆黑通透的顏色，在這個水潭之中，閃爍著屬於它的異樣光輝，這個指甲的顏色，和周澤死前救治的那位老者指甲顏色一模一樣。\n\n\n\n  「滋滋滋滋滋………………滋滋滋滋滋…………」\n\n\n\n  熱水下油鍋的聲音傳來，\n\n\n\n  無面女糾纏著周澤的頭髮在觸碰到周澤指甲時直接融化崩斷，而周澤的身形則開始慢慢地後退，開始脫離無面女的束縛。\n\n\n\n  「不可能……不可能……這不可能…………為什麼！為什麼你也能離開！\n\n\n\n  為什麼你也能離開我不能！\n\n\n\n  為什麼！\n\n\n\n  為什麼！\n\n\n\n  這不公平！\n\n\n\n  不公平！」\n\n\n\n  無面女用手去攔住周澤，\n\n\n\n  但當周澤用手去擺脫時，指甲一旦觸碰到無面的手，無面女原本完美無瑕的玉手當即被燙出一個洞。\n\n\n\n  「啊啊啊啊！！！」 \n\n\n\n  無面女發出了一聲慘叫，\n\n\n\n  身形開始後退，自此，也失去了對周澤的掌控。\n\n\n\n  周澤的身體開始上浮，\n\n\n\n  即將浮出水面。\n\n\n\n  「你跑不掉的……你會被……會被抓回來的！\n\n\n\n  這裡，\n\n\n\n  才是亡者的歸宿！\n\n\n\n  你們，你和他們，哪怕是走了，也終究會被抓回來！」\n\n\n\n  無面女在下方歇斯底里地吶喊咆哮著，\n\n\n\n  她嫉妒，\n\n\n\n  她羨慕，\n\n\n\n  她瘋狂！！！\n\n\n\n  而不斷上升中的周澤，\n\n\n\n  則慢慢地失去了自己的意識，\n\n\n\n  幽冥黃泉小路，\n\n\n\n  彼岸花的炫目，\n\n\n\n  無面女的咆哮，\n\n\n\n  旗袍女的婉約，\n\n\n\n  一切的一切，\n\n\n\n  似乎都正在漸漸離他遠去…………",

    "content": "On a midnight street,\n\nThe streetlights were yellow,\n\nAnd the people were panicked.\n\nThe weather was cold, and a wind blew, sharp as a knife.\n\nZhou Ze felt cold, too.\n\nHe didn’t know where this place was,\n\nBut he knew one thing,\n\nThis was… the mortal realm.\n\nHe was already dead, but he had returned.\n\nHe didn’t know what he should do,\n\nHe could only keep walking forward, numb and mechanical.\n\nRight now, he didn’t have the luxury of thinking about much else.\n\nLike the place he had just descended to.\n\nLike the old man he had treated before his car accident.\n\nLike the faceless woman in the red dress in the pool.\n\nLike… his own fingernails.\n\nHe had returned, which should have been a joyful thing, but even when people occasionally walked by, no matter how hard he tried to greet them, no one could see or hear him.\n\nHe had been pushed out by this world, cut off from it.\n\nSomeone who has never been in “solitary confinement” wouldn’t understand the pain of complete isolation. For Zhou Ze, the entire world was now his cage, a cage covered with a black cloth.\n\nNo one could see him,\n\nAnd no one could communicate with him.\n\nHe couldn’t pick up a single solid object.\n\nEven,\n\nThe wind could blow right through him with ease.\n\nHe was so weak.\n\nThe idiom “unable to withstand the wind” was no exaggeration when it came to him.\n\nAnd, what shocked and horrified Zhou Ze the most was,\n\nHe could see faint specks of light continuously scattering from his body.\n\nIn other words,\n\nHis body was slowly fading.\n\nPerhaps in another fifteen minutes, he would disappear completely, the last trivial trace of him erased.\n\nHe didn't know how any of this was happening, but he knew that his time was truly running out.\n\nAmong the Eight Immortals, Li Tieguai entered the body of a man who had starved to death as a soul, which is how he became the figure passed down in later generations.¹\n\nZhou Ze had also heard stories about ghosts “borrowing a corpse to return the soul.” He wanted to do that, too. He was cold and panicked; he needed a physical body to inhabit.\n\nHe didn't even care who the person was.\n\nPeople are always selfish at times like these, and Zhou Ze was no exception. Besides, he really couldn't take it anymore.\n\nBut whenever he tried to get close to someone, flames would appear on the person's head and shoulders, preventing him from getting near. He was even harmed by it, speeding up the rate of his “evaporation.”\n\nHe was a little tired, a little numb.\n\nHe was waiting for his end,\n\nWaiting for it all to be over.\n\nAs a man who had already died once, he could face death a second time with a bit more composure.\n\nBesides, in Zhou Ze's current state, the longer he lingered here, the longer he would have to endure this torment.\n\n“Creeeak…”\n\nAhead, there was a lit storefront. It looked like a bookstore, because he could see rows of shelves through the glass door.\n\nSomeone pushed the door open from inside and walked out. It was a man in a hoodie. The man wore a hat, obscuring his face. He glanced around for a moment, then left in a hurry.\n\nOf course, the man couldn't see Zhou Ze standing less than five meters away from him.\n\nInitially, Zhou Ze didn't think anything was amiss, but shortly after the man left, Zhou Ze suddenly sensed a warm presence from within the bookstore.\n\nYes,\n\nA warm presence.\n\nThis warmth baffled Zhou Ze, but right now he was like a man about to freeze to death who suddenly finds a box of matches. Even knowing the matches couldn't save his life, he would still strike one to feel a final warmth before he died.\n\nZhou Ze walked over. His body passed directly through the bookstore's glass door and continued inside, arriving behind the bookshelves.\n\nBehind the bookshelves,\n\nA person was lying there.\n\nIt was a handsome young man, probably only twenty-three or twenty-four years old. Because the air conditioning was on in the store, he wasn't wearing much—just a long-sleeved shirt and a thin jacket.\n\nHe was lying on the floor, but from him, Zhou Ze sensed a feeling of warmth, like a pauper who finds a bag of gold coins while walking down the road at night.\n\nThis attraction was impossible to refuse, and the current Zhou Ze was in no position to refuse it!\n\nZhou Ze walked over and squatted down in front of the young man.\n\nHe didn't know how to enter the other's body, but he understood how to touch the warmth he needed.\n\nHe stretched out a hand and placed it on the other's chest.\n\nZhou Ze saw his fingernails actually begin to slowly embed themselves into the other person's body.\n\nIt was a very strange sensation, different from the “breeze” that had passed through his body on the street. This was a melding, a fusion using his fingernails as the medium.\n\nSlowly, Zhou Ze's entire being began to enter the other's body. The two began to merge.\n\n………………\n\n“Xu Le! Wake up! Get up!”\n\nZhou Ze was woken by a series of shoves. No, to be precise, he was “startled” awake. He opened his eyes and found himself sitting behind the bookstore counter, his head having been resting on his arms.\n\n“Hey, wake up!”\n\nThe woman’s voice was sharp and high-pitched, carrying a bossy tone.\n\nLifting his head, Zhou Ze looked at the woman in front of him. No, to be precise, she was a girl, probably high school age. Though she was a big girl, she still had a touch of childishness.\n\n“Hey, Xu Le, what is your problem? You've gotten bold, haven't you? Trying to give my parents and my sister attitude, is that it? How dare you not come home all night!\n\n“Who gave you the nerve!”\n\nXu Le?\n\nWho’s that?\n\nZhou Ze spread his hands in confusion and saw that they were smooth. His own hands had calluses from long hours of practicing with surgical instruments, but these hands had none.\n\n“Hey, I'm talking to you!”\n\nThe girl slammed a hand on the counter, looking fierce.\n\nZhou Ze frowned slightly, stood up, and walked to the glass mirror by the shop door. He saw his reflection—a strange face. No, he’d seen this face before. It was the face he’d seen last night.\n\nThis body…\n\nIs mine now?\n\n“Hey, what’s your deal? My parents are both angry, you know. My mom’s at home throwing a fit. Let me tell you, the food you eat, the drinks you drink, the things you use, they're all from my family. What right do you, a live-in son-in-law, have to put on airs in my family’s house?²\n\n“Who are you trying to put on a show for!\n\n“If you dare to not come home again tonight, believe it or not, I'll come over here and slap you!”\n\nThe girl raised her hand as if to strike, but she suddenly noticed that the man in front of her—her “brother-in-law”—wasn't flinching or begging for mercy like usual. Instead, the look in his eyes made her feel a little scared.\n\nJust then, she glanced at the time and saw it was already seven-thirty.\n\n“Hmph, I'm going to school now. I'll deal with you tonight!”\n\nThe girl left in a huff.\n\nZhou Ze slowly sat back down in the chair behind the counter. There was an old laptop here, and a cell phone next to it.\n\nEven now, he still hadn't managed to adjust to this change in identity.\n\nHe was Zhou Ze, a famous young surgeon in Tongcheng. And he was an orphan.\n\nAnd now,\n\nHe had become this person.\n\nWhat did that girl just say?\n\nI'm… a live-in son-in-law?\n\nI have a wife?\n\nAnd a mother-in-law and father-in-law?\n\nAnd judging by the attitude and tone his little sister-in-law had just used with her “brother-in-law,” his status as a “live-in son-in-law” really lived up to the fine traditions of ancient times.\n\nA live-in son-in-law, colloquially known as a man who marries into his wife's family, was not only looked down upon by his wife's family but by all of society in ancient times. Their status was similar to that of criminals; during the Han and Tang dynasties, these men were often among those forced into military service on the frontiers.\n\nHe picked up the phone. It wasn't password-protected. He didn't know if that guy was lazy or just didn't dare to set one, but at least it allowed Zhou Ze to easily open his WeChat and QQ.\n\nThe QQ contact list was small, just a few junior high, high school, and university classmates. Then there was a family group with only one person in it, with the contact name “Wife.”\n\nHe opened his QQ chat history with her. Empty.\n\nFine.\n\nZhou Ze opened WeChat and, after a bit of searching, found the woman with the contact name “Wife.” Here there were replies. It was basically Xu Le asking things, like what's for dinner tonight, what preparations are needed, how much money is needed for restocking, how much the bookstore made recently, a whole pile of questions about how she was feeling.\n\nHer replies, however, were usually perfunctory and cold,\n\nConsisting of:\n\n“Oh.”\n\n“Mhm.”\n\n“Okay.”\n\nZhou Ze tossed the phone aside. This interpersonal relationship was a bit complicated. He suddenly looked down at his palm. His fingernails looked no different from a normal person's.\n\nBut in the events leading up to this—treating that old man before the car crash, escaping from the faceless woman, entering this guy's body—his fingernails had played an extremely crucial role.\n\nWith a thought,\n\nJust then,\n\nZhou Ze discovered his fingernails slowly beginning to lengthen, becoming pitch-black and translucent at the same time. There was even a faint black mist swirling around them.\n\n“Huu…”\n\nHe let out a long breath.\n\nHe closed his eyes.\n\nWhen he opened them again,\n\nHis fingernails were back to normal.\n\nFrom morning until noon, Zhou Ze sat there, trying to adapt to his new identity and soothe the discomfort the transition had brought. He didn't even eat lunch; he didn't know if he'd forgotten or if he just didn't feel hungry at all.\n\nThis was still Tongcheng. Zhou Ze's old home was in the Chongchuan District, and now he was in the Gangzha District, not far away.\n\nWhen afternoon arrived, Zhou Ze finally sighed and stood up silently. *Since I'm here, I might as well accept it.*\n\nHe began trying to tidy the bookshelves, at least to find something to do.\n\nWhat the old man who had strangled him before dying had said—“He's been discovered”—and what the faceless woman in hell had said—“You’ll be caught sooner or later”—instilled a sense of crisis in Zhou Ze.\n\nHis current state could be considered “eking out an existence.” To come back from the dead was a blessing from the heavens, so he cherished it. At least, until he fully understood the situation and had enough clues, he had to immerse himself in this identity. It was best not to cause any major abnormalities, not to attract the attention of those “people who want to catch him.”\n\nThe business at this store was truly awful. The decline of the traditional book market was nothing new, and this place wasn't on a prime street right outside a school.\n\nIt was questionable if that “Xu Le” could even break even by choosing to open a bookstore here.\n\nIt wasn't until three in the afternoon that the first customer of the day walked in.\n\nThe customer was browsing in the elementary school readers section, and lingered for a long time.\n\nZhou Ze waited a while before walking over and asking, “What kind of books are you looking for?”\n\nAlthough, Zhou Ze didn't know much about them either.\n\n“Just looking,” the customer replied.\n\n“Mm,” Zhou Ze said and paid him no more mind. He hadn't yet settled into the role of “bookstore owner.”\n\nBut just then,\n\nThe person suddenly walked up behind him and spoke in a low voice:\n\n“You really don't recognize me?”\n\n“What?” Zhou Ze asked.\n\n“Last night I hit you over the head with a baseball bat and robbed you.\n\nAnd I even made a point to check.\n\nYou were clearly no longer breathing then.”\n\n***\n\n¹ **Li Tieguai (Iron Crutch Li)** is one of the Eight Immortals in Chinese mythology.

    "content": "周澤愣了一下，所以說，昨晚自己之所以能拿「徐樂」這個人的身體去借屍還魂，還是因為他剛剛被殺了？\n\n\n\n  因為身子還熱乎著，所以自己才能進去？\n\n\n\n  這樣看來，自己，好像真的有些幸運了。\n\n\n\n  沒有反感，也沒有憤怒，更沒有可能被戳破身份的驚慌，周澤轉過身，看著自己身後的這位年紀和自己差不多的男子。\n\n\n\n  男子愣了一下，\n\n\n\n  他從周澤眼裡看見了不同尋常的東西，\n\n\n\n  是歡喜，\n\n\n\n  是慶幸，\n\n\n\n  甚至，\n\n\n\n  還有一點點的欣賞。\n\n\n\n  作為一個宿主，在昨晚那個情況下，周澤清楚自己面對的是何種艱難局面，如果這個傢伙沒恰巧在那個時候殺人，自己可能已經魂飛魄散了，根本見不到今天的太陽。\n\n\n\n  「抱歉，我昨晚昏過去，早上起來腦子很不舒服，像是喝醉了酒一樣，忘記了昨天的事情。」周澤隨意地解釋道。\n\n\n\n  他不認為對方會猜出來自己是鬼魂借屍還魂，除非對方腦子進水了。\n\n\n\n  「你不怪我？」對方指了指自己的鼻子，有些荒謬道，「哪怕我已經告訴你，昨天抽了你一記悶棍？」\n\n\n\n  「沒事兒，我倒是謝謝你，沒把我桌上的手機和電腦拿走。」 \n\n\n\n  「那個……是我忘了。」男子撓了撓頭，「你沒事就好，這是我昨天搶的你的錢。」\n\n\n\n  男子主動地從口袋裡拿出了三百塊，然後又掏了掏，又取出了八百塊。\n\n\n\n  「八百塊是你的醫藥費，三百是昨天搶的。」男子抿了抿嘴唇，「昨天上網賭錢把自己的工資都輸給狗莊了，路過你這書店時忽然想弄點錢花花，把你打倒之後我發現你沒鼻息了，還嚇得要死。\n\n\n\n  跑回家後一整晚沒睡著，就想著警察會不會忽然破門進來把我抓走，入室搶劫加殺人，就拿了三百塊，感覺自己真傻，真不值。」\n\n\n\n  男子伸手在周澤的肩膀上拍了拍，\n\n\n\n  「哥們兒，你沒死真好，真的，我從早上開始就在外頭轉悠了，我在等有人報警，等警察過來，結果我看見你居然還在書店裡。\n\n\n\n  你知道麼，那時候我都快跪在地上給你磕頭了，謝謝你，你命硬，沒死，不然我就完了，這裡這麼多攝像頭，要是你死了，我肯定跑不掉。」\n\n\n\n  周澤看著自己手中的一千一百塊，再看著眼前這位噙著眼淚對自己懺悔的「殺人兇手」，總覺得，這畫風很詭異。\n\n\n\n  老實說，「徐樂」是死了，因為他死了，自己才能鵲巢鳩占，而因為自己鵲巢鳩占了，眼前的這個傢伙就免去了殺人罪。\n\n\n\n  自己和眼前的這個傢伙，都獲利了，唯有那個徐樂，倒霉鬼一個。 \n\n\n\n  「行，沒事了，可能昨晚我只是岔氣了。」周澤將對方的手從自己肩膀上挪開，他以前是一名急診醫生，什麼樣的污穢沒見過？但他卻在那種極端環境下，養成了些許潔癖，事實上，大部分急診醫生都有輕重程度不一的潔癖。\n\n\n\n  正是因為見識過太多的骯髒污穢，所以才更懂得珍惜「乾淨」。\n\n\n\n  「你真的不怪我？」男子有些欣喜道。\n\n\n\n  「嗯，不怪你。」周澤點點頭，「你去好好上班過日子去吧，下次別犯錯了。」\n\n\n\n  「好，謝謝你，哥們兒，你是個實在人。」\n\n\n\n  男子重重地點點頭，離開了書店，去迎接他的「新生」去了。\n\n\n\n  而周澤則是拿起了手機，他想了想，覺得還是得報個警，不是以對方殺自己（徐樂）的事兒來報警，而是舉報對方涉嫌盜竊。\n\n\n\n  反正讓警察去查唄，如果對方真的有案底或者曾做過其他壞事兒被警方抓住了，也是他活該。\n\n\n\n  自己占據了人家的身體，總得替這個倒霉鬼做點什麼。\n\n\n\n  雖然，在對方良好認錯態度還給自己醫藥費的前提下，自己依舊實名舉報，確實挺缺德有點生兒子沒*****兒的意思。\n\n\n\n  只是，當周澤剛剛撥通了110，那邊接線台的聲音剛傳來時， \n\n\n\n  店門口，\n\n\n\n  那個傢伙忽然又去而復返。\n\n\n\n  「還有件事兒…………」對方剛走進來，就看見拿著手機的周澤，他愣了一下，直接伸手指著周澤，「你他娘的還是要報警對不對！」\n\n\n\n  周澤搖搖頭。\n\n\n\n  「把手機給我看一下，給我！」\n\n\n\n  周澤只能繼續搖頭。\n\n\n\n  「你說話不算數，王八蛋，老子弄死你！我看你這次死不死！」\n\n\n\n  男子瞬間進入了激動亢奮的狀態，他的精神應該有一點點的問題，可能是長期處於賭徒生活節奏和社會脫鉤的關係吧，他往往容易因為某件事的刺激而進入極端。\n\n\n\n  對方撲了過來，周澤放下手機，身體開始後退。\n\n\n\n  他前世是個醫生，不是拳手也沒練過功夫，這一世的身子也有些孱弱，論起面對面地打架，還真有些慌亂。\n\n\n\n  「砰！」\n\n\n\n  男子將周澤撞擊後壓在了牆壁上，同時他的雙手開始死死地掐住周澤的脖頸。\n\n\n\n  「我讓你報警，我讓你報警，我讓你說話不算話，好，我就讓你死，讓你真的死，這次我要掐死你後再給你放血，我看你還死不死！」\n\n\n\n  男子咬牙切齒地吼道。 \n\n\n\n  可憐的書店行情，下午時分，別提顧客了，甚至門口連行人都沒幾個。\n\n\n\n  脖子那邊幾乎麻木了，也已經無法呼吸了，周澤在盡力地去掙扎，在掙扎的過程中，周澤的雙手指甲忽然變黑變長拉起來。\n\n\n\n  緊接著，周澤雙手抱住了對方的後背。\n\n\n\n  「嘶………………」\n\n\n\n  男子忽然打了一個哆嗦，冒起了白眼，直接放開了周澤的脖子，整個人倒退了幾步後撞倒了幾個書架，而後轟然倒地。\n\n\n\n  周澤得以脫困，伸手揉了揉自己的脖子，他之前其實並沒有太驚慌，畢竟，自己的指甲可是連地獄裡的惡鬼都能傷到，對付一個普通人，應該問題不大吧？\n\n\n\n  但這個指甲具體是什麼緣由有什麼用處，周澤還沒完全清楚，只知道應該是自己車禍前救治的老者「傳染」給自己的，\n\n\n\n  還真是，\n\n\n\n  得了灰指甲，一個傳染倆。\n\n\n\n  走上前，蹲了下來，周澤伸手在男子臉上拍了拍，還好，沒死，還有氣，周澤搖搖頭，拿起手機，重新報警。\n\n\n\n  ………………\n\n\n\n  派出所做完了筆錄，警察同志讓周澤在小廳那邊等著，因為周澤舉報的事情有些邪性，說人家上門打算搶劫自己但結果被打暈的居然是「兇手」，而現在這位兇手還在醫院裡，得等他醒來才能做進一步地確定。 \n\n\n\n  不過，警察同志至少沒給周澤上手銬。\n\n\n\n  周澤旁邊蹲著一個中年男子，男子的左手被鎖在暖氣片上。\n\n\n\n  「兄弟，你牛叉啊，那貨是要搶你錢結果被你放倒了？」臉上有些邋遢的中年男子一邊說著一邊搓了搓自己滿是泥垢的長劉海，「真有我年輕時的那種范兒，對這種不開眼的毛賊，就得往死里揍！」\n\n\n\n  「喂，你給我老實點兒。」一名年輕的警察走過來呵斥道，「你這是入冬來第幾次偷電瓶車了？\n\n\n\n  我說啊，快過年了，你就不能安生點？或者找個工作正兒八經地賺點錢給家裡寄點？多大的人了都。」\n\n\n\n  「打工是不可能打工的，這輩子都不可能打工的，做生意又不會做，就是偷電瓶車電瓶才能維持的了生活這樣子，進看守所感覺就像回家一樣。\n\n\n\n  裡面個個都是人才，說話又好聽，我超喜歡裡面的！」\n\n\n\n  「哼。」年輕警察不想再搭理這貨了，直接轉身離開。\n\n\n\n  「兄弟，我剛那番感言咋樣？」油膩中年男對周澤拋了一個媚眼。\n\n\n\n  「挺有意思的。」周澤笑了笑。\n\n\n\n  「切格瓦拉是我的偶像，切格瓦拉，你知道是誰麼？」\n\n\n\n  周澤點點頭。\n\n\n\n  「我跟你說啊，這日子就得…………」油膩中年男愣了一下，目光看向了門口那邊，道：「額滴個龜龜，好漂亮啊，這是警察麼？」 \n\n\n\n  周澤側過頭看過去，在門口那邊有一個上身著藍色羽絨服下身穿長筒皮靴的女人和另外一名女警察一起向這邊走來。\n\n\n\n  「應該是警察吧。」周澤說道。\n\n\n\n  女人很漂亮，身材精緻，皮膚白皙，最重要的，還是她身上的那種氣質，最為加分。\n\n\n\n  「但沒穿警服啊。」油膩男子反駁道。\n\n\n\n  「可能是便衣吧。」周澤猜測道。\n\n\n\n  「你說得對，美女警花，嘖嘖，看來以後我還得多多進來了。」油膩中年男砸吧砸吧了嘴，意猶未盡的樣子，「要是能娶了她，折壽十年我都願意。」\n\n\n\n  周澤搖搖頭，壽元陽壽這種東西，他不敢再亂開玩笑了。\n\n\n\n  「你不同意？」油膩男見周澤搖頭，急道：「你這叫有眼無珠啊，這種女人，折壽十年換一個，絕對不虧的…………」\n\n\n\n  這時候，那名女警察和那位長靴女人一起走到了周澤面前。\n\n\n\n  「徐樂，你妻子來領你走了，那邊調查清楚了，你沒事了。」女警察指了指周澤說道。\n\n\n\n  「…………」周澤。\n\n\n\n  「…………」油膩中年男。",

    "content": "警察同志，請問一下，我老婆叫什麼名字來著？\n\n\n\n  這個念頭只是在心裡想了一下，周澤也沒蠢到這個地步，但他是真的不清楚自己這個「老婆」真名叫什麼，這個年代，也很少有人用自己的真名做QQ名和微信名。\n\n\n\n  倒是油膩男子一臉哀怨地瞥了周澤一眼：兄弟，你不厚道啊，說好做彼此折翼天使的呢？\n\n\n\n  周澤也有些無奈的回瞥了一眼：我也很意外啊。\n\n\n\n  油膩男子低下了頭，嘆了口氣，小聲地呢喃道：「我做的餃子很好吃。」\n\n\n\n  「走吧。」\n\n\n\n  「老婆」很清冷地說道，然後，自己直接轉身往外走去。\n\n\n\n  周澤只能跟著一起過去。\n\n\n\n  她開著一輛卡宴，直接上了車。\n\n\n\n  周澤打開車門，坐入了副駕駛位置。\n\n\n\n  老實說，\n\n\n\n  有些尷尬。\n\n\n\n  如果那位倒霉鬼徐樂，他的夫妻和家庭生活能正常一點，那麼自己還真不至於現在這麼尬著，面對嬌妻的關心自己還能找一些藉口去解釋解釋，比如頭暈了一些東西好像記不清了這類的；\n\n\n\n  但這位明顯帶著一種冰山女神的范兒，好像完全不愛搭理自己的樣子，就算是從派出所領自己出來也只是例行公事一般。 \n\n\n\n  我家狗走丟了，被保安撿到，\n\n\n\n  我去把它領回來。\n\n\n\n  就是這種感覺。\n\n\n\n  女人發動了車子，她其實挺年輕的，應該和自己（徐樂）差不多年紀，比原本的周澤要小個好幾歲。\n\n\n\n  當車子開上高架路時，女人終於開口打破了沉默：\n\n\n\n  「沒事吧？」\n\n\n\n  「哦，我沒事。」周澤回答道。\n\n\n\n  然後，\n\n\n\n  又是沉默。\n\n\n\n  女人覺得自己丈夫今天有些過於安靜了，但她沒那個意願去探究原因。\n\n\n\n  就在這時，女人的手機響了，她按了免提，車載音響里傳來了電話那頭的聲音：\n\n\n\n  「林醫生，青年中路那裡剛剛發生了一起校車碰撞事故，現在已經有傷者正在向我們醫院輸送，主任讓你趕緊回來。」\n\n\n\n  周澤微微一愣，\n\n\n\n  原來自己妻子也是一名醫生，\n\n\n\n  還有，\n\n\n\n  原來自己妻子姓「林」。\n\n\n\n  「我知道了，馬上回來。」女人掛斷了電話，直接在前面下了高架，然後在紅綠燈路口大轉彎，開向了醫院。\n\n\n\n  她沒問周澤是否要把你先送回家或者是讓周澤先下車自己打車回去，而是將車一路開進了崇川區人民醫院的停車場。 \n\n\n\n  老實說，周澤還真擔心她讓自己下車打車回家，想著到時候自己還得腆著臉問：\n\n\n\n  「老婆，咱家住哪兒來著，我忘了。」\n\n\n\n  就覺得很傻。\n\n\n\n  女人下了車，周澤也跟著一起下了車，女人進了醫院大樓上了電梯，周澤也跟著一起進了電梯，女人進了女更衣室，周澤……\n\n\n\n  周澤在過道邊長椅上坐了下來。\n\n\n\n  也就在這會兒，第一批車禍傷者被送來了，重傷一人，另外還有五個孩子傷勢也不輕。\n\n\n\n  看著自己的「老婆」換了白大褂就出來忙碌救治，\n\n\n\n  周澤只能坐在長椅上發著呆，\n\n\n\n  這感覺，有點像是媽媽上班把自己兒子帶著，媽媽在工作兒子就在旁邊看著，自己玩。\n\n\n\n  不過，\n\n\n\n  醫院特有的消毒水味道以及中央空調的悶熱感，還真是讓人懷念啊，熟悉的感覺。\n\n\n\n  前面就是急診室，重傷且生命垂危的似乎是一個女孩。\n\n\n\n  出事的是幼兒園校車，看著一個個小朋友在手術台上哭喊著疼痛，這畫面，確實挺讓人揪心的。\n\n\n\n  周澤抿了抿嘴唇，以往這個時候，自己肯定已經換好了衣服參與救治工作了，他是通城年輕一代最有名的外科醫生，而現在，自己只能當一個看客。 \n\n\n\n  這種感覺，很不舒服，但他只能忍著，而且這家人民醫院也算是通城明面上最好的醫院，醫生數量和質量也都毋庸置疑，他們應該能搞得定。\n\n\n\n  很快，下一批孩子也被送了過來，他們受的傷比較輕，只需要處理一下傷口或者進行簡單地包紮就可以了。\n\n\n\n  有交警專門守護在這層樓的入口處位置，一些收到通知的家長已經過來了，情緒很激動，但這個時候讓家長進來很可能會影響救治工作的展開，只能先把他們攔住。\n\n\n\n  周澤搖搖頭，站起身，走到樓道最里端窗台那邊，伸手把窗戶架高，然後從口袋裡摸出了煙，他是抽菸的，徐樂也是抽菸的，這時候倒也方便。\n\n\n\n  「叔叔，不能在醫院抽菸的哦。」\n\n\n\n  剛把菸頭咬在嘴裡，一道清脆的女童聲音就從周澤身後傳來。\n\n\n\n  周澤轉過身，看見一名身穿著百合裙子的小姑娘站在自己身後，嘴巴嘟起來，氣鼓鼓地看著自己。\n\n\n\n  咳咳，\n\n\n\n  有些尷尬啊。\n\n\n\n  周澤只能將煙收起來，不管怎麼樣，讓一個小姑娘教育自己要遵守公德心總是有些難為情的。\n\n\n\n  「小朋友，你穿這麼點不冷麼？」周澤彎下腰問道。\n\n\n\n  小姑娘皮膚很精緻，臉上點著點嬰兒肥，大眼睛，很可愛，像是一個放大版的芭比娃娃。 \n\n\n\n  「不冷呢。」小姑娘搖搖頭，「叔叔，以後不能再在醫院抽菸哦。」\n\n\n\n  「我知道了。」\n\n\n\n  周澤很認真地點頭。\n\n\n\n  「你沒事吧？」周澤又問道。\n\n\n\n  「我沒事，其他小朋友都受傷了，他們很疼呢。」\n\n\n\n  小姑娘側過身，看向自己身後那些正在被包紮傷口的小朋友，大部分都在哭，其實倒不是因為疼痛難忍，而是有一個人在哭其他人也就跟著一起哭起來。\n\n\n\n  護士們一邊做著傷口處理一邊還要哄孩子，\n\n\n\n  外面被交警暫時攔住的家長們在外面不停地吵鬧罵人，\n\n\n\n  總之，\n\n\n\n  這一層樓，給人一種亂糟糟的感覺。\n\n\n\n  「那你可真幸運。」周澤感嘆道。\n\n\n\n  小姑娘身上連一處疤痕都沒有。\n\n\n\n  「恩呢，我坐在最後一排，所以沒事。」小姑娘點點頭，然後主動跑去那邊安慰她的同學去了，這個看看，那邊瞅瞅，還鼓勵他們安撫他們。\n\n\n\n  挺懂事也挺堅強的一個孩子。\n\n\n\n  周澤轉過身，下意識間又將煙取了出來，想想還是又放了回去。\n\n\n\n  重新走回長椅那邊坐下來時，前面的急救室里，走出來三名護士還有兩名醫生。 \n\n\n\n  一位男醫生一位女醫生，女醫生也就是自己的老婆。\n\n\n\n  「沒事的，我們盡力了。」男醫生說著伸手想要搭住周澤老婆的肩膀去安慰。\n\n\n\n  作為丈夫，\n\n\n\n  周澤就坐在這裡，\n\n\n\n  但他對這一幕並不反感……\n\n\n\n  坑爹的徐樂給自己留下這麼複雜的一個坑，又是上門女婿，又是脾氣極大的小姨子和脾氣明顯不好的丈母娘丈人。\n\n\n\n  周澤巴不得自己這個老婆趕緊紅杏出牆踹了自己和自己離婚然後自己一個人去靜靜。\n\n\n\n  換誰剛死而復生進入一具新的身體裡，都懶得去折騰什麼現代都市的贅婿生活百味吧？\n\n\n\n  不過，讓周澤有些意外的是，自己老婆竟然直接伸手擋開了那位醫生的鹹魚手，直接指著他道：\n\n\n\n  「這是我丈夫。」\n\n\n\n  話語裡沒有絲毫柔情蜜意，簡單，生硬，像是在說：這是我家養的哈士奇。\n\n\n\n  「哦，你好，先生。」那位男醫生臉色有些尷尬，不管怎麼樣，當著人家的面撩人家老婆總是那麼一點點沒底氣。\n\n\n\n  周澤笑了笑，算是打了招呼。看來，自家媳婦兒很守婦道……但他怎麼都高興不起來，倒不是什麼綠帽情節作祟，\n\n\n\n  只是單純的，生活簡單點多好。 \n\n\n\n  「我去那邊再看看，其他孩子都處理好了，應該沒什麼事了，你早點和你先生回去休息。」這位男醫生說完後就走開了。\n\n\n\n  林醫生則是在周澤旁的長椅上坐了下來，她摘下了口罩，脫去了手套，丟在了地上。\n\n\n\n  周澤看見她的眼圈有些泛紅，貝齒輕咬著嘴唇，顯然，她的心情很不好，這意味著那位重傷的小朋友，沒能救回來。\n\n\n\n  這一副樣子，很『我見猶憐』。\n\n\n\n  周澤在心裡有些理解徐樂了，這個上門女婿至少比其他同行要賺不少，老丈人家條件比自己好這是前提，之後這位林醫生，真的確實是好看。\n\n\n\n  「別往心裡去，以後要經歷得多呢，求一個心安就好。」\n\n\n\n  周澤作為過來人在旁邊安慰道，他的經驗比自己這位「老婆」豐富很多，心理承受能力自然也強大很多。\n\n\n\n  「閉嘴。」\n\n\n\n  女人回了這兩個字，如果是以周澤原本作為前輩的身份來說這種話，確實是勸導；\n\n\n\n  但周澤現在是徐樂，以他的形象來對林醫生說這種話，就是純粹站著說話不腰疼了。\n\n\n\n  「…………」周澤聳聳肩膀，再度在心裡鄙視了一把那位徐樂，看你慫的，你老婆敢在外面直接叫你閉嘴。\n\n\n\n  林醫生紅著眼，慢慢地站起來：「我去換衣服，回家。」 \n\n\n\n  「好。」周澤點點頭。\n\n\n\n  這時候，有兩名護士將急救室的帘子拉開，露出了裡面的病床，床上躺著一個小身體，蓋著白布。\n\n\n\n  周澤目光掃了一眼，死者他見得多了，自己從醫這些年來，救活的人很多，但就在自己面前無能為力只能死去的病人也不少。\n\n\n\n  「林醫生，這是你丈夫吧？」一名小護士以調侃的意味問道，她們是知道林醫生已經結婚了的，但林醫生的丈夫和其他女醫生女護士的男友不同，從沒來醫院露過面。\n\n\n\n  你不能指責她們在面對死亡時還能開個玩笑，這就像是你讓那些去一次西藏就發朋友圈說自己心靈被淨化好感動好虔誠的小清新長年累月在那裡待十年他們也受不了一樣，不現實。\n\n\n\n  「是。」林醫生點頭應道，這時候，她的情緒也平復了一些。\n\n\n\n  「那你們趕緊回去吧，說不定回去要有什麼活動呢，您說是吧？\n\n\n\n  我跟你說，咱林醫生可喜歡小孩子啦，你們抓緊回家去…………」\n\n\n\n  「艹！」\n\n\n\n  「…………」小護士。\n\n\n\n  周澤看見了白布外面露出了百合裙裙邊，腦子「轟」的一聲，猛然意識到自己剛剛見到的那位毫髮無傷的小女孩，\n\n\n\n  她不是人！",

    "content": "That one word, \"Fuck,\"\n\n...after he said it,\n\n...the two young nurses were at a loss, and Dr. Lin was also stunned for a moment.\n\nIt was just too simple and crude an answer.\n\nZhou Ze, however, offered no explanation. He reached out and directly lifted the white cloth covering the girl's head.\n\nIt was her. It really was her!\n\nNo wonder she didn't have a single injury just now.\n\nNot even a scratch on her body.\n\nThis wasn't because she was lucky enough to be sitting in the back row.\n\nIn fact,\n\nshe was the most severely injured of all the children; she was the one the doctors had been trying their best to save.\n\nHer soul had already drifted out, but she was still unaware of it. She was still reminding him not to smoke in a public place, and she had even gone to comfort her classmates who had suffered minor injuries.\n\nActually,\n\nthose children couldn't see her at all.\n\nIn the entire hospital,\n\nthe only person who could see her,\n\nwas Zhou Ze!\n\n\"She's dead?\" Zhou Ze asked as his eyes scanned the surroundings.\n\n\"Xu Le?\" Dr. Lin looked at her husband. She didn't want to deal with his cursing right now, because she realized her husband was acting abnormally.\n\n\"She's not dead yet. You keep trying to save her, keep resuscitating her!\"\n\nZhou Ze suddenly grabbed Dr. Lin's arm, pulled her over, and roared,\n\n\"The time limit for resuscitation isn't up yet! She can still wake up! Keep resuscitating her!\"\n\n\"Sir, sir!\"\n\nSeeing Zhou Ze grabbing Dr. Lin so roughly, the two nurses immediately came forward to pull him away. In their eyes, Dr. Lin's husband was being bizarre, and he even showed tendencies of domestic abuse.\n\nZhou Ze pushed the two nurses beside him away, and also let go of his wife, whispering under his breath,\n\n\"Where are you? Where are you? Where the hell are you!\"\n\nZhou Ze rushed out. He was running, searching.\n\nJust a moment ago, the girl's soul had been wandering among the children, comforting them. Now, she was nowhere to be found.\n\nHad she already gone to hell?\n\nShe was already dead.\n\nWas it too late?\n\nZhou Ze was a bit dazed. He didn't know why he was so agitated, nor why he was so anxious.\n\nPerhaps it was because of his profession; it was his duty to treat any patient who had a chance of survival. And besides, he had just had an encounter with that kind and strong little girl.\n\n\"Mister, are you looking for me?\"\n\nA familiar child's voice sounded from behind Zhou Ze. He immediately turned around and saw the little girl again.\n\nOnly now, the little girl's body wasn't as solid as before. She had become semi-transparent.\n\n\"Mister, I'm a little cold.\" The little girl hugged her arms and squatted down. \"I went to find the nurses to ask if I could borrow a piece of clothing, but they ignored me. Do they hate me? Am I very annoying?\"\n\nSpecks of light were constantly dissipating from the little girl's body. Zhou Ze had seen this image before; it had once happened to him.\n\n\"Xu Le, come back with me!\"\n\nDr. Lin walked over at that moment.\n\nThe little girl turned her head to look behind her.\n\n\"Don't look!\"\n\nZhou Ze took a step forward, reaching out to cover the little girl's eyes. No one knew what would happen if she saw her own body lying on the hospital bed.\n\nWould she break down?\n\nWould she realize she was dead and then dissipate completely?\n\nWhen Zhou Ze's hand touched the little girl's body, his fingernails grew slightly warm. They didn't grow longer, nor did they turn black, but Zhou Ze felt a searing heat. At the same time, the little girl's body began to distort, transforming into a ring of light that wrapped around Zhou Ze's fingertips. And this light was clearly invisible to everyone else around them.\n\n\"Get out of the way! She can still be saved!\" Zhou Ze charged toward the hospital bed again.\n\n\"Xu Le!\" Dr. Lin's chest heaved. The dead was dead. She didn't know what nonsense her husband was still babbling on about. Besides, her husband had studied civil engineering and had absolutely no connection to medicine.\n\nThis time, when Zhou Ze rushed over, the two young nurses didn't dare to stop him. Zhou Ze ripped off the white cloth and placed his hands on the girl's chest.\n\nYes, this was how he had come back to life.\n\n*Your soul came out,*\n\n*but it can go back in.*\n\n*You can live!*\n\nAfter seeing the light from his fingertips completely enter the girl's body, Zhou Ze began CPR, pressing on the girl's chest with his hands clasped together.\n\n\"Wake up!\"\n\n\"Wake up!\"\n\nThe two nurses didn't dare to get close and looked toward Dr. Lin.\n\n\"She's dead.\"\n\nDr. Lin walked to Zhou Ze's side and said.\n\n\"We're still within the golden hour for resuscitation! I've been keeping track of the time,\" Zhou Ze roared as he continued the compressions. \"She can live! She can live!\"\n\nDr. Lin pursed her lips, then pushed Zhou Ze aside and began performing compressions on the girl's chest herself.\n\n\"Your compressions are too forceful. She has injuries. A Chun, reconnect the monitor. Continue resuscitation.\"\n\nZhou Ze was pushed away but didn't get angry. He just continued to stare at the little girl on the bed.\n\nThe only saving grace was probably that the parents were being held back by the traffic police, and with so many children making noise outside, no one noticed what was happening here.\n\nDr. Lin continued the compressions, beads of sweat already forming on her forehead. She didn't know why she was joining this man in his madness, but for some reason, she had just seen something unusual in his eyes.\n\nAnd this man was her husband. Today, she felt she couldn't see through him at all.\n\nThe monitor was reconnected, but the screen still showed a flat line.\n\nThe two young nurses stood by, at a loss.\n\n*She can't be saved?*\n\n*Even after I put her soul back in,*\n\n*she still can't be saved?*\n\nA sense of loss and disappointment began to spread through Zhou Ze's heart.\n\n\"Beep... Beep... Beep...\"\n\nJust then,\n\nthe flat line suddenly showed a wave.\n\nDr. Lin stared at the monitor in utter shock.\n\nWas this...\n\na medical miracle?\n\n***\n\nIt was already night when they drove home from the hospital. Zhou Ze sat in the passenger seat while Dr. Lin drove. The two were still not speaking.\n\nSilence, it seemed, was the standard for the couple's relationship. However, in the past, it was always Xu Le who tried to break the silence. Today, it was Dr. Lin.\n\n\"Have you studied medicine?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Your technique just now was very professional,\" Dr. Lin could tell.\n\n\"They trained us when I was getting my driver's license,\" Zhou Ze casually made up an excuse.\n\n\"But you don't have a driver's license.\" Dr. Lin frowned slightly.\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze.\n\n*Mm,* Zhou Ze silently despised Xu Le once again.\n\nDr. Lin didn't plan to press the issue further, simply saying, \"Today, thank you for your persistence.\"\n\n\"You're welcome.\" Zhou Ze waved his hand. As... at least in his heart he still considered himself a doctor, saving a patient truly required no thanks.\n\nThe girl hadn't woken up yet and was still in a coma, but at least there was hope now.\n\n\"I thank you on that girl's behalf.\" Dr. Lin picked up her phone to check the time. \"It's almost eight. My parents are still waiting for us to come home for dinner.\"\n\n*Parents?*\n\nA headache suddenly came over Zhou Ze.\n\nWas he about to meet his mother-in-law and father-in-law?\n\nThe car entered a high-end residential complex. Tongcheng was near Shanghai, geographically situated on opposite ends of the Yangtze River estuary. Although it wasn't as extreme as Shanghai where every inch of land was gold, real estate wasn't exactly cheap here either.\n\nDr. Lin parked the car and walked inside. Zhou Ze followed behind her. They entered the elevator, got out together, and Dr. Lin used a key to open a door.\n\nThe apartment was well-decorated with a duplex layout. In fact, one could tell from the car Dr. Lin drove that her family's financial situation was likely very good.\n\nOf course, his current status as a \"live-in son-in-law\"¹ was also proof. After all, a family without some money and confidence couldn't afford to take in a son-in-law.\n\nOn the living room sofa, an elderly man with half-gray hair, wearing a sweater, was watching TV. It was a rerun of *Xinwen Lianbo*,² and he was watching with great interest.\n\nEven when his daughter and son-in-law returned, he merely glanced over without saying anything.\n\n\"Wanqiu, you're back.\"\n\nThe kitchen door was pushed open, and the mother-in-law poked her head out. Perhaps Dr. Lin and her younger sister got their height from their mother; the mother-in-law was very tall. She was a bit plump now, but she was still the type who could reign supreme at the \"Sunset Glow\" plaza dances, making countless old men and grandpas vie for her attention.\n\nTime to tap the blackboard, take notes, and highlight the key point:\n\nZhou Ze finally knew his wife's full name—Lin Wanqiu.\n\nThe mother-in-law's gaze swept over Zhou Ze, her expression clearly sinking.\n\n\"Old man, time to eat. Wanqiu is back.\"\n\n\"Finally, we can eat,\" the younger sister-in-law said as she walked out of the study. She waved a fist at Zhou Ze, then jutted her chin, signaling for him to be mindful of her parents.\n\nThis small gesture was actually quite nice. Although the girl was a bit bossy, she wasn't too over the top.\n\nZhou Ze went to the restroom to wash his hands. As he was washing, Lin Wanqiu came in too. The two of them used hand soap to scrub their hands, both very meticulously.\n\nLin Wanqiu glanced at Zhou Ze a couple more times, then rinsed her hands and walked into the living room.\n\nZhou Ze also rinsed his hands, dried them with a paper towel, and walked out of the restroom.\n\nEveryone was seated. Zhou Ze sat down in the chair next to Lin Wanqiu.\n\nThe mother-in-law, with a sullen face, served the bowls of rice one by one. When she placed the bowl in front of Zhou Ze, she clearly used a bit more force.\n\n*Well, at least,*\n\n*she didn't deliberately refuse to give me rice,*\n\nZhou Ze thought to himself.\n\n\"Xu Le, do you think we treat you poorly?\" the mother-in-law asked before even starting to eat.\n\n\"You treat me very well,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\n\"Then you didn't come home last night. Who were you giving the silent treatment to...\"\n\n\"Mom, let's eat. He had something to deal with at his shop. He told me,\" Lin Wanqiu cut in.\n\nThe mother-in-law and father-in-law exchanged a glance, surprised that their elder daughter was actually speaking up for this son-in-law. It was so out of character that they momentarily forgot to continue their attack.\n\nThe younger sister-in-law, watching from the side, was also a bit surprised. Her sister had never cared much about this so-called brother-in-law. Had the sun risen from the west today?\n\n\"Let's eat.\" The father-in-law picked up his chopsticks to signal the start of the meal. \"You eat too.\" The father-in-law specifically pointed at Zhou Ze with his chopsticks.\n\n*Hmm, that's a bit rude,* but at least it signaled that the matter from last night was over.\n\n\"Wanqiu, have a piece of braised pork. Mom stewed it for a long time.\"\n\nThe mother-in-law placed a piece of meat in both her elder and younger daughters' bowls. Then, after a moment's hesitation, she also placed a piece in her son-in-law's bowl.\n\nOnly then did Zhou Ze realize he hadn't eaten anything all day. From the moment he'd possessed this body last night, through the morning and noon, he hadn't eaten.\n\nHe didn't stand on ceremony.\n\nHe picked up the meat and put it in his mouth.\n\nIn the next instant,\n\nZhou Ze's expression froze.\n\nAn unexpected wave of nausea rose up from within him, causing his stomach to spasm violently.\n\n\"Bleh...\" Zhou Ze retched instantly, as if what he was eating was poison.\n\n\"...\" The mother-in-law.\n\n\"...\" The father-in-law.\n\nThe atmosphere at the dinner table,\n\ninstantly plunged to freezing point.\n\n---\n**Footnotes:**\n\n1.  **Live-in son-in-law (上門女婿, shàngmén nǚxù):** A traditional arrangement where the husband moves into his wife's family home, often when the wife's family has no male heirs.

    "content": "\"My apologies.\"\n\nZhou Ze raised a hand, signaling that it wasn't intentional, because this was a huge slap in the face—especially given the unknown reason why \"Xu Le,\" this live-in son-in-law, was so disliked by his in-laws.\n\n\"Not feeling well?\" Dr. Lin asked, putting down her chopsticks.\n\n\"I'm fine, I'm fine.\"\n\nZhou Ze picked up his chopsticks again and shoveled rice into his mouth.\n\nBut just as the food entered his mouth, before he could swallow,\n\nHis stomach spasmed again, and a wave of intense nausea rose from deep within him, as if what he was about to swallow wasn't cooked rice, but a pile of shit.¹\n\n\"Pfft—\"\n\nThis time,\n\nZhou Ze sprayed all the rice in his mouth out,\n\nsplattering it onto the faces of his father- and mother-in-law sitting opposite him.\n\nRice grains clung to his father-in-law's glasses and hair.\n\nHis mother-in-law's coiled hair was also speckled with glistening white.\n\nWith a clatter,\n\nthe chopsticks in his father-in-law's hand fell. His face twitched a few times, as if he hadn't yet processed what emotion he should use to face the current situation.\n\nHis mother-in-law, however, took a deep breath, the flames of fury already blazing in her eyes!\n\nThis was...\n\nThis was throwing kindness back in their faces!\n\n\"Smack!\"\n\nThe mother-in-law pushed her chair back and stood up.\n\n\"Xu Le!\"\n\nHis mother-in-law was a retired head nurse, so she knew that even if a person was sick, they couldn't possibly spray rice so dramatically. Besides, looking at Xu Le, he didn't seem to be on death's door.\n\nHe was doing this on purpose.\n\nHe must be doing this on purpose!\n\nHe was rebelling!\n\nRebelling!\n\nClutching his chest, Zhou Ze left the dining table and rushed into the bathroom. He lifted the toilet lid and began to dry heave violently.\n\nThis time, he even threw up bile, a bitter taste flooding his mouth.\n\nThis meal was a lost cause.\n\nDr. Lin glanced toward the bathroom where Xu Le was still vomiting nonstop, then said directly to her younger sister:\n\n\"Xiao Yi, go cook some noodles.\"\n\n\"Oh, okay.\"\n\nThe sister-in-law stuck out her tongue. She also felt that her brother-in-law was playing with fire today. She immediately left the table and went to the kitchen to prepare some dried noodles.\n\n\"How outrageous, that bastard!\"\n\nHis father-in-law slammed a hand on the table and took off his glasses to shake them clean. Xu Le's father-in-law was a retired vice-president of the hospital who placed the utmost importance on a refined appearance. Today, his bottom line had been thoroughly crossed.\n\n\"I'm going to ask that guy just how our family has wronged him! We didn't ask for a single cent of bride price for the wedding, and we even paid to open that money-losing bookstore for him. How have we wronged him!\"\n\nThe mother-in-law prepared to march to the bathroom.\n\n\"Mom, just clean up here. He's not feeling well.\"\n\nDr. Lin began to clear the barely touched plates on the table.\n\n\"You're still protecting him after all this?\" The mother-in-law's anger flared, and she pointed at her daughter, scolding her.\n\n\"What else should I do? Who was it that forced me to get married by threatening to hang themselves?\" Dr. Lin looked directly at her mother, her beautiful face looking exceptionally resolute at that moment.\n\nThe mother-in-law was speechless for a moment. Indeed, they were the ones who had forced their daughter to marry. They were desperate for a grandchild, so they went to great lengths to recruit Xu Le as a live-in son-in-law. The thinking at the time was simple: she and her husband only had two daughters, so they had no choice but to recruit a son-in-law so the grandchild would carry their family name. Xu Le's parents were deceased, and he was a college graduate, so he fit the criteria.\n\n\"I'm not eating.\"\n\nThe father-in-law didn't dare to meet his daughter's gaze. He was the one who had made the final decision back then. Thinking about it now, he really had wronged his daughter. He stood up and went back to his study.\n\n\"Hey, old man, you have stomach problems,\" his wife called out anxiously.\n\n\"Mom, bring a bowl of noodles to Dad later.\"\n\nDr. Lin finished clearing the table and then walked toward the bathroom.\n\nThe mother-in-law watched her daughter's back and finally said no more.\n\nPushing open the glass door to the bathroom, Dr. Lin saw Zhou Ze kneeling by the toilet, one hand gripping the edge of the bowl, the other clutching his chest.\n\n\"Are you feeling unwell?\"\n\n\"I'm alright,\" Zhou Ze replied. He had been perfectly fine before dinner; who knew he would end up like this the moment he tried to eat.\n\n\"I asked Xiao Yi to make some noodles. You can eat later...\"\n\n\"Ugh...\"\n\nAt the mere thought of noodles, Zhou Ze felt an intense wave of nausea rise from deep within him again, and he started to dry heave once more.\n\nLin Wanqiu frowned slightly.\n\n\"Do you want to go to the hospital?\"\n\n\"No need, it's nothing. I'm not eating.\"\n\nZhou Ze waved his hand dismissively, managed to stand up with great effort, and went to the sink to rinse his mouth and wash his face.\n\nTonight's dinner was destined to end on a sour note.\n\nThe father-in-law, mother-in-law, and sister-in-law lived on the first floor, while Zhou Ze and Lin Wanqiu's bedroom was on the second floor.\n\nAfter cleaning up, Zhou Ze also took a shower. Not knowing where his change of clothes was, he didn't bother changing and went upstairs in his old clothes, his hair still wet. As soon as he reached the top of the stairs, he noticed Lin Wanqiu showering in the second-floor bathroom.\n\nZhou Ze stood at the bathroom door for a moment, watching the graceful silhouette reflected inside, and lightly licked his lips.\n\nA man is always most impulsive at times like this. Of course, at times like this, he also best understands gratitude.\n\n\"Thank you,\"\n\nZhou Ze said silently in his heart.\n\nThis was the first time in the two days since he had reincarnated in a borrowed body that Zhou Ze had given a thumbs-up to that unlucky bastard Xu Le.\n\n*Although you left behind an incredibly shitty web of relationships, your wife is truly beautiful.*\n\nWith a hint of fantasy, a bit of excitement, a touch of impatience, and a sliver of hope,\n\nZhou Ze pushed open the bedroom door.\n\nAnd then,\n\nZhou Ze's expression changed. He bit his lip,\n\nand in his heart, he dragged out the same Xu Le he had just praised and viciously flogged his corpse ten thousand times over.\n\nThe bedroom was large.\n\nThere was a large bed.\n\nAnd next to the large bed,\n\nwas a mattress on the floor!\n\nEven an idiot would know what this meant!\n\nWas that guy sick in the head?\n\nWas he a fucking idiot?\n\nWhat was the point of being a live-in son-in-law like this?\n\nZhou Ze took three deep breaths in a row, then silently lay down on the floor mattress.\n\n*Just sleep.*\n\n*No more drama.*\n\n*Don't think about it.*\n\nHe needed to see if he could get some money, become independent, and then whether it was divorce or something else, just resolve this complicated relationship. Having been reincarnated in a borrowed body, there were still many problems he had to face.\n\nLin Wanqiu came out after finishing her shower. She wore a pair of blue pajamas. They were a bit loose, looking somewhat oversized on her.\n\nLying on the floor mattress, Zhou Ze subconsciously swallowed.\n\n\"Get up,\" Lin Wanqiu said.\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\n\"You've always slept on the bed, and I've slept on the floor mattress,\" Lin Wanqiu said.\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze silently got up and climbed into the bed.\n\nLin Wanqiu turned off the light and lay down on the floor mattress.\n\nPerhaps this was her compensation for being unwilling to share a bed with Xu Le. She would sleep on the floor.\n\nZhou Ze sighed.\n\nHe prepared to sleep.\n\nHalf an hour later, still awake. He turned over.\n\nAn hour later, still awake. He turned over again.\n\nEven after three hours, when it was already past midnight, he still couldn't fall asleep.\n\nHis eyelids were fighting to stay open, but sleep just wouldn't come.\n\nMeanwhile, Lin Wanqiu on the floor mattress was breathing steadily. She must have been asleep.\n\nZhou Ze swore it absolutely wasn't because there was a beautiful woman sleeping nearby that his blood was rushing and keeping him awake.\n\nHe was exhausted and tired; after all, so much had happened today.\n\nBut he just couldn't fucking fall asleep.\n\nLying in bed, Zhou Ze gave up and opened his eyes, looking at his own hands.\n\nToday, he had used these hands to save that little girl's life. Although the girl hadn't woken up yet, her vitals had returned. There was still hope.\n\nWas this a special ability he had gained after his trip through hell?\n\nOr,\n\nwas it something that old man left behind when he grabbed his wrist before he died?\n\nBut,\n\nit felt pretty good.\n\nAs a doctor, with a pair of hands like this, how many lives could he save?\n\nThis was an ability that transcended medical technology and understanding, something that could even allow him to reach a level beyond Hua Tuo and Bian Que.² Practitioners in every field hope to one day surpass their founding masters. Perhaps it wasn't for money, nor for fame, but for a kind of... sentiment.\n\nBut just at this moment,\n\nZhou Ze suddenly felt a spasm in his arms, and a sharp pain shot through them.\n\n\"Hiss...\"\n\nZhou Ze sucked in a breath of cold air, his whole body curling up on the bed.\n\nBut the pain continued, and it was intensifying!\n\nCold sweat beaded on Zhou Ze's forehead from the pain. Unable to bear it any longer, he got out of bed and left the bedroom.\n\nHe went into the bathroom. Without turning on the light, he sat on the toilet. In the dimness, Zhou Ze could see bulging blue veins running down his arms all the way to his fingernails, looking as if they were about to split open.\n\nThe pain originated from them, as if something was hammering at his very bone marrow.\n\nDamn it,\n\nwhat the hell was happening!\n\nZhou Ze's face began to twist in agony.\n\nThis feeling was so excruciating it made him want to grab a kitchen knife and chop off his own arms.\n\nIn a daze, he seemed to recall the image of himself lying in an ice-cold casket, about to be pushed into the incinerator.\n\nHe also seemed to recall fragments of his time in hell, trudging numbly towards his end.\n\nIs this a curse?\n\nIs this a punishment?\n\nWhat am I being punished for?\n\nWhat did I do wrong?\n\nBecause I smuggled myself back?\n\nBecause I'm not a living person, so heaven is punishing me?\n\nOr... is it because I used them to save someone today?\n\n*That's it. That must be the reason.*\n\nZhou Ze took a deep breath. Because he had used that ability to save someone, he had broken some rule and was now suffering a backlash?\n\nThen,\n\nif he went and killed that girl right now, would the pain stop?\n\nA wisp of black mist began to coalesce in Zhou Ze's eyes, though he was completely unaware of it.\n\n\"Uncle, you're not supposed to smoke in the hospital.\"\n\nThe little girl's voice suddenly surfaced in Zhou Ze's mind.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head violently.\n\n*No.*\n\n*I saved her, and that's that!*\n\n*I don't regret it.*\n\n*I don't regret it!*\n\n...\n\n\"Mom, are you still not done?\"\n\n\"I just got in. Go use the bathroom on the second floor.\"\n\n\"Fine.\"\n\nThe sister-in-law went upstairs. She really couldn't hold it anymore. The second-floor bathroom light was off. She pushed the door open and walked right in.\n\nAnd then,\n\nat that very moment,\n\nZhou Ze looked up at her.\n\nAnd she looked at Zhou Ze.\n\nWithin Zhou Ze's eyes, black mist swirled, carrying an overwhelming, terrifying power. It was the gaze of a malevolent spirit that had clawed its way out of hell, cursed and crazed.\n\n\"AHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!\"\n\nThe sister-in-law screamed in terror.\n\nThen she fell to the ground.\n\nShe looked at Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze was also looking at her.\n\nThen, Zhou Ze saw that under his sister-in-law's pajamas—it was wet. A discordant puddle of liquid had appeared on the tile floor...\n\nHe had...\n\nscared her so badly she'd peed?\n\n***\n**Footnotes:**\n¹ In the original Chinese, this is a pun.

    "content": "A scream woke the whole family.\n\nAnd no wonder.\n\nIn the middle of the night, in a bathroom with the lights off, bursting for the toilet, you open the door and suddenly see someone inside—that alone is enough to scare the daylights out of you. Most people have probably had a similar experience.\n\nWhat's more, what the sister-in-law had run into was a ghost.\n\nLin Wanqiu came out of the bedroom and reached down to pull her younger sister up.\n\n\"What's wrong? What's wrong!\"\n\nHis father-in-law and mother-in-law also came up from the first floor. They saw their younger daughter crying in her older sister's arms, and then glanced at Zhou Ze, who was still sitting on the toilet.\n\n\"So it's you, Xu Le! You bastard, your mind must be clouded with filth to be getting ideas about my younger daughter!\"\n\nThe mother-in-law grabbed the broom by the bathroom door, ready to hit Xu Le.\n\nThe father-in-law was the same, fuming as he prepared to come in and teach his bastard son-in-law a lesson.\n\nIt was no wonder.\n\nSeeing a scene like this, anyone would naturally jump to that conclusion.\n\nA crazed brother-in-law making a move on his sister-in-law.\n\nAfter all, as the saying goes, half of a sister-in-law's you-know-what belongs to her brother-in-law.¹\n\n\"Mom, Dad, Xiao Yi just got scared when she came into the bathroom,\" Dr. Lin said.\n\nThe mother-in-law froze, the broom still raised, unsure where to aim it now.\n\nThe father-in-law also faltered, then retreated a few steps, looking sheepish.\n\nThis interruption made Zhou Ze realize that at some point the bulging veins in his arms had subsided, and the excruciating pain was gone too.\n\nHe suddenly felt exhausted, so sleepy, and just wanted to sleep.\n\nHe stood up, ready to leave the bathroom. As for his father- and mother-in-law, Zhou Ze couldn't be bothered to argue with them. He had no interest in cleaning up that coward Xu Le's mess.\n\nBut when Zhou Ze stood up, his sister-in-law immediately started trembling again, burrowing deeper into her sister's arms.\n\n\"Ah! Don't come near me! Don't come near me!\"\n\nZhou Ze frowned slightly. What had she seen just now?\n\n\"What on earth is going on!\" The mother-in-law stood with her hands on her hips, questioning her younger daughter. \"This doesn't look like you were just scared. Xiao Yi, my sweet girl, tell Mommy what really happened. Did he... do something to you?\"\n\nThe sister-in-law was an honest girl, and she knew she couldn't lie about something like this; the consequences would be too severe.\n\n\"No, I came to use the toilet, opened the door, and saw him sitting there. It was terrifying!\"\n\nAfter mustering the courage to say this, she buried her head in her sister's arms again.\n\nAlright.\n\nSo it was all a misunderstanding in the end.\n\n\"You brainless fool! Who uses the toilet in the middle of the night without turning on the light?\n\nYou think my house is like yours, all stingy and penny-pinching?\n\nCan't even bear to pay for a little electricity!\n\nIf my daughter gets a heart attack from the scare, how are you going to compensate her...\"\n\nThe mother-in-law began to berate Zhou Ze, her finger nearly poking him in the face.\n\nZhou Ze was exhausted. People tend to have a short fuse when they're severely sleep-deprived. On top of that, Zhou Ze was already fed up with the god-awful family relations Xu Le had left him with.\n\nIf they weren't sleeping in separate beds,\n\nZhou Ze might have held his tongue.\n\nBut since they were already sleeping apart,\n\nZhou Ze couldn't be bothered to take any more crap from his snobbish mother-in-law.\n\n\"Smack!\"\n\nZhou Ze swatted her pointing finger away.\n\n\"Leave me alone.\"\n\nThe mother-in-law's eyes widened, clearly in disbelief that her usually wimpy son-in-law would dare speak to her like that.\n\n\"Is that any way to talk to your mother? Have you no manners at all!\" the father-in-law scolded.\n\n\"If you want your daughter to be a divorcee, then by all means, keep lecturing me about manners!\"\n\nZhou Ze shot back, then shouldered past his father-in-law and walked back to the bedroom.\n\n\"Bang!\" He slammed the door shut forcefully.\n\n\"Outrageous! Simply outrageous!\" The father-in-law's chest heaved with anger.\n\nThe mother-in-law rushed to her husband's side to soothe his chest.\n\nBut in the end, neither of them dared to press the issue.\n\nAfter all,\n\nwhat Zhou Ze had just said carried a lot of weight with them.\n\nThough they didn't know what had gotten into their normally spineless son-in-law—the kind who wouldn't say boo to a goose—he was right. If their older daughter got divorced, she would be a \"second-marriage woman\" next time. That would be bad for her reputation, and for their family's.\n\nBesides, in their view, a divorced woman wasn't worth much and wouldn't be able to find a good family to marry into.\n\nIn truth, a person's character and whether their thinking is feudal has little to do with their education or family circumstances. It really comes down to the individual's personal quality.\n\nTake Xu Le's in-laws, for example. No matter how furious they were, they didn't dare provoke their bastard son-in-law any further at that moment, terrified he might actually jump up and demand a divorce.\n\nZhou Ze lay on the bed, took a deep breath, closed his eyes, and tried to sleep. He was truly exhausted.\n\nAbout a quarter of an hour later,\n\nZhou Ze heard a knock on the bedroom door:\n\n\"Xiao Yi is scared. I'm going to sleep with her tonight.\"\n\nIt was Lin Wanqiu's voice. Then she left.\n\n*As if she'd been sleeping with me in the first place.*\n\n...\n\nThe next day at noon,\n\nhis father-in-law and mother-in-law were having lunch.\n\n\"Did he go to the bookstore?\" the father-in-law asked the mother-in-law.\n\n\"Hasn't gotten up yet,\" the mother-in-law said resentfully.\n\n\"Unacceptable,\" the father-in-law commented.\n\n\"I know...\"\n\nJust then, the mother-in-law suddenly fell silent. She saw Zhou Ze coming down the stairs. His eyes were bloodshot, and he had severe dark circles under them.\n\nThe atmosphere grew tense.\n\nPerhaps because of last night's incident, Zhou Ze's status as the live-in son-in-law had risen somewhat. At least, his in-laws didn't say anything to provoke him this time.\n\nOf course, it was also because Zhou Ze currently looked like he was ready to grab a knife and start hacking at people at any moment.\n\nHis gaze swept over the dining table.\n\nZhou Ze clutched his chest.\n\nThe smell of rice,\n\nthe smell of meat...\n\nSo disgusting.\n\nHe felt like throwing up again.\n\nZhou Ze walked out the front door. Breathing in the cool, fresh air outside, he felt a little better.\n\nHis head was groggy. Zhou Ze began to wander aimlessly down the street. He needed to think about some things quietly, but his current state—desperately sleepy yet unable to sleep—made it impossible to truly find peace.\n\nIt was a conflict,\n\nan agony,\n\nlike walking out of an internet cafe after pulling two all-nighters, or like a middle schooler who stayed up all night reading a novel under the covers and then had to get up for class the next morning.\n\nAs he walked, Zhou Ze suddenly stopped. The surroundings felt somewhat familiar.\n\nThen he saw the sign up ahead:\n\nTongcheng First Affiliated Hospital.\n\nHe'd actually wandered all the way to his old workplace. *Heh,* maybe it was just because Tongcheng was so small.\n\nZhou Ze walked into the hospital, not to take a trip down memory lane, but to try and get a prescription for some sleeping pills.\n\nHe could handle not eating, at worst he could just drink a lot of water and fill his stomach for a while. But not sleeping was a long-term form of torture.\n\nThe familiar hospital, the familiar work environment. Zhou Ze saw that in the staff photo album for the emergency department on the ground floor, his own picture had been grayed out.\n\nHe then subconsciously walked to his old office. Someone new was at his desk. A middle-aged doctor with a pockmarked face sat in his spot. He glanced at the nameplate on the desk: surname Kang.\n\nHe let out a long breath, a hint of melancholy in the sigh.\n\nFor a moment, Zhou Ze forgot about getting sleeping pills. Perhaps the feeling of \"things remain, but people have changed\" had temporarily suppressed the torment of his sleeplessness. Zhou Ze began to wander through the hospital.\n\nHe was reminiscing about the little details of his life here.\n\nHis work,\n\nhis life,\n\nand,\n\nhis past,\n\nor rather, his past life.\n\n*'Can't go back, I really can't go back,'* Zhou Ze repeated to himself in his mind.\n\nThen, without realizing it, he found himself walking down the stairs to the basement level.\n\nHe stood still. As a doctor who had worked here for many years, he knew the layout of this floor.\n\nA few equipment storage rooms, and then... the morgue.\n\nHe remembered having once lain in this hospital's morgue, where a mortuary cosmetologist had applied makeup to his face.\n\nHe started walking again, heading toward the morgue.\n\nZhou Ze told himself he wanted to see the place where he had once lain. But in reality, it was a special feeling, a pull from the great unknown, that was guiding him forward.\n\nAs he walked, Zhou Ze saw the morgue door. It had an electronic keypad lock. Coincidentally, Zhou Ze remembered the code. Doctors from other departments probably wouldn't have had much to do with this place, but Zhou Ze had been in the emergency department. People brought to the ER were usually seriously ill or injured, and it was inevitable that some couldn't be saved and had to be sent here for placement.\n\nIn fact, this hospital also served as a morgue for the police department. Some unidentified bodies or those that still needed \"processing\" would be temporarily stored here. This was common practice in many places; if the local police department lacked adequate facilities or forensic staff, bodies were often kept at the local funeral home or hospital.\n\nHe entered the code.\n\nThe lock clicked open.\n\nZhou Ze walked inside.\n\nA chill washed over him.\n\nNot the kind that just prickles the skin,\n\nbut a special, deep gloom that seemed to extinguish the warmth within your very soul.\n\nIn the morgue, naturally, there were bodies. This was a temporary resting place for the dead.\n\nNormally, there should have been an attendant on duty outside, but for some reason, Zhou Ze hadn't seen anyone when he walked in. Perhaps the person had stepped away.\n\nZhou Ze walked among them. A few bodies lay on cold gurneys, covered by white sheets. Another body was wrapped in a floral quilt from home. Judging by the silver hair peeking out, the deceased was likely an elderly woman.\n\nDue to his profession, Zhou Ze had never been particularly afraid of corpses. What's more, he himself was now a ghost.\n\nZhou Ze walked over to the refrigerated drawers—the kind that could be pulled out in tiers.\n\nThe drawers containing bodies all had labels on the outside, recording the deceased's name, gender, and other information.\n\nZhou Ze pulled open an empty drawer. He reached inside, closed his eyes, and slowly sensed his surroundings. A feeling of intoxicating peace gradually washed over him, as if only here could he find tranquility.\n\nAfter a moment's hesitation, Zhou Ze lay down inside it.\n\n*Creeak...*\n\nThe drawer was slowly pushed in, until it was finally closed.\n\nQuiet.\n\nCold.\n\nSilent.\n\nZhou Ze slowly closed his eyelids.\n\nSleepiness washed over him.\n\nHe had finally found the feeling of being able to sleep.\n\nBut he couldn't sleep just yet.\n\nBecause he didn't know...\n\nwho had just been standing outside and pushed the drawer shut for him...\n\n***\n¹ A vulgar Chinese folk saying implying a flirtatious, and sometimes inappropriate, relationship between a man and his wife's younger sister.

    "content": "Zhou Ze began to kick his feet against the inside, trying to push himself out, but from outside came the sound of clicking and clacking. This meant the lock on the ice coffin had been fastened.\n\nHe was locked in. There was no getting out.\n\nFor a moment, Zhou Ze felt as if he had returned to the scene of being placed in that cramped coffin.\n\nOnly, this time, Zhou Ze wasn't frantic, nor was he enraged. He simply reached up and tapped on the metal panel near his head:\n\n\"Is something wrong?\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't think someone had come in to help push his ice coffin shut and then lock it, unless that person was a deranged madman, and Zhou Ze didn't believe his luck was *that* bad.\n\nBesides,\n\nHe had closed the morgue door when he came in. A madman who knew the morgue's door code?\n\nWould you believe that?\n\nTherefore, Zhou Ze could only assume that one of *those things* had \"helped\" him out, and done a very thorough job of it.\n\nHowever, after his question, the outside remained silent.\n\nZhou Ze decided to ignore it. He closed his eyes again, preparing to get some proper sleep.\n\nThis time, sleep came quickly.\n\nAfter all, he hadn't closed his eyes in two days, and a lot had happened in that time. The accumulated fatigue was terrifying.\n\n*Let the flood come after I am dead.*¹\n\nRight now, no one could stop him from sleeping.\n\n...\n\nHe didn't know how long he slept, but when Zhou Ze opened his eyes, he felt refreshed and clear-headed. A long-lost vigor had returned, though unfortunately, his body had also been frozen stiff.\n\nThe degree of stiffness was somewhat alarming. Zhou Ze tried his best to wriggle his body within the narrow space, and a series of \"cracking\" sounds echoed out, so satisfying it made him groan unconsciously.\n\nAt this moment, Zhou Ze’s ten fingernails naturally grew long and turned black, shimmering with an unnatural luster. The stiffness in his body and the cold energy that would be unbearable for an ordinary person slowly gathered at his fingertips.\n\nThe entire process didn't last long, but it made Zhou Ze no longer feel the cold or discomfort.\n\nHe subconsciously kicked with his feet again, and the ice coffin slid out smoothly.\n\nThe lock,\n\nIt had been undone?\n\nZhou Ze was a bit surprised. He sat up on the steel slab, climbed down, and then pushed it back in.\n\nHis clothes were somewhat stiff, hanging on him like cardboard, which felt extremely uncomfortable. Zhou Ze's gaze swept across his surroundings.\n\nThe morgue of the affiliated hospital wasn't particularly large; compared to the massive hospitals in big cities, it even seemed a bit modest. But it still stored a considerable number of bodies.\n\nZhou Ze didn't know who had pushed him in earlier, and trying to find them now would indeed be a bit difficult.\n\nFortunately, since the other party had undone the lock while he was asleep, Zhou Ze had no intention of stirring up trouble here.\n\nHe walked towards the morgue door, planning to leave. However, as he passed the few gurneys covered with white sheets, Zhou Ze stopped.\n\nThere was nothing unusual about the bodies under the white sheets.\n\nIncluding the old woman wrapped in a homemade floral quilt, she also seemed unchanged.\n\nBut Zhou Ze still stopped.\n\nBecause he remembered that this old woman's head and feet were now in opposite positions.\n\nIt was impossible that the morgue attendant had come in while he was sleeping, done nothing else, and just flipped the old woman around.\n\nZhou Ze stood beside the old woman and said:\n\n\"If it was you, and you don't come out now, I'm leaving.\"\n\nThe old woman had pushed him in and locked it before, which could have been malicious, but the fact that she had quietly unlocked it for him meant she didn't intend to harm him.\n\nPerhaps someone was about to come by, and seeing an unlocked drawer might have led to his discovery.\n\nAfter all, it was very obvious from the outside whether these drawers were locked or not.\n\nAfter waiting for half a minute with no activity, Zhou Ze decided not to wait any longer.\n\nJust as he was about to turn and leave, a sigh came from behind him.\n\nZhou Ze really disliked this feeling.\n\nActing all coy,\n\nPlaying hard to get.\n\nShe was clearly an old woman when she died, yet she insisted on putting on the airs of a young maiden.\n\nAlright, ageism was indeed wrong, but it was only human nature that a normal person's tolerance for a beautiful female ghost would be slightly higher.\n\nIf Nie Xiaoqian² had a face full of wrinkles and big yellow teeth, do you think Ning Caichen would still have had a human-ghost romance with her?\n\nZhou Ze turned around and looked behind him.\n\nAn old woman with a full head of silver hair was squatting there, dabbing at her eyes with a handkerchief that had been washed until it was faded.\n\nBut ghosts have no tears, so from Zhou Ze's perspective, the old woman looked more like she was dry-heaving.\n\n\"You keep crying. I won't disturb you.\"\n\nZhou Ze prepared to leave.\n\nHe found that he was, after all, a common mortal. Even when it came to ghosts, he was a bit of a lookist.\n\n\"Help me. I have money,\" the old woman said suddenly.\n\n\"Hm,\" Zhou Ze grunted in acknowledgment. He needed money.\n\nThe damn Xu Le had less than two hundred yuan combined in his Alipay and WeChat. Adding the one thousand one hundred that the \"murderer\" had returned, Zhou Ze's total assets were now less than one thousand three hundred.\n\nAnd Zhou Ze's house and savings from his previous life had probably all been donated to an orphanage. He was, for all intents and purposes, destitute.\n\n\"My money is in a hidden compartment in my cabinet. It's an old, yellow-lacquered cabinet. There's thirty thousand yuan, and also my dowry from when I got married—a jade hairpin and a jade bracelet. I don't know how much they're worth.\n\n\"I died so suddenly, I didn't have time to tell my sons. I'm afraid they won't know.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded. \"I'll take a cut.\"\n\nA look of struggle crossed the old woman's face, but she still nodded. \"That's only right.\"\n\nThe old woman knew that without an \"anomaly\" like Zhou Ze to pass on the message, her sons would probably never find the assets she had left behind.\n\n...\n\nAfter leaving the hospital, Zhou Ze took a taxi directly to a place in Tongzhou District called \"Xingdong Town.\" It wasn't very far; Tongcheng's airport was located in this town.\n\nEarlier at the hospital, Zhou Ze had inquired at the registration desk. After the old woman was brought to the hospital, resuscitation efforts failed. Her family then abandoned the body at the hospital, leaving behind an unpaid medical bill.\n\nAbout half an hour later, Zhou Ze arrived in the town and, following the old woman's description, found the village.\n\nIt was a self-built two-story house. Attached to it was a small brick structure, like a rural outhouse.\n\nWhen Zhou Ze got there, he saw several workers dismantling a building—the brick one, of course.\n\nZhou Ze walked over, handed a cigarette to one of the masters, and asked, \"Still busy, with the New Year so close?\"\n\n\"Got to make more money *because* the New Year is coming. Besides, we're all from the same village,\" the bricklayer replied casually.\n\n\"This house, what's going on?\" Zhou Ze asked while peering inside. Two workers were already tearing off the roof, and the bricks from the small house's walls were being removed to be reused later. Inside the house, forget the yellow-lacquered cabinet the old woman mentioned, there wasn't even a small stool to be seen. It was completely empty.\n\n\"His old lady died. This shack was where she used to live alone. Now they're planning to tear it down and build a new kitchen.\" The master leaned his head forward, letting Zhou Ze light his cigarette for him. He smiled a bit sheepishly and said, \"Look, the one who just walked past in front of the house is their eldest son.\"\n\nZhou Ze looked over and saw that the man, whose hair was also turning white, had some bruises on his face.\n\n\"Five brothers. They got into a fight over the little money their old lady left behind. These bricks, once they're taken down, the other four will come to claim their share too.\n\n\"You tell me, what's this world coming to? It's different now. Their old lady's body is still at the hospital, they haven't even gone to get her. None of the brothers are willing to pay off the medical bills she owed.\"\n\n\"What about the old woman's things from her room?\" This was what Zhou Ze was concerned about. From the old woman's description, the thirty thousand yuan in the cabinet was her life savings, but the jade bracelet and hairpin were the truly valuable items. They could probably be sold for a small fortune, hundreds of thousands, without much trouble.\n\n\"Sold 'em to the scrap collector. Cleared out long ago. Sold 'em right after the old lady was hospitalized.\" The master took another hard drag from his cigarette. \"I gotta get back to work.\"\n\nA wry smile touched Zhou Ze's lips. This trip of his had been a complete waste of time.\n\nNot only did he not get a share of the things the old woman left behind, but even her sons wouldn't get to enjoy them. They had just ended up lining the pockets of some junk dealer who buys old furniture.\n\nZhou Ze felt vexed now. Being broke was truly a huge problem. He was unwilling to use his abilities to swindle money—although it seemed very easy and satisfying—but last time he saved a girl, the pain almost killed him last night. Heaven knew what would happen if he kept messing around.\n\nWhether there are gods three feet above one's head, Zhou Ze didn't know,\n\nbut he was certain that if you keep digging three feet down, there is a hell, because he had been there.\n\nHe knew he wasn't human, and this was the human world. Besides, he still vividly remembered how the patient who died in front of him had screamed in terror, \"I've been discovered!\" just before his death.\n\nBut,\n\nMoney,\n\nZhou Ze was willing to turn the millstone,³\n\nBut who was going to pay him?\n\nZhou Ze needed money now. Setting aside the matter of shedding his status as a \"matrilocal husband,\"\n\nhe at least needed to buy himself a freezer or a large refrigerator, right?\n\nOtherwise, would he have to run to the hospital morgue every day just to freeload on the cold air?\n\nFeeling somewhat dejected, Zhou Ze lit a cigarette and took a deep drag, feeling utterly frustrated.\n\nJust then, the phone in his pocket rang. Zhou Ze picked it up. It was an unfamiliar number. He answered the call:\n\n\"Hello,\" said Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Big Bro, the goods arrived safely. When are you coming to inspect them? The cops have been cracking down hard lately, it wasn't easy getting this shipment in,\" the person on the other end said in a low, careful voice.\n\nZhou Ze slowly opened his mouth,\n\nbut made no sound.\n\nAt the same time,\n\nthe image of Xu Le suddenly began to grow much, much taller in his mind.\n\n---\n¹ An adaptation of \"Après moi, le déluge,\" a French phrase meaning \"After me, the flood,\" expressing indifference to what happens after one is gone.\n\n² Nie Xiaoqian and Ning Caichen are the main characters of *A Chinese Ghost Story*, a famous tale about a scholar who falls in love with a beautiful female ghost.\n\n³ A Chinese saying, `有钱能使鬼推磨` (yǒu qián néng shǐ guǐ tuī mò), literally means \"money can make ghosts turn the millstone.\" It's an idiom for \"money makes the world go 'round\" or \"money can accomplish anything.\" Zhou Ze is humorously twisting it, implying he's the \"ghost\" willing to work, but needs the \"money.\"",

    "content": "Next to the bookstore was a noodle shop. Business was average, at best—practically as deserted as Zhou Ze’s bookstore.\n\nThis was because the pedestrian street had originally been built around a central plaza, but the plaza was now \"defunct.\" Aside from a movie theater, all the other businesses had moved out or shut down. As a result, the entire plaza had become a desolate, \"rarely visited\" area.\n\nIn Tongcheng, at least, the symptoms of overzealous urban development were already showing. A few years ago, commercial centers were planned and built in great numbers, but Tongcheng wasn't Shanghai, after all; it couldn't supply that much foot traffic.\n\nFortunately, the noodle shop could still do delivery business, and it seemed to be doing quite well. But obviously, no one would suddenly feel mentally \"hungry\" and order a few books for delivery to chew on.\n\nZhou Ze leaned back in his chair, still a little dizzy. Dr. Lin sat opposite him, wiping his chopsticks with her own tissue before placing them in front of him.\n\nShe was meticulous and considerate, just as she had been when she let Xu Le have the bed while she slept on a floor mat. But at the same time, she was also very cold.\n\nZhou Ze didn't bother asking if she was genuinely opposed to feudal arranged marriages or if she was just a lesbian. The question was meaningless. Zhou Ze himself had no interest in the baffling network of relationships Xu Le had left behind, nor did he feel any attachment to it.\n\n\"Are you sure you're okay?\" Dr. Lin asked again.\n\n\"It's a small problem, a small problem.\" Zhou Ze was a doctor himself. He knew that his issues with eating and sleeping were difficult to explain with modern medical theory, let alone treat.\n\nFortunately, his sleeping problem was now taken care of. It was the eating that was a headache.\n\nIf he didn't eat, he would pass out again, as he just had. But eating... the very thought made him nauseous.\n\n\"If you have no appetite, try a bowl of sour plum juice first,\" the noodle shop owner said. He was around thirty, but his face already had some wrinkles. The burdens of life seemed to weigh heavily on him.\n\n\"Sour plum juice, will that work?\" Zhou Ze asked helplessly.\n\n\"It'll whet your appetite.\" The noodle shop owner smiled, then called toward the back room, \"Honey, is the pickled vegetable noodle soup ready yet?\"\n\nThe owner walked into the back room, and the sound of the couple talking could be heard.\n\nZhou Ze looked at the sour plum juice in front of him. He picked up a spoon, scooped a little, and brought it to his lips. The moment he swallowed, his expression changed.\n\n\"What's wrong?\" Dr. Lin pulled out a facial tissue and held it to his chin.\n\nZhou Ze's face twisted as he clutched his stomach.\n\nThen he took a deep breath and said:\n\n\"That's really sour.\"\n\nYes, so sour it felt like his whole body was about to seize up, so sour it even overpowered the nausea.\n\n\"Coming, the noodles are here.\" The owner's wife walked over carrying a bowl of noodles. She set it down in front of Zhou Ze and said, \"You can't drink our sour plum juice that fast.\"\n\nDr. Lin glanced at the noodles and frowned slightly. \"These noodles... they're way too mushy.\"\n\nMeaning they had been cooked for too long and had lost their firmness, which would greatly affect the texture.\n\n\"Well... our noodles are just like that,\" the owner's wife said, a look of shame on her face.\n\n\"It's fine, it's fine.\"\n\nZhou Ze waved his hand. Mushy or not, firm or not, it didn't matter to him right now. As long as he could get it down, that was all that mattered. He needed energy. If he couldn't eat, Zhou Ze's only option was to go to a hospital for a glucose drip.\n\nWith great solemnity, he lifted his head, feeling as dignified as a warrior on a suicide mission. Then he abruptly lowered it and poured the entire bowl of unimaginably sour plum juice into his mouth in one go.\n\n*Hiss...*\n\nThat invigorating sourness...\n\nIt was like pouring sulfuric acid into his stomach.\n\nBut immediately after, Zhou Ze grabbed his chopsticks, scooped up the noodles, and shoved them into his mouth. He wolfed them down as fast as he could. In five or six bites, the entire bowl of noodles was in his stomach. Then he lifted the bowl and gulped down all the broth.\n\n*Huuuh...*\n\n*Clack!*\n\nZhou Ze set the empty bowl down.\n\nHe let out a long breath. He'd eaten!\n\nThe next moment, Zhou Ze reached up and clutched his chest. The nausea, which had been suppressed by the sour plum juice, came rushing back. But the food was already in his stomach. Zhou Ze practically had to choke himself with both hands to keep from throwing it all up.\n\nNot throwing up was a success.\n\nHe had finally,\n\nfinally,\n\neaten something.\n\nBeads of sweat had formed on Zhou Ze's forehead. He grabbed a napkin from the table and wiped them away.\n\nAt that moment,\n\nboth Dr. Lin and the owner's wife were staring at him, stunned. The way Zhou Ze had just eaten was simply too horrifying.\n\n\"Hehe, looks like you were really hungry. Want another bowl?\" the owner's wife asked.\n\n\"No, no, that's alright,\" Zhou Ze declined.\n\n\"Alright then.\" The owner's wife cleared away the bowl and chopsticks in front of Zhou Ze and called to the back room, \"Honey, get the dough for the afternoon ready. The delivery orders should start coming in soon.\"\n\nThe owner's wife went inside. Her figure couldn't be called graceful, merely average-looking, but her full chest and well-defined backside added a special kind of charm, making her surprisingly attractive.\n\n\"You like... that type?\" Dr. Lin asked.\n\nZhou Ze had been watching the owner's wife until she disappeared into the back room.\n\n\"No.\" Zhou Ze shook his head. *I actually like your type, but you won't let me sleep with you.*\n\nZhou Ze was slightly startled by his own thought. The idea of \"not being allowed to sleep with her\" had been in his mind for a long time, almost becoming an obsession. He had to admit, Dr. Lin was truly beautiful, and young too.\n\nEven though she was Xu Le's wife,\n\neven though Zhou Ze had never been married in his past life,\n\nif he were being honest with himself,\n\nhe still wanted to sleep with her.\n\nIt was precisely because he couldn't that he was so fixated on it, that she was so often on his mind.\n\n\"Not going home?\" Dr. Lin asked again.\n\n\"Not going back,\" Zhou Ze confirmed.\n\n\"Then I'm leaving.\" Dr. Lin stood up. \"Call me if you need anything.\"\n\nAfter all, he was her husband in name, even if there was no substance to their marriage.\n\n\"Alright.\" Zhou Ze nodded. *If I'd known you were this easy to talk to and this considerate, I really should have asked to borrow some money when I was broke.*\n\nDr. Lin left, driving away in her Porsche Cayenne.\n\nZhou Ze, however, remained seated in the noodle shop. His bookstore was right next door. Even though he'd finished his noodles, it was fine to sit and chat for a bit. They were neighbors, after all.\n\nThe owner came out from the back room and handed Zhou Ze a cigarette.\n\n\"How much?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Don't be a stranger. I can afford to treat you to a bowl of noodles, brother.\" The owner waved his hand magnanimously. They were neighbors who would see each other all the time; no need to create distance over a bowl of noodles.\n\n\"Your wife won't get mad?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"She won't. She's just a woman, what does she know? It's not her place to talk,\" the noodle shop owner said, his machismo radiating off him.\n\nA man, regardless of his status at home, always had to put on a bit of a show in public. No one wanted to admit they were afraid of their wife, just as no one wanted to admit they couldn't perform in bed.\n\n\"Hehe, your wife is very pretty,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nJoking about another man's wife was taboo. If two men were facing outward, joking about some woman walking down the street, that was just fun banter between men.\n\nThe owner paused for a second but said nothing, just smiled. He had a good temper. People who run small businesses generally understand that harmony brings wealth.\n\n\"Her figure is excellent,\" Zhou Ze continued. \"Solid, full of flavor. Just like the noodles I just ate.\"\n\nThe owner took a deep drag from his cigarette.\n\n\"How is she in bed?\" Zhou Ze asked, pushing his luck even further this time.\n\nThe owner's fist clenched slightly, but he quickly relaxed and said nonchalantly, \"Oh, her legs... they could squeeze a man to death. So powerful!\"\n\nZhou Ze smiled.\n\nThe owner smiled too.\n\n\"Can you handle it?\" Zhou Ze asked again. \"She's at that age where she wants it, right?\"\n\nThe owner rubbed his lower back. \"Can't handle it anymore. Not a young man anymore.\"\n\n\"Well then, how about you let me have a try?\" Zhou Ze asked again.\n\nThe owner's face completely darkened.\n\nHis knuckles cracked as he squeezed his fist.\n\n\"If you can't, I can. I'm still young,\" Zhou Ze said to himself, though the words were somewhat disingenuous. Xu Le's body, for all its youth, had the feel of a silver spear with a wax tip. It wasn't nearly as well-maintained as Zhou Ze's own body from his previous life.\n\n\"Isn't this joke going a bit too far?\" The owner was still suppressing his anger.\n\n\"What if your wife agrees?\" Zhou Ze continued.\n\n\"Was that your wife just now?\" the owner asked, changing the subject.\n\n\"Yeah,\" Zhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"Would you be willing to give her up?\" the owner asked.\n\nZhou Ze hesitated, then shook his head. Even though she was Xu Le's wife, she was his in name now. Zhou Ze was unwilling.\n\n\"Then what makes you think I'd be willing?\" the owner retorted.\n\n\"Who knows, maybe you have some special tastes or unusual kinks? That kind of thing isn't so rare these days, is it?\"\n\n\"Brother, it's been a long time since I've hit someone.\" The owner stood up.\n\n\"Call your wife out. Ask her. I want to hear her say whether she's willing or not.\" Zhou Ze leaned back slightly, smiling.\n\n\"Heh.\" The owner took a few steps closer to Zhou Ze.\n\n\"You stand here and call her out,\" Zhou Ze insisted.\n\n\"You're asking to die!\" The owner lunged forward.\n\n\"Can she come out?\" Zhou Ze asked suddenly.\n\nThe owner froze.\n\nThen a look of terror appeared on his face, and he stumbled back several steps in fear.\n\nZhou Ze stood up and walked toward the back room himself. He pushed aside the curtain. The room was empty.\n\nThere was only a human skin, a woman's skin,\n\nhanging on a clothes hanger.\n\nAs the curtain was pushed aside, a breeze entered,\n\nmaking it flutter gently,\n\ndrifting slowly.\n\n\"How... did you figure it out?\" the owner asked, slowly walking over. His voice betrayed neither joy nor anger.\n\n\"There's a saying... Are you trying to fool a ghost?\" Zhou Ze turned around and looked at the owner. \"This layer of skin you're wearing, shouldn't you be tearing it off now?\n\nI'm very curious,\n\njust how bored are you,\n\nto be here,\n\nputting on this kind of two-man act.\"",

    "content": "The boss smiled, not feeling the least bit provoked. He just found it a little amusing.\n\nA person's disposition and their aura are often more credible than their words.\n\n\"Riiip...\"\n\nA crisp, somewhat drawn-out sound, like a snake shedding its skin, echoed as he began to tear off his own.\n\nAt the same time, the boss's frame and skeleton began to shrink, his physique slowly thinning out, like a balloon with a small hole in it, gradually deflating.\n\nZhou Ze now finally understood why that bowl of noodles had been so overcooked.\n\nThis kind of \"transformation\" of his really did require some time.\n\nHe was still wearing the boss's clothes, complete with the apron, but the face had changed into that of a slightly greenhorn youth.\n\nThe youth had a smile on his lips, his charm seemingly innate. The curve extending from the corner of his eye, in particular, seemed capable of scratching that itch deep in the hearts of any man or woman nearby—just right, perfectly pitched.\n\nTo describe a man as \"charming\" or \"coquettish\"[^1] is somewhat incongruous, but some men are indeed born with a seductive charm. Take the ancient emperors, for instance; countless among them had a preference for male companionship. The reason being that some men are, in fact, more like women than women themselves.\n\n\"Am I pretty?\" the youth asked Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze felt the nausea he had suppressed after eating the noodles surge up again. He waved a hand apologetically, then clutched his chest, striking a pose that said, *I can't throw up.*\n\n*Who knows that of the meal in the dish, every grain comes from hard toil!*\n\nZhou Ze knew how to cherish food, especially food he had managed to swallow and was about to digest into energy for his body.\n\nThe youth sat down on a nearby chair, a lighter in his hand, which he casually flipped and twirled.\n\nHe was sizing up Zhou Ze, because Zhou Ze had discovered him. He had thought his imitation was seamless, and given that this was a small diner, he didn't think there would be any problems.\n\nMost importantly, he was imitating his own parents.\n\nEver since he was young, he had been observing his parents. Their every move, every expression, was already etched into his heart.\n\n\"How did you find out it was me?\" the youth couldn't help but ask.\n\n\"You're not a ghost?\" Zhou Ze asked at the same time.\n\nThe youth frowned slightly. He thought Zhou Ze was mocking him, accusing him of playing pretend and making things needlessly mysterious.\n\nBut in reality, Zhou Ze had assumed he was a ghost from the very beginning.\n\nZhou Ze didn't want to meddle in other people's business. As someone who, not long ago, was fretting over the cost of a freezer, Zhou Ze didn't think he had the right to meddle.\n\nBut this was business he couldn't ignore.\n\nThis business was happening right next door.\n\nSo Zhou Ze felt that, no matter what, it was best to expose the matter first. If it was easy to solve, he'd solve it himself. If it wasn't, he could always just move again.\n\n\"Your fingernails,\" Zhou Ze said. \"I'm a bit sensitive when it comes to fingernails.\"\n\nWhen the proprietress brought the noodles to him, and when the boss personally handed him a cigarette, their fingernails had both been on full display.\n\nAlthough the thickness, fairness, and calluses of their fingers were different, the patterns on their nail beds were identical.\n\nAnd recently, Zhou Ze had been paying even more attention to fingernails—not just his own, but others' as well.\n\nThe youth's eyes narrowed slightly. He felt a sense of loss. The details hadn't been perfect.\n\nAlthough he had been careless, the fact that he was discovered was indeed his own oversight.\n\n\"You're really not a ghost?\" Zhou Ze asked again.\n\nIf he was human, then that was truly outrageous.\n\nIn truth, Zhou Ze hadn't seen many ghosts. Not counting his journey in Hell, the number of ghosts he had seen in the mortal realm could be counted on one hand.\n\n\"Painted Skin is my family's ancestral art,\" the youth said, standing up. He reached out, grabbed Zhou Ze's hand, and placed it on his own chest. \"It's just that the line was broken for many generations. It was only with my generation that it could be picked up again.\"\n\nThe gesture was a bit ambiguous, a bit out of line, but Zhou Ze still subconsciously gave a squeeze.\n\nZhou Ze would never believe it was because Dr. Lin hadn't let him sleep with her that he was now developing an interest in men.\n\nOf course, the man before him was indeed more coquettish than a woman. That was a fact.\n\n\"No bones?\" An expression of surprise appeared on Zhou Ze's face. \"No, it's rickets.\"\n\nRickets, also known as osteomalacia, is caused by a calcium deficiency that hinders bone calcification, making the bones soft and easily deformed. Zhou Ze used to be a doctor, so he naturally knew a little about it. But just as a single cold can have many variations and different pathologies, rickets also has many sub-categories. The young man before him was likely an extreme case.\n\nAccording to unofficial histories from the Spring and Autumn period, a prince from the State of Lu suffered from this disease. He was said to be boneless, his body pliant. He could walk like a person, but also crawl like a snake.\n\n\"You can think of it as a genetic disease. It requires a certain probability to manifest. For many generations before me, my family couldn't practice Painted Skin because they didn't have this disease. But I...\"\n\nThe youth smiled, not finishing his sentence.\n\n\"So, you're really not a ghost?\" Zhou Ze was still not convinced.\n\n\"My name is Xu Qinglang,\" the youth replied very seriously.\n\n\"And who were you imitating?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"My dad and my mom.\"\n\nZhou Ze froze for a moment, a wry smile appearing on his face.\n\nWell then.\n\nThis was a huge misunderstanding.\n\nEarlier, after he'd finished his noodles and Miss Lin had left, Zhou Ze had intended to expose him, deliberately provoking him with his words. But he never expected that the guy was just playing role-play here out of boredom, commemorating his deceased parents.\n\nBut from Zhou Ze's perspective before, he had just assumed that this was a ghost, a ghost like in the story \"Painted Skin,\" who had killed people, skinned them, and was now parading around in their guise.\n\n\"Then... my apologies.\"\n\nMaking fun of your mother... that really is a bit embarrassing.\n\n\"I'm not angry,\" Xu Qinglang said. \"But I am very curious. What did you mean by insisting I was a ghost?\"\n\n\"It was nothing.\"\n\n\"Have you seen a ghost?\" Xu Qinglang asked.\n\n\"I am a ghost,\" Zhou Ze said, looking at Xu Qinglang very seriously.\n\nHis expression was stern, his features solemn.\n\nHe was baring his soul.\n\nXu Qinglang's face froze.\n\nThen, he couldn't stop himself from bursting out with a \"Pfft\" of laughter.\n\nThe way he looked at Zhou Ze...\n\nWas as if he were looking at an imbecile.\n\nZhou Ze nodded. Sometimes, that's just how it is. You tell them the truth, and they think you're joking. They just won't believe you.\n\n\"Anyway, I'm sorry. By the way, I wanted to ask, was that human skin... real human skin?\" Zhou Ze asked curiously.\n\n\"Fish skin,\" Xu Qinglang replied. \"Processed, painted, and crafted.\"\n\n\"Then why are you selling noodles?\" Zhou Ze couldn't quite understand. \"I heard that a single piece of snake-skin clothing from the Hezhen people can sell for a lot of money, sold as art. Yours should be even more valuable, right?\"\n\n\"It's an ancestral craft. I can't bring myself to use it for profit.\"\n\n\"Then you must be very rich,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"My family's property was just part of a demolition and relocation project,\" Xu Qinglang didn't answer directly. \"We got over twenty apartments in compensation.\"\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze took a deep breath.\n\nSo, the world really is this unfair. In his past life, he worked himself to the bone at the hospital and barely earned anything, while this guy casually ends up with over twenty apartments.\n\nTongcheng couldn't compare to Shanghai, but housing prices were still close to ten thousand yuan per square meter.\n\nA second-generation nouveau riche from demolition... Truly enviable.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. \"Are you going to keep making noodles in the future?\"\n\n\"Are you going to keep selling books in the future?\"\n\nThe two of them asked each other a question at the same time again.\n\n\"I'll see how it goes for now,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\n\"Same here.\"\n\n\"Well then, see you around. By the way, does your plum juice come in other flavors?\" Zhou Ze was very curious about this. \"Like bitter melon? Or grape?\"\n\n\"I have the secret recipes. I can make them,\" Xu Qinglang said honestly.\n\n\"Excellent.\" Zhou Ze reached out and patted Xu Qinglang on the shoulder.\n\nDamn it.\n\nIt was like cotton.\n\nSo soft. He was truly pliant, truly boneless. If you were to hold him in your arms in bed...\n\nZhou Ze immediately conjured an image of Dr. Lin emerging from the shower in her pajamas in his mind, forcefully suppressing that discordant thought.\n\nZhou Ze walked out of the noodle shop.\n\nXu Qinglang went into the back room, lifted the curtain, and said to the woman's skin hanging there:\n\n\"Mom, do you think he really believed me, or was he faking it?\"\n\nThe woman's skin swayed gently.\n\nIt swayed ever so slightly.\n\nAs if to say, *he didn't believe you*.\n\nOr as if to say, *she didn't know either*.\n\n...\n\nZhou Ze returned to his shop. The freezer was already set up. The next step was to overhaul the broken-down bookstore Xu Le had left behind. Letting it continue to lose money like this was not a solution.\n\nThe sign at the entrance of the bookstore read \"Xu Le Bookstore.\" It was as tacky as tacky could be.\n\nIn short, in that guy's hands, this bookstore, from top to bottom, inside and out, exuded an aura of \"guaranteed to lose money.\"\n\nZhou Ze sat down at the computer and tried several times to log into his original QQ account, but he couldn't. He couldn't pass the identity verification, and filing an appeal was basically impossible.\n\nAfterward, Zhou Ze had no choice but to go out and hail a taxi. He planned to get a new sign, or maybe a pair of couplets for the doorway.\n\nHe knew someone who owned a plaque shop, specializing in carved wooden plaques. The owner was an old man who often donated to that orphanage. Back when Zhou Ze himself was a member of the orphanage, the old man was already donating. After Zhou Ze started working, the old man and Zhou Ze donated together.\n\nThe plaque shop wasn't far, located at the foot of Langshan Mountain. It was surrounded on all sides by shops selling incense and candles; only this one sold plaques.\n\nHowever, when Zhou Ze walked in, he found the shop in the middle of a major cleaning. Even the main plaque had been taken down.\n\nA middle-aged man was there, directing workers.\n\n\"Can I help you?\" the man asked when he saw Zhou Ze approach.\n\n\"I'm looking for Old Mr. Zhao,\" Zhou Ze said. He held the old man in high esteem.\n\n\"I'm sorry, my father passed away last month,\" the middle-aged man replied.\n\n\"Passed away?\" Zhou Ze was a bit surprised, and also a bit saddened. He and Old Mr. Zhao weren't actually close; they just knew of each other. So, it was perfectly normal that he wasn't notified of the funeral.\n\nBesides, it was possible that Old Mr. Zhao's family, seeing him donate all the income from his plaque-making to the orphanage, naturally held no goodwill towards the orphanage. They might not have even notified the orphanage of the funeral, afraid they would come asking them for money.\n\n\"Are you here to order a plaque?\" the middle-aged man asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" Zhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"Our family... we're not making them anymore,\" the middle-aged man said apologetically. \"From now on, we're selling incense and candles.\"\n\nLangshan Mountain is one of the ten minor Buddhist holy mountains. Even if it didn't attract tourists from afar, the locals who came to burn incense and pray during holidays were enough to let the shops at the foot of the mountain make a fortune.\n\nThis was another way of living off the mountain.\n\n\"That's a shame,\" Zhou Ze said, feeling a bit regretful.\n\nHe decided he would go visit the old man's gravestone.\n\n\"But we still have a few plaques my dad made before. They didn't sell. I don't know why my dad carved them; they weren't custom orders. If you like any of them, I'll sell them to you cheap.\" The middle-aged man was thinking of getting rid of them like scrap.\n\n\"Alright, I'll take a look,\" Zhou Ze agreed.\n\nHe followed the middle-aged man into a small courtyard in the back. The man opened a storeroom and switched on the light.\n\nInside were some miscellaneous items, including Old Mr. Zhao's crafting tools, all piled up in disarray, signifying that the younger generation had no intention of inheriting the craft.\n\nNowadays, everyone wanted illuminated signs. Who would want to use these? It was hard work and didn't even make much money.\n\n\"Whoosh...\" The middle-aged man blew a breath of air at the few plaques on the floor. \"Take a look. Two hundred yuan apiece. If you see one you like, you can take it. If not, no big deal.\"\n\nClearly, the middle-aged man wasn't very confident he could sell these plaques.\n\nZhou Ze walked over to take a look.\n\nThe first plaque read:\n\n\"Life and death are ruled by fate; wealth and honor are decreed by heaven.\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. The middle-aged man sighed, knowing that one was a no-go.\n\nThe next one read:\n\n\"Men know the terror of ghosts; ghosts know the poison of human hearts.\"\n\nZhou Ze paused for a moment. This one... resonated with him.\n\nThe middle-aged man didn't sigh this time, because he knew it was a definite no-go. What kind of shop owner would be crazy enough to hang this at their entrance?\n\nThe third one:\n\n\"Take it for what it's worth. Thus have I heard.\"\n\nZhou Ze smiled.\n\nSeeing Zhou Ze smile, the middle-aged man smiled too.\n\nFinally, one had found a home.\n\n---\n[^1]: The original word used is `媚` (mèi), which means coquettish, charming, or seductive, and is typically used to describe women.

    "content": "He brought the plaques back. Zhou Ze planned to nail them up on either side of the door; he didn't care which one went on the left and which on the right.\n\nThe young man from next door, Xu Qinglang, was very warmhearted.\n\nHe had been squatting by his door peeling garlic, but when he saw Zhou Ze getting ready to hang the plaques, he went right into his own place to get a hammer and nails.\n\nZhou Ze said thanks and took the hammer. It felt a bit greasy and heavy in his hand. Suppressing a slight sense of discomfort, Zhou Ze still nailed the two plaques up.\n\nAfterward, the two of them stepped back a few paces together, looking at the plaques, at the door, at the bookstore.\n\nZhou Ze handed Xu Qinglang a cigarette as a thank you. Xu Qinglang lit it for him.\n\nThey both exhaled rings of smoke, in perfect sync.\n\n\"It's got atmosphere, don't you think?\" Zhou Ze said, a classic case of tooting his own horn.\n\nXu Qinglang shook his head. \"If I'm not mistaken, those two lines are from the chapter titles of Ji Yun's *Notes from the Thatched Abode of Close Scrutiny*.\"\n\n*Notes from the Thatched Abode of Close Scrutiny* is a collection of stories written by Ji Yun, also known as Ji Xiaolan, similar to *Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio*. It uses tales of fox spirits, ghosts, and monsters to express the author's own ideas.\n\nTo put it simply, the couplet meant: *These are all just stories I've heard, so everyone here should just take them as such.*\n\n\"Mm,\" Zhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"Still too artsy. This shop of yours is still going to lose money,\" Xu Qinglang's assessment was blunt.\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"In this world, there are too many stories. All sorts of bizarre things happen every day, but not many of them are actually interesting.\n\nSome things are boring when you tell them.\n\nSome things, you're not allowed to talk about at all.\n\nSome things, no one will listen to unless you change them.\n\nAnd some things, people don't dare to listen to unless you change them.\"\n\nZhou Ze stared at Xu Qinglang for a long moment.\n\nXu Qinglang lowered his head slightly, a blush spreading across his face.\n\nHe was a man who naturally exuded a flirtatious charm, and at this moment, he looked exquisitely beautiful.\n\nSeeing that Zhou Ze wasn't speaking, Xu Qinglang continued:\n\n\"Take these tales of mountain spirits, fox fairies, ghosts, and monsters, for example. Where would you ever really find them in the real world?\" Xu Qinglang yawned. \"How true can the morals be when they're hidden in fake stories?\"\n\nZhou Ze continued to stare at Xu Qinglang, not saying a word.\n\nXu Qinglang started to feel his scalp tingle under the intense gaze.\n\nBut Zhou Ze kept on staring at him.\n\nFinally, Xu Qinglang waved his hand dismissively, saying he had to go back to make his soup base. As he walked back to his noodle shop, he felt as if there were needles on his back, because just now, it had felt as though Zhou Ze wasn't looking at him, but at a joke.\n\nZhou Ze paid Xu Qinglang no mind. Since they were neighbors, it was best to just let well water not mix with river water. They weren't in competition anyway, and most importantly, Zhou Ze didn't have the money to move to a new shop.\n\nIn the afternoon, Zhou Ze sorted through most of the textbooks and study guides in the bookstore and had a scrap collector take them away for the price of waste paper.\n\nHe also went to the supermarket and bought ten small plastic chairs. The only two remaining bookshelves were filled with books that Zhou Ze himself found somewhat interesting.\n\nAt this point, it was less a bookstore and more a recreational center for the elderly.\n\nZhou Ze stretched. He wasn't very good at running a business. Right now, he was just messing around aimlessly. After all, Xu Le had been constantly losing money when he was around, so there was no pressure on him.\n\nGoing up to the small second floor, Zhou Ze turned on the freezer's power and set the temperature. He smoked a cigarette outside while waiting for a bit, then reached into the freezer to feel it.\n\nThe temperature was about right. Zhou Ze lay down inside it.\n\nA freezer that cost over ten thousand yuan naturally had many functions, for instance, a timer setting, which served as Zhou Ze's alarm clock.\n\nHe closed the freezer lid.\n\nZhou Ze placed his hands on his abdomen and lay perfectly straight.\n\nIt looked like…\n\n…he had passed away peacefully.\n\n***\n\nLate at night, a red sedan pulled over on the street in front of the bookstore. The entire street was somewhat deserted. Over by the shops, only the adjacent noodle shop and bookstore still had their lights on.\n\nInside the car sat a well-dressed girl. Black down jacket, shoulder-length hair, looking rather cute and delicate.\n\n\"Xiao Bai, you bastard! I prepared for three days, and today you tell me you've gone on a business trip! You can just go to hell! Get lost!\"\n\nThe girl hung up the phone and sat fuming in the driver's seat.\n\nThe corgi in the passenger seat jumped onto the girl's lap. Its coat was lustrous and flowing; one look was enough to tell it was a good breed and very well cared for.\n\n\"Good boy. At least I still have you with me.\"\n\nThe girl lit a cigarette, stuck her hand out the window, and flicked the ash. Her gaze drifted outside and she saw the bookstore. More importantly, through the glass window, she could see that the furnishings inside were a bit unusual—not many bookshelves, but rows of plastic stools instead.\n\nGetting out of the car, the girl walked toward the bookstore, holding her corgi. She didn't want to spend this Valentine's night driving around aimlessly by herself. She wanted to find a quiet place to sit for a while.\n\nThe bookstore door was unlocked. Stepping inside, she could feel the warmth from the air conditioner.\n\nThe girl, leading her dog, first picked a random magazine from a shelf, then sat down on one of the plastic chairs.\n\nShe let the corgi off its leash, and the little guy began to \"explore\" the shop.\n\nAfter finishing the magazine, the girl stretched lightly. Feeling a bit thirsty, she called out:\n\n\"Hello? Is the owner here? Do you have milk tea or coffee?\"\n\nThe girl stood up, put the magazine she was holding back, and picked out an illustrated version of *Dream of the Red Chamber*. By the time she sat down again, she couldn't help but shout once more:\n\n\"Owner! It's the middle of the night, are you dead or something? Is this any way to run a shop?\"\n\nThe bookstore's glass door had a small sign hanging on it that read \"Open for Business, Welcome.\" The door was open, and the heat was on; it was definitely still open.\n\nIf the girl had been a little less polite or a little more curious at that moment and had gone up to the second floor to take a look, she might have been impressed at how her words had become a prophecy.\n\nIn the low-ceilinged space of the second floor, there was indeed a freezer.\n\nThe owner was lying inside, looking just like a dead person.\n\nNo, the owner *was* a dead person.\n\nOf course, the girl probably wouldn't have had time to admire her own prescience before being scared out of her wits.\n\nA normal person enters a shop late at night only to find the owner lying in a frozen coffin... pretty terrifying, right?\n\nThe girl lit another cigarette, growing impatient, and took out her phone to play with it.\n\nAt that moment, the sound of footsteps came from the top of the stairs. Zhou Ze hadn't gotten up because he heard the girl's shouts; he had woken up naturally.\n\nJust as he came down the stairs, Zhou Ze saw a small yellow figure dart over to his leg, asking to be held.\n\nZhou Ze smiled and bent down, scooping the corgi into his arms. The little guy wasn't shy with strangers, acting familiar with everyone.\n\nOnly then did Zhou Ze notice the woman sitting in the shop.\n\nOh. The first customer since the reopening.\n\nBut he wasn't as excited as he might have imagined, because all Zhou Ze had done today was change the bookstore's signs and clean up the interior; he still hadn't figured out how he was going to make money.\n\n\"Do you have coffee here, owner?\" the girl asked.\n\nZhou Ze pointed a finger at a water cooler in the corner. There were disposable paper cups by it.\n\nThe girl looked a bit resigned, but she got up anyway, poured herself a glass of water, and sat back down on her plastic stool.\n\nOwner and customer, facing each other in silence.\n\nAfter about half an hour of silence, the girl started scrolling through Weibo and watching videos. One video was very loud and boisterous:\n\n\"Step right up, ladies and gentlemen, don't miss out!\n\nSpirit money, blessed by yours truly, the Old Taoist! Limited supply!\n\nYou can burn it now and withdraw it for use when you go down below! You'll even earn interest, higher than Yu'e Bao!¹\n\nYou can also burn it for your relatives down below! Fast and convenient, no swindling of old or young, the ghost bailiffs won't bother you, and there's no skimming off the top!\"\n\nThe girl laughed when she saw the video. People usually have a habit of wanting to share when they find something funny. She looked up at the owner sitting behind the counter and said:\n\n\"Owner, have you seen this video? This Old Taoist's livestream is pretty famous. He's practically an internet celebrity.\"\n\n\"Oh, a livestream?\" Zhou Ze took out his phone. On Xu Le's phone, there were quite a few livestreaming apps. It seemed the guy had been really bored in his daily life, either watching livestreams or writing a sequel to *Bai Jie*.²\n\n\"Yeah, search for his ID. It's hilarious. I think he runs a spirit money shop in Rongcheng, but he hasn't streamed in a long time.\"\n\nZhou Ze opened an app and searched for the Old Taoist's ID as the girl suggested. He found a stream room—\"The streamer is not home.\"\n\nBut luckily, he could watch past recordings. Zhou Ze randomly clicked on a video from a month ago.\n\nIn the video, the Old Taoist had his phone fixed in one spot and was practicing martial arts. His punches had force; you could tell he was a trained practitioner. In the frame, a young man was sitting there, a smile on his lips and his eyes narrowed, as if he were watching a monkey show.\n\nZhou Ze casually scrubbed through the video. Another man appeared on screen, sitting behind the counter, holding a spoon, looking like he was eating congee.\n\nThe Old Taoist was chattering away in the main frame, endlessly promoting himself and the spirit money he sold on Taobao, but Zhou Ze's gaze was subconsciously drawn to the man in the corner of the video.\n\nHe was frowning, he was suffering, he was in pain, he was resisting.\n\nOne mouthful of congee, he ate it with great difficulty.\n\nThen he continued with a second mouthful, as if he were being tortured.\n\nWatching this, Zhou Ze took a deep breath, as if he himself had been infected by the man in the corner of the video.\n\nEating... really isn't an easy thing to do.\n\nHe didn't know the identity of the man in the video but was instinctively intrigued. Was he anorexic? Or did he have some kind of gastrointestinal disease?\n\nAfter the video ended, Zhou Ze opened the page. On a whim, he used the still-logged-in account of Xu Le to send the Old Taoist a private message:\n\n\"Who was the man sitting in the background eating congee in your video?\"\n\n\"Hey, I'm leaving. How much is it?\" The girl stood up and stretched. \"If I tell anyone about this, they'll definitely think I'm an idiot. I spent Valentine's night sitting in a bookstore reading *Dream of the Red Chamber* for so long.\"\n\n\"Pay what you think is fair,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nThe girl glanced at Zhou Ze. \"Owner, you've got a good routine here. Just like those masters in temples who interpret fortune sticks. The sign by the cushions says 'Free Fortune Readings,' but after the tourist gets their fortune read, the master pulls out a red donation ledger. It's filled with a long list of names and donation amounts, and the lowest one is a hundred.\"\n\nZhou Ze just smiled, noncommittally.\n\nThe girl took out a hundred-yuan bill, placed it on the chair she had been sitting on, then left with her corgi, pushing open the bookstore door.\n\nZhou Ze stood up and collected the hundred-yuan bill. He flicked it in his hand.\n\nA crisp snap.\n\nOne of the most wonderful sounds in the world.\n\nWhen he walked back to the counter, Zhou Ze saw his phone screen light up. He opened his phone and saw there was actually a reply. It was a private message from the Old Taoist. The reply was very simple:\n\n\"Gone!\"\n***\n¹ Yu'e Bao is a high-yield money market fund offered by Alipay, a major Chinese digital payment platform.\n² *Bai Jie* is a well-known work of Chinese internet erotica.",

    "content": "Only one customer the entire evening. Total income: one hundred yuan. The only cost: a single glass of water.\n\nOf course, you could argue there were also costs like electricity and rent...\n\nBut that’s not how you should look at it. Back when Xu Le was around, those were costs too, but his income was practically negligible. A person has to find the right point of comparison to feel a little satisfaction and confidence in life.\n\nAlso, it was only because of that girl with the Corgi that Zhou Ze even realized today was Valentine's Day.\n\nHe scrolled through WeChat, found Dr. Lin's contact, and tapped on it. Zhou Ze wanted to send her a red envelope. He tried to send 1314 but realized he didn't have enough money.¹ He had enough for 131.4, but sending that would just seem cheap.\n\n*Besides, it's not like she's sleeping with me.*\n\n*Forget it.*\n\n*Not sending it.*\n\nTossing his phone aside, Zhou Ze grabbed a random book and flipped through it, holding that pose until morning.\n\nHe went next door for wontons. Whether the wrappers were thin or the filling was generous, Zhou Ze couldn't tell. He ate them the same way as before: after downing a large bowl of sour plum juice, he immediately scarfed them down. Then he clutched his throat, taking deep, continuous breaths to suppress the urge to vomit.\n\nThe thought that every meal from now on would follow this same routine cast a shadow over his future.\n\nZhou Ze thought of the man in the video, painfully drinking congee. He felt a wave of sorrow. Eating was once one of life's greatest pleasures, but now, it was lost to them.\n\nHe wondered if there was an \"Anorexics' Club\" somewhere in the world, where everyone would gather around a table, and whoever managed to eat a bite of food first would get a collective thumbs-up from the rest:\n\n\"You're so awesome!²\nMy XXX is so amazing!\"\n\nHe took a deep breath. The image was somewhat chilling.\n\nIn any case, yesterday's video, including the old Daoist priest and the man drinking congee, felt too distant for Zhou Ze at the moment.\n\nAfter Valentine's Day came New Year's Eve. Normally, this shopping center would be festooned with lanterns and decorations, brimming with a festive \"New Year's atmosphere.\" But now, it was the same as always—cold and deserted.\n\nIt was just like life.\n\nIf you've had your moment in the sun, you'll naturally have your time in the shadows.\n\nZhou Ze remembered when this shopping center first opened; it was all the rage for a time. Now, it was utterly neglected.\n\nXu Qinglang's business was booming today, likely because many other shops were closed. As someone who insisted on doing deliveries even on New Year's Eve, he naturally raked in more orders. After all, the customers had fewer options.\n\nDelivery drivers in blue, yellow, or red uniforms constantly came and went from his noodle shop. Zhou Ze squatted at the entrance of his own bookstore, smoking a cigarette and sighing with emotion.\n\nThat son-of-a-bitch Xu Le. He should have opened a braised chicken joint instead.\n\nIn myths and legends, deities were fond of saying, \"A day in heaven is a year on earth.\"\n\nIn fact, Zhou Ze felt this was probably right, and it applied to hell just as well.\n\nHe remembered when he died in the car crash... no, wait, he remembered being sent into the incinerator for cremation. It must have just been Children's Day on June 1st. And now, in the blink of an eye, it was New Year's Eve.\n\nHalf a year had passed so quickly. Life is but a fleeting dream, nothing more than a dazed walk halfway down the road to the underworld.\n\nAfter smoking quite a few cigarettes and thinking quite a few thoughts, Zhou Ze felt a bit tired. He took out his phone, wanting to see what movies were playing recently. The theater was right next door; he could go there to kill some time.\n\n\"Hey, you got any newspapers over there?\" Xu Qinglang asked, walking out after a busy spell of sending off the last batch of delivery drivers.\n\n\"What for?\"\n\n\"To paper the walls,\" Xu Qinglang replied.\n\n\"That frugal?\"\n\n\"Newspaper on the walls gives it atmosphere, a sense of an era. You didn't sell them all yesterday, did you?\"\n\n\"There are still some left. Wait, I'll go get them for you.\"\n\nZhou Ze went back into the store. On the second floor, next to his freezer, he heaved out a half-man-high stack of newspapers. He brought them downstairs and gave them to Xu Qinglang, who was waiting there.\n\n\"You're not going home for the New Year either?\" Xu Qinglang asked.\n\n\"I'm spending the New Year with my books.\"\n\nIt was a pity Zhou Ze didn't have a goatee or wine in his hand, otherwise he could have drunk a toast to that incredibly classy line.\n\n\"You're not going home either, are you?\" Zhou Ze asked after a moment of self-satisfaction.\n\n\"With over twenty properties, which home am I supposed to go back to?\" Xu Qinglang sighed.\n\n\"...\" said Zhou Ze.\n\nAfter a moment of silence, Zhou Ze said, \"Let me tell you a story.\"\n\n\"Alright.\" Xu Qinglang nodded, his expression slightly demure. His hair was a little long, and a few strands drooped towards the corner of his mouth. He reached up and gently brushed them away, his gesture so delicate he was truly bashfully charming.\n\nSuch charm was not for outsiders to know.\n\n\"Once upon a time, also on New Year's Eve, a man on a late-night road ran into the richest man in town.\n\nThe rich man was dead drunk.\n\nThe man asked the tycoon, 'Why don't you go home?'\n\nThe rich man replied, 'Home? Where is my home? My family and relatives aren't by my side. The home you speak of, is it that mansion of mine, the largest in the city?'\"\n\nAfter hearing the story, Xu Qinglang nodded slightly, as if he deeply related.\n\n\"Then the man pinned the tycoon to the ground and beat the crap out of him, shouting:\n\n'That'll teach your ass for coming out on New Year's Eve to act all pretentious!'\"\n\nZhou Ze finished the story.\n\n\"...\" said Xu Qinglang.\n\nTheir conversation ended.\n\nZhou Ze returned to his bookstore. The heat was on, making it warm and cozy. He fiddled with his phone, but there was no one to contact.\n\nHe'd thought about visiting the orphanage, but then decided against it. He didn't have much money left.\n\nBut just then, a customer arrived. It was a young man in blue work clothes and a hard hat. He pushed open the bookstore door and walked in, asking somewhat shyly:\n\n\"Can I read books here? How much is it?\" The man pursed his lips.\n\n\"Go ahead. Pay what you think is fair,\" Zhou Ze said with a wave of his hand, indicating the man could browse freely.\n\n\"That's great. Do you have any novels here?\" the young man asked, a bit reservedly. \"I like reading novels, the web novel kind.\"\n\nZhou Ze pointed to a box behind a bookshelf. \"They're all over there.\"\n\nThe man walked over to the box and rummaged through it, looking very pleased. Some of the books were still in their plastic wrap.\n\n\"Go ahead and open them. No charge,\" Zhou Ze said magnanimously.\n\n\"Alright, thanks.\"\n\nThe young man unwrapped a web novel, sat down on a plastic stool, and began to read.\n\nAs the owner, Zhou Ze sat behind the counter, trimming his nails. The young man just sat there reading. About half an hour later, the young man stood up, took out his cigarettes, and offered one to Zhou Ze.\n\n\"It's not a good brand, hope you don't mind.\"\n\n\"Hey, cigarettes are no good to begin with. Why distinguish between good and bad?\"\n\nZhou Ze took the cigarette. The man took one for himself and proactively walked outside the shop door to light up while standing in the cold wind.\n\nThis made Zhou Ze, who had been planning to smoke inside, pause for a moment. He decided against it, put the cigarette aside, and continued trimming his nails.\n\nAfter finishing his smoke outside, the young man came back in. This time, he didn't sit on the plastic stool but leaned against the wall and sat on the floor.\n\nAlthough the air conditioner was on, the floor tiles were still cold. The young man didn't seem to mind at all, as if he were used to it.\n\nAbout fifteen minutes later, four more men in clean, well-worn blue work clothes walked up to the shop. The oldest looked to be no more than thirty, while the youngest was perhaps only about seventeen.\n\nThe four of them came in together. The young man leaning against the wall waved to them; he must have been the one who called them over.\n\nThe newcomers greeted Zhou Ze. He gave a perfunctory reply and went back to trimming his nails.\n\nZhou Ze decided he needed to buy a professional manicure set. His nails deserved it.\n\nBut with deliveries suspended and most physical stores closed, he'd have to put it off for now.\n\nWhen he looked up again, Zhou Ze saw that all five workers were sitting on the floor, each holding a novel.\n\nHe could tell from the covers that they were all web novels, mostly fantasy. One was holding a horror novel, biting his nails as he read, clearly engrossed.\n\nHowever, Zhou Ze found the man's nail-biting habit hard to condone.\n\n*Only those who know how to cherish their nails know how to cherish life.*\n\nFrom time to time, someone would laugh while reading, a genuine laugh inspired by the story.\n\nThe bookstore was full of people, but it was quiet. There was an occasional small sound, but it wasn't disturbing.\n\nWhen evening arrived, Xu Qinglang walked in carrying a bowl of dumplings. He entered and said directly:\n\n\"Well now, the shop's pretty lively.\"\n\nZhou Ze smiled and nodded.\n\n\"Brothers, want something to eat?\" Xu Qinglang asked the workers sitting in the shop.\n\nThey looked at each other, at a loss.\n\n\"Forget it, it's on me.\" Xu Qinglang was, after all, a man with over twenty properties. \"It's New Year's, and it's not easy for you guys not to be home. We're all out here trying to make a living. We're brothers, no matter where we're from.\"\n\n\"Well, thank you, boss. May you get rich,\" the oldest worker said, standing up to thank Xu Qinglang.\n\n\"It's what I should do, what I should do.\"\n\nXu Qinglang put down Zhou Ze's dumplings and went back to his own shop.\n\nZhou Ze drank a little of the broth, then forced down two dumplings. That damn Xu Qinglang had forgotten to bring him sour plum juice, so he couldn't eat.\n\nTaking out the cigarettes on the counter, Zhou Ze walked out from behind it.\n\n\"When you're done, just grab another. I should have the full sets of whatever I've got here. Anyway, this shop is a money-losing business, so don't be polite with me.\"\n\nZhou Ze handed out cigarettes one by one.\n\nThe workers accepted them, flattered and overwhelmed.\n\nThen they all got up and went outside the shop door, squatting in a row to smoke.\n\nThey didn't want to dirty the shop's environment.\n\nZhou Ze thought for a moment, then also walked outside. The wind was a bit cold. He squatted down next to them and smoked along.\n\nThe workers chatted.\n\nThe married ones talked about their wives and kids.\n\nThe unmarried ones talked about girls they knew in Tongcheng or back home.\n\nThey joked with each other.\n\nThey teased one another.\n\nEven though they all knew each other's stories, there was still plenty to talk about.\n\nJudging by their accents, this group of workers was from all over the country, not from the same village.\n\nTongcheng was near Shanghai, part of the Yangtze River Delta region. Although it couldn't compare to Shanghai in scale, the demand for labor here was huge every year. As long as you were willing to work hard, you wouldn't have trouble finding a job or making money.\n\nAnother two rounds of cigarettes were passed around.\n\nZhou Ze spoke up, \"Brothers, you're really not going home for the New Year?\"\n\n\"Nope, everyone at home is fine.\"\n\n\"It's a lot of trouble to go back and forth. There's still work in the first lunar month, and the boss will even give out red envelopes. It'd be a waste not to take them, and we can send more money home.\"\n\n\"Haha, today's been great. We've got novels to read and cigarettes to smoke. This New Year's feels pretty good.\"\n\n\"Boss, when are you closing up?\" one of the workers asked.\n\n\"I'm not closing,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\n\"The boss isn't going home?\"\n\n\"The old lady at home won't listen to me, so I'm not going back.\"\n\nZhou Ze suddenly felt a surge of heroic spirit reaching the heavens!\n\nAll the workers gave Zhou Ze a thumbs-up in applause.\n\nOf course, no one took the joke too far. They could tell from his accent, and the fact that he ran a bookstore and not a fruit stall, that Zhou Ze was a local.\n\nFor a local to be minding his shop on New Year's Eve instead of being home, there had to be a reason, so no one continued to joke or tease him about it.\n\nBesides, they were each the pillar of their own family. They came out to work and earn money while their wives managed the elderly and children back home. They worked hard, they were tired, but their wives were too.\n\nLife is built on generations of hardship and endurance. Whose life is ever easy?\n\nJust as Zhou Ze was about to pass out more cigarettes, a voice called out from a distance:\n\n\"Xu Le!\"\n\nZhou Ze looked up and stood. He then noticed a Porsche Cayenne parked on the other side of the road. A familiar car.\n\nRight, his wife's car.\n\nThe one shouting was his sister-in-law. She had indeed been scared out of her wits by Zhou Ze in the bathroom a while back, but she was back to normal now. She couldn't possibly believe her brother-in-law was a ghost, so she just chalked it up to her eyes playing tricks on her in her fear.\n\nOf course, she couldn't possibly be in a good mood with Zhou Ze. After all, he made *her* pee her pants. How humiliating!\n\n\"Xu Le, come home for dinner!\" the sister-in-law shouted.\n\n\"Not going back. The shop's busy, and it's quite lively here,\" Zhou Ze waved his hand.\n\nWhat a joke.\n\nGo back on New Year's Eve to see that pair of坑爹³ in-laws?\n\nAnd put up with this bratty sister-in-law?\n\nMost importantly, rush home on New Year's Eve just to sleep in separate beds?\n\nWas he a glutton for punishment?\n\n\"Sis, is this guy nuts? He's unreasonable, just plain weird, and so stubborn!\"\n\nThe sister-in-law pouted from the back seat.\n\nDr. Lin smiled. \"Let's go home and eat with Mom and Dad first.\"\n\n\"Ooh, sounds like you're planning on coming out tonight, Sis?\"\n\n\"I am, after all, his... legal wife.\" Dr. Lin said no more, started the car, and drove away.\n\nWatching the car leave, Zhou Ze shouted to the workers beside him, \"Brothers, is my wife pretty or what?\"\n\n\"Pretty!\"\n\n\"You're a lucky man!\"\n\n\"Gorgeous!\"\n\n\"Hahahaha.\"\n\nXu Qinglang came out of his shop carrying a large tray.\n\n\"Here we go, braised pork over rice! Dig in, brothers!\"\n\nThe workers were a bit reserved and hesitant. The oldest one said, somewhat embarrassed, \"We came out without bringing any...\"\n\n\"We already agreed, it's my treat for my brothers! If you mention money again, you're not treating me as a brother. We're all from different places, who knows when our paths might cross again. There might be a day when I need to ask you guys for a favor.\"\n\n\"Alright!\"\n\n\"Say no more!\"\n\n\"When you come to my hometown...\"\n\n\"Let's eat!\"\n\nThe workers each took a large bowl of rice and went into the bookstore. They all squatted on the floor, placing their bowls on the plastic stools, and ate heartily.\n\nOne worker was eating while still reading his novel. A worker next to him tapped him on the head with his chopsticks.\n\n\"You've got lard in your brain. What if you get the book dirty? How's the boss supposed to sell it then?\"\n\n\"You're right. I'll eat first.\"\n\nThe atmosphere was lively. Zhou Ze returned behind his counter. The dumplings were already a bit cold. He ate three more. This time, for some reason, maybe because of the atmosphere, his nausea was much less severe than before.\n\nAfter the meal, the group went back to reading.\n\nThe room was warm, there were novels to read, and the atmosphere was harmonious.\n\nUnconsciously, it got to be ten o'clock at night.\n\nThe oldest worker stood up, stretched, and said, \"Brothers, it's about time. Let's head back. Let's help clean up the place for him.\"\n\n\"You got it!\"\n\nThe five workers helped Zhou Ze clean the entire shop, upstairs and downstairs.\n\n\"Boss, we're leaving. Thanks for everything today.\"\n\n\"Don't mention it,\" Zhou Ze waved his hand.\n\nThey left.\n\nUnlike the girl with the Corgi from last night, who left a hundred-yuan bill after reading for a while, these men had read for a whole day and half the night without leaving a single yuan.\n\nBut Zhou Ze didn't mind in the slightest, nor did he feel any dissatisfaction.\n\nStretching, Zhou Ze was about to call Xu Qinglang over to collect the bowls and chopsticks when he walked to the noodle shop and saw Xu Qinglang sitting at a table, reading a newspaper.\n\nYes, the very newspaper Zhou Ze had given him that day.\n\nXu Qinglang was wearing a pair of gold-rimmed glasses, which gave him a rather scholarly air. A man with over twenty properties was truly something else.\n\nNo matter how you looked at him, he had class!\n\n\"The bowls and chopsticks over there, you can clear them,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Alright, I'll go right now.\"\n\nXu Qinglang took off his glasses, rubbed his eyes, and got up to go next door to clean up.\n\nOn top of the large stack of newspapers was a copy of the *Yangzi Evening News*. The date showed it was from seven days ago.\n\nThe front page headline was in large, bold, black type:\n\n**\"Residential Building Fire, A Moving Tale of Heroism\"**\n\nLast week, a fire broke out in a densely populated residential complex in Tongcheng. The fire was severe.\n\nFive young construction workers from a nearby site rushed into the building to save people without regard for the danger. In total, they rescued over twenty elderly people, women, and children. But after they charged back into the fire one last time to save more people,\n\nthey never came out again.\n\nThe front page of the *Yangzi Evening News* featured a large photograph.\n\nIt was a group photo of the five men.\n\nThey were standing shoulder to shoulder, making old-fashioned peace signs with their fingers. It seemed to be a photo taken after they first arrived at the construction site and were living in the same dorm.\n\nTheir faces were youthful yet etched with a hint of world-weariness.\n\nIn the photo,\n\ntheir smiles were a bit reserved, but also brilliant.\n\nXu Qinglang walked into the bookstore.\n\nHe looked at the five bowls of braised pork over rice sitting on the plastic stools.\n\nNot a single bite had been taken. The food had long since gone cold.\n\nIn each bowl of rice, a pair of chopsticks was stuck straight up.⁴\n\n\"My brothers,\"\n\n\"Eat well,\"\n\n\"Drink well.\"\n\nXu Qinglang murmured.\n\nOutside, the sound of firecrackers erupted.\n\nTongcheng hadn't banned fireworks. For a moment, the sky was filled with brilliant colors, exceptionally lively and festive.\n\nZhou Ze lifted his head and looked outside.\n\nHe whispered softly:\n\n\"It's the New Year.\"\n\n***\n\n**Footnotes:**\n¹ `1314` in Mandarin sounds like *yīshēng yīshì*, which means \"for a lifetime,\" a common romantic gesture.\n² `你含棒棒哦` (nǐ hán bàng bàng o) is a cutesy, almost childish slang term for \"you're awesome.\" It literally means \"you're holding a lollipop.\"\n³ `坑爹` (kēng diē) is a popular slang term literally meaning \"to scam one's own father.\" It's used to describe something that is deceptive, frustrating, or a total rip-off.\n⁴ Sticking chopsticks upright in a bowl of rice is a traditional East Asian funereal rite, as it resembles incense sticks burned as offerings to the dead.

    "content": "The sound of firecrackers rang out, bidding farewell to the old year. After the clock struck midnight, the noise of fireworks and firecrackers erupted from all directions, exceptionally lively and dense. What had been a sparse commotion now took on an overwhelming scale.\n\nZhou Ze blew on his fingernails. The clamor outside had little to do with him. He had no home—though nominally, he now had a \"home,\" he didn't want to go back.\n\nMany people, while alive, have had the thought of what they would do if they could be reborn.\n\n*To write with passion, to command the world, to scorn the marquises of yesteryear.*¹\n\nBut when you truly return from hell, you suddenly discover that your former pursuits, your old ideas, your aspirations—they're like when a kindergarten teacher asks, \"Children, what do you want to be when you grow up?\"\n\nAnd all the children answer in unison: \"Scientists, doctors, astronauts, soldiers...\"\n\nDreams are always full.\n\nAnd reality, while not exactly skeletal, is a reminder that a person's zeal is inevitably finite.\n\nSometimes, just being able to breathe, to hear sounds, to sit here and slack off a bit, to waste a little time,\n\nThis, perhaps, is what it truly means for the years to be quiet and good.\n\nXu Qinglang was sleeping in the shop again tonight. Zhou Ze heard him lock the front door.\n\nHe said he had over twenty properties, but Zhou Ze knew his parents were right there in the shop.\n\nA family should be together and complete.\n\nThis New Year, naturally, was even more important.\n\nOutside, it began to rain. A dampness started to seep in, making one feel a bit oppressed.\n\nZhou Ze's phone rang. It was his wife.\n\n\"Hello,\" Zhou Ze answered.\n\n\"Are you asleep?\" Dr. Lin asked.\n\nZhou Ze thought this was a moronic question.\n\n*If I were asleep, who would be answering your call?*\n\n*A dead person... oh, no, a ghost?*\n\nWait, that didn't seem quite right.\n\nZhou Ze leaned back slightly in his chair. An image surfaced in his mind of Dr. Lin gently poking his chest with her finger, calling him, \"You old devil...\"\n\nFor the first time, he felt how, honestly speaking, the plain truth could be so dazzling.\n\nPerhaps he was too bored, or maybe he was just idle,\n\nZhou Ze found his thoughts starting to wander.\n\nHe was thinking... a little too much.\n\n\"No, I'm not,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\n*Creak...*\n\nDr. Lin pushed open the shop door and walked in. She held a red umbrella, wore leather pants on her lower half and a white sweater on top, her hair draped over her shoulders.\n\nFor a moment, Zhou Ze forgot to put down the phone.\n\nThis woman,\n\nshe was truly beautiful.\n\nEspecially her aura, which always gave you the feeling of \"if life were only like the first time we met,\" instantly piercing a man's heart.\n\n\"Afraid I'd be lonely and cold by myself?\" Zhou Ze stood up and poured Dr. Lin a glass of water.\n\nShe was the mistress of this place.\n\nWell,\n\nto be precise, the money Xu Le had used to open this bookstore had come from her family.\n\nDr. Lin took the water and shook her head, not saying a word.\n\nThe two were husband and wife, but in reality, they were like the most familiar of strangers, stuck in a position more awkward than being platonic best friends.\n\nTaking a step forward was hard;\n\ntaking a step back was even harder.\n\n\"Let's go for a walk,\" Zhou Ze said, feeling the room was a bit stuffy. Besides, he couldn't possibly invite Dr. Lin to his sleeping quarters on the second floor.\n\nEven if Dr. Lin had taken the wrong medicine today and decided to feed her body to the tiger, the sight of the freezer on his second floor would probably make her immediately call the number of a familiar psychiatric hospital and have him sent there for some serious rehabilitation.\n\n\"It's raining,\" Dr. Lin said.\n\n\"It's a light rain, it's fine.\" Zhou Ze waved his hand, relaxed and at ease.\n\n...\n\n*Pitter-patter-patter-patter...*\n\nThe rain grew heavier. Much heavier.\n\nZhou Ze, who had initially planned to experience the \"spring rain as precious as oil\" without even taking an umbrella, was now soaked like a drowned rat. Dr. Lin still held her umbrella, standing to the side. Zhou Ze had refused her offer to share it.\n\nA bluff you start yourself, you have to see it through, even with tears in your eyes.\n\nPatting his soaking wet hair, Zhou Ze shivered. He wasn't particularly afraid of the cold; in fact, he was quite resistant to freezing. It was just that the woman beside him, though barely wet under her umbrella, was still trembling slightly.\n\nThe bus stop shelter could block most of the rain,\n\nbut the cold night wind still blew through with impunity.\n\nPetty-bourgeois sentimentality,\n\na man and a woman together,\n\nsoaked on a rainy night,\n\na beauty in distress...\n\nThis should have been a good opportunity for the two to cultivate their relationship, a perfect opening. It could even have led to an accidental discharge, a \"mistake in the flower patch,\"² and hitting the jackpot on the first try. But the two stood in mutual silence.\n\nZhou Ze lit a cigarette. Dr. Lin stood beside him.\n\nOne wanted to escape, the other was inherently resistant; naturally, they couldn't meet in the middle.\n\nA melon twisted from the vine isn't sweet, and in this case, both the melon and the vine felt awkward.\n\nIn his heart, Zhou Ze grumbled a bit at Xu Le. If that coward had just forced the issue after getting married, none of this nonsense would be happening now. Even if Dr. Lin had become a wife or was pregnant with a child, she would probably still be devastatingly beautiful, perhaps even earning a few extra points.\n\nThen he could have just gone with the flow. Why would he be stuck between a rock and a hard place like this?\n\nOf course, this complaint was rather unfair to Xu Le. If Zhou Ze himself had forced the issue that night, would Dr. Lin have desperately fought back, screaming \"indecent assault\"? And then called the police to have Zhou Ze sent to the Public Security Bureau? Accuse him of rape?\n\nThe rain continued to fall.\n\nZhou Ze dropped his cigarette butt on the ground.\n\n\"Did you drive here?\"\n\n\"I took a taxi,\" Dr. Lin replied.\n\n\"I'll see you home.\"\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\nThere was no need to dwell on how this seemingly foolish and naive New Year's Eve walk in the rain had begun.\n\nAt least, for now, both of them felt that ending it here was the most appropriate thing to do.\n\nThey hailed a ride-sharing car, and Zhou Ze and Dr. Lin got in together.\n\nFifteen minutes later, they arrived. Zhou Ze got out of the car with Dr. Lin. The driver settled the fare and drove away immediately.\n\nHome was just upstairs, but Zhou Ze and Dr. Lin didn't go up right away.\n\nThe scene was a bit like a pair of junior high sweethearts walking the girl home at night. Now it was time to say goodbye, lingering, whispering sweet nothings.\n\nBut the atmosphere here was even less rich than that of a pair of shy middle schoolers. It was like meat broth without salt or MSG—tasteless to eat, but a waste to throw out.\n\n\"Aren't you coming up?\" Dr. Lin asked.\n\n\"Not today. Let's wait a while, then we can take care of our business.\"\n\nDr. Lin understood Zhou Ze's underlying meaning. \"I'm sorry,\" she said.\n\nZhou Ze smiled, then raised his hand. He had intended to pat Dr. Lin on the shoulder, but after his hand landed, he suddenly felt an impulse and pulled her into a hug instead.\n\nDr. Lin's body stiffened for a moment, but she didn't resist.\n\nThe two drew slightly closer, but it wasn't a particularly intimate gesture. Given their relationship, it could even be called distant.\n\nShe smelled quite nice. He didn't know which brand of body wash she used, but in any case, it was very pleasant.\n\n\"I've always been curious about something. Is there someone else in your heart?\" Zhou Ze added, \"And that 'someone' could be a man or a woman.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Dr. Lin said honestly, without even a hint of hesitation.\n\nBefore, her husband had been so timid and shrinking, she couldn't bear to hurt him.\n\nNow, her husband seemed like a different person, which allowed her to shed some of her burdens as well.\n\n\"Oh,\" Zhou Ze grunted, his gaze drifting slightly upward, as if to see if his head was now sporting a certain protective coloration.\n\nHe was still a little disappointed.\n\nHe couldn't say it was love.\n\nHe couldn't say he liked her that much.\n\nHe could barely even say they were familiar.\n\nBut she was, no matter what, nominally his woman. And in the end, he'd still been cuckolded.\n\nYes, as long as you're a man,\n\nno,\n\nas long as you're a male of any species,\n\nyou probably wouldn't be too happy about something like this.\n\n\"I'm sorry.\" This was the second time she had said sorry.\n\nZhou Ze released his hands, and the two slowly separated.\n\n\"Saying sorry makes us sound like strangers,\" Zhou Ze said, leaning back against a nearby stone bollard. The rain had lightened, and there was a small eave here.\n\n\"I'll give you another sum of money. You can open another bookstore,\" Dr. Lin said, then added, \"I'm sorry.\"\n\nZhou Ze wanted to magnanimously wave his hand and say, \"I don't care about the money.\"\n\nBut then he thought about his freezer, about his future life,\n\nand Zhou Ze suddenly found he couldn't get the words out.\n\nWhat if,\n\nwhat if,\n\nwhat if this woman took him at his word, thought that giving him money was an insult, and really didn't offer any compensation?\n\n\"Let's talk in a few days,\" Zhou Ze shrugged. \"So, that guy, what's he like?\"\n\n\"He's very handsome, in my opinion,\" Dr. Lin answered.\n\n*It's a guy.*\n\n*Stab.*\n\n*Another knife wound.*\n\n*It would have been easier to accept if it were a woman...*\n\nZhou Ze felt as if the intensity of the photosynthesis above his head had grown stronger.\n\n\"There's no chance, is there?\" Zhou Ze asked a very stupid question. He regretted it as soon as he asked it, but then consoled himself: *I'm asking for the pitiful Xu Le.*\n\n*You've occupied his body, and now his wife is cheating. You have to at least help him ask why, right?*\n\n*Yes, that's it.*\n\n\"No chance,\" Dr. Lin's reply was just as quick, and just as certain.\n\nThis woman was also a surgeon. Her style of speaking was truly decisive, like wielding a scalpel—every cut hit a vital spot, no hemming and hawing.\n\nOtherwise, the patient would only suffer more. The same principle seemed to apply to matters of the heart.\n\n\"Fine, fine. I can't compare, I can't compare. It's fine. We'll each live our own lives. You should go back and deal with your parents,\" Zhou Ze said, feeling annoyed.\n\nDr. Lin nodded and turned to walk into the building's hallway.\n\nZhou Ze stood up, preparing to hail a taxi, but at that moment, an unknown number called:\n\n\"Hello.\"\n\n\"Sir, I've brought the car back.\"\n\n\"So efficient?\" Zhou Ze was a bit surprised. He recognized the voice of the driver from before.\n\n\"You left a bag on the back seat. I brought it back for you.\"\n\n\"Oh, thank you.\"\n\nThe car pulled up to the building again, and from the window, the driver handed out a woman's handbag.\n\n\"Please check it.\"\n\n\"Alright.\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't stand on ceremony. He opened Dr. Lin's bag. Inside was just a phone, a wallet, a charging cable, and a few packs of tissues.\n\nTaking out the wallet, Zhou Ze froze the moment he opened it.\n\nHis eyes were fixed on the photo slot in the wallet.\n\nThere was a photograph there.\n\nThe woman in the photo looked very young, even... naive, wearing an ill-fitting white lab coat.\n\nAnd the man to the girl's right... Zhou Ze felt a sense of unfamiliar familiarity.\n\nHe stared for a good while.\n\nOnly then did Zhou Ze realize,\n\nwasn't that... himself?\n\nIt was a cropped photo, likely from a group picture, but it had been cut down to just the two of them.\n\n\"Is anything missing?\" the driver urged.\n\n\"Everything's here. Thanks, Master Driver. You can go.\"\n\nThe driver drove off.\n\nZhou Ze continued to stare at the wallet. It didn't even occur to him that he should call Dr. Lin and tell her to come down and get her bag.\n\nSome memories, not exactly buried but certainly not often considered, began to surface.\n\nHe vaguely remembered,\n\nabout five or six years ago, he had supervised a group of students assigned to the hospital for their internship. There was a girl, her surname seemed to be Lin, and her face... it seemed to match the girl in the photo.\n\n*A girl really does change so much by the time she's eighteen.*\n\nA smile touched the corners of Zhou Ze's mouth.\n\nWho knew Dr. Lin had such an adorkable phase back then? And to think she would turn out so stunning five or six years later. He really hadn't noticed this girl's potential to blossom at all.\n\nMoreover, he had been very perfunctory about the hospital making him supervise interns back then. He had basically just used those students as \"medical grunts.\"\n\nZhou Ze shook the wallet in his hand.\n\n\"Damn it, serves you right for being single until you were almost thirty.\"\n\nThis time, surprisingly, he wasn't cursing Xu Le.\n\nHe was cursing himself.\n\n\"My eyes...\n\nwere truly blind...\"\n\nZhou Ze stretched out his arms and arched his back.\n\nThe one who cuckolded him,\n\nwas actually himself.\n\nAfter the rain, in the wee hours of the morning, on the first day of the New Year.\n\nHeh heh.\n\nHe gazed at the sky.\n\nHe very solemnly reached out and patted his own chest.\n\nZhou Ze paused.\n\nAnd said, very seriously:\n\n\"Xu Le, you truly are my good brother!\n\n*Your wife I shall care for myself; you need not worry.*\"³\n\n---\n¹ A line from Mao Zedong's 1925 poem, \"Qinyuan Chun: Changsha,\" expressing youthful, revolutionary ambition.\n² \"A mistake in a field of flowers\" (花田裡犯的錯) is the title of a popular song by Leehom Wang about an affair.\n³ A famous and cynical quote attributed to the warlord Cao Cao in the historical epic *Romance of the Three Kingdoms*. He says this to a general before having him killed, implying he will \"take care of\" the man's wife by taking her as his own. It's a classic example of dark, historical humor.",

    "content": "The air was still thick with the lingering smell of fireworks, a bit acrid, but this seemed to be the smell a New Year's ought to have—what is commonly called the spirit of the New Year.\n\nFor Zhou Ze, at this particular moment, life seemed to have gained a little more beauty.\n\nIt wasn’t some romance of eternal vows, nor was it as dramatic as \"the mountains losing their peaks and heaven and earth merging.\"\n\nIt was simply like a little kid who normally had no pocket money finding a ten-dollar bill on the street, with no passing policeman in sight, but a small convenience store right nearby.\n\nA trip through hell, a change of bodies, and still so many troubles, both discovered and undiscovered, that needed solving. His own personality had also undergone a considerable change without him even realizing it.\n\nHe thought back to himself in his previous life. After leaving the orphanage, his mind was filled with nothing but climbing the ladder step by step with his own two hands and abilities. In retrospect, the reason he had overlooked Dr. Lin back then probably wasn't just because of how dorky or plain she was five years ago. A young girl at that age should have been full of romantic notions; otherwise, she wouldn't have cut out that photo and kept it in her wallet.\n\nIt was just a pity that the him of that time had neither the energy nor the inclination to glance at the scenery along the way. His obsession was too strong, wearing an air of deep-seated tragedy while pretending to be so cool he was like a breath of fresh air.\n\nUnlike now. Having died once and come back, he felt a kind of carefree abandon and wistfulness, like the lightness that comes with having no official duties.\n\nBut no matter what,\n\nthe feeling of being secretly loved, even a \"love you even after death\" kind of feeling,\n\nwas indeed quite nice.\n\nHe made the call, and Dr. Lin came down again. She came down in a bit of a hurry, took her handbag from Zhou Ze’s hands, and smiled. She didn't say thank you; given their current relationship, saying \"thank you\" was even more inappropriate than saying \"I'm sorry.\"\n\nWith a wave,\n\nZhou Ze left her with a view of his back.\n\nTime to go back and sleep.\n\nAnd then wait for tomorrow. Tomorrow would be even better.\n\n***\n\nDr. Lin felt that her husband's mood seemed to have undergone a slight change, a sense of relief, as if a great weight had been lifted.\n\nPerhaps it was a good thing for both of them to be able to move on.\n\nRather than remaining awkwardly entangled, it was better to part ways gracefully and each face life anew.\n\nOne could only chalk it up to the unpredictability of life. Dr. Lin could never have imagined that the shell of her husband was now inhabited by another soul.\n\nThe soul of the man she, as a young intern, had naively and innocently admired.\n\n***\n\nZhou Ze hailed another car, then squatted by the residential complex gate, smoking. The phone screen persistently showed that it was searching for a ride. Zhou Ze felt a pang of regret. Why did he let that driver go? He should have asked him to wait a little longer so he could take his car back to the bookstore.\n\nAnd now look.\n\nOn New Year's Eve night,\n\nit was truly difficult to get a car.\n\nAfter waiting for about ten minutes and smoking three cigarettes, Zhou Ze started to get annoyed. He stood up straight and stretched.\n\nAlthough he wasn't particularly afraid of the cold, walking all the way back would be exhausting.\n\nJust then, a black sedan drove past on the road in front of Zhou Ze. As it passed him, it slowed down.\n\n\"Need a ride?\" The driver stuck his head out the window. He had a big, round face, was middle-aged, unshaven, and wore a black cotton-padded jacket.\n\n\"Yeah.\" Zhou Ze had no other choice.\n\n\"Hop in. I won't overcharge you,\" the driver said with a smile.\n\nZhou Ze got in the car, gave the bookstore's location, and settled on a price. The driver started the car again.\n\nThe car must be new; the seat cushions still smelled of plastic and leather, and the interior was very clean.\n\nGenerally speaking, very few people were willing to use a new car as a taxi.\n\n\"That place is pretty out of the way,\" the driver said, proactively offering Zhou Ze a cigarette. Zhou Ze took it.\n\n\"Yeah.\"\n\n\"You live there?\"\n\n\"My shop is there.\"\n\n\"Oh, business can't be good then, huh?\" Everyone knew that the commercial center was long dead, with hardly any foot traffic.\n\n\"You're not a local?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nThe Tongcheng dialect was very different from others, almost like a completely different language from Mandarin. It was easy to tell.\n\n\"I'm from Rongcheng. I work here.\" The driver lit his cigarette. \"Go on, smoke. Don't be a stranger.\"\n\nZhou Ze lit his cigarette as well, took a drag, and frowned slightly. The smoke was so faint it was ridiculous.\n\n\"Not going back for the New Year?\"\n\n\"Wife and kids are at home, everything's fine. Not going back. Figured I'd earn a bit more money.\" The driver stuck his hand out the window and flicked his ash. \"I have four kids.\"\n\n\"That's impressive,\" Zhou Ze said admiringly.\n\n\"It's tough, too.\" The driver smacked his lips. \"My wife's first was a son, the second was a boy too. I really wanted a daughter, but the third was another boy. Luckily, the fourth was finally a girl. I'm satisfied now.\"\n\n\"Nice,\" Zhou Ze echoed. He took another drag of the cigarette, then tossed it out the window. It was so mild it was like smoking a paper scroll.\n\n\"I'm not old-fashioned, and I don't favor boys over girls. I just like kids, want to have a few more, haha.\" When talking about his children, the driver became much more talkative.\n\n\"Haven't paid the fine for the youngest yet. When it's time for her to start school, I'll pay it and get her household registration sorted. By the way, what kind of shop do you run?\"\n\n\"A bookstore.\"\n\n\"How's business?\" The driver had a knack for hitting a sore spot.\n\n\"Not great.\"\n\n\"That's true. Nowadays you can buy books online, and with discount coupons too.\"\n\nUp ahead on the road, there was a car accident. Traffic police had set up a roadblock, and the original four-lane road was now down to a single lane. Fortunately, there weren't many cars on the road late on New Year's Eve, so it shouldn't cause too much of a delay.\n\n\"Getting into a car crash on New Year's, that's some bad luck,\" the driver said, blowing out a smoke ring. His tone was very much like that of a leader, tinged with a bit of criticism.\n\nZhou Ze leaned back in his seat, shifting to a more comfortable position, and asked,\n\n\"Is this car new?\"\n\n\"Yeah, my son gave it to me.\"\n\nZhou Ze smiled. \"How old are you? How old is your son?\"\n\n\"Hehe.\" The driver's eyes narrowed to slits. \"My son is promising. These days, ambition isn't tied to age. If you've got hands, feet, and a brain, and your fate isn't constantly against you, how can you stay poor?\"\n\n\"That's the truth,\" Zhou Ze nodded in agreement.\n\n\"Beep... Beep...\"\n\nA car behind them seemed to be in a hurry to get home, honking its horn frequently, urging the cars ahead to get a move on.\n\n\"Hurry, hurry, hurry. Rushing to meet the devil, are you?\"\n\nThe driver had a bit of a show-off streak in him. He leaned out of the car again and yelled at the car behind him.\n\nBut the cars behind them only honked more frequently, as if in deliberate defiance.\n\n\"Hey!\"\n\nThe driver made a show of pushing open his door, ready to get out and have a proper argument.\n\nJust then, the traffic police officer directing traffic gestured for their lane to pass through quickly. The driver sheepishly sat back down, started the car, and drove past.\n\n\"Business isn't good today,\" the driver started lamenting again. \"Should've just gone home to see my wife and kids.\"\n\n\"It's alright, I suppose.\" Zhou Ze was noncommittal. He had seen that the noodle shop next door was doing decent business. With most of their competitors closed for the holiday, even if demand was a little lower during the New Year period, business was still better than before.\n\nEspecially since Zhou Ze had just spent so long trying to hail a cab with no one taking the order.\n\n\"Hey, it's not easy,\" the driver insisted, shaking his head. \"I don't dare to rest either. The kids' school fees, got to send money home every month. I work my day job, then drive for half the night. This life is pretty dull. Can't even bring myself to smoke a better pack of cigarettes.\"\n\n*This cigarette of yours... seems to be fake.*\n\nZhou Ze took out his own pack, pulled out a cigarette, and played with it in his hand.\n\n\"But it's okay. The internet is convenient now. At night when I get home, I can have a video call with my wife and kids before bed. That's pretty good. I can see them.\" A look of relief appeared on the driver's face.\n\nZhou Ze closed his eyes slightly. He couldn't fall asleep, but right now, he didn't feel like talking or chatting.\n\nBut even without Zhou Ze's feedback or reaction, the driver continued to talk. It was New Year's, and he was a stranger in a strange land, all alone. Of course he was lonely.\n\nFrom naming his children to their schools, to his own parents, to the local customs of his village, the driver rambled on.\n\nIn the end, Zhou Ze just rested his forehead against the car window and urged, \"Driver, can you go faster?\"\n\nThis driver was driving way too slowly, maybe only thirty miles an hour.\n\nAnd this was an elevated highway.\n\nZhou Ze even suspected the man was just too lonely and was deliberately driving slowly to have someone to talk to, but Zhou Ze had no interest in playing therapist.\n\n\"Hehe, it's a new car, I'm not too familiar with it yet. Don't dare to drive too fast.\" The driver stroked the steering wheel fondly. \"This car isn't worth much, it's actually really cheap, but it's a token of my eldest son's love. I have to cherish and treasure it.\n\n\"I'll try to use this car to run fares for a few years, and after my eldest son finds a girlfriend, I'll get him a down payment for an apartment. Get one sorted out, then worry about the next. I don't want the older one to have to provide for the younger ones. That's not fair to the eldest. After all, the one who decided to have them was me, their father. As long as I can still work, still have a job, I have to grit my teeth and bear it. I'm not an irresponsible person. I wouldn't do something like have kids and not raise them.\"\n\nZhou Ze frowned slightly.\n\nHe was getting annoyed.\n\nThen he lit one of his own cigarettes and took a drag.\n\n\"Driver, seriously, I'm begging you to go a little faster.\" Zhou Ze was starting to miss his ice chest. He was also regretting not asking Dr. Lin to drive him back.\n\n\"Don't be in such a hurry, young man. It's the New Year. It's fate that brought us together, right? No need to rush. I get it, I get it. I'm an old hand at this...\"\n\nZhou Ze flicked his ash.\n\nHe accidentally missed the window.\n\nA small clump of ash landed on the inside of the car door.\n\nImmediately after,\n\nthe spot on the inner car door was burned through by the ash, leaving a hole.\n\nA hole the size of a thumb.\n\nThe cool night air whistled in through the small hole.",

    "content": "For people who don't know much about cars, buying one can be a real headache. They inevitably turn to knowledgeable friends or relatives for advice, since some cars do have their disadvantages or potential issues, whether with quality or performance.\n\nBut when you get right down to it,\n\na car door you can burn a hole clean through with a cigarette butt,\n\nyou can't just chalk that up to \"poor quality,\" can you?\n\nAll of this pointed to only one thing:\n\nThis was a…\n\npaper car!\n\nThe driver was middle-aged, but his eldest son was probably only elementary school age. And because of this, when the driver said the car was sent to him by his son,\n\nthe \"sent\" here,\n\ncould also be written as \"burned.\"[^1]\n\nThe father died,\n\nand his son burned a paper car for him.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. To be honest, he hadn't noticed beforehand. Only after getting in the car did he belatedly realize that something was slightly off, but he still wanted to play dumb.\n\nHe himself was a stowaway; he had no ambition to be some Zhang Tianshi.[^2]\n\nAt the end of the day, he was a ghost, too.\n\nIf he were to take up the banner of slaying demons and defending the righteous, he'd be no different from a Hanjian[^3]—a \"Gui-jian,\" a traitor to ghosts.\n\nHe pressed his palm over the small hole to cover it. Feigning drowsiness, Zhou Ze half-closed his eyes, pretending that nothing had happened.\n\nZhou Ze remembered that when he was in the orphanage, there was a teacher who usually led everyone in gym activities and also had a part-time job: manning the gate.\n\nAnd because his surname was Qin, the children at the time called him Gatekeeper Uncle Qin.\n\nUncle Qin was a great storyteller, and he often told ghost stories. He seemed to derive great satisfaction from the frightened expressions on the children's faces when they heard his tales. The director had spoken to him about it several times, but he never toned it down.\n\nBut before Zhou Ze left the orphanage for school, Uncle Qin passed away from a heart attack.\n\nZhou Ze remembered a ghost story Uncle Qin had once told, called \"Ghosts Carrying a Sedan Chair.\"\n\nAccording to legend, in ancient times, there were many different kinds of ghosts. Most people, after dying, went directly down to the Underworld, entered the Yellow Springs, drank Meng Po's soup of forgetfulness, and re-entered the cycle of reincarnation. Very few ghosts could remain in the mortal world.\n\nBut some ghosts did stay. They might have known they were dead, or they might not have, but regardless, they often continued doing what they did in life.\n\nFor example, sedan chair bearers.\n\nThey would appear on deserted country roads or in the dead of night, asking people if they wanted a ride in a sedan chair, offering an extremely cheap price. After the person was transported to their destination, the transaction would be complete.\n\nBut for a living person to do business with a ghost and enjoy a service provided by a ghost was never so simple. When ghosts carried a sedan chair, what they wanted wasn't mere money, but your lifespan, or perhaps your vitality and spirit.\n\nIn the underworld, ghosts carry sedans for figures like King Yama. What status does a living person have? Are they worthy?\n\nIt's like having an eighty-year-old man kneel to you—it'll shorten your life.\n\nZhou Ze remembered this story, and very clearly. In fact, Zhou Ze still remembered many of the stories Uncle Qin told; even after becoming an adult and starting work, he hadn't forgotten them.\n\nBecause Zhou Ze knew that on the day before Uncle Qin's sudden death, Uncle Qin, who had always just guarded the gate and never entered the back courtyard, made an exception and walked into the children's dormitories. He looked into each room, at each child, one by one. Zhou Ze happened to be awake at the time and saw it.\n\nIt was as if Uncle Qin knew his time was up and had come to say goodbye in advance.\n\nIt's like how if Warren Buffett farts, people will think it contains some profound financial secret.\n\nA man who could know he was going to GG the next day—the ghost stories he told couldn't really be dismissed as mere nonsense.\n\nThe driver was still chattering away, continuing to bullshit. Zhou Ze remained calm in the back.\n\nShorten my life?\n\nDrain my vitality and spirit?\n\nZhou Ze wasn't particularly afraid. He wasn't a living person; he was a ghost, too.\n\nTo put it bluntly, although Zhou Ze didn't understand the stratification and class divisions of ghosts, the fact that he could walk under the sun, interact with the living, and run a business meant he had to be on a much higher level than the lonely souls and wandering ghosts out there, right?\n\nBesides, even the faceless woman in the pool of hellish water could be injured by his fingernails. When facing other ghostly beings, Zhou Ze felt quite confident.\n\n\"These days, more and more people are buying cars and driving, and more and more of them don't follow the rules,\" the driver continued his monologue. He kept on talking even though Zhou Ze didn't respond or engage.\n\n\"When the forest gets bigger, you get all kinds of birds. All in all, if you really get angry at every single one of them, you'd probably shorten your life by quite a few years.\n\n\"Even though you know you shouldn't get angry, some people get on the road like they have a sign pasted on their forehead saying, 'Hit me! You bastard, come on and run me over!' It's really infuriating.\"\n\nZhou Ze's eyes narrowed. He felt himself getting sleepy, even wanting to sleep.\n\nBut he knew he was incapable of sleep. Therefore, this distinct feeling must be fake.\n\nZhou Ze suddenly let out a small, silent laugh.\n\nHe understood why the driver had been chattering nonstop the whole way. It wasn't that the driver didn't know he was being annoying.\n\nIt was because he hadn't fallen asleep yet, so the driver had to keep talking to pretend that everything was normal.\n\nHe was trying to make him fall asleep.\n\nAnd his own reaction to sleep-inducing effects had always been very sluggish.\n\nA smile touched the corners of Zhou Ze's mouth. He placed a hand on the car seat and closed his eyes.\n\n*Sleep, then.*\n\nThe car began to slow down.\n\nAs Zhou Ze \"fell asleep,\" the driver's voice also grew softer and softer.\n\nAt the same time, the driver specifically turned his head to look behind him.\n\nHowever, just then, a look of struggle suddenly appeared on the driver's face. Finally, he shook his head violently, sighed, and continued driving forward.\n\nIt looked like they were almost at the bookstore.\n\nZhou Ze wasn't sure how a ghost driving a paper car was able to transport him, a person with a physical body.\n\nIt was hard to explain, as physics has no \"ghost-dynamics\" branch.\n\nThen again, ancient Chinese legends speak of \"Yellow Turban Strongmen\" and \"Qi Men Dun Jia.\"[^4] It was probably something similar to those principles.\n\nZhou Ze slowly woke up, because he sensed that the body of the driver in front of him was slowly evaporating in a shimmering light.\n\n*Interesting,*\n\n*It seems I've been running into good ghosts lately.*\n\nThis driver was supposed to \"collect payment\" from him, but he couldn't bring himself to do it. It must have been his first time doing something like this, and in the end, he couldn't go through with it. In that struggle, he achieved his own release and redemption.\n\nHe began to dissipate.\n\nAfter dissipating, he would enter the underworld and begin reincarnation.\n\nFrom this, it was clear that not all the \"nonsense\" the driver had spouted was false. He had four children, he enjoyed the feeling of being a father, and he worked hard to earn money to support his family and provide a good environment for his children to grow up in.\n\nHe was a good father. In terms of character and personality, he was decent enough. After becoming a ghost, he'd wanted to try his hand at the \"Ghosts Carrying a Sedan Chair\" business, but in the end, he was too soft-hearted.\n\nZhou Ze slowly lifted his head and opened his eyes. The driver didn't notice, still absorbed in his driving.\n\nGradually, Zhou Ze saw light shining in from outside. Through the window, he could see the endless stream of traffic on the road.\n\nThe driver was about to dissipate.\n\nThis must be a memory from the driver's final moments.\n\nSimilar to the principle of how lightning, combined with a special environment, can supposedly record a scene.\n\nZhou Ze subconsciously lit another cigarette. Since the driver had already found his own release, it wouldn't matter even if he burned this whole car down now.\n\nMusic was playing in the car, a very popular song at the time called \"Liang Liang\" (Cold Cold).[^5]\n\nThe driver was humming along as he drove. He must have just finished a big fare and was in a good mood, planning to go home and treat himself to a plate of peanuts, then video chat with his kids for a while. Life was hard, but it was also pretty good.\n\nJust then, Zhou Ze saw a minibus appear on the road ahead of the car.\n\nIt must have been a school bus. It had a school emblem printed on it, along with the words \"XXX Elementary School.\"\n\nAt first, Zhou Ze didn't think much of it, but then a girl in the back of the bus suddenly stood up. She was facing the rear of the bus, and even from the car behind, he could see her clearly through the glass.\n\nThe girl was wearing a cute, blue pleated skirt.\n\nZhou Ze frowned slightly.\n\nHe knew this girl. He was the one who had saved her. He'd heard she had woken up. Just a little while ago, Dr. Lin had told him that the girl's father wanted to host a thank-you banquet and had planned to invite him.\n\nZhou Ze's gaze darkened. So, this driver was the culprit who caused that car accident?\n\nSo many children were injured.\n\nAnd if he hadn't intervened, some children would have even died.\n\n\"What a pretty little girl, just like my youngest.\"\n\nThe driver muttered to himself. This was the final memory of his life, so he had no idea there was another person sitting in the back seat.\n\nZhou Ze looked around. He didn't think the driver had been drinking, nor did he seem to have any other issues. So, what exactly caused him to crash into the school bus? What caused that accident?\n\nWas it a chain-reaction collision caused by a nearby car?\n\nAnd just at that moment,\n\nthe girl in the pleated skirt, who had been standing at the very back of the school bus, suddenly opened her mouth. Her tongue shot out.\n\nYes,\n\nit shot out,\n\nlike a red carpet being rolled out for a newlywed couple, it just shot out, long... so long... so long it made one's scalp tingle with fear.\n\nAt the same time,\n\nthe girl's eyes held a mocking smile, fixed squarely on the driver in front of her.\n\n\"Oh my god, a ghost!!!!!!!!!!\"\n\nIn his panic, the driver stomped on the accelerator, and the car shot directly toward the school bus in front of it.\n\n\"Boom!\"\n\nSparks flew.\n\nZhou Ze was standing at the entrance of his bookstore.\n\nOn the ground around him were the still-smoldering ashes of the paper car, scattering with the wind, swirling and falling, dissolving into final, fading specks.\n\nZhou Ze was unharmed, not even a scratch.\n\nAnd that driver had kept his promise, delivering him to his destination.\n\nBut Zhou Ze didn't rush back into the bookstore.\n\nIn his hand, he still held the cigarette, its embers glowing.\n\nTaking a deep breath,\n\nZhou Ze licked his lips.\n\n\"Mister, you're not supposed to smoke in the hospital, you know.\" The girl's voice still echoed in his ears.\n\nWhat...\n\nexactly...\n\nhad he saved?\n\n***\n\n**Footnotes:**\n\n[^1]: The Chinese words for \"sent\" (捎, *shāo*) and \"burned\" (燒, *shāo*) are homophones, both pronounced the same way. The author is making a pun indicating the car was a paper effigy burned for the dead.\n[^2]: Zhang Tianshi refers to the lineage of Celestial Masters of the Zhengyi school of Daoism, who were known for their power to subdue demons and ghosts. Zhou Ze is saying he has no desire to be a ghost-hunting hero.\n[^3]: A *Hanjian* is a deeply derogatory term for a traitor to the Han Chinese people, especially those who collaborated with foreign invaders. \"Gui-jian\" (鬼奸) is a clever play on this, meaning \"ghost traitor.\"\n[^4]: Yellow Turban Strongmen (黃巾力士) are divine warriors from Daoist lore.

    "content": "The next morning, after washing up, Zhou Ze went to the noodle shop next door as usual. This had gradually become a habit for him. When eating was no longer a process of enjoyment, it became purely a task. And for tasks, simple and efficient was best. There was nowhere more convenient and quick than Xu Qinglang's place.\n\n\"Bitter melon juice.\" Xu Qinglang placed a large glass tumbler in front of Zhou Ze, then brought over a serving of egg-fried rice.\n\nZhou Ze took a tentative sip. The moment the liquid entered his throat, he felt an unbearable bitterness between his lips and teeth. Then, after swallowing, it even felt like his intestines and stomach were tying themselves in knots.\n\nIt took about ten seconds for Zhou Ze to recover, letting out a long sigh.\n\nIt really was bitter.\n\n\"Haha, packs a punch, doesn't it?\" Xu Qinglang wore an expression that said, *Go on, praise me.* He then sat down across from Zhou Ze. \"Seriously, you have some heavy tastes. You can't eat without drinking this stuff?\"\n\nZhou Ze composed himself, then picked up the large, full glass of bitter melon juice and downed it in one go. Immediately after, he quickly grabbed his chopsticks and began to wolf down the egg-fried rice in front of him.\n\nA minute later, Zhou Ze finished his meal, set down the plate, and closed his eyes.\n\n\"That way of eating... the spitting image of a hungry ghost that crawled out of hell,\" Xu Qinglang teased.\n\nWhether this was just a tease or held some other meaning, it was hard to say.\n\nZhou Ze opened his eyes and glanced at him. On the day of the five migrant workers' seventh-day soul return,¹ it was normal that his sister-in-law and wife couldn't see them. But this noodle shop owner could see them; otherwise, he wouldn't have made those five servings of braised pork over rice.\n\nBut between the two of them, there was a tacit understanding of seeing the truth but not speaking it, and they had never broken the unspoken rule. Perhaps this was the best way for them to get along.\n\n\"How come you're not taking orders today?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nIn the past few days, even on New Year's Eve, Xu Qinglang's phone had been constantly buzzing with delivery orders. But today, it was much quieter, and there were no delivery drivers coming to pick up food.\n\n\"Taking a break.\" Xu Qinglang took out a pack of cigarettes, stuck one in his own mouth, and passed one to Zhou Ze.\n\nAlthough it was strange not to rest on New Year's Eve but to rest afterward, as a man who owned over twenty properties, he certainly had the capital to be willful.\n\n\"Do you know about 'ghost-carried sedans'?\" Zhou Ze asked. The events of last night were still fresh in his mind, but he hadn't rushed to do anything about them. He had simply gone home and slept in his freezer.\n\nHe had indeed saved the person himself, but if any problems arose from it, Zhou Ze didn't want to get involved.\n\nHe was just living his own little life, cautiously and with a mix of seriousness and levity. If he encountered things he could handle along the way, he would, but he wouldn't force anything.\n\nEven if there really was something wrong with that little girl in the lily-patterned dress, it was no longer his business to manage.\n\n\"Ghost-carried sedans?\" Xu Qinglang paused for a moment, then chuckled. \"Heh heh, there are probably a lot of them on New Year's Eve. They say that when everyone burns joss paper and spirit money for the New Year, the ghosts have some spare cash in hand, so they can finally afford to catch a ride.\"\n\nXu Qinglang continued his nonsense, then let out a yawn. \"By the way, why isn't your bookstore open yet?\"\n\n\"I'll open it tonight.\"\n\n\"Fine, be willful.\" Xu Qinglang took out his phone and glanced at it a couple of times. \"How about we go see a movie this afternoon?\"\n\nThe scene instantly fell into an awkward silence.\n\n\"Not going,\" Zhou Ze refused.\n\n\"See? So ungrateful. After I went to all the trouble of mixing a new juice for you, you won't even accompany me to a movie. Men... not a single one is any good.\"\n\n\"...\" said Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Sorry, I forgot I'm a man too.\" Xu Qinglang shook his head with a somewhat mournful air, as if lamenting the fact that he wasn't born a woman.\n\n\"Did you suffer some kind of psychological trauma as a child?\" Zhou Ze asked. \"I know a few psychologists, I could help you out.\"\n\nXu Qinglang scoffed with a \"pfft.\"\n\n\"Heterosexuality is just a heresy created for the sake of procreation. Homosexuality is true love.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid I can't agree.\"\n\n\"Those with different principles cannot make plans together.\"\n\nWith that, their post-meal conversation ended on a sour note.\n\nZhou Ze returned to his bookstore, opened the door, and after a moment's thought, decided not to lock it. He simply sat down behind the counter, turned on his computer, and sent Dr. Lin a message on WeChat:\n\n\"Movie this afternoon?\"\n\nAbout ten minutes later, Dr. Lin replied:\n\n\"Working.\"\n\nThe New Year didn't stop people from getting sick or having accidents. Having been a doctor himself, Zhou Ze knew that holidays at a hospital were mostly for show.\n\nIt was understandable, but still a bit disappointing.\n\nZhou Ze really wanted to tell her that he was Zhou Ze, not some damn Xu Le.\n\nBut he was worried the result would be Dr. Lin being so frightened she'd question her own sanity, and that even the hazy, one-sided crush she had might be washed away. Of course, the most important thing was that the fewer people who knew about certain things, the better.\n\nSomeone would come for him.\n\nZhou Ze was very clear on this point.\n\nAnd while he waited, he hadn't chosen to curl up and tremble in some dark corner like a sewer rat. He still needed to live, and live a very normal life at that. Otherwise, he might as well have not come out of hell and just followed the main procession down the Road to the Underworld.\n\nAs for the neighbor next door, Zhou Ze didn't know if he had figured things out, nor did he care to find out.\n\n\"Tonight, maybe.\"\n\nDr. Lin sent another message.\n\nZhou Ze smiled. He felt his smile was like a dumbass's, just like being back in middle school, seeing the class academic representative give him a shy, sidelong glance.\n\nIn his previous life, he had lived too tired a life.\n\nIn this life, he had to live a bit more freely and unrestrainedly.\n\nMany of life's great truths are only truly understood right before death or in old age, but by the time you understand them, you've already lost the chance to start over.\n\nZhou Ze cherished his present life and opportunity.\n\nA small red car pulled up on the street in front of the bookstore, and two females got out.\n\nOne was a woman under thirty, the other a girl who looked to be only five or six.\n\nThe woman wore a red dress, her hair flowing. Though she was a mother, it was hard to hide her captivating charm, which, if anything, was even more capable of tugging at one's heartstrings.\n\nThe girl wore overalls, likely with several layers of warm clothes underneath, making her bundled up like a small zongzi,² looking sweet and adorable.\n\nBut when he saw the girl, Zhou Ze's eyes subconsciously narrowed.\n\nThis was no friendly visit.\n\nHe hadn't gone looking for her, but she had come looking for him.\n\nHe had felt a bit smug when he heard from Dr. Lin that the girl had been calling for her \"uncle\" at the thank-you dinner. Thinking back now, it was clear she had no intention of letting him go.\n\nWhen it came down to it, the death of that father of four was because of this girl.\n\nThe bookstore door was pushed open. The woman looked around with curiosity, while the girl walked timidly to Zhou Ze's counter, looked at him, and said in a soft, sweet voice:\n\n\"Hello, Uncle.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded, maintaining a reserved demeanor.\n\nIn reality, he was wondering if he should just whip out his fingernails and strangle this girl to death right then and there.\n\n\"Hello, I'm Ruirui's mother.\"\n\nThe woman walked up to Zhou Ze and placed a gift box on the counter.\n\n\"Thank you for saving Ruirui.\"\n\nThe woman bowed to Zhou Ze, her gratitude deep and sincere.\n\n\"You're too kind.\" Zhou Ze still didn't get up.\n\nHe really wanted to act as if everything were normal, so the girl wouldn't suspect a thing.\n\nBut it was too difficult.\n\nEven an Oscar-winning actor, after seeing the memories of the driver's life last night, would probably find it hard to remain composed in front of this girl.\n\nSince he couldn't pull off the act, he might as well not even try.\n\n\"Mommy, I want to read here,\" Ruirui said to the woman.\n\n\"Alright, Mommy is going to get her hair done. You can stay here with Uncle and read.\" The woman smiled at Zhou Ze. \"Sorry to trouble you.\"\n\n\"No trouble.\"\n\n\"It was Dr. Lin who told me you owned a shop here.\"\n\n*Silly woman.*\n\n\"You and Dr. Lin really make a handsome couple, the man talented and the woman beautiful.\"\n\nThat was such a disingenuous thing to say; Xu Le himself wouldn't have believed it.\n\nThe woman drove off, leaving her daughter behind. This was a bookstore, after all. And since Zhou Ze was a sort of savior to her daughter and also Dr. Lin's husband, she felt very at ease leaving the girl here for a while, not worried that anything would happen.\n\nNext, Ruirui picked out an illustrated book herself and sat on a small plastic stool to read.\n\nShe wasn't noisy, nor did she cause a fuss.\n\nShe didn't ask for a drink, nor did she whine for snacks.\n\nZhou Ze just sat behind the counter, watching her.\n\nJust then, Xu Qinglang walked in. Seeing the porcelain-doll-like little girl, he immediately went over and picked her up.\n\n\"My, what an adorable little girl.\"\n\n\"Thank you, big sister,\" Ruirui replied.\n\nThe smile on Xu Qinglang's face bloomed like a chrysanthemum, growing ever more brilliant.\n\nThe little girl's flattery had scratched him right where he itched.\n\nZhou Ze, however, sat there with a somber face.\n\n\"Come out. I need to talk to you about something.\" Xu Qinglang put the child down and gestured to Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze and Xu Qinglang walked out.\n\n\"Some people from the plaza management came by. They're asking if we want to terminate our contracts. They can refund the rent we paid in advance.\"\n\n\"Let's not.\" Zhou Ze didn't want to go through another upheaval just yet. Besides, he didn't have enough capital. Even with the refunded rent, it wouldn't be enough to open a new shop.\n\n\"That's what I was thinking too.\" Xu Qinglang nodded, indicating he understood. \"Then I'll go negotiate on your behalf as well?\"\n\n\"Fine.\"\n\n\"Alright, it's settled then.\"\n\nThe two of them stood outside the shop, smoked another cigarette, and then went their separate ways.\n\nWhen Zhou Ze turned, pushed open the shop door, and walked back in, he found that the little girl was gone from the row of small plastic stools. The illustrated book was left on one of them.\n\nZhou Ze frowned.\n\nHe raised his head.\n\nAt the top of the stairs, he heard the sound of little leather boots.\n\nThe little girl emerged from there, half of her body revealed, the other half blocked by the wall.\n\nShe had just been...\n\non his second floor.\n\n---\n**Footnotes:**\n\n1.  **Seventh-day soul return (頭七回魂):** A concept in Chinese folk religion where the soul of the deceased is believed to return home on the seventh day after death.\n2.  **Zongzi (粽子):** A traditional Chinese food made of glutinous rice stuffed with different fillings and wrapped in bamboo leaves, making them look like small, tightly wrapped parcels.",

    "content": "\"You went up to look?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nThe little loli shook her head. \"It's dark up there, I couldn't see anything clearly.\"\n\nAs soon as she finished speaking, the little loli slowly walked down and stood before Zhou Ze.\n\nShe was very short and wore many layers of clothing. Her delicate face was like an exquisite work of art.\n\nBut Zhou Ze knew that her tongue could get very, very long. So long... it would make one's skin crawl.\n\n\"Uncle, I'm going to keep reading now.\"\n\nThe little loli gave a charmingly innocent smile, sat back down on the small plastic stool, picked up the illustrated children's book, and continued to read with relish.\n\nZhou Ze stood behind her, his hands clasped behind his back.\n\n*Strangle her.*\n\n*Strangle her.*\n\n*Whatever she's planning,*\n\n*There's no need to keep up this charade!*\n\nThis voice resounded in Zhou Ze's mind. It wasn't someone else's voice; it was his own.\n\nCompared to the noodle shop owner next door, Xu Qinglang, this little loli in front of him provoked a much greater sense of irritation and revulsion in Zhou Ze.\n\nHe had been the one to save her.\n\nShe was very cute,\n\nvery sensible,\n\nvery well-behaved,\n\nvery polite and reasonable,\n\npossessing a sense of propriety and discipline rarely seen in a child her age.\n\nPerhaps,\n\nit was precisely because his initial impression of her had been so very, very good that when Zhou Ze witnessed her true nature, the resulting distortion and reversal of expectations made his revulsion and rejection of her all the more intense.\n\nThe little loli continued to read her book, seemingly paying no mind to Zhou Ze behind her.\n\nZhou Ze stared at her, able to see even the fine hairs on the nape of her neck with perfect clarity.\n\n*Strangle...*\n\n*Don't strangle...*\n\n*In the end...*\n\n*To strangle or not?*\n\n...\n\n\"Dad, Mom, your son is off work today.\"\n\nIn the back room, Xu Qinglang had set out several cold dishes and hot dishes on a small table, along with two cups of alcohol.\n\nOne cup was Maotai; his old man had loved its flavor when he was alive.\n\nThe other cup was home-brewed rice wine. His mother hadn't drunk alcohol and had strongly disapproved of his father's drinking. On the rare occasion she attended a banquet where the host was overly enthusiastic, his mother would only drink a little rice wine.\n\nHis mother often said that rice wine was nourishing.\n\nOn the east and west corners of the small table, two candlesticks were also placed, their flames flickering.\n\nTwo human skins were hanging behind their respective seats, stirring as if in a breeze where there was none.\n\nXu Qinglang first toasted his father with a full cup, then took a small sip with his mother.\n\nPicking up his chopsticks, he said to his parents:\n\n\"Help yourselves, help yourselves. Dad, you're trying to snatch the meat from me again!\"\n\nHe took several pieces of meat for himself and wolfed them down.\n\nIn his memory, when he was little, his father always liked to pretend to fight him for the meat, but every time he would just make him hurriedly gobble it down until his cheeks were puffed out and he couldn't swallow.\n\nAnd his mother, at that moment, would gently pat his back while chiding his father.\n\nToday was the first day of the Lunar New Year.\n\nMost people made offerings to their ancestors before the New Year,\n\nbut Xu Qinglang was different. He did it on this day, because his parents had died together in an accident on this day.\n\nFor ordinary people, the New Year might have lost some of its so-called festive spirit¹ compared to the past, but for Xu Qinglang, it meant the return of his own heartbreak.\n\nTaking a deep breath,\n\nXu Qinglang smiled,\n\nand said:\n\n\"Dad, Mom.\"\n\nHe pursed his lips,\n\npoured himself another cup of white liquor, and drained it in one gulp.\n\nThe fiery alcohol made his already delicate and lovely face even more flushed and tender.\n\nHe was a man,\n\nyet a *femme fatale* in his own right.²\n\nIf this were ancient times, he would surely have been the forbidden treasure of many an emperor and prince. Of course, even in the modern era, if he were willing, he could have lived a life of ease and success.\n\nHow terrifying a man who could turn a straight man gay was, went without saying.\n\nAfter long hesitation,\n\nafter long contemplation,\n\nXu Qinglang couldn't hold it in any longer.\n\nHe said:\n\n\"The man next door... that man next door, I'll find a chance to ask him. Ask him... ask him how on earth he came back!\"\n\nXu Qinglang wasn't drunk, but his speech was a little slurred.\n\nClearly,\n\nhe knew in his heart that the man next door wouldn't just sit down and tell him, as if they were having a normal chat.\n\nThe process,\n\nin the end, would be somewhat unpleasant, and would require him to use certain methods.\n\nThe two human skins stopped swaying,\n\nas if in disapproval.\n\n\"Dad, Mom, it's alright. Your son will definitely bring you back to life!\"\n\n\"Clatter!\"\n\n\"Clatter!\"\n\nTwo pairs of chopsticks fell to the floor.\n\nXu Qinglang, holding his own chopsticks, froze for a moment.\n\nBut he still shook his head.\n\n\"No, I can't listen to you this time. Even if you disagree, I will pry his mouth open!\"\n\n...\n\n*Strangle,*\n\n*or not to strangle?*\n\nZhou Ze was still pondering this question.\n\nHe didn't know why he was so hesitant, nor did he understand what he was struggling with right now.\n\nHe was a ghost,\n\nno longer the doctor from his past life.\n\nHe was dangerous, and his situation was perilous. Therefore, he knew he should nip all dangers in the bud.\n\nThis little loli was a threat to him.\n\nShe had come looking for him.\n\nShe had come of her own accord.\n\nJust like that day when her soul had sought him out to speak.\n\nShe...\n\nhad probably been watching him for a long time.\n\nEven a child understood the story of the Farmer and the Snake. Zhou Ze didn't think that just because he had once saved her, everything would be fine.\n\nIn fact, most of the world's enmities evolved from kindness.\n\nThe nails on Zhou Ze's ten fingers had already begun to slowly lengthen, and at the same time, wisps of black mist were swirling around his fingertips.\n\nSimultaneously,\n\na black luster was shimmering in the depths of Zhou Ze's eyes.\n\n*I have to strangle her.*\n\n*Strangle her!*\n\nZhou Ze told himself this over and over in his mind. He had fought so hard for this new life; he still had a life, he still had things he wanted to do.\n\nHe still wanted to be lazy, to reminisce, to think.\n\nHe didn't want to be like the old and young on the Yellow Springs Road, numb and hollow, knowing only to take one step after another.\n\nZhou Ze raised his hands,\n\nand slowly approached the little loli.\n\nThe little loli was reading, very engrossed, a smile on her lips, looking very cute and lovable.\n\nSuddenly, she felt two fingers placed on her temples.\n\nShe asked, a little confused, \"Uncle?\"\n\n\"Giving you a little massage to protect your eyes.\"\n\n\"Mm,\" the little loli responded, continuing to read her book.\n\nA perfectly applied pressure emanated from her temples, and the little loli found it very comfortable.\n\nAfterward,\n\nthe little loli saw her uncle silently walk over and sit down in the chair behind the counter.\n\n\"Uncle, what's wrong?\"\n\n\"It's nothing,\" Zhou Ze said with a wave of his hand.\n\nThe little loli lowered her head and continued to read her book.\n\nThen,\n\n*Smack!* A crisp sound.\n\nThe little loli looked up and saw that one side of Zhou Ze's face, over by the counter, was bright red.\n\n\"Uncle?\"\n\n\"Killing a mosquito.\" Zhou Ze let out a long sigh of relief, then leaned back in his chair, lamenting inwardly: *Damn it, I still couldn't do it. How am I so useless?*\n\nThe little loli apparently didn't realize there were no mosquitoes in the middle of winter, but she stood up and looked around, as if helping Zhou Ze find it.\n\n*Damn it,*\n\n*keep acting,*\n\n*you've been possessed by a drama queen, haven't you!*\n\n*Still acting!*\n\n*And acting so convincingly!*\n\n*Hurry up and stick out your tongue,*\n\n*let's have a fight!*\n\n*It would be great if you killed me or I killed you.*\n\n*Still wearing that loli face. Are you banking on the fact I can't bring myself to do it?*\n\n*And I... really can't bring myself to do it.*\n\n*Fuck!*\n\nFeeling helpless, Zhou Ze turned and went into the bathroom, turned on the tap, and splashed cold water hard against his face.\n\n\"You used to be a doctor. Curing diseases and saving people was your instinct, your profession.\"\n\n\"You've already fucking turned into a ghost,\"\n\n\"why are you still such a damn bleeding-heart!\"\n\n\"Useless piece of trash!\"\n\nZhou Ze started cursing his reflection in the mirror.\n\nThen, Zhou Ze noticed that the frequency with which he cursed himself lately seemed to be higher than the frequency with which he cursed Xu Le.\n\nBut the little loli, who had been sitting in the bookstore reading, now put down her book.\n\nShe cast a deep glance in the direction of the bathroom door, but instead of walking toward it, she walked out of the bookstore,\n\nand went next door.\n\n...\n\n\"Dad, Mom, it's no use no matter how you try to persuade me. I want you to sit here and eat with me for real. If he can be like that, I can make you like that too!\"\n\n\"Our family can continue to live together, just like before.\"\n\nXu Qinglang was still rambling on.\n\nSuddenly,\n\nthe two human skins hanging by the small table began to sway frantically.\n\nA look of shock appeared on Xu Qinglang's face. He looked up at the yellow talismans pasted on the wall of his back room, only to find that for some unknown reason, they had turned gray.\n\nHe violently threw aside the curtain and rushed out.\n\nHe saw a little girl standing in his noodle shop.\n\nThe girl opened her mouth,\n\nand a long tongue stretched out.\n\nVery long,\n\nvery long,\n\nterrifyingly long!\n\n\"The Underworld has its order; the dead must be on their way.\"\n\nA grim, childish voice came from the girl's mouth.\n\nThe next moment, the two human skins in the back room began to wither and decay, losing their luster and resilience. Two streams of white gas trickled out, landing beside the little girl and materializing into the figures of a middle-aged man and woman.\n\nThey swayed unsteadily,\n\nas if they had forgotten everything,\n\nknowing only to dazedly walk step by step along the long tongue that came out of the girl's mouth, as if her tongue was their final destination, leading to some unknown place.\n\nGradually, their forms began to fade, growing more and more indistinct.\n\n\"You... you're actually... you're actually a...\"\n\nXu Qinglang pointed at the sweet-talking little loli he had held in his arms not long ago, his face a mask of shock. But when he saw his parents slowly disappearing,\n\nhe immediately tried to rush over hysterically. However, his feet seemed to be shackled, and instead of running, he fell hard onto the floor.\n\nHe reached out, pointing at his parents, and began to plead:\n\n\"Don't take them away, don't take them away.\"\n\n\"I haven't hurt anyone.\"\n\n\"I've never hurt anyone.\"\n\n\"I just want my family to be together.\"\n\n\"They never hurt anyone either!\"\n\n\"Don't, don't, I'm begging you, I'm begging you, please...\"\n\nHowever, in the face of Xu Qinglang's tearful pleas,\n\nthe little loli remained unmoved. Only after the two souls had completely vanished did she retract her long tongue and revert to her cute loli appearance.\n\nXu Qinglang felt as if two chunks had been brutally gouged out of his chest.\n\nHis parents,\n\nhad left him for good.\n\nXu Qinglang's eyes were shot with blood. He pounded the tiled floor with his fists, striking it fiercely.\n\nSuddenly,\n\nas if he had thought of something,\n\nhe immediately pointed next door and roared:\n\n\"He's not human either! He's not human either!\"\n\n\"Why don't you take him? Why don't you take him!\"\n\n\"This isn't fair! What you're doing isn't fair!\"\n\n\"He's not human either!\"\n\n\"Why did you only take my parents?\"\n\n\"He's not human either!\"\n\n\"It's not fair!\"\n\n\"It's not fair!!!!!\"\n\n---\n**Footnotes:**\n¹ `年味兒` (niánwèir) literally means \"New Year's flavor.\" It refers to the special atmosphere, traditions, and excitement surrounding the Lunar New Year.\n² `紅顏禍水` (hóngyán huòshuǐ) is a Chinese idiom literally translating to \"beautiful face, calamitous water.\" It typically refers to a beautiful woman whose allure brings ruin to a man, a family, or even a nation.

    "content": "The bathroom Xu Le had wasn't actually well-renovated. It only had a simple washbasin and a squat toilet, not even a showerhead. The second floor, let alone a bed, didn't even have a straw mat to begin with; it was purely used as a small storeroom, because the Xu Le of the past had to go home every day.\n\nEven if at home there was a father-in-law and mother-in-law who looked down on him,\n\nEven if at home there was a bossy sister-in-law,\n\nEven if at home there was a wife who didn't sleep with him,\n\nXu Le would still, after finishing the little work there was to do at the bookstore each day, lock up the shop and head home at a leisurely pace.\n\nThis was life.\n\nYou couldn't call it dignified,\n\nNor could you say it was carefree,\n\nBut he accepted it gladly.\n\nHe was a wimp, a coward, with no spirit.\n\nBecause he was Xu Le, not some great figure who had left a name in history, everyone felt it didn't matter.\n\nIf you put him in the shoes of some ancient historical figure, however, Xu Le’s life would seem like a case of great wisdom appearing as foolishness, adding layers upon layers of flavor out of thin air.\n\nZhou Ze couldn't relate to what Xu Le felt. Having grown up in an orphanage, the sense of inferiority in his heart, though never shown, had always existed. That was why he was sensitive, why he strived so hard—in his studies, his work, his own life, it was always the same. He always insisted on being the best, the most outstanding.\n\nBut right now, looking at the wet face in the mirror, a sliver of pity appeared in Zhou Ze's heart.\n\nPity for Xu Le, and at the same time, pity for himself.\n\nEveryone has their own cage. The only differences are the style and size, but a cage is there all the same.\n\nZhou Ze didn't want to become some Ghost King, nor did he fantasize about using his special powers to call the shots in the mortal world. On one hand, he knew that if he became too high-profile, something bad would probably happen to him right away. On the other hand, his previous life had been exhausting enough; he wanted to live differently this time around.\n\nRegardless, he wanted to live, to continue living in this physical body.\n\nHe spread his palm open and held it in front of him. The long nails had long since receded, showing no trace of anything unusual.\n\nZhou Ze smiled.\n\n*Forget it.*\n\n*Maybe this is just what I deserve.*\n\nHe took a towel and wiped his face, then his hands. When Zhou Ze walked out of the bathroom, the conflict on his face was gone, replaced by a kind of carefree air.\n\nThe little loli was still sitting on the plastic stool, engrossed in her picture book.\n\n\"Uncle, Rui Rui is thirsty,\" the little loli called out to Zhou Ze.\n\nLike a pet acting cute for its master.\n\nZhou Ze nodded, took a paper cup, and poured a glass of water, mixing hot and cold to a lukewarm temperature before bringing it to her.\n\nThe little loli took the cup, took a sip, and her lips curved into a crescent moon.\n\nZhou Ze simply sat down on the tiled floor, reached out, and ruffled the little loli's head, open and forthright, without the slightest bit of caution.\n\nTime slowly trickled by.\n\nThe little loli continued to read her book.\n\nZhou Ze continued to lie beside her.\n\nOne big, one small.\n\nThey got along peacefully.\n\nThe little loli would show Zhou Ze the interesting stories she read to share them with him, and Zhou Ze would respond in kind, telling her about the deeper morals in fables or other little tales.\n\nAfter an unknown amount of time, the red sedan pulled up again.\n\nThe girl's mother pushed open the door and expressed her thanks to Zhou Ze. Her hair was exactly the same as when she had arrived. A curve formed on Zhou Ze's lips; he really wanted to suggest that the woman go demand an explanation from that barbershop. You can't fool people like that.\n\nOf course, if he really said that, the woman would probably blame him for being a busybody.\n\nThe little loli bowed to Zhou Ze and said thank you, then left with her mother.\n\nFrom beginning to end, the little loli never once looked back at him.\n\nGone was gone.\n\nZhou Ze walked over to the counter and picked up the gift box the woman had left earlier, only to discover a stack of cash inside. Three thousand yuan.\n\nNot bad.\n\nZhou Ze had no intention of returning it.\n\nHe needed money. He might as well use it for now.\n\nZhou Ze felt that he had come to an understanding, like a cultivator suddenly achieving enlightenment.\n\nBut he also felt like he was just throwing caution to the wind, letting things fall apart since they were already broken. *Come what may, I'll be free.*\n\nBut no matter what, at least he felt much more relaxed now.\n\nZhou Ze casually picked up a book with a large cover from the shelf. It was an appreciation of famous calligraphers' works, the kind of thing that was purely unsellable. He had no idea if Xu Le's head had been run over by a large iron gate countless times for him to even stock this kind of book.\n\nHe flipped it open casually.\n\nThis page happened to show the four characters for \"Nándé Hútú.\"¹\n\n\"Tsk tsk.\"\n\nZhou Ze clicked his tongue.\n\n*Interesting.*\n\nHe checked the time and saw it was almost evening. Remembering that he had plans to see a movie with Doctor Lin that night, Zhou Ze decided to get something to eat first.\n\nWalking next door, Zhou Ze froze for a moment when he saw Xu Qinglang kneeling on the floor.\n\nXu Qinglang's eyes were bloodshot, and several empty liquor bottles lay beside him. At that moment, he was holding another bottle, continuing to drink.\n\n\"It's not fair... It's not fair...\"\n\nXu Qinglang muttered to himself. Even when Zhou Ze walked into the shop, it was as if he hadn't noticed him at all.\n\n\"Hey?\" Zhou Ze reached out and patted Xu Qinglang's shoulder. \"You alright?\"\n\nHe really wanted to remind Xu Qinglang that for other men, getting drunk might only mean getting robbed. But if he, Xu Qinglang, got drunk and wandered outside, it wouldn't be as simple as just losing money.\n\nIn fact, if he were lying on a street late at night next to a starlet, Xu Qinglang might be assaulted more times than the starlet.\n\nXu Qinglang's body trembled. He slowly raised his head, his face tear-streaked and pitiable like a pear blossom in the rain, a sight to evoke compassion in anyone. Posing his fingers delicately like an orchid, he pointed at Zhou Ze and said mournfully, \"Today is the anniversary of my parents' death.\"\n\nZhou Ze was silent for a moment before saying, \"My condolences.\"\n\nHe waited a bit.\n\nXu Qinglang continued to drink.\n\nZhou Ze could only remind him, \"Are you not cooking tonight?\"\n\n\"Yes! I'll cook!\"\n\nXu Qinglang stood up shakily. His slender, willow-like waist was graceful and exceptionally alluring, especially with his teetering posture, making one want to rush over and support him, to take a whiff of his fragrance.\n\n\"You don't have to force yourself.\"\n\nZhou Ze said this, but he still sat down in a chair, ready to eat.\n\nGetting a meal wasn't easy for him, so he didn't want to look for another place.\n\nXu Qinglang waved his hand and walked into the back room.\n\nSoon, the sound of the stove flaring up came from inside. Xu Qinglang was stir-frying.\n\nZhou Ze took out his phone and saw that Doctor Lin had just sent him a message, saying she was coming to pick him up soon.\n\nZhou Ze replied with an \"Okay.\"\n\nThinking it wasn't enthusiastic enough, he sent a \"laughing Paopaobing emoji.\"²\n\nThen he immediately felt it was too flippant, so he retracted the emoji.\n\nThinking that retracting it seemed like he was trying to hide something, which only made it more obvious, he replied again with a \"Heh heh.\"\n\nRight after, he felt that \"Heh heh\" wasn't friendly enough, but then he thought retracting a second time would seem too pretentious.\n\nWhat a dilemma...\n\nZhou Ze was conflicted at the dining table.\n\nThe other person, the chef currently stir-frying, was also conflicted.\n\nIn the wok was twice-cooked pork. Once it was done, he would ladle it over rice to make a plate of twice-cooked pork over rice. It was simple and went well with rice.\n\n\"Why didn't she take you, but took my parents?\"\n\nXu Qinglang muttered to himself as he cooked.\n\nAs the old saying goes, one does not worry about scarcity, but about inequality. This saying explained so many truths and also revealed the darkest side of the human heart.\n\n\"It's not fair. It's really not fair,\" Xu Qinglang continued to mutter.\n\n\"How could you be partial? How could you play favorites?\"\n\nXu Qinglang's gaze was vacant, but the rhythm of his stir-frying didn't change. He was a good cook; cooking had almost become an instinct.\n\nSilently, Xu Qinglang took out a yellow jar from the cabinet under the stove and poured some powder from it into the twice-cooked pork.\n\n\"My parents were taken away. Why didn't you go? Don't tell me it's because you saved her life?\"\n\n\"Heh, what a joke.\"\n\n\"You want to eat?\"\n\n\"Fine, I'll give you food to eat.\"\n\nXu Qinglang kept taking deep breaths.\n\n\"Is it ready yet?\" Zhou Ze called out from outside.\n\n\"Almost.\"\n\nXu Qinglang paused, a flicker of panic and hesitation in his eyes, but he still put the lid on the wok. He realized he hadn't heated up his own rice in the microwave yet, so he had to reheat it again.\n\nOnce the rice was hot, Xu Qinglang spooned the twice-cooked pork over it and carried the plate out.\n\nZhou Ze was staring at his phone screen, still conflicted. Seeing Xu Qinglang walk over, looking lost and dejected, he put the food down and said with some concern, \"In your state, you didn't forget the salt, did you?\"\n\nXu Qinglang shook his head.\n\nZhou Ze picked up his chopsticks, ready to eat.\n\nXu Qinglang's hand trembled. His lips parted slightly, and just as he was about to speak, Zhou Ze put his chopsticks down.\n\n\"What about the sour plum juice or bitter melon juice?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Oh, right.\"\n\nXu Qinglang went back and returned with a glass of sour plum juice.\n\nZhou Ze picked up the juice first, sniffed it, then took a deep breath, preparing to drink it when his phone vibrated.\n\n\"I'm here. Come out.\"\n\nZhou Ze hesitated for a moment, then put the sour plum juice down.\n\nHe knew that if he ate this meal, his face would probably be sour for a long time afterward, as if everyone around him owed him a huge sum of money.\n\n*On second thought, forget it.*\n\nCounting both his past and present lives, this was his first time asking a girl out to a movie. He should probably be a bit more composed.\n\nThere was no helping it. Originally, his quest for Doctor Lin was a beginner-level rookie mission.\n\nNow, having swapped into Xu Le's skin, the rookie mission had instantly turned into a final boss-level quest.\n\nHe didn't know whether he should be secretly pleased or miserable.\n\nWhat he had to work on now was... defeating himself? Only then could he win the beauty's heart.\n\n\"The money, put it on my tab. We'll settle it at the end of the month. I'm leaving.\"\n\nZhou Ze stood up and pushed the door open to leave.\n\nDoctor Lin's car was parked by the roadside. The window was down, and she was waiting for him.\n\nAnd inside the noodle shop, Xu Qinglang's expression flickered between pale and grim. Then, he violently swept the entire plate of twice-cooked pork over rice onto the floor.\n\nHe clutched his head and started crying on the ground.\n\nHis crying grew louder and louder,\n\nUntil finally,\n\nIt turned into dry, heaving sobs...\n\n---\n¹ Nándé Hútú (难得糊涂): A famous phrase by the Qing dynasty artist Zheng Banqiao, literally meaning \"it is a rare gift to be muddled.\" It expresses the wisdom in not being overly sharp or serious about everything, akin to the English idiom \"Ignorance is bliss.\"\n\n² Paopaobing emoji (炮炮兵表情): Paopaobing is a popular Chinese emoji character set featuring a cartoon soldier with a big green helmet, known for its exaggerated and humorous expressions.",

    "content": "Dr. Lin got out of the car, just as Zhou Ze was also walking over. The two of them had a strange sort of rapport; neither spoke, silently walking toward the entrance at the other end of the mall.\n\nThis mall was already \"dead.\" Apart from Zhou Ze and Xu Qinglang's small shop, all that was left was a movie theater and a buffet restaurant.\n\nOf course, due to the influence of the bigger picture, the movie theater was probably also operating at a loss. It was rare for anyone to go see a movie there on a weekday; you could easily buy a ticket and have the whole theater to yourself.\n\nBut since it was the New Year holiday, most people were off work. Families coming out to see a movie together had become a common sight, adding a splash of popularity that was a world away from the theater's usual arctic desolation.\n\nTo Zhou Ze, however, this liveliness felt like the final flare-up before death.\n\nThe great mansion was about to fall. This was, he supposed, a case of \"when the nest is overturned, no egg remains unbroken.\"¹\n\nZhou Ze went to buy the tickets, and also bought a couples' combo. He checked the time, and then he and Dr. Lin walked into the theater.\n\nBecause they'd arrived a bit late and Zhou Ze had bought tickets for the earliest showtime, all the good seats were gone. Zhou Ze and Dr. Lin could only sit in the first row.\n\nIt wasn't that they couldn't have waited, but there was nothing else to do in the mall. Besides, this movie, *Neon Street Detective 2*, was a 2D film, so sitting in the front row wouldn't be too bad.\n\nDr. Lin hadn't said much on the way over, and now she sat beside Zhou Ze in extreme quiet, gently crossing her long legs and looking up at the screen.\n\nZhou Ze offered her the popcorn. Dr. Lin waved her hand, indicating she didn't want any.\n\nZhou Ze sighed. For someone like him, who'd been an old bachelor in his past life, how to pursue a girl was truly an unfamiliar subject.\n\nThe movie's jokes were pretty good. Zhou Ze would laugh occasionally, and Dr. Lin often laughed too, but her laughs were soundless—very reserved, and very beautiful.\n\nBut for Zhou Ze, the atmosphere of this movie date was still somewhat different from what he had expected. A little bland, like food without salt.\n\nThe movie ended. Zhou Ze and Dr. Lin walked out side by side. It was only seven in the evening, not late at all, but once they left the theater area, the rest of the mall was already pitch black.\n\nDr. Lin remained silent, just walking along with him.\n\nZhou Ze wanted to say something but didn't know how.\n\nHe was the one who'd said he wanted to end things and say goodbye yesterday. If he acted too enthusiastic today, would she think he was a lunatic?\n\n\"Let's go to my bookstore...\"\n\n\"Let's go sit in your bookstore...\"\n\nIt seemed both of them were trying to find a way to break the current awkwardness, and they'd landed on the same idea.\n\nBack at the bookstore, Zhou Ze saw that the noodle shop had already closed. The security shutter, rarely seen down, had been pulled. He had no idea if Xu Qinglang was still inside.\n\nDr. Lin picked out a magazine and sat down in the chair behind the counter. Zhou Ze also grabbed a book and sat beside her, flipping through it casually.\n\nTwo cups of hot tea sat on the counter, steam curling up from them.\n\nZhou Ze suddenly felt he no longer had the face to mock Xu Le. He realized that to have engineered a first date this \"cultured\" and this \"respectful as guests\"² was a rare feat indeed!\n\nSo rare he felt like rewarding himself with a slap across the face!\n\n\"You're not closing now?\" Dr. Lin asked. In fact, her subtext was that she wanted to leave. After all, it was nighttime. As soon as Zhou Ze closed the shop, she could naturally say her goodbyes.\n\n\"Oh, I usually open for business at night.\" Zhou Ze didn't catch the subtext. He was telling the truth.\n\nDr. Lin was momentarily speechless. She could only smile, gently tucking a strand of dark hair behind her ear, and went back to the book in her hands.\n\n\"Squeak...\"\n\nThe bookstore door was pushed open, and two men and a woman walked in.\n\nNone of the three were very old, looking to be in their early twenties. The two men had clearly been drinking; one of them was already flushed, his entire face rosy red.\n\n\"Boss, you got any water?\" the woman asked.\n\nZhou Ze pointed to the water dispenser against the wall.\n\nThe woman went to pour a few cups of hot water and handed them to her friends, then walked up to the counter.\n\n\"How much?\"\n\nAs she spoke, she took out her phone, looking ready to scan a code to pay.\n\n\"Thirty,\" Zhou Ze answered.\n\n\"You can't rip people off like this just because it's the New Year, boss,\" the woman said with a laugh, but she still scanned the code to pay. Then she turned to her two male companions. \"Let's just rest here for a bit, look at some books.\"\n\nThey were treating the bookstore as a temporary resting spot. To them, Zhou Ze charging 30 yuan was probably like a minimum charge to enter a teahouse, which was understandable.\n\n\"Read books? What books?\"\n\nThe somewhat drunk man's voice was now loud as he called out,\n\n\"I want to read ghost stories! Horror novels! You got any in this shop?\"\n\nThe man laughed out loud to himself as he spoke.\n\nZhou Ze sighed, took out two horror anthologies from under the counter, walked over to the man, and handed them to him, casually brushing the man's arm with his finger in the process.\n\n*Hm, he's human, not a ghost.*\n\nTonight's date was already a failure.\n\nIf he made Dr. Lin experience something like the \"Night of a Hundred Ghosts\"³ with those five construction workers again, that would really be something else. Zhou Ze didn't want that.\n\n*He's human, and that's good enough.* He looked almost endearing, even if he was drunk.\n\nAs for the other two, Zhou Ze didn't try to touch them; it wouldn't have been convenient.\n\nThe drunk man sat down. His two friends, the man and the woman, also sat down on the plastic stools. The three of them played on their phones while casually flipping through the books.\n\nPurely to make it seem like they were getting their 30 yuan's worth, at least on the surface.\n\n\"What kind of crap is this ghost story.\"\n\nThe man tossed the book, and it landed right next to the water dispenser.\n\nThe woman went to pick it up and found that because she had just spilled some water while pouring, the book's cover and some pages inside were now wet.\n\n\"Boss, how much?\"\n\n\"Eighty percent of the list price.\" Zhou Ze was actually amused; these three young people were surprisingly well-mannered.\n\nOf course, Zhou Ze was hoping the drunk man would proceed to throw every book on his shelves, and get them all dirty, to help him clear his inventory.\n\nThe woman, looking a bit helpless, scanned the code to pay, then walked over to the drunk man.\n\n\"Let's go, stop going crazy.\"\n\n\"This isn't a ghost story! The person who wrote it has definitely never seen a ghost,\" the drunk man insisted stubbornly.\n\nZhou Ze let out a soft \"en.\" *Well, you probably have seen a ghost. One's right in front of you.*\n\n\"I'm not going back, absolutely not! I'm not planning on sleeping tonight!\" the man continued his drunken rant. \"I see a ghost when I go home, I see a ghost when I sleep! I'd rather just stay here in this bookstore and read all night!\n\nAt least...\n\nI won't run into any ghosts!\"\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze.\n\nAt this, Dr. Lin also put down her book and looked at the drunken man. Clearly, she found this matter quite interesting.\n\n\"Yo, Brother Liu, your house is haunted?\" the man who had come in with him joked.\n\nThe woman shot him a glance, signaling him not to talk nonsense.\n\n\"Screw you! Your house is the one that's haunted!\"\n\nThe drunk man stood up.\n\n\"Dammit! That ghost only knows how to pick on me and torment me every New Year! It ignores everyone else! There are three of us brothers, plus an older sister, plus my mom and dad and my grandpa and grandma, and it doesn't bother any of them! It only messes with me!\"\n\n\"A female ghost?\" his male companion added.\n\n\"If only it were a female ghost! It's a female... dog!\"\n\n\"Pfft!\"\n\nThe drunk man's two companions couldn't help but laugh.\n\nEven Zhou Ze and Dr. Lin lowered their heads and coughed a few times, but it was genuinely funny.\n\nEspecially the utter grievance on the drunk man's face when he said it wasn't a female ghost, but a female... dog.\n\n*My heart is breaking,*\n\n*I'm drunk and I need to pour my heart out!*\n\n\"Every New Year, for those few days, it comes looking for me! As soon as I fall asleep, it shows up! Crap!\"\n\nThough the drunk man was ranting, he was still in control. He didn't seem scary, but rather quite amusing.\n\n\"It's been doing this for seven years now! Every New Year's, it shows up right on time—more punctual than my parents giving me my New Year's money!\" The man clutched his head and squatted right on the floor, starting to cry. \"Damn it, I can't live like this anymore!\"\n\n\"What really happened? That dog, did you know it?\" his male companion asked.\n\n\"It was a dog our family used to have. It pulled out the money my dad kept under his bed and chewed it to pieces, so my brothers and I killed it and we ate the meat.\"\n\n\"The dog must have been holding a grudge and came back for revenge,\" his companion analyzed.\n\n\"But what I fucking don't get is why it only comes for me! When we killed the dog, it was me, my older brothers, my dad, and my grandpa!\n\nWhen we ate the dog meat, the whole family ate it together, just treated it as an extra dish for the New Year!\n\nThat dog destroyed five thousand yuan, it deserved to be eaten!\n\nBut why does it only hate me?\"\n\nThe drunk man practically cried, \"I asked them! My brothers, my dad, my grandpa—nothing's happened to them! Why is it fixated only on me?\"\n\n\"You're drunk. Let's go, I'll take you home.\" The woman helped the man up and gestured for her male companion to help.\n\nThe group left the bookstore.\n\nThe previous liveliness instantly vanished, replaced by quiet.\n\n\"What do you think? Why?\" Dr. Lin asked Zhou Ze, not caring if it was true or not, she was simply making small talk after hearing a story. \"Why does the dog only torment him? Is there something different about him?\"\n\n\"You're very interested in this?\" Zhou Ze asked, a little surprised.\n\n\"Mm-hmm,\" Dr. Lin nodded.\n\nZhou Ze smiled. \"Actually, it's very simple. To understand its thinking, you first have to put yourself in the dog's place.\"\n\n\"How so?\" Dr. Lin said, suppressing a smile. \"That's pretty hard to do.\"\n\nRight, how could a person put themselves in a dog's mind?\n\n\"The ghost of a dog comes back for revenge, to torment someone, because it holds a grudge,\" Zhou Ze explained. \"That should be the same as with people.\"\n\n\"Then why doesn't it go after the other family members for revenge?\"\n\n\"Perhaps, it's because of the money. The dog was mischievous and tore up some of it, but it's possible that this guy, who wasn't very old back then, stole some of it himself.\n\nSo the dog feels it's deeply unfair. It tore up the money and was punished—killed and eaten. It feels that's justified, that it had it coming.\n\nBut why...\n\ndid that person, who also stole money and made some of it disappear, get away with it completely?\n\nSo it can't accept it. It doesn't take revenge on the rest of the family; it specifically goes after him.\"\n\nDr. Lin shook her head, looking a little surprised. \"It was just a drunkard's rambling story, but after your analysis, it almost sounds like it really happened.\"\n\nZhou Ze walked over to where the group had been sitting and noticed a wallet on the floor. He picked it up and walked to the shop entrance.\n\nJust then, the female companion came jogging back.\n\n\"Excuse me, did we leave a...\"\n\nZhou Ze handed her the wallet.\n\n\"Thank you so much!\" The woman bowed to Zhou Ze to express her gratitude. \"If this guy lost his wallet and ID on his way home tonight, his family would chew him out again.\"\n\n\"No problem,\" Zhou Ze said with a wave.\n\nShe waved back at Zhou Ze, then turned to chase after her friends up ahead.\n\nUnder the moonlight,\n\nas the woman ran,\n\nfrom beneath her coat,\n\nit looked as if a fluffy yellow tail was swaying gently............\n\n***\n\n¹A Chinese idiom (覆巢之下，安有完卵) meaning that when a group or entity is destroyed, no individual within it can escape unharmed.\n\n²A Chinese idiom (相敬如賓) describing a relationship, especially between a married couple, that is polite and respectful but lacks intimacy, as if they were interacting as formal guests.\n\n³A reference to a traditional Japanese and Chinese parlor game (百物語怪談会) where participants tell ghost stories.

    "content": "Zhou Ze felt his eyes must be playing tricks on him. After just hearing a drunkard's ghost story about a dog, coupled with the dim streetlights, it was normal for his vision to blur.\n\nYes, that must be it.\n\nZhou Ze was no Zhang Tianshi of Mount Longhu; he knew he was still a bit of a pushover. He couldn't change himself—otherwise, he would have extended his own fingernails to choke that little loli during the day.\n\nAs for whether the end result would be him being choked to death by the little loli or him *still* being choked to death by the little loli,\n\n...that was anyone's guess.\n\nSince he couldn't change himself, he might as well try to be less affected by all this damn trouble. The things he saw, he'd dodge if he could, or just cover his eyes if he couldn't.\n\nAnyway, that dog had been toying with that man for seven years. Counting the years,\n\nit was about time for the seven-year itch.\n\nIf that dog really meant to harm someone, it would have done so long ago. As for what kind of trouble it would stir up next, Zhou Ze didn't care.\n\nThe woman had come to his store, bought some water, and compensated him for the book. She paid readily. That was a point of good karma, and that was enough.\n\nHowever, Zhou Ze was discovering for the first time that there were quite a few匪夷所思 (unimaginable) things in this world. Perhaps it was because he used to be a person, and now he was a ghost. Different circles, so naturally a different perspective on the world.\n\n\"What's wrong?\" Dr. Lin had also walked over to the shop entrance by this time.\n\nZhou Ze smiled. \"I'm glad I'm not like Spider-Man, without some random elder relative suddenly popping up to tell me:\n\n'With great power comes great responsibility.'\"\n\nDr. Lin didn't understand what that meant, but she still said, \"I should be heading back.\"\n\nIt was getting late; she really should be going.\n\n\"You're not staying a little longer?\"\n\n\"I might have to be on duty tomorrow,\" Dr. Lin said, tying her scarf.\n\n\"You can reschedule,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"It's not convenient.\"\n\n\"You're not willing?\"\n\nDr. Lin frowned slightly. This was the first time she had sensed such an aggressive feeling from Zhou Ze, and she was somewhat at a loss.\n\n\"You're my wife,\" Zhou Ze said, looking into Dr. Lin's eyes very seriously.\n\nDr. Lin took a small step back. \"Yesterday, you said...\"\n\nThe Zhou Ze of yesterday had just said it was over, that they would both be free.\n\n\"Yesterday was yesterday.\" Zhou Ze took half a step forward. \"Before I've signed the divorce papers, I am your husband, and you are my wife. So, I want you, right now, to stay and keep me company a little longer!\"\n\nZhou Ze's voice grew louder.\n\nDr. Lin said nothing, standing rooted to the spot.\n\nA nameless rage suddenly surged within Zhou Ze.\n\nHe reached out, pinched Dr. Lin's jaw, and made a frivolous gesture of lifting her chin.\n\nDr. Lin looked at him, her gaze clear and calm. Her crimson lips, especially, were mesmerizing. She was beautiful, truly beautiful—the kind of beauty where exquisite features combined with a perfectly fitting temperament, giving one a very comfortable feeling.\n\nZhou Ze lowered his head and kissed her directly on the lips.\n\nHe kissed her fiercely, brutally, like a savage beast whose vicious nature had been completely unleashed from within! And the woman before him was the object of his taking.\n\nDr. Lin raised her hand, as if preparing to slap the man in front of her, but halfway up, she slowly lowered it again.\n\nFrom the corner of her eye, a crystalline teardrop trickled down.\n\n\"What are you crying for?\"\n\nTheir lips parted.\n\nZhou Ze looked up at Lin Wanqiu.\n\n\"You think your crying will make me feel guilty? You think your crying will make me stop?\n\nI'm telling you,\n\ncrying won't do you any good today. You are my wife, and I am your husband!\n\nLook at your parents! What kind of trash are they? Look at your sister, the way she usually looks at me!\n\nAnd then look at you.\n\nYou're noble,\n\nyou're cold and glamorous,\n\nyou're a goddess,\n\nyou're above the mortal world!\n\nIn the bedroom, you even sleep in a separate bed from me!\n\nYou're married, you're a wife now, yet you still hypocritically care about your chastity. Take a look at yourself, are you even worthy of it anymore!\n\nI know, I'm just a fucking idiot. In your whole family's eyes, I'm just a good-for-nothing and a fucking idiot!\"\n\nZhou Ze grabbed Dr. Lin's neck with one hand, pushed her against the counter, and then pulled off her coat.\n\n\"Today, I'll teach you! I'll show you what a wife is supposed to do!\"\n\n\"Xu Le...\" Dr. Lin didn't resist. She just stared coldly at Zhou Ze. \"You... bastard...\"\n\n\"Heh heh.\" Zhou Ze just smiled, completely unconcerned. He then took off his own jacket and pressed Dr. Lin down onto the counter.\n\nHe was rough, he was tyrannical.\n\nAt this moment,\n\nthe dry firewood was already stacked; all it needed was a tiny spark to burst into a raging fire.\n\nZhou Ze was that bundle of firewood!\n\nShe smelled so good, her skin was so soft, her body so voluptuous. Everything, everything was so wonderful, so intoxicating.\n\nBut just then, Zhou Ze suddenly froze, stumbling back a few steps.\n\nBefore him, Dr. Lin lay on the counter, her blouse in disarray, while Zhou Ze himself was panting heavily.\n\nNo,\n\nHow did it turn into this?\n\nDr. Lin was still lying on the counter. Her eyes were still open; she still hadn't resisted.\n\nShe felt guilty toward Xu Le. She was a very independent and strong woman, but her social environment and the family education she had received since childhood left her in a constant state of conflict.\n\nHer parents had threatened her with their own deaths, desperate for a grandchild to be born soon, which forced her to agree to marry Xu Le. Yet she held fast to her own bottom line, her heart belonging to another man—even though that man had died in a car crash half a year ago, even though that man might have long forgotten her, or perhaps never even knew that a woman like her had been secretly watching him for years after her internship ended.\n\nTo put it in the critical style common in middle school textbooks: Dr. Lin had chosen to yield to feudal conventions in her life, yet she was unwilling to continue living that way, still holding onto her own principles and resistance in her heart.\n\nThis was why, despite being ten thousand times unwilling, Lin Wanqiu still didn't resist and had allowed Zhou Ze to do as he pleased just now.\n\nShe felt she had no reason to resist. Zhou Ze was her husband, and she was well aware that her actions since their marriage had wronged her husband and their marriage.\n\nShe did not accept it, did not consent to it,\n\nbut she did not resist.\n\n\"Get your clothes on! Put your clothes on!\"\n\nZhou Ze roared at Lin Wanqiu, who was still lying on the counter.\n\nLin Wanqiu froze for a moment, then stood up straight, looking at Zhou Ze in disbelief. Just a moment ago, she had already resigned herself to her fate.\n\n\"I haven't even done anything to you yet, so don't act like you were just violated. Get your clothes on for me!\n\nNow!\n\nImmediately!\n\nRight this instant!\n\nAnd then get out!\"\n\nDr. Lin silently put her clothes back on, then straightened the hem in front of a mirror. She was expressionless. When she was done tidying up, she poured Zhou Ze a fresh cup of hot water and placed it on the counter. Then, without even glancing at Zhou Ze, she walked straight out of the bookstore.\n\nZhou Ze sank dejectedly to the floor, somewhat dazed, somewhat baffled.\n\nOn his lips and in his palms, her warmth seemed to linger. He didn't know why he had stopped, nor did he understand why he hadn't continued.\n\nIt felt so good,\n\nIt was something he yearned for,\n\nIt was so intoxicating,\n\nBut for some reason, he felt something was wrong. It seemed... this wasn't the feeling he wanted.\n\nHe was just about to sleep with her.\n\nShe had agreed to it.\n\nBut that scene just now was completely different from what he had wanted.\n\nZhou Ze staggered to his feet. He picked up the teacup, took a sip, and then spat out the hot water. The water was scalding, not tempered with the slightest bit of cold water.\n\nTossing the cup aside and letting the water soak the floor, Zhou Ze looked around, recalling his actions and replaying the words he had just said.\n\nHis fists clenched, then relaxed, only to clench tight once more.\n\nHe went to the washroom, turned on the faucet, and stuck his head directly under the running water to rinse it.\n\nHe needed to calm down, to find his peace.\n\nNot just to quell the fire in his body, but also the one in his heart.\n\nThe shock of cold winter water was not something an ordinary person could endure. Zhou Ze lifted his head, feeling a wave of dizziness wash over his mind.\n\nHe looked at the mirror before him.\n\nIn the mirror, his own face was reflected.\n\nZhou Ze gripped the porcelain edge of the sink, panting nonstop. Then, he slowly raised his head again, and as if muttering to himself, said:\n\n\"It was you!\n\n\"It was you, you damned son of a bitch, you useless loser!\n\nYou're influencing me, you're trying to control me!\n\nYou piece of trash, you scum, you mutt!\"\n\nZhou Ze cursed at his own reflection in the mirror.\n\nYes,\n\nthat wasn't him. His behavior just now had been too abnormal. That nameless, rising fire, that unreasonable stupor, that inexplicable impulse—\n\nit was definitely more than just a young man's virility.\n\nJust a moment ago, at that very instant,\n\na guy he thought had long since gone to hell, had long since ceased to exist in this world,\n\nhe had influenced him.\n\nHe hadn't left.\n\nHe was still hiding somewhere near him.\n\nEven...\n\nHe was hiding inside his own body!\n\nHe was a good-for-nothing, he was weak. He had been scorned his whole life, never daring to resist, never having the courage to raise his head. But after death, cowering in a corner, he wanted to use someone else's hands to take revenge on his wife in the simplest, most brutal way!\n\nUsing another person's strength to get back at his own wife.\n\n\"I used to feel sorry for you, felt a little bit bad for you,\" Zhou Ze murmured. \"Now I understand. The pitiful always have their detestable side. The fact that you lived your life the way you did, I can only say you deserved it!\"\n\n*Crack!*\n\nZhou Ze raised his fist and smashed it directly into the mirror.\n\nThe mirror shattered.\n\nZhou Ze's palm was streaming with blood, which began to drip into the sink.\n\nOn the fragmented shards of the mirror,\n\nZhou Ze's face was still reflected.\n\nNo,\n\nit was Xu Le's face.\n\nZhou Ze stood there without moving.\n\nThe person in the mirror didn't move either.\n\nBut in the next moment,\n\na glint of sinister malice appeared in the eyes of the person in the mirror, who then spoke:\n\n\"Well now. You found me out.\"",

    "content": "\"You are... courting death.\"\n\nA black luster surged in the depths of Zhou Ze's eyes. At this moment, he was furious.\n\nYes, he was a cuckoo in another's nest.\n\nBut,\n\nso what!\n\nI'm going to use your body to keep on living, can you stop me?\n\nYour revenge,\n\nis merely to suddenly provoke me into forcing myself on your wife?\n\nIs that all you've got?\n\nZhou Ze spread his right hand open. Black fingernails slowly grew out, wreathed in wisps of black mist.\n\nOften, the true solution to a problem depends on where you sit—that is, your standpoint.\n\nFrom Zhou Ze's standpoint, there was simply no way to distinguish right from wrong. He wanted to live. As long as any action was based on this premise, it was correct. Otherwise, everything lost its meaning.\n\nIf it loses its meaning, is there any need for right or wrong to exist?\n\n\"No matter where you're hiding, I'll drag you out, even if... you're hiding in this body!\"\n\nZhou Ze's face began to contort. His fingernails started to dig into his own chest.\n\n\"Hiss...\"\n\nIntense pain was accompanied by an uncontrollable twitching. Zhou Ze's whole body trembled, and he collapsed to his knees.\n\nHe opened his mouth,\nlooking somewhat dazed.\n\nNot here.\n\nHe's not here at all!\n\nWhy,\n\nhe had just verified at the risk of nearly shredding his own soul. Inside this body, there was one and only one soul—his, Zhou Ze's. Xu Le simply didn't exist!\n\nZhou Ze crawled back to his feet. In the shattered mirror, his own face was still reflected. This time, he waited a long while, but the person in the mirror showed no change at all.\n\nXu Le was long gone.\n\nThen, everything I did to Dr. Lin before, was that driven by my own nature?\n\nNo,\n\nthat's impossible,\n\nImpossible!\n\nIt can't be like that.\n\nFor the first time, Zhou Ze felt that the person in the mirror was so unfamiliar—not because he had changed bodies and faces, but because his own heart, his own soul, seemed to be, compared to his original self-perception,\n\nfundamentally different.\n\nThe body and the soul, which one is the real me?\n\nFrom ancient times to the present, many great poets and thinkers, both at home and abroad, have actually given a similar answer: the flesh will change, it will decay, but the soul can be eternal.\n\nIt can be noble, it can be remembered, it can shine brightly throughout the long river of history.\n\nZhou Ze also believed that he was still Zhou Ze, still his original self. Right now, it was merely his body that had changed, but he still considered himself to be Zhou Ze.\n\nNow,\n\nhe began to feel fear.\n\nBecause since Xu Le's soul was long gone,\n\nthat meant...\n\nthe one who had changed... was himself?\n\n...\n\n\"You go to bed, dear.\"\n\n\"Okay, I'll take our daughter to rest first. You finish up soon and get some rest too.\"\n\n\"Alright, as soon as I finish revising this treatment plan.\"\n\nWang Ke gently twisted his neck and yawned. He was indeed very tired, but the work at hand had to be finished. Though only in his early thirties, he already had a lot of white hair on his head.\n\nMen of this age are in the most awkward position. If you don't strive, it's too early to retire. If you do strive, your body has already started its slow decline.\n\n\"Ding dong... ding dong...\"\n\nWang Ke frowned slightly. Someone was visiting this late?\n\nHe walked to the entryway and glanced at the man in a black jacket standing outside on the video monitor. He asked, \"Excuse me, who are you?\"\n\n\"I'm looking for Wang Ke. A friend introduced me.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, if you have business, you can make an appointment with my assistant. At home, I generally...\"\n\n\"Zhou Ze sent me,\" the man outside said.\n\nHearing this name, Wang Ke paused, then opened the door.\n\nThe man looked a bit young, maybe twenty-five at most.\n\n\"Come in.\" Wang Ke gestured for him to enter, personally brewing him a cup of tea and placing it on the coffee table.\n\nZhou Ze sat on the sofa, looking at his old friend.\n\nHe hadn't changed, still striving in his profession. As children who grew up together in an orphanage, they had been close since they were young. And in the old director's eyes, the two of them were the most promising of the children who had left the orphanage in recent years.\n\nZhou Ze had become a deputy director at the hospital at a young age, while Wang Ke already had his own psychological clinic—not some small shop in a cramped location, but one right next to South Street, the heart of downtown Tongcheng.\n\nEven this villa was something no ordinary person could afford.\n\n\"You know Zhou Ze?\" Wang Ke asked first.\n\n\"Yes, he's been dead for half a year,\" Zhou Ze replied, then picked up the teacup and took a sip. He still liked Maojian tea; his taste hadn't changed.\n\n\"What can I do for you?\"\n\n\"I need to see a doctor.\"\n\n\"See a doctor?\" Wang Ke coughed. \"You can make an appointment.\"\n\n\"It's urgent.\" Zhou Ze looked into Wang Ke's eyes. \"Very urgent.\"\n\nWang Ke fell silent, then smiled and nodded. He stood up and said, \"Please come with me to the study.\"\n\nRegardless of whether the man's sudden visit was impolite, or whether his request was abrupt, since he claimed to be Zhou Ze's friend, Wang Ke had no reason or way to refuse.\n\nZhou Ze sat properly in Wang Ke's study for a while. Wang Ke returned, having changed into a white outfit, a sign of his seriousness.\n\n\"Tell me about your situation.\" Wang Ke twirled a pen in his hand. It was a dark gold fountain pen, very eye-catching under the study's light.\n\nZhou Ze slowly shook his head. \"Don't try to hypnotize me, not even shallow hypnosis.\"\n\nWang Ke nodded and put down the pen.\n\n\"I might have... a split personality,\" Zhou Ze said, choosing his words carefully.\n\n\"Be more specific,\" Wang Ke asked.\n\n\"It feels like there's another person's personality inside my body. To be precise, at certain moments, that person's temperament will suddenly influence my actions, and I can clearly sense that those are definitely not things I should be doing. I've always... been a very self-disciplined person.\"\n\n\"Signs of a split personality?\" Wang Ke's eyes narrowed. \"How long has this been going on?\"\n\n\"Just recently.\"\n\n\"How about this? On this piece of paper, draw your second personality. Just go with your gut feeling and draw what he looks like, even if you've never seen his true appearance.\"\n\nWang Ke pushed a sheet of white paper and the fountain pen in front of Zhou Ze.\n\n\"The second personality?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" Wang Ke nodded.\n\n\"But... strictly speaking, I *am* the second personality.\" Zhou Ze pointed at himself. \"The one causing trouble now should be this body's original personality.\"\n\nWang Ke's gaze sharpened, and he began to re-examine Zhou Ze.\n\n\"You're saying that your current state *is* the second personality?\"\n\n\"Using your theory to describe it, that should be it,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\nThe original owner of this body was Xu Le, and Zhou Ze was the outsider. Therefore, Zhou Ze was the second personality.\n\n\"You've already killed him?\" Wang Ke asked with great interest. He seemed... somewhat excited.\n\n\"I suppose so. And I'm certain he's gone,\" Zhou Ze answered.\n\n\"Then what you did is technically murder,\" Wang Ke reminded him. \"Although legally, this kind of act can't be judged, and its nature can't be defined, I still have to sit here and condemn you.\"\n\n\"And after the condemnation?\"\n\n\"You came to me to find a way to completely rid yourself of the first personality's influence?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nWang Ke began to twirl the pen again, this time not for hypnosis, but because he was thinking.\n\n\"I don't know if I should help you, because from my perspective, you killed a 'person' who originally existed. And if I help you, it would be helping you destroy the evidence, making me an accomplice.\"\n\n\"Help me,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"I need to think about it,\" Wang Ke said, deliberating.\n\n\"No need to think. Help me,\" Zhou Ze urged. Then, he added, \"Brother Erdan.\"¹\n\nWhen the name \"Brother Erdan\" was spoken, Wang Ke's expression changed abruptly. He said with some surprise, \"Zhou Ze even told you that?\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\nWang Ke looked up, appearing conflicted, but he gritted his teeth and began writing a prescription.\n\n\"I'll prescribe you some medicine. These are really just for support, to help you stabilize your mood and aid your sleep.\"\n\n\"Then there's no need to prescribe them,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"The most important step is that you need a change of environment.\" Wang Ke ignored Zhou Ze's previous words and continued after writing the prescription, \"Break away from the social circle your first personality originally lived in and reconstruct your own. Many people think that a person's thoughts reside only in the soul—although whether souls, or ghosts for that matter, truly exist in this world is still unknown. But that statement itself is inaccurate. In fact, our body, our muscles, our eyes, including many other organs, can also store a person's 'soul.' This 'soul' is different from the soul in the broader sense. It refers to things like the 'muscle memory' developed by athletes through countless repetitions, as well as 'psychological suggestions' and so on. You can think of it as a kind of inertia. You are the second personality who killed the first personality, but this body, after all, was operated by the first personality for a very, very long time. It has its own inertia, its own memories. The reason you sometimes suddenly make baffling choices that leave you shocked and surprised afterward, creating the illusion that the first personality still exists and is causing trouble, is because of this. First, sever all your current interpersonal networks and build your own social circle. Let this body begin to re-adapt to you, to counteract the previous inertia, and the problem will be solved. Actually, your current situation isn't serious. Your logical thinking is very clear. Overcoming it is just a matter of time.\" Wang Ke smiled.\n\nAt that moment, there was a knock on the study door.\n\n\"Dear, do we have a guest?\"\n\n\"Yes, bring us two more cups of coffee.\"\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\nZhou Ze thought of Dr. Lin, of his parents-in-law, of that sister-in-law.\n\nIndeed,\n\nin the beginning, he had rejected that person's social circle, even wanting to cut ties long ago.\n\nBut he didn't know when it started,\n\n*she won't sleep with me anyway,*\n\nthat it became an obsession of his.\n\n\"How long will it take to sever the ties?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"It won't take long.\" Wang Ke shrugged, looking very relaxed. \"I've been observing you since you walked in. The feeling you give me, how should I put it... You are the second personality, but I think you're the most thorough case I've ever seen of a second personality killing the first. It's like... borrowing a corpse to resurrect a soul from ancient tales of the strange and supernatural. It's very clean, very neat, you could even use the word 'perfect' to describe it. Right now, you can think of it as a mild side effect from a medicine you took. You can completely overcome it with your own immune system. Maybe just two or three months. After that, you can pick up your old relationships again without any problem.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded. \"Thanks.\"\n\n\"You're welcome.\"\n\n\"Coffee's here.\"\n\nThe study door was pushed open, and a woman walked in carrying two cups of coffee, placing them on the desk.\n\nZhou Ze looked at the woman, and the woman looked at Zhou Ze.\n\nThe next moment,\n\nZhou Ze's heart suddenly stirred, and the woman's expression also changed abruptly.\n\n\"What, you two know each other?\" Wang Ke asked.\n\n\"Yes, he's Dr. Lin's husband, Xu Le,\" the woman replied.\n\n\"Ah?\" Wang Ke stood up in surprise.\n\nHe came over to shake Zhou Ze's hand to express his gratitude.\n\nA moment ago, the man before him was a patient introduced by his deceased best friend. Now, he was also the savior of his own daughter. The relationship had naturally grown one level closer.\n\nZhou Ze responded perfunctorily, his mind actually wondering whether he should warn this best friend of his, who was so devoted to his career, that his wife was recently very engrossed in the indescribable activity of \"getting her hair permed.\"²\n\nAfter thinking about it, he decided it was best to warn him anonymously after leaving. Although the two of them, knowing each other's personalities after starting their careers, had both thrown themselves into their work and thus didn't disturb each other, the friendship and childhood memories hadn't changed. They never had the habit of just getting together for a drink or tea to chat when they had nothing to do. In fact, if not for this rather tricky problem, Zhou Ze wouldn't have come looking for Wang Ke.\n\nHe was married, Zhou Ze didn't know. He had a child, Zhou Ze didn't know. But when help was needed, just mentioning his name was enough for the other to agree.\n\nWang Ke and his wife walked Zhou Ze to the door. Zhou Ze declined Wang Ke's kind offer to drive him home.\n\n\"Dear, what did he come to you for?\"\n\n\"To see a doctor,\" Wang Ke replied. \"You said he runs a bookstore?\"\n\n\"Yes, a bookstore that's sort of like a tea party venue.\"\n\n\"Alright then, I'll go check it out when I have the chance.\"\n\n...\n\nJust as Zhou Ze walked out of the villa's premises,\n\nhe suddenly felt something, stopped in his tracks, and turned to look back at the villa.\n\nOn the villa's balcony,\n\nstood a little girl.\n\nShe was hugging her white teddy bear, wearing red pajamas, standing outside in the wind.\n\nHer hair stirred, her nightgown fluttered, yet she remained perfectly still, seemingly unaware.\n\nBut that pair of eyes,\n\nwas fixed upon him.\n\nAt first, Zhou Ze's expression was grave, his body a little tense.\n\nBut slowly, the tension began to fade. The pressure of Xu Le's matter on his mind had also been eased by their recent conversation. Zhou Ze felt very relaxed.\n\nHowever, what troubled Zhou Ze a little was,\n\nit seemed he didn't just have to warn his best friend about his wife's problem,\n\nhis daughter,\n\nseemed to have a problem too.\n\nSilently, in the bottom of his heart, Zhou Ze felt for his best friend,\n\na pang of pity.\n\nWhat sins did he commit in a past life to deserve such a \"happy and perfect\" family?\n\nAt this thought, a bitter smile appeared on Zhou Ze's lips.\n\nThe next moment, facing the little girl's gaze on the distant balcony,\n\nZhou Ze raised his hand,\n\nwaved in that direction,\n\nand said:\n\n\"Hi.\"\n\n***\n**Footnotes:**\n¹ *Erdan Ge* (二蛋哥): A rustic and affectionate childhood nickname. \"Ge\" means \"older brother.\"\n² *\"getting her hair permed\"* (燙頭髮): This is used euphemistically, as a slang term for having an affair.",

    "content": "Leaving the villa district, Zhou Ze didn't rush to hail a cab. Instead, he decided to take a walk alone on the night road.\n\nWang Ke had said his side of things wasn't a big problem; he just needed to sever Xu Le's old network of connections. Of course, at this point, it was practically severed already.\n\nAfter the way he had treated Dr. Lin, Zhou Ze figured she wouldn't be speaking to him for some time. As for his in-laws, he hadn't been back for several days either.\n\nThe only potential complication was his own bookstore, since the money to open it had come from his wife's family.\n\nHe'd just let things be for now. He needed some time to cool down anyway.\n\nUp ahead was a footbridge. Zhou Ze walked up and sat down on one of the steps, took out his phone, and scrolled through it casually.\n\nAs chance would have it, Zhou Ze opened that live-streaming app. Xu Le had followed many gaming and \"good-looks\" streamers, but Zhou Ze wasn't very interested in any of them. Scrolling down, he saw that the old Daoist streamer he had watched last time still wasn't broadcasting.\n\nHe hadn't been live for so long; he'd probably quit for good.\n\nThe streaming industry seemed easy—making money while sitting at home—but the pressure was immense. Forget one or two months of not streaming; even a few days off could make you yesterday's news.\n\nJust then, however, Zhou Ze noticed an unread message in his account. He tapped it open and saw it was a private message from the old Daoist, sent the day before yesterday.\n\n\"This humble Daoist is in Tongcheng. Hey dear, wanna meet up?\"\n\nBelow the message was the old Daoist's phone number.\n\nZhou Ze frowned slightly. Besides the message, the old Daoist had also included many little heart emojis. Zhou Ze then checked the profile information for this account of Xu Le's.\n\nIt was a female account.\n\nAnd the location was set to Tongcheng.\n\nXu Le must have tried her hand at streaming before, so she even had her own stream room, though her popularity was dismal.\n\nZhou Ze finally understood where that strange feeling was coming from. The old Daoist's message clearly had the vibe of a streamer trying to hook up with his fans. He had come to Tongcheng for some reason, looked up his local fans, and was casting a wide net to see what he could catch.\n\nZhou Ze wasn't interested in this old Daoist. What he was interested in was the young man who had appeared in the old Daoist's video, the one who had great difficulty drinking porridge.\n\nStill, Zhou Ze sent a reply: his own phone number.\n\nStanding up, he stretched and prepared to leave. He was starting to miss his freezer.\n\nHowever, his phone rang right at that moment.\n\nHe picked it up. The caller ID showed a number from Rongcheng.\n\nZhou Ze answered the call.\n\n\"Hello, Benefactor, where are you!\"\n\nThe old Daoist's voice was extremely loud, as if he were shouting into the phone's speaker. It sounded like there were trains in the background.\n\n\"Where are you?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nWas this old Daoist really that free? Didn't he have a lot of fans? How did he manage to reply to his message so quickly every time?\n\nCould it be that the \"female fan\" tag was really that appealing?\n\n\"Huh...?\" The old Daoist was startled. He fell silent for a moment, not expecting the fan he was planning to meet to be a man!\n\nA... cute girl with a dick!¹\n\nHeartbreak,\n\nDisappointment,\n\nDespair!\n\nBut the old Daoist immediately changed his tone, wailing with all his might:\n\n\"Big bro, I'm starving! Begging for a few beers and a bite to eat!\"\n\n...\n\nTaking a taxi over, Zhou Ze found the old Daoist in a nook under a railway bridge. The man was wearing a filthy Daoist robe, his hair was a mess, and his face was bruised. He looked for all the world like a refugee. He had been lying on a plastic sheet on the ground.\n\nNearby on the street was a restaurant called \"Longtan Homestyle Cooking.\" Zhou Ze ordered him two bowls of noodles, a plate of Kung Pao Chicken, and a plate of small fried fish. The old Daoist devoured his food with gusto.\n\n\"Bro, you're a real one!\" The old Daoist finished one bowl of noodles and finally began to slow down. He then told the owner to warm a pot of yellow wine before smiling apologetically at Zhou Ze. He barely had any money left; Zhou Ze would definitely be the one paying for this meal.\n\n\"How did you end up like this?\" A glass of water sat in front of Zhou Ze. He hadn't touched any of the food on the table.\n\n\"Sigh, don't ask.\" The old Daoist drank a mouthful of noodle soup, smacking his lips. \"Luck's been bad lately. I was originally with a film crew that came to Tongcheng to shoot on location.\"\n\n\"Switched careers?\"\n\n\"I guess. Haven't felt like streaming lately.\" The old Daoist sighed. \"A man's got to have a dream, right?\"\n\n\"True,\" Zhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"This humble Daoist's dream for the future is to act in a *Mr. Vampire* movie, whether it's part three, four, five, or six, seven, eight.\" When he spoke of his dream, the old Daoist's entire demeanor seemed to change slightly.\n\n\"And you ended up like this from being on a film crew?\" Zhou Ze asked, a little curious.\n\n\"Heh heh, I was actually a minor supporting actor in the crew, but who knew fate could be so cruel.\"\n\nThe wine arrived.\n\nThe old Daoist poured a cup for Zhou Ze first, then filled his own. He took a small sip, his eyes narrowing:\n\n\"Tsk tsk tsk, mighty fine, mighty fine.\"\n\nZhou Ze picked up his plain water and took another sip.\n\n\"The assistant director's a piece of work. He wanted to use the casting couch on a young actress. That girl probably wasn't even eighteen. Sigh, the girl cried, she didn't want to.\n\n\"This old Daoist happened to run into them, so I went up and gave that assistant director a beating.\"\n\nThe old Daoist patted his chest and said:\n\n\"Making money is making money, getting famous is getting famous, but no matter what we do, we can't go against our conscience, right?\n\n\"Tell me, my friend, am I right?\"\n\n\"Mhm,\" Zhou Ze grunted. \"So you got fired?\"\n\n\"Nah, he didn't dare use that as an excuse.\" The old Daoist continued to grin. \"Quite a few people knew I beat him up. He wouldn't dare try to get rid of me like that, or his own reputation would be ruined.\"\n\n\"And then?\"\n\n\"And then, the next night, that young actress I saved walked into the assistant director's room on her own and didn't come out all night.\"\n\nThe old Daoist's voice was full of wistfulness as he said this. \"They're all pitiful people. Life isn't easy for any of them.\"\n\n\"And then?\"\n\n\"And then that young actress claimed I groped her, that I took liberties with her. The assistant director didn't get involved. The main director fired me from the crew.\" The old Daoist was still smiling, but there was a bitterness in his smile.\n\n\"Let's drink,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Come on, bottoms up!\" The old Daoist raised his cup. Seeing that Zhou Ze was holding plain water, he immediately said, \"You looking down on me, bro? Let's have a drink. I'm down on my luck today, and I'm grateful for your help. Mountains and rivers will meet again. Sooner or later, when I've got money again, I'll return the favor.\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. \"I'm allergic to alcohol.\"\n\n\"Alright then, tea will do!\"\n\nThe two clinked their cups, and the old Daoist downed his in one go.\n\nLife’s grievances, frustrations, indignation, inequalities—\n\nAll of it was in that one cup of wine.\n\n\"You're broke?\" Zhou Ze asked, though the question was unnecessary.\n\n\"Yeah.\" After saying this, the old Daoist looked on expectantly, hoping Zhou Ze would lend him some money. He originally had some savings, but he had donated it all at the beginning of the month. Now that he'd been fired from his new job, he was suddenly destitute.\n\n\"Oh,\" Zhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"...\" The old Daoist suddenly felt a sense of familiarity in the way this person conversed.\n\n*What the fuck*, he thought. *You just say \"oh\"? Then why did you ask if I had money?*\n\nZhou Ze stood up, went to pay the bill, and then prepared to leave. Treating the old Daoist to a meal was purely because Zhou Ze was also a bit bored tonight and wanted to find someone to talk to.\n\nHe could have gone back to find Xu Qinglang, but Xu Qinglang had closed up early tonight—the roller shutter was already down—so he couldn't find him.\n\nNow, he was tired and wanted to go back and rest.\n\n\"Buddy, you run a bookstore?\" the old Daoist asked.\n\n\"Mhm.\"\n\n\"Bookstores don't make much money, do they?\" The old Daoist held out his palm, pinching his fingertips together as if making a calculation.\n\n\"Mhm.\"\n\n\"This humble Daoist thinks that opening a spirit shop² is where the real money is.\" Seeing that Zhou Ze didn't seem interested in his \"divination,\" the old Daoist thought, *Alright, this one was born under the red flag, doesn't give a damn about feudal superstitions,* and dropped the act.\n\n\"A spirit shop?\" Zhou Ze shook his head. \"Don't want to open one.\"\n\nHe was a ghost himself. Why would he open a spirit shop?\n\n\"To be honest with you, this old Daoist used to run a spirit shop back in Rongcheng.\" The old Daoist pulled a wad of bills from his pocket. It was spirit money. \"Buddy, thanks for the meal today. I don't have much to give you. Take this stack of spirit money. Don't be in a hurry to curse me out. Of course, you can't spend this money, but it carries yin virtue. Just keep it on you. Don't worry about it being bad luck; it might bring you some good fortune.\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't reach out for the money.\n\nWho in their right mind would take a stack of spirit money and put it in their pocket?\n\n\"Brother, don't be a skeptic.\" Seeing Zhou Ze refuse, the old Daoist got anxious. He pulled up his robe and pointed to a scar on the right side of his chest. \"Back then, it was a wad of spirit money just like this that saved my life.\"\n\n\"Fine, fine, I'll take it.\"\n\nZhou Ze couldn't be bothered to watch a grown man expose his chest in front of him, so he had no choice but to reach out and take the spirit money.\n\n\"I remember from your video, there was another person in the spirit shop. That person... had a lot of trouble drinking porridge,\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Oh, him. He was an employee I hired. Lazy as hell. All he did all day was sunbathe, didn't do a lick of work. I yelled at him every day, telling him he couldn't be so lazy at his young age.\"\n\n\"Oh, does he have anorexia?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Something like that.\" The old Daoist seemed a bit down when talking about him. \"What, is he very handsome?\"\n\n\"No, he just felt... familiar.\"\n\n\"Familiar my ass,\" the old Daoist said, as if he'd just heard a hilarious joke.\n\n*You feel a kinship with a ghost? Don't tell me you're a ghost too?*\n\n*Hahahahahaha,*\n\n*You're killing this humble Daoist!*\n\nThe two of them walked out of the restaurant together. Zhou Ze offered the old Daoist a cigarette. The supermarket next door was still open, with a small fruit stand at its entrance.\n\n\"You stand here and don't move. I'm going to go buy you some oranges,\" the old Daoist joked.\n\n\"I'll just have two. You can have the rest,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\n\"What?\" The old Daoist thought Zhou Ze was a bit out of the loop and didn't get his joke. Finding it a bit dull, he figured this bookstore owner must be a bookworm.\n\nZhou Ze didn't bother to explain.\n\nIn reality, \"I'm going to go buy you some oranges, you just stand here and don't move\" is what a father says to his son in Zhu Ziqing's famous essay *The Rear View*. The speaker is effectively calling himself the listener's \"father.\"\n\nAnd Zhou Ze's reply was what a grandfather says to his grandson in Lao She's *Rickshaw Boy*.³\n\nFinally, Zhou Ze reached out and patted the old Daoist on the shoulder. \"I'm leaving. Take care.\"\n\nJust as the old Daoist was about to say something,\n\nHe suddenly clutched his crotch.\n\nThen, the smell of burnt hair wafted out.\n\n\"Holy mother, it's burning this humble Daoist to death!\"\n\n---\n¹ **A... cute girl with a dick!**: The original Chinese is internet slang for a \"trap\" or a male pretending to be a female online.\n² **Spirit shop**: A shop that sells joss paper, incense, and other ritual items for honoring the dead or deities.\n³ **The orange joke**: The old Daoist's line comes from a famous essay where a father says it to his son before parting, thus jokingly calling Zhou Ze his \"son.\" Zhou Ze's reply is from another classic novel, where a grandfather says it to his grandson, thus one-upping the joke by calling the Daoist his \"grandson.\"",

    "content": "\"What's wrong?\" Zhou Ze frowned. Clearly, he had smelled it too.\n\n\"Nothing, I have to pee. You go on ahead!\"\n\nAfter saying this, the old Taoist immediately turned and ran off.\n\nZhou Ze looked at his own hand, didn't follow to ask any more questions, and instead hailed a cab back to the bookstore.\n\nThe old Taoist reached the side of the road and pulled a paper talisman from his crotch. The talisman had already turned red, and upon meeting the wind, it disintegrated into ash and scattered.\n\nThis was an ancestral talisman of the old Taoist's. As for why he kept it in that particular spot, well, that was a secret not to be shared with outsiders.\n\nBut that last scene was already seared into the old Taoist's memory.\n\nOf course, looking down at his 'walnuts,'¹ which had been scalded tight together,\n\nit was actually seared onto his flesh as well.\n\n\"Holy mother, Boss, I never would've thought I'd run into one of your kind here in Tongcheng, over two thousand kilometers away.\"\n\nIn the great scheme of things,\n\nperhaps there was some kind of connection.\n\nJust like when Zhou Ze watched the old Taoist's livestream video and saw the young man sitting behind the counter of the Spirit Shop, struggling to drink porridge, he'd felt an inexplicable connection.\n\nIt wasn't just as simple as anorexia.\n\nIn truth,\n\nthey were the same kind of person.\n\nIn this world, he was not the absolute, one and only, solitary anomaly.\n\nJust as the Faceless Woman in Hell had roared in unwilling fury:\n\n\"How can you leave too?\"\n\nThis implied that,\n\nit wasn't just Zhou Ze; someone else had left from before the Faceless Woman in the past.\n\nAdd to that the old man with the black fingernails whom Zhou Ze had saved after the car accident...\n\nThis world,\n\nwas truly not as peaceful as one might imagine.\n\n..................\n\nBy the time he took a cab back to the bookstore, it was already one in the morning. Zhou Ze cleaned up the broken glass on the bathroom floor, then boiled a few kettles of water and managed a makeshift wipe-down with a towel.\n\nHe decided he would have someone come install a shower head tomorrow for convenience. For a person with mild mysophobia, not being able to shower was absolute torture.\n\nReturning to the second floor, he set the temperature. Zhou Ze lay down inside it, closed his eyes, and prepared to bid farewell to the day's exhaustion and all its chaos.\n\nHe slept soundly and peacefully that night.\n\nThe night passed without incident.\n\nWhen he woke up the next morning, Zhou Ze, emerging from the freezer, first went to wash up, then opened the shop's door and glanced next door.\n\nThe shop next door was closed again today.\n\nThere was no way to contact Dr. Lin for now.\n\nHis wife was gone.\n\nNow he was gone too.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head sharply. *Damn it, how could I have such a thought?*\n\n*Xu Le's lingering poison is corrupting me.*\n\nYes,\n\nthat must be it.\n\nHaving not eaten since last night, Zhou Ze could only take out his phone and order takeout, with a note asking the shop to send extra vinegar.\n\nAfter about a twenty-minute wait, a young delivery guy in a yellow uniform arrived on an electric scooter. He pushed open the shop door, walked right in, and handed the food to Zhou Ze, who was sitting behind the counter reading a book.\n\n\"Thank you. It can't be easy, delivering food during the Lunar New Year,\" Zhou Ze said politely.\n\n\"You've got it tough too, having to eat takeout during the Lunar New Year,\" the delivery guy shot back.\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze felt like he'd taken an arrow to the knee. He looked up and took a good look at the delivery guy in front of him. He was very young, looking to be in his early twenties.\n\n\"This is a bookstore?\" The delivery guy glanced around the shop. \"The kind where you can sit and read? How much?\"\n\n\"Pay what you think it's worth,\" Zhou Ze said, opening the takeout bag.\n\n\"Deal.\"\n\nThe delivery guy sat down on a plastic stool, found a copy of *Battle Through the Heavens*, and began to read with great interest.\n\nZhou Ze, meanwhile, downed the vinegar the shop had sent in one gulp. It seemed that thanks to the training from the freakishly sour plum juice at Xu Qinglang's place, ordinary vinegar didn't have much of an effect on him anymore.\n\nNext, he began to wolf down his food. Halfway through, the nausea and urge to vomit began to set in.\n\nZhou Ze clutched his own throat with both hands, forcing himself not to throw up. Finally, after a terrible standoff, the nausea slowly began to recede. Zhou Ze wiped the corner of his mouth, then started coughing heavily.\n\n\"Bro, eat slower. The way you eat... to use my grandma's words, it's like you're a reincarnated hungry ghost.\"\n\nThe delivery guy commented while still reading his book.\n\nZhou Ze glared at him, then simply sat on the chair, panting. He needed a moment.\n\n*Damn that Xu Qinglang!*\n\n*Why isn't he open yet!*\n\nZhou Ze decided that if the man still wasn't open by the afternoon, he would have no choice but to break down his door to find the rest of the sour plum juice or bitter melon juice. Otherwise, he really wouldn't be able to get his meals down.\n\nThe delivery guy seemed to have stopped taking orders, sitting there and reading his novel for an hour.\n\n\"Huh, why do I smell something like burning coal?\" The delivery guy suddenly sniffed the air, then walked outside the bookstore.\n\nZhou Ze didn't think much of it. The guy probably wanted to read for a bit without paying. Whatever.\n\nThis bookstore's profits really were up to fate.\n\nBut then, the delivery guy who had just stepped outside immediately opened his mouth and shouted:\n\n\"Whoa, it's on fire!\"\n\nOnly then was Zhou Ze jolted to attention. He also walked out of the shop, looked up, and his gaze immediately fixed. On the fourth floor of the building above, thick smoke was billowing out.\n\nThat was,\n\nthe location of the movie theater!\n\nThe only part of the once-bustling commercial center that still had some life was that movie theater. And because it was the New Year holiday, a lot of people had been coming to watch movies.\n\n\"Let's go, save people!\" The delivery guy immediately sprinted in that direction.\n\nZhou Ze stood there, hesitating for ten seconds. The fire was definitely serious, but it absolutely wouldn't burn down to his bookstore. He was suppressing the instinct deep inside him to go and help.\n\nHe couldn't remember how many times in the past he had rushed to the front lines of a disaster site to participate in rescue efforts. But just recently, he had been planning to break this bad habit.\n\nHowever, after an intense internal struggle, Zhou Ze still ran after him.\n\nMe...\n\nStill a sucker, I guess!\n\nOn the stairs leading from the first to the third floor, many people were running down, while Zhou Ze ran up.\n\nAlthough this commercial center was \"dead,\" it was located in the city center. The fire trucks should arrive quickly.\n\nThere weren't as many people watching movies in the morning as in the afternoon, but the number was still considerable. By the time Zhou Ze ran up the stairs to the fourth floor, he saw that the smoke inside was much thicker, and the flames were burning strangely. Even if it were an accidental fire, it shouldn't be burning this wildly!\n\nBut this wasn't the time to analyze the cause. Amidst the thick smoke, Zhou Ze saw the delivery guy, his face blackened by soot, carrying an old woman out.\n\nThe guy glanced at Zhou Ze, smiled, revealing a set of white teeth, then turned and ran back toward the theater auditoriums to continue rescuing people.\n\nThe fire hadn't completely spread out, but in the auditorium area, the blaze was intense.\n\nZhou Ze hesitated no longer. Since he was already here, he had to do something. He immediately ran into the thick smoke.\n\n\"*Cough cough... cough cough...*\"\n\nWithout any protective gear, rushing in like this was a foolish act. It was easy to fail to save anyone and end up getting himself killed.\n\nSo Zhou Ze knew his time was limited. If he saw someone who needed help, he'd just get them out. He couldn't do much else; he could only wait for professional firefighters to handle the rest.\n\n\"*Whoosh...*\"\n\nThe moment Zhou Ze opened the door to Theater 2, flames shot out directly at him. Zhou Ze had to step back to avoid the worst of it.\n\nAnd inside, there were still sounds of crying and shouting.\n\nZhou Ze gritted his teeth and charged straight in. Inside the theater, there were flames everywhere—on the floor, the ceiling, the walls, all on fire. And because of the confined space, the thick smoke produced by the combustion could only billow and fill the room.\n\nIn most fire scenes, many more victims die from smoke inhalation than from being burned.\n\nOnly at a time like this did people realize how important those annoying fire safety announcement videos before every movie really were.\n\nAs soon as Zhou Ze rushed in, he saw two people lying in the small space of the aisle.\n\nOne was an adult man in a black suit. He was on the ground, coughing, clearly unable to get up.\n\nThe other was a boy of about ten, lying unconscious on the ground, it was impossible to tell if he had just fainted or had already suffocated.\n\n\"Save me... save me... save...\" The man in the suit managed to lift his head, looking at Zhou Ze standing before him.\n\nZhou Ze jumped right over him, lifted the little boy onto his back, and prepared to rush out.\n\nHe was already feeling dizzy. Clearly, without a gas mask or other professional equipment, he wouldn't last much longer either.\n\nHowever, just as he was about to run out with the boy on his back, Zhou Ze felt a tug on his leg, and his whole body fell to the ground. The boy on his back tumbled off as well.\n\n\"Save... save... me... first... I'll... give you... money... save... me... first...\"\n\nThe man in the suit used his last bit of strength to grip Zhou Ze's ankle tightly. He knew he couldn't hold on for much longer. He couldn't breathe at all now, and his lungs felt like they were on fire.\n\nHaving been pulled down, Zhou Ze felt his head spin, and he nearly passed out. In that instant, he bit down hard on the tip of his own tongue, forcing himself to stay conscious.\n\n\"Thump!\"\n\n\"Thump!\"\n\nZhou Ze used his other foot to kick the man's hand and head.\n\nAfter several kicks, the man finally let go.\n\nZhou Ze staggered back to his feet, hoisted the boy onto his back again, and charged out of Theater 2.\n\nAs he burst through the billowing smoke and into a safe area, Zhou Ze's knees buckled, and he fell directly to the ground. The boy on his back fell too, but because Zhou Ze had subconsciously cushioned the fall, it wasn't serious.\n\nThe firefighters had already arrived and were beginning to extinguish the fire. Another group of firefighters in full gear was charging into the blaze.\n\n\"There's still someone in Theater 2.\"\n\nZhou Ze grabbed the uniform of a firefighter running past him and said.\n\n\"Okay, got it.\" The firefighter nodded and rushed into the fire.\n\n\"*Haaah... haaah...*\"\n\nZhou Ze lay flat on the tiled floor, gasping for air. Opposite him, the delivery guy, his yellow uniform now blackened by soot, was also leaning against the wall, panting. The two made eye contact and managed a weak, exhausted smile.\n\nThe paramedics had also arrived, a group of doctors and nurses in white. Zhou Ze didn't have the strength to see if Dr. Lin was part of this rescue operation.\n\nGritting his teeth, he got up again. Zhou Ze glanced at the boy who was receiving emergency treatment from a doctor. The boy's chest was still rising and falling; he should be fine.\n\nAt the same time, Zhou Ze saw several other people being carried out by the firefighters. Some couldn't be saved, while others were. The man in the black suit was lying on a stretcher, motionless. He was probably gone.\n\nZhou Ze felt no guilt. He had no reason to feel guilty.\n\nHe was doing a good deed, saving people, but who he saved first was his decision. No one had the right to morally condemn him.\n\nBesides, at that moment, he had absolutely no ability to carry a child while also hauling an adult man out. If he had tried, the only result would have been him dying in there as well.\n\nThe body he had possessed was Xu Le's, a \"scholar\" with no strength to even truss a chicken, not Schwarzenegger's.\n\nWhat's more, that guy had almost gotten him killed in the theater too.\n\nHe struggled to his feet, refusing the help of a nurse who wanted to check his condition. Zhou Ze walked to the restroom at the other end of the building, turned on the tap, and vigorously splashed cold water on his face.\n\nFinally,\n\nhe had caught his breath.\n\nLifting his head,\n\nZhou Ze looked at himself in the mirror.\n\nSuddenly, he noticed,\n\nin the mirror, behind him, a faint human figure was slowly appearing.\n\nThis person,\n\nwas wearing a black suit.\n\nStaring at him with a face full of venomous hatred.\n\nHis mouth was open, shouting incessantly, as if questioning him about something, hysterical, frantic, and agitated.\n\nAfter a person dies, under specific circumstances, there is a certain probability they might turn into a vengeful ghost to seek revenge.\n\nRight now, this man had just died, and his soul was still in the ghost-formation stage. It would likely take full form on the seventh day after his death.\n\nHe was not yet a ghost, merely a nascent form.\n\nBut because of Zhou Ze's own unique nature, he could perceive the man's existence ahead of time.\n\nHe hated him.\n\nFor not saving him.\n\nAnd this hatred was so strong,\n\nit was enough to turn him into a vengeful ghost!\n\n\"Heh, interesting.\"\n\nZhou Ze smiled.\n\nHe lowered his head back into the sink and continued to rinse his face with water.\n\nAt the same time, he sighed inwardly:\n\n\"Heh, people...\"\n\n***\n\n¹A common slang term for testicles.",

    "content": "According to the Jianghai Evening News (a local Tongcheng newspaper), seven people lost their lives in the movie theater fire, and more than thirty others suffered injuries of varying degrees.\n\nA week had passed. The movie theater had been closed down, and it was impossible for it to reopen anytime soon. It was even likely that the theater would be abandoned altogether. It had already been losing money, so naturally, they wouldn't go through the trouble of a grand reopening.\n\nWith that, this commercial complex was basically declared completely dead.\n\nDuring this time, Zhou Ze hadn't contacted Dr. Lin. Both sides maintained a tacit understanding not to interfere with each other, each living their own life. His father-in-law and mother-in-law, however, had called several times, questioning why Zhou Ze wasn't coming home, saying he'd gotten bold, and so on.\n\nEventually, Zhou Ze simply blocked their numbers.\n\nThe current headache was that his in-laws had paid to open this bookstore. *One's mouth is soft from eating their food, and one's hands are weak from taking their things.*¹ The problem was, Zhou Ze still hadn't figured out a way to earn some money so he could open a new store and be truly independent.\n\nAll he could say was that the foundation Xu Le had left him was just too poor.\n\nSeveral media outlets had contacted him, hoping to interview Zhou Ze about his heroic deed and promote some positive energy for the new era, but Zhou Ze refused them all.\n\nHe had no interest in that kind of fame. As the saying goes, a tall tree attracts the wind. Given his identity and role, turning himself into some kind of celebrity would only invite more uncontrollable dangers.\n\nThis past week, business had been unremarkable. Daily sales were less than a hundred yuan, not even enough to cover rent and utilities, but Zhou Ze wasn't too concerned about it.\n\nWhat he was concerned about was that his next-door neighbor, Xu Qinglang, hadn't opened his door in a week.\n\nZhou Ze hired an unscrupulous locksmith to open the lock. He went inside and searched the place but couldn't find any sour plum juice or anything of the sort. The kitchen in the back room was spotless and very tidy.\n\nIt was quite helpless.\nA handsome man who owned over twenty properties—\nif he suddenly decided to renounce the material world and go chasing the wind, free and easy,\nyou'd have a really hard time finding him.\n\nAnd because of that, Zhou Ze's week had been pretty miserable.\n\nChili oil,\naged black vinegar,\ndark soy sauce,\nhigh-concentration orange juice—he had tried them all. Although they allowed him to get some food down, they all made him miserable. The effect was far inferior to Xu Qinglang's family-recipe sour plum juice.\n\nAs night fell, Zhou Ze squatted alone at the entrance of his bookstore, a cigarette dangling from his lips. His gaze occasionally drifted next door, giving off a feeling of 'where in this life can one speak of desolation'.\n\nBy the road in front of the shop, four or five pagoda incense coils were burning. The people from the shopping center had set them up. According to custom, today was the day to welcome the God of Wealth. Even though they knew the God of Wealth could hardly save this shopping center, they still had to go through the motions.\n\nWhat if a miracle happened?\n\nOccasionally, Zhou Ze would glance behind him or at his reflection in the glass in front of him. The vengeful ghost of the man in the black suit was continuously taking shape. Tonight was his *touqi*,² so it should be almost complete.\n\nThe materialization of a vengeful ghost was an incredibly small probability to begin with. Besides, an ordinary vengeful ghost could at most make you trip while walking or bite your tongue while eating. Making you catch a minor illness that required a two-day IV drip would be considered an impressive feat for a ghost.\n\nThe kind of thing you see in movies, where vengeful ghosts run rampant killing people everywhere, could never happen in reality. Otherwise, the world of the living would have descended into chaos long ago.\n\nEven Zhou Ze, who had returned to life in a borrowed body, was keeping such a low profile.\nHow dare those scumbags who didn't even have a physical body come out and act tough?\n\nThis week, whenever he had nothing to do, Zhou Ze would read, space out, trim his nails, and incidentally check if the ghost behind him had become any clearer.\nIt gave him a feeling of... raising something. He was experiencing 'a father's love, as solid as a mountain'.\n\n*Daddy loves you.*\n*Daddy's waiting for you to grow up.*\n\nZhou Ze could clearly perceive the emotions of the one behind him. His greatest hatred wasn't directed at the cause of the fire, but at Zhou Ze himself. He was resentful, furious, expectant, and waiting.\n\nPerhaps,\nin his view, tonight—the day of his *touqi*—was his moment of revenge.\n\nInteresting.\nZhou Ze flicked the ash from his cigarette. After the ghost finished forming, Zhou Ze would show him why the flowers are so red.\n\nAs for saving the man, Zhou Ze didn't feel he'd done anything wrong. Nor did he think it was wrong for the man in the suit to hate him.\n\nPreviously, Zhou Ze had encountered a similar incident. A person was drowning, and someone went in to save them. In the end, the rescuer was grabbed tightly by the drowning person, and they both drowned.\n\nGenerally speaking, when rescuing someone from the water, you have to approach from behind and hold them to pull them out. If you approach from the front, the drowning person will easily latch onto you like a final straw to clutch at.\n\nOf course, he could understand it,\nbut understanding wasn't a reason for Zhou Ze to allow the man in the suit to run wild in his bookstore at midnight.\n\nDuring the day, Zhou Ze ordered takeout and chatted a bit with the new delivery guy. He learned that the delivery guy who had helped with the rescue had gotten famous recently. Not only was he attending various award ceremonies, but he had also been commended and rewarded by his company. He now had a nickname: \"The Most Handsome Delivery Guy.\" He was still delivering food, but now he did it while livestreaming, and his popularity was very high.\n\nWhile eating his meal and chugging aged black vinegar, Zhou Ze casually scrolled through Weibo and actually saw the delivery guy in the trending topics.\n\nA week had passed since the incident. It had moved from the initial phase of handling and summarizing to the current phase of developing and promoting positive energy, placing it at the peak of public discussion. The incident's influence had spread not just in Tongcheng, but throughout the entire country.\n\nAt eleven at night, Zhou Ze watched the man in the suit slowly become more solid while also watching a movie. The movie was called *Demon Cop*, a work from a few years ago by the recently famous director Dante Lam, starring Daniel Wu and Nick Cheung.\n\nThe bookstore door was pushed open, and the delivery guy, wearing his uniform, walked in while holding a selfie stick.\n\n\"This is a bookstore I often come to. After a busy day of delivering food, I always come here to read. Not for any scholarly reason, I just simply like to read.\"\n\nAfter speaking, the delivery guy took a copy of Wen Tiejun's *Eight Crises* from the bookshelf.\n\nThe book was about China's various economic crises in modern history. The delivery guy opened the book, sat down on a plastic stool, and began to read with great interest.\n\nZhou Ze remembered that the last time he came, he had read two volumes of *Battle Through the Heavens*.\n\n\"Alright, that's all for today's stream. I want to read quietly for a bit. You all should get some rest too. Thanks for keeping me company all day.\" The delivery guy bowed to his phone screen.\n\nA barrage of subscription notifications, planes, and rockets scrolled across the phone screen. His popularity was indeed terrifyingly high.\n\nTurning off his phone, the delivery guy closed *Eight Crises*, stretched, looked at Zhou Ze, and said:\n\n\"Boss, let's go grab a late-night snack. My treat.\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head and pointed at the computer screen in front of him.\n\n\"What are you watching?\" The delivery guy came closer, glanced at the screen, and laughed. \"I've seen this movie. *Demon Cop*, right?\"\n\n\"Yeah.\" Zhou Ze nodded, simultaneously checking the time in the bottom right corner of the screen. It was almost midnight.\n\nThe \"baby\" behind him was already getting impatient.\n\n\"No reporters came to interview you?\" the delivery guy asked.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head.\n\n\"You really should have accepted the interviews. Your bookstore's business would be a lot better.\"\n\n\"I like the quiet,\" Zhou Ze said, insincerely posturing.\n\nMoney is important, but life is more important.\n\n\"You can watch the movie later.\" The delivery guy seemed to feel a connection with Zhou Ze. After all, they were comrades who had rushed into the fire to save people together.\nThere was a sense of...\nmutual admiration, perhaps.\n\n\"Did you know? *Demon Cop* is based on a true story. The real-life protagonist was apparently named Tsui Po-ko,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Heh, I actually didn't know that.\" The delivery guy smiled a little sheepishly. \"It's just a movie, who pays attention to that stuff?\"\n\n\"Mm, that's true.\" Zhou Ze shut down his computer and stretched. \"It's so late, what do you want to eat?\"\n\n\"Whatever's fine.\"\n\n\"Then I'll just order some takeout.\"\n\n\"No, let's eat out. My treat. What's so good about takeout? Let me tell you, the back kitchens of some of those places are unbearable to look at. Some businesses don't even have a physical store, they just rent a rundown place and cook there. Tsk tsk, anyway, I wouldn't dare eat it.\"\n\n\"I see.\" Zhou Ze nodded. \"By the way, do you know the story of Tsui Po-ko?\"\n\n\"If you tell me, won't I know then?\"\n\n\"He killed his colleague, took the money, and then lived it up. He even participated in a TV show. He liked being in the spotlight, being famous.\" Zhou Ze rubbed the tip of his nose. \"A very complex person. He really enjoyed being on camera.\"\n\nThe delivery guy was silent for a moment, not continuing the topic. Instead, he said, \"Boss, are you going for a late-night snack or not?\"\n\n\"I don't feel like it. Haven't you seen all the pagoda incense coils outside my door? The smoke has been wafting in all day, I've completely lost my appetite.\"\n\nPagoda incense coils are those large incense sticks, taller than a person, stacked layer upon layer like a pagoda. They are very thick and can burn for a long time.\n\n\"Haha, but your shop doesn't smell at all.\" The delivery guy pointed to the central air conditioning unit above Zhou Ze's bookstore. \"That part, that's an air purifier, right?\"\n\n\"Yeah, it was installed with the AC. And I'm used to spraying some air freshener in the store. After all, you have to create a bookish atmosphere, right? Since I don't offer coffee or pastries, the least I can do is provide a pleasant scent.\"\n\n\"So, Boss, you're still not going to give me face, huh?\" the delivery guy said, pretending to be angry. \"We've been through life and death together, you know.\"\n\nZhou Ze raised a hand and said curiously, \"That's why I've always been curious about something.\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"That day, I didn't smell anything at all. In my shop, it's difficult to smell anything from outside—almost impossible. So how did you smell the fire that day?\"\n\nThe delivery guy froze for a second, his expression turning a bit unnatural. But he brushed it off and said, \"I've had a good sense of smell since I was a kid. My grandma said I had a dog's nose. When I was little, I was always dead on when sniffing out hidden snacks at home.\"\n\n\"Do you know what day it is today?\" Zhou Ze asked again.\n\n\"What day?\"\n\n\"The *touqi*.\"\n\n\"*Touqi*?\"\n\n\"That's right. The *touqi*... for the seven people who died in the fire!\"\n\n***\n\n¹ A Chinese idiom meaning one cannot be assertive toward one's benefactors.\n\n² *Touqi* (头七), \"the first seventh,\" is the seventh day after a person's death, a significant day in Chinese funerary traditions when the spirit is believed to return home.",

    "content": "The delivery guy stood still on the other side of the counter, looking at Zhou Ze, who was sitting behind it.\n\n\"Don't be scared. The store doesn't have any security cameras, and I don't have a voice recorder,\" Zhou Ze said, stretching lazily. \"Of course, you're definitely not going to believe me. Tsk, suit yourself.\"\n\n\"I don't know what you mean,\" the delivery guy said calmly.\n\nSomeone who could do such a thing would have to be calm.\n\nThe police still hadn't identified a specific arsonist, which was a testament to his skill—in a derogatory sense, of course.\n\n\"I'm positive that you're the one who set that fire.\" Zhou Ze spread his hands. He was simply stating a fact, one that was beyond argument.\n\n\"You're drunk,\" the delivery guy said.\n\n\"Not drunk.\"\n\nZhou Ze smiled.\n\n\"And just what are you basing that on, saying I set the fire? You think you're better than the cops?\" The delivery guy's expression was beginning to tense up, but he was still restraining himself.\n\n\"Sss... Of course I'm not as skilled as the police, but I'm not blind. And as for saying I figured you were the arsonist based on *that*—sorry, but that's not it at all.\n\n\"I first confirmed you were the arsonist, and then worked backward to deduce the evidence. Just wanted to see what it feels like to be Conan.\"\n\nZhou Ze pointed a finger behind the delivery guy.\n\nThe delivery guy whipped his head around, thinking the police were there, but there was no one, nor any sound of sirens.\n\nIn this nearly abandoned mall, so late at night, there wasn't even a single person passing by.\n\n\"They... all followed you in,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Who?\" The delivery guy frowned.\n\n\"The six people who died in the movie theater. They followed you in, and as soon as I saw that, I went, 'Oh.' The killer is you. It's as plain as day.\n\n\"Aside from the dope standing behind me who's hell-bent on hating my guts, you can't be telling me the other six victims all got the wrong guy, can you?\"\n\nZhou Ze slowly stood up, looking at the delivery guy before him.\n\n\"Stop with the hocus-pocus!\" the delivery guy practically roared. For some reason, he felt the pressure mounting, and cold sweat began to bead on his face.\n\n\"Don't be nervous. They can't harm you.\"\n\nZhou Ze walked out from behind the counter, carrying a plastic bag.\n\nInside the bag were small boxes of rice and some pickles.\n\nIn Zhou Ze's line of sight, six people were sitting on plastic stools—men and women, two of them elderly.\n\nThey were all sitting there properly, reading books, quiet and not the least bit disruptive.\n\nZhou Ze placed a bowl of rice in front of each person. The rice was topped with pickles, and a pair of disposable chopsticks was stuck upright in it.\n\nThen, Zhou Ze took out a bottle of cheap white liquor that cost less than ten yuan, poured it into plastic cups from the water dispenser, and placed a cup in front of each person.\n\n\"Hey fellas, life's not easy for me either. This bookstore's been losing money since it opened, so this is all I can offer. Don't mind me being cheap, alright? You guys are dead, but I still have to keep on living.\n\n\"Besides, your families will be making offerings to you, so you won't miss this little bit from me, right?\"\n\nZhou Ze bent over, speaking as if he were casually serving customers.\n\nRight. As for that dope behind him with a screw loose, Zhou Ze wasn't feeling charitable enough to leave him a portion.\n\n\"Are you fucking sick in the head!\" The delivery guy couldn't hold it in anymore. \"Ha, I should really record this for you, post it online, and let all my followers see you in this state!\"\n\n\"You dare?\" Zhou Ze asked, turning to the side. \"You talk a big game. You've only been streaming for a few days. Even WuWu got taken down.\"¹\n\nYes, there were many reasons the police hadn't found the arsonist yet, but if they had a primary suspect to investigate, it would be very difficult for the arsonist to stay hidden.\n\n\"I'm leaving. You're crazy.\"\n\nThe delivery guy's friendly demeanor vanished. He had successfully converted his popularity into a livestreaming career and a huge income, not just because he was a \"hero,\" but also because of his own marketing strategy.\n\nHe was very down-to-earth, and his original public image was excellent. On that foundation, livestreaming his deliveries, something that should have been tedious and boring, became something people enjoyed watching.\n\nHe knew he was panicking, that he'd lost his composure. So he wanted to leave, to flee this bookstore.\n\nHe regretted coming here today, regretted it very, very much.\n\nZhou Ze didn't try to stop him. But, just as the delivery guy reached out to push open the bookstore's door,\n\nZhou Ze took out his phone, checked the time, and said:\n\n\"It's midnight.\"\n\n\"Dong!\"\n\nThere was no clock hanging in the bookstore, but at that moment, the delivery guy felt as if he had heard a bell toll.\n\nHe pushed the door with all his might, but it didn't budge. Enraged, he glanced at the lock. The door wasn't locked, and there was nothing blocking it, but it just wouldn't open.\n\nThe delivery guy began kicking the door like a madman, but it remained motionless.\n\nWhat he couldn't see was that,\n\nThe six people who had been sitting and reading,\n\nhad all slowly risen to their feet.\n\nThe seventh night after death, the night of the soul's return.\n\nEvery injustice has a source, every debt a debtor.\n\nThey had come here, following their enemy,\n\nand now,\n\nthey were all staring daggers at him,\n\nthe man who had become a hero after burning them to death.\n\n\"This is for not saving me!\"\n\nA low growl came from behind Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze happened to be blowing on his fingernails at that exact moment. He then spun around abruptly, the nails of his right hand instantly growing long, their translucent blackness emitting a strange luster. Wisps of black energy coiled around his fingertips, carrying a terrifying aura.\n\nAt the same time, a black mist churned within Zhou Ze's eyes.\n\n\"Sssssss... AHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!\"\n\nThe man in the black suit, who had just managed to transform into a vengeful ghost, was seized by the shoulder by Zhou Ze's hand. His entire being began to tremble as the black energy from Zhou Ze's fingertips pierced his body like countless sharp knives. Wisps of green smoke rose from the top of the man's head.\n\n\"I understand you, but you disgust me.\"\n\nZhou Ze said in a deep voice,\n\n\"So, you should just say goodbye.\"\n\nZhou Ze's fingers tightened.\n\nThe man in the black suit wailed while his expression turned pleading. He hoped Zhou Ze would spare him. He had already become a vengeful ghost; to \"die\" again would mean his soul would be scattered, without even the chance to enter hell.\n\nBut Zhou Ze didn't let go.\n\nHis gaze remained ice-cold.\n\nOnly after the black-suited man's body had completely melted and evaporated,\n\ndid he withdraw his hand. In his palm, faint traces of ash could be seen.\n\n\"Hoo...\"\n\nZhou Ze blew on his palm, then clapped his hands together.\n\nTurning back around, Zhou Ze sighed.\n\nHe didn't know if it was because of his presence here that the bookstore's feng shui had changed,\n\nor if,\n\nthis was just a coincidence.\n\nThe six customers who had been reading quietly earlier now had black mist rising from their bodies—a sign they were about to become vengeful ghosts to seek revenge.\n\nMeanwhile, the delivery guy was still relentlessly punching and kicking the wall.\n\nLook up, and see whom the heavens have spared. Perhaps that saying described this very scene.\n\nThese six victims had also been in a state of panic and confusion amidst the thick smoke and fire, ultimately failing to escape and dying a miserable death.\n\n\"Everyone, do me a favor. Don't be in such a hurry to become vengeful ghosts.\"\n\nZhou Ze walked into the middle of the group and raised a hand to the six figures.\n\n\"Come on, relax. How about you all give me a smile?\"\n\nZhou Ze wanted to lighten the mood. Once they became vengeful ghosts, they could no longer enter the cycle of reincarnation. After taking their revenge, once their obsession was gone, they would simply dissipate into the wind.\n\nThat was the most tragic ending.\n\nZhou Ze felt it wasn't worth it, truly not worth it.\n\nThe arsonist had already caused your deaths, separating you from your loved ones forever. Your children lost a father or mother, your parents lost a child.\n\nThere was no need to push yourselves into an even more terrible abyss because of the same murderer.\n\nHowever, Zhou Ze's words had no effect.\n\nThe faces of the six people remained frigid, and the black mist around them grew thicker. Black lines began to spread from the corners of their eyes and lips.\n\nThey were about to look like that dopey man in black had when he charged at him.\n\n\"Since you won't smile for me, how about I smile for you?\"\n\nZhou Ze forced a very ugly smile.\n\nIt was over.\n\nWhat a disaster.\n\nThey couldn't be saved.\n\nZhou Ze knew it would be easy for him to obliterate these vengeful ghosts, just like that dope who had been following him for a week and got slapped to death the moment his cooldown ended and he was about to use his ultimate move.\n\nBut as for delivering these souls from suffering, he truly had no idea how to do it. Besides, Zhou Ze was a ghost himself, which made it inconvenient for him to perform such a task—it was like asking Zhang Fei to do embroidery.\n\n\"The netherworld has a path, the Yellow Springs can be crossed!\"\n\nA sharp cry came from outside. Immediately after, the bookstore door was pushed open. Xu Qinglang walked in, holding a small porcelain bowl filled with rice grains, in which three sticks of incense were inserted.\n\n\"Rise!\"\n\nThe three incense sticks burned down rapidly.\n\nAt the same time, the rice grains in the bowl turned from a crystalline white to black, while the black mist around the six figures began to fade. Finally, their expressions shifted from their initial cold and murderous look to one of peace and tranquility.\n\nThe six people slowly sat back down in front of their respective bowls and chopsticks.\n\n\"Xu Qinglang!\" Zhou Ze shouted, pointing at him.\n\nHe was excited.\n\nTruly excited.\n\nMore excited than when he saw Doctor Lin coming out of the bath.\n\nJust think about how difficult it had been for him to eat this past week.\n\nHow could he not be excited!\n\nAs for Xu Qinglang's performance just now, Zhou Ze wasn't surprised. In fact, everyone had probably known the truth all along and just hadn't said it out loud.\n\nXu Qinglang shot Zhou Ze a look, and for a moment, he was overwhelmingly charming, like a mountainside of azaleas bursting into bloom.\n\nBut at the same time, he said irritably:\n\n\"Are you hosting a Chinese New Year midnight party here?\"\n\n\"It's not like I wanted to,\" Zhou Ze said, briefly explaining the situation to Xu Qinglang.\n\nXu Qinglang nodded to show he understood. He clasped his hands and bowed to the six figures.\n\n\"Everyone, it is the seventh night of the soul's return. You should go back and see your loved ones. They should be at home waiting for you. As for what happened here, I will give you a proper resolution.\"\n\nHearing this, the six figures silently passed through the glass and left.\n\nZhou Ze's gaze, however, was fixed on the bowl of \"black rice.\"\n\n\"How come this stuff has no effect on me?\"\n\nThe corner of Xu Qinglang's mouth twitched. He fought back the urge to leap up and fight three hundred rounds with Zhou Ze.\n\nHe huffed:\n\n\"You're different.\"\n\nHe was still angry, still held a grudge against Zhou Ze, still felt it was unfair. But because of his looks, his temperament, and his voice, the words \"You're different\" carried the deep resentment of a lady locked away in her boudoir.\n\nThen,\n\nXu Qinglang looked at the delivery guy, who had fainted in the corner. \"What do we do with him?\"\n\nAs he spoke, Xu Qinglang made a throat-slitting gesture.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head.\n\nAnd said:\n\n\"We should hand him over to the country.\"\n\n---\n¹A reference to Lu Benwei (盧本偉), a top-tier Chinese streamer also known as \"55Kai,\" who was permanently banned from streaming, serving as a cautionary tale about the precariousness of a streaming career.",

    "content": "周澤最後報了警，警察很快來了，按照周澤的說法，是說這位外賣小哥來到自己店裡後忽然發了瘋，說有很多被他燒死的人亡魂來找他復仇，然後不停地對著牆壁狂踹狂砸最後暈厥了過去。\n\n\n\n  從警局做完筆錄出來時，天都已經亮了，影院縱火案，一波三折，但現在至少打開了局面，之前警方很可能只是因為燈下黑的緣故，沒有懷疑到見義勇為的外賣小哥身上，現在哪怕還沒有確切的證據，但只要真的將目光落在對方身上進行查找，應該很快就能發現真相。\n\n\n\n  至於之後輿論的轉向，網上吃瓜群眾的顛覆以及那些曾給這位外賣小哥刷禮物的目瞪口呆，就不是周澤需要擔心和思考的問題了，他能做的，也就只有這麼多，願意做的，也就只有這麼多。\n\n\n\n  鬼的事兒，還是交給鬼來解決，人的事兒，還是交給警察來解決為好。\n\n\n\n  站在警局門口，呼吸著清晨新鮮的空氣，頭腦頓覺清醒。\n\n\n\n  打車回到店裡時，周澤看見隔壁許清朗的店已經重新開門營業了，許清朗本人換了一身平常點的衣服坐在店鋪門口一邊擇菜一邊曬著太陽，嘴裡還哼著「童子戲」（地方曲種）小調，悠哉悠哉，自有一股子風流韻味流淌出來。\n\n\n\n  一切，\n\n\n\n  仿佛依舊。\n\n\n\n  周澤走到店裡，許清朗拍了拍手，問道：「吃啥？」 \n\n\n\n  「隨便吧，我要酸梅汁。」\n\n\n\n  許清朗點點頭。\n\n\n\n  周澤在店裡坐了下來，手指輕輕地敲擊著桌面。\n\n\n\n  不一會兒，許清朗端上來一碗雞蛋面，麵湯清澈，麵條筋道，當然，這些都不重要，最重要的是，熟悉的酸梅汁，又出現在了周澤面前。\n\n\n\n  「給我做一桶吧，多少錢？」周澤指了指店裡的飲水機水桶，「先做一桶。」\n\n\n\n  「等過陣子吧。」許清朗在周澤面前坐下來，嘴裡叼著一根煙，他似乎很想做出一副小痞子抽菸吊啊吊的姿態，但偏偏給人一種「女人抽菸也能這般美麗」的違和感。\n\n\n\n  他不娘，也不gay，只能怪老天給錯了皮囊。\n\n\n\n  就著酸梅汁吃完了面，破天荒地，這次吃碗麵後周澤的噁心感不再那麼強烈了，但依舊多喝了好幾杯水緩了緩。\n\n\n\n  「記得林黛玉初進賈府吃飯後遇到什麼事兒麼？」許清朗吐出一口煙圈問道。\n\n\n\n  周澤想了想，明白了過來。\n\n\n\n  林黛玉初入賈府，第一頓家宴，飯畢後，下人送上茶湯，林黛玉在家裡被父親教導過飯後不宜飲茶容易消化不良，但見賈母和諸多姐妹都喝了，她也只能跟著一起喝。\n\n\n\n  「我能吃飽了就行。」周澤搖搖頭，以他現在這個情況，很可能這輩子是做不成一個老饕或者美食家了，至於消化問題，再說吧。 \n\n\n\n  「我心裡有些不平衡。」許清朗開門見山地說道，「我父母，走了。」\n\n\n\n  許清朗父母早就走了，但周澤清楚許清朗這次說「走了」是什麼意思，應該是下去了。\n\n\n\n  「怎麼忽然就走了？」周澤問道，本想回應一個「節哀」，想想，不合適。\n\n\n\n  「被發現了。」\n\n\n\n  周澤拿煙的手微微一抖，\n\n\n\n  被發現了？\n\n\n\n  周澤記得那個老者在臨死前，也曾喊過「他們發現我了！」\n\n\n\n  許清朗看著周澤，「我很不甘心，也很不平衡，為什麼她帶走了我父母，卻不帶走你。」\n\n\n\n  「他？她？」周澤腦海中浮現出了那個小蘿莉的形象，再結合許清朗那日的狀態和晚上的離開，就猜出了七七八八。\n\n\n\n  「她，不可能吧。」\n\n\n\n  「陰司有序，亡者上路！」許清朗壓低了聲音，盯著周澤的眼睛，「長舌化路引，深喉許幽冥，熟悉麼？」\n\n\n\n  「黑白無常？」\n\n\n\n  「那只是一個統稱。」許清朗嘆了口氣，「但他們確實是執法者，遊歷陽間，肅清秩序，將人和鬼，區分開來。人有人間道，鬼有奈何橋。」\n\n\n\n  「哦。」\n\n\n\n  周澤還是有些不太相信，如果小蘿莉真的是白無常那種的身份，那她之前在校車上顯露出真身吐出長舌頭導致車禍和那位司機的死亡該怎麼算？ \n\n\n\n  「她沒帶走我，反而帶走你父母，所以，你恨我？」周澤伸手指了指自己。\n\n\n\n  「對。」許清朗點頭道。\n\n\n\n  「那這面里沒下毒吧？」\n\n\n\n  「…………」許清朗。\n\n\n\n  「沒下毒吧？」周澤又問道。\n\n\n\n  「沒。」許清朗回答。\n\n\n\n  「那就好。」周澤並不知道，在那天的回鍋肉蓋澆飯里，飯菜里是下了毒的，若不是那天林醫生來得早了一些，可能自己真得吃下那頓飯。\n\n\n\n  「你是真傻還是假傻？」許清朗有些沒好氣地看著周澤，「她為什麼不抓你？」\n\n\n\n  「對啊，她為什麼不抓我？」周澤也問道。\n\n\n\n  「我問你呢！」許清朗提高了聲音。\n\n\n\n  「我也不知道。」周澤攤攤手，「可能，是因為我救了她一次吧。」\n\n\n\n  「…………」許清朗。\n\n\n\n  兩個人的談話，最後以菸頭燒滅了作為終止符。\n\n\n\n  雙方這次算是開門見山了，打破了原本的那種默不作聲地默契。\n\n\n\n  周澤走回自己的店裡，收拾地上的塑料板凳時，卻發現有六張塑料板凳下面都貼著厚度不均的冥鈔。\n\n\n\n  這是看書錢還是吃飯錢？ \n\n\n\n  周澤記得前陣子那個開直播的老道也曾給自己一沓冥鈔，說是能積攢陰德，那麼，他的那些冥鈔就是以這種方式弄來的麼？\n\n\n\n  他是怎麼弄過來的？\n\n\n\n  周澤將冥鈔都收集起來，整整一沓，手感不錯，沒有平日裡見到的那些冥鈔的粗糙，摸在手裡，有絲綢的觸感。\n\n\n\n  這讓周澤想到了老道所說的冥店，和鬼做生意，最好的店鋪當然是冥店，因為那裡賣的東西，也都是給死人的。\n\n\n\n  也因此，如果自己手中現在拿的冥鈔是死人的「鈔票」，那麼開冥店，肯定能比自己賺得更多。\n\n\n\n  腦海中，再次浮現出視頻畫面里坐在櫃檯後面艱難喝粥的男子，\n\n\n\n  周澤忽然覺得，\n\n\n\n  自己好像發現了一件可能會很有趣的事情。\n\n\n\n  當然，再有趣的事兒，現在也沒精力去管了，昨晚一宿沒睡，現在既然回來了，就得好好地補一個覺。\n\n\n\n  周澤將書店捲簾門給拉了下來，上了鎖，不知道為什麼，他的書店正在變得晚上開門的時間比白天多，或許，自己以後有機會可以再訂做一個牌子，\n\n\n\n  叫\n\n\n\n  「深夜書屋。」\n\n\n\n  反正白天也沒什麼生意，書店也一直在虧損著，自己可以隨意地玩一些噱頭，搞一些事情，最爛最壞的結果也不就是現在這個樣子唄。 \n\n\n\n  外賣小哥的事兒是罪大惡極的錯誤，但也給周澤一些啟發。\n\n\n\n  衛生間的洗澡設備已經被裝了起來，周澤買的是電熱水器，脫去衣服，周澤洗了一個澡，換上了一套干整的衣服上了樓。\n\n\n\n  當周澤彎下腰準備調置冰櫃溫度時，整個人卻愣在了那裡，\n\n\n\n  因為在他面前的冰櫃裡，\n\n\n\n  躺著一個人。\n\n\n\n  對方閉著眼，像是陷入了沉睡，呼吸平穩，雙手交叉放在胸前，有著一種小大人似地安逸。\n\n\n\n  很平靜，也很可愛，\n\n\n\n  前提是，\n\n\n\n  她的舌頭如果不會變得那麼長的話。\n\n\n\n  小蘿莉，\n\n\n\n  把自己的巢穴給鵲巢鳩占了。\n\n\n\n  周澤很想大喊一聲，讓隔壁的許清朗同學過來復仇。\n\n\n\n  但想想還是算了，不是他覺得把許清朗喊來復仇是害了他，而是他認為許清朗也沒那個膽子過來復仇，說不定人家來了他還會親切地問候一聲：\n\n\n\n  「您醒了啊？\n\n\n\n  您想吃點什麼？\n\n\n\n  我給您去做。」\n\n\n\n  小蘿莉睜開了眼，她的眸子很深邃，不再是以往見面的清澈和單純。 \n\n\n\n  對方伸出手，周澤幫忙把冰櫃蓋子打開。\n\n\n\n  小蘿莉從裡面坐起來，周澤注意到了，她其實沒有設置溫度，只是選擇了一個通風換氣。\n\n\n\n  「你躺在這裡，不冷麼？」坐在冰櫃裡的小蘿莉開口問道，沒等周澤回答，小蘿莉又開口道：「哦，我忘了，你不一樣。」\n\n\n\n  說完，坐在冰櫃裡的小蘿莉伸手輕輕拍了拍自己身邊的空位置，一臉天真無邪地看向周澤：\n\n\n\n  「一起睡不？」\n\n\n\n  周澤伸手想要揉一揉這個女孩兒的頭，但手在旁邊，卻停了下來。\n\n\n\n  她是黑白無常一類的存在，是陰司在人間的執法者。\n\n\n\n  小蘿莉伸手，她的小手抓住了周澤的大手，把周澤的手按在她的頭上，然後按著周澤的手在自己頭上來回揉了揉。\n\n\n\n  「…………」周澤。\n\n\n\n  「你，很好。」小蘿莉終於從冰櫃裡站起來，但似乎因為腿短的原因，爬出來有些困難。\n\n\n\n  周澤將她從冰櫃裡抱出來，\n\n\n\n  也不知道她之前是怎麼躺進去的。\n\n\n\n  「你，很好。」小蘿莉伸手指著周澤，「重複道。」\n\n\n\n  「額……謝謝。」周澤不知道該如何回復了。 \n\n\n\n  「我要走了。」小蘿莉轉過身，背對著周澤，雙手交叉負於身後，周澤知道她是想表現出一種高山仰止的氣質。\n\n\n\n  但她的問題和許清朗一樣，\n\n\n\n  老天給錯了皮囊。\n\n\n\n  她這個樣子，怎麼都覺得好可愛。\n\n\n\n  憋住，\n\n\n\n  不准笑。\n\n\n\n  周澤在不停地提醒自己，\n\n\n\n  這是黑白無常老爺，\n\n\n\n  不准笑！\n\n\n\n  哈哈哈哈哈！\n\n\n\n  但還是忍不住啊！\n\n\n\n  作死了哈哈哈！\n\n\n\n  完蛋了哈哈哈！\n\n\n\n  憋得越狠笑起來就越誇張，連眼淚都滴出來了。\n\n\n\n  小蘿莉沒理會周澤的笑聲，也沒治周澤一個大不敬之罪，\n\n\n\n  只是問道：\n\n\n\n  「你想，接替我麼？」",

    "content": "\"You want to... take my place?\"\n\nThis question stunned Zhou Ze.\n\nWhat did that mean?\n\nTo go from being an undocumented person, hiding all over the city, to suddenly becoming a local civil servant?\n\nThe pleasant surprise came too suddenly.\n\nZhou Ze was a little afraid to accept.\n\nPies do fall from the sky, but most people who run into such things end up being crushed to death by the pie.\n\nMost importantly, Zhou Ze didn't think that saving her life once was worthy of such a reward.\n\nAfter all, the matter with that driver still hadn't been cleared up. This little loli was very adorable, but that was just her skin.\n\nXu Qinglang had said she once appeared in his shop, stuck out her tongue without a word, and collected the souls of his parents.\n\nNo matter how Xu Qinglang cried and begged, she remained completely unmoved.\n\nYou couldn't expect someone like that to repay a debt of gratitude; you should thank your lucky stars if she didn't turn around and bite you.\n\nAs an Underworld Emissary,\n\nHow many partings of joy and sorrow had she witnessed?\n\nHow much of humanity's evil?\n\nHow much of the ghosts' venomous resentment?\n\nShe was not a simple little girl, nor could she be.\n\n\"What, not talking anymore?\" the little loli asked again.\n\n\"I don't know what to say. Are you just asking casually?\" Zhou Ze asked cautiously.\n\n\"You can say no,\" said the little loli.\n\nThen, silence.\n\nThe little loli added, \"And then, I'll drag you down.\"\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze.\n\nAlright then.\n\nIsn't that much more straightforward?\n\nWho needs multiple-choice questions?\n\nJust fill in the blank.\n\nThe question was basically: write \"Y\" for the answer, or get shot.\n\n\"I agree,\" Zhou Ze replied. This time, there was no hesitation, no indecision.\n\nThe little loli turned around and smiled, looking somewhat innocent and pure. Then she slowly walked over to Zhou Ze, wanting to straighten his collar like a grown-up.\n\nThis seemed to be a gesture a superior would use to show favor to a subordinate, a bit like an ancient emperor granting a minister the chance to dine with him.\n\nIt was just that the little loli was too short. Standing in front of Zhou Ze, she couldn't reach his collar, so she could only help him adjust his belt.\n\n\"Pick me up,\" the little loli pouted, commanding him.\n\nZhou Ze bent down and picked her up.\n\nThe little loli reached out to straighten Zhou Ze's collar, then frowned, seeming to feel that being held by Zhou Ze like a daughter was rather inappropriate.\n\n\"Do I look really stupid like this?\"\n\n\"Very cute.\"\n\nThe little loli raised her small hand, intending to slap Zhou Ze's cheek.\n\nIn that instant, the fingernails of the hand Zhou Ze was using to hold the little loli grew long and black, and black vortexes swirled deep within his eyes.\n\nThe little loli stopped, a meaningful smile playing on her lips.\n\nZhou Ze didn't make any further moves either.\n\n\"Do you know that showing anger and defiance in front of me is a very foolish thing to do?\" the little loli asked.\n\n\"Doesn't matter. I'm already someone who's died once.\"\n\n\"That's because you were lucky. You only walked a small part of the Yellow Springs Road before you left. You've never experienced the pain and torture of the journey through hell!\" the little loli said in a loud voice. \"That kind of torment would make everyone who committed suicide and went to hell regret it endlessly! 'Better to be alive and wretched than dead' is by no means an empty platitude.\"\n\n\"Is that so?\"\n\n\"Put me down.\"\n\nZhou Ze put the little loli down.\n\nThe little loli leaned back slightly, looking at Zhou Ze. \"Do you know why I chose you?\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head.\n\n\"Because you're very smart. Or rather, you're very placid; you know your limits.\" The little loli counted on her fingers. \"The Underworld has its order, and the mortal world has its laws. There are quite a few who sneak out for all sorts of reasons, but you're the most placid one I've ever seen.\"\n\n\"I don't believe that's the real reason,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"The real reason, I don't want to tell you.\" The little loli stretched. \"I'm tired. I want to go down. So, I happened to run into you, and you won't cause me too much trouble, so I picked you.\n\n\"Heh, a while ago in Rongcheng, there was this guy who caused a huge ruckus. He was clearly just a pathetic stowaway, yet he fancied himself a judge. A ghost, yet he deluded himself into thinking he could exercise his own judgment in the mortal world. Don't you think he was an idiot?\"\n\n\"An idiot,\" Zhou Ze replied. Then, he suddenly remembered that the old Daoist priest seemed to be from Rongcheng. \"What happened to him?\"\n\n\"He was taken out of the picture.\"\n\nThe little loli tilted her head, a look of pure innocence on her face. \"The rules are flexible, but for those who cross the line too brazenly, there's no hope at all.\"\n\n\"He died?\" Zhou Ze asked. \"I mean, was he dragged back to hell, or did his soul scatter to the winds?\"\n\nHearing this, a hint of displeasure appeared on the little loli's face, as if he had touched a raw nerve.\n\n\"That, you don't need to know.\"\n\nThe little loli grabbed Zhou Ze's hand, placing her small palm against his.\n\nImmediately, Zhou Ze felt a searing heat in his palm. When the little loli moved her hand away, Zhou Ze saw a black sigil had appeared in the center of his palm.\n\nThe sigil wasn't complex; it looked like an eye.\n\n\"The Underworld has its order, the Yellow Springs can be crossed,\" the little loli said very seriously. \"Those who should go down, you send them down. Those who should be dispersed, you can disperse them directly.\n\n\"Of course, if you want to 'see injustice on the road and let out a roar,'¹\n\n\"that's fine too.\n\n\"But you'll have to bear the consequences yourself.\n\n\"If you screw up, you deal with it.\"\n\nThe little loli yawned, as if she were tired.\n\n\"You said you're tired, so how long will you be resting? Is this... like I'm covering your shift?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"We'll talk when I get back,\" the little loli said, preparing to go downstairs.\n\nZhou Ze continued to ask, \"So what do I have to do? Go out on patrol every night?\n\n\"Look for ghosts?\n\n\"And then,\n\n\"deal with ghosts?\"\n\n\"The door is in your hands; you can figure it out. You can keep running your bookstore. You're a ghost, a ghost possessing a corpse. Those filthy things and all that other riff-raff will naturally flock to you.\n\n\"To them, you're a candle in the night, and they're the moths.\n\n\"Furthermore, after I left that mark on you, it's like I upgraded you from a candle to an incandescent lightbulb, bright enough to blind their damn dog eyes.\"\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze.\n\nThe little loli went downstairs, and Zhou Ze followed.\n\n\"I'll read for a bit, then I'll be going. This body's mother will be here to pick her up soon.\"\n\nThe little loli sat down on a plastic chair and casually picked up an illustrated book to flip through.\n\nZhou Ze stood beside her, not to wait on her, but because he had some questions to ask.\n\n\"Go on, ask,\" the little loli said.\n\n\"Is there... a salary?\" Zhou Ze asked. \"You know, this business of mine is a money-losing venture.\"\n\n\"The economy's in a slump. Money from the living is getting harder and harder to earn these days,\" the little loli lamented.\n\n\"Yeah, it is,\" Zhou Ze agreed.\n\n\"Then just earn money from the dead.\"\n\n\"Can't spend money from the dead,\" Zhou Ze shrugged.\n\n\"That's because you're not doing it right.\" The little loli held out her hand. \"Bring me some spirit money. The kind that... the dead give you.\"\n\nZhou Ze took out a stack of spirit money and placed half of it in the little loli's hand.\n\n\"You've earned quite a bit,\" the little loli glanced at it and smiled.\n\nZhou Ze didn't mention that half of it was from the old Daoist priest from Rongcheng. Inexplicably, Zhou Ze felt that letting this little loli know about it would bring him trouble.\n\nThe little loli took the money, pushed open the bookstore door, and squatted down by the roadside.\n\n\"Lighter.\"\n\nZhou Ze handed her the lighter.\n\nThe little loli burned the spirit money, and the ashes were quickly blown away by the wind.\n\nThen, the little loli stood up and clapped her hands. \"Alright.\"\n\nZhou Ze stood in the wind, feeling a bit disoriented.\n\n\"Is this an advance deposit into my account at the Underworld bank?\"\n\n\"Just wait and see. This place of yours... still doesn't have enough human traffic.\" The little loli and Zhou Ze, one big and one small, stood waiting at the shop entrance for about half an hour.\n\nThe wind had blown the little loli's delicate face a little red. Zhou Ze wasn't afraid of the cold, but standing by the roadside looking around like a pair of idiots felt very strange.\n\nFinally,\n\na pot-bellied man walked past them. Then, a wallet fell from the man's pocket. He didn't notice at all and kept walking.\n\nZhou Ze went to pick up the wallet and found it contained several thousand yuan, along with an ID card, bank cards, and other things.\n\n\"Should I go return it to him?\" Zhou Ze asked tentatively.\n\nThe little loli burst out laughing with a \"pfft.\"\n\n\"That man has a guilty conscience. Consider this him spending money to avert disaster. This money is rightfully yours.\"\n\nThe little loli pushed open the door and entered the bookstore, then rubbed her hands together. Clearly, she had gotten quite cold during that half hour; it was warmer inside the bookstore.\n\nZhou Ze walked in with the wallet, asking in disbelief, \"He won't call the police?\"\n\n\"This money, you can take it. It won't burn your hands at all,\" the little loli said, a little impatiently.\n\n\"Alright. So in the future, if I'm short on cash, I can just stand at the door and burn spirit money, and someone will deliver money to me?\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't know whether to laugh or cry, but he also found it interesting.\n\nJust then, Xu Qinglang walked over, carrying a large bottle of sour plum juice.\n\n\"Hey, these are all the ingredients I have in the shop, this is all I could make. For the rest, you'll have to wait...\"\n\nXu Qinglang had just pushed open the door and come in when he saw the little loli sitting there. He stumbled, and the bottle in his hand fell to the floor, shattering into pieces.\n\nSour plum juice splashed all over the bookstore floor.\n\nZhou Ze looked at Xu Qinglang, signaling him to control himself.\n\nThe little loli seemed to completely ignore Xu Qinglang's existence.\n\nIndeed, a person who was lucky enough to have some knowledge of the mystic arts was really not worth a second glance from her.\n\n\"Whose daughter is this? So cute, hahahaha. Come, little friend, uncle has a tank of little goldfish at home, want to come home with uncle to see them?\"\n\nXu Qinglang's smile was very awkward, forced out.\n\nThe little loli just spat out a single word: \"Scram.\"\n\nXu Qinglang smiled again, turned around, and went back to his own shop.\n\n\"Do you think I'm being unreasonable?\" The little loli looked up at Zhou Ze.\n\n\"A little,\" Zhou Ze said honestly.\n\n\"Then what if I also told you that the driver's death was just because I was bored on the school bus at the time, revealed my true form, and wanted to play a joke?\n\n\"Would you think that...\n\n\"...was even more out of line?\"\n\nThe little loli tilted her head, looking at Zhou Ze with a blank, adorable expression.\n\n***\n\n**Footnotes:**\n\n1.

    "content": "\"Is that going too far?\"\n\nThis was a question Zhou Ze couldn't answer. Whether the little loli was telling the truth or not, he had no standing to question her further.\n\nIt was frustrating, but it was the truth.\n\nAlthough he’d heard from the Rongcheng loli about that \"fellow\" in Rongcheng who, as a ghost,妄图 attempted to become the judge of the mortal world...\n\nZhou Ze was envious and full of admiration, but that ghost’s end was also a lamentable one.\n\nWhen you lack the capital and the power to stand on the same level as the other party, you don't even have the right to an equal conversation. Where would the right to interrogate come from?\n\n\"Boring.\" The little loli shook her head, but then she smiled. \"But that's precisely what I admire about you.\"\n\nThe little loli continued to hold the book in both hands as if she were about to fall asleep, and murmured:\n\n\"You're the one person I've met who truly knows their own damn place.\"¹\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze.\n\nWas that a compliment or an insult?\n\n\"I have to go.\" The little loli was getting sleepier and more fatigued.\n\n\"I have one more question. Eating and sleeping—is there really no other way to solve or improve these issues?\" This was the question Zhou Ze most wanted to ask, the problem he was most desperate to solve.\n\nSince his return by borrowing a corpse, he could perfectly integrate into society, except for these two problems.\n\n\"In terms of stability, an assembled computer is never as good as a pre-built one.\" The little loli shook her head weakly. \"As for sleeping, unless you have a creature of Yin from Hell next to you, providing an environmental magnetic field similar to that of Hell, you simply can't rest.\n\n\"You are originally a person of Hell. Lingering in the mortal world is like being unable to acclimate to a new environment—and the most severe case of it. Because you're a bit special, you can still rely on special methods to manage. Others can't sleep at all. Half a year without sleep would drive them mad, or even kill them!\n\n\"So, you're already considered lucky.\"\n\nThe little loli let out a couple of weak \"hehe\"s. \"If I weren't going back, you could just hold me while you sleep.\"\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze.\n\n\"As for eating, I still can't get used to the food of the mortal world.\"\n\nAfter saying this, the little loli's head tilted to the side, and she fell directly into a deep sleep. Zhou Ze reached out and steadied her. Seeing that she was still breathing and her body was normal, he breathed a sigh of relief.\n\nZhou Ze used to be a doctor, so he could naturally tell the girl was fine.\n\nThis little one was Wang Ke's daughter; he couldn't just watch something happen to her.\n\nHowever, what disappointed Zhou Ze a little was that the scene of the little loli's departure was a bit too ordinary.\n\n\"Shouldn't she have vanished into the ground with a 'biu' sound? Is just falling asleep considered going back?\" Zhou Ze muttered to himself.\n\nIt wasn't grand, and there was nothing to see, just like drawing a talisman on his own palm.\n\nNo sense of ceremony at all, no flair.\n\nThe little loli in his arms suddenly opened her eyes and said, \"Alright.\"\n\nZhou Ze froze for a moment. She was faking it!\n\nThe next moment, a cloud of Yin energy so thick it seemed about to condense into droplets surged from the little loli's body. Even with the central air conditioning on, the temperature in Zhou Ze's bookstore plummeted in an instant.\n\nThe door was closed, but gusts of cold wind whipped through the room, accompanied by the sound of book pages flipping.\n\nA vast shadow covered the area, like the awakening of a ferocious beast, bringing with it a pressure only ghosts could perceive.\n\nStimulated by this, Zhou Ze's fingernails grew out again, and he felt his blood surge as if the power within his body was responding to hers.\n\nAnd then,\n\nIt really was,\n\nwith a \"biu,\"\n\nall the Yin energy instantly rushed into a single point in the ground.\n\nIn a flash,\n\nthe clouds dissipated,\n\nthe temperature returned to normal,\n\nthe sun shone through.\n\nIn that daze, it seemed to truly echo the line:\n\n*Like birds to the woods when food is gone, leaving a vast, white, and truly clean land!*²\n\n***\n\nIn the evening, Xu Qinglang brought dinner. The plum juice was gone, replaced by bitter melon juice.\n\n\"The... uh... 'sour-sweetie' juice³ is gone. Make do with bitter melon juice for now.\"\n\nXu Qinglang said, a little embarrassed. During the day, seeing the little loli had scared him witless.\n\nIn truth, he understood that he was a coward and quite useless.\n\nWhen the little loli had taken his parents' souls, he didn't dare to confront her for revenge, much less resist. He could only kneel there and beg like a weakling.\n\nMoreover, he had even redirected his anger toward Zhou Ze, attempting to poison his food.\n\nNow, Xu Qinglang had come to terms with it. So what if he was a coward? He was just a minor mystic who happened to have Yin-Yang Eyes due to his physical constitution. He really didn't have the guts to face a Hell emissary.\n\nIn fact, the little loli could have punished him for privately detaining his parents' souls—deducting his mortal lifespan or even dragging his soul out and taking it back to Hell.\n\nShe had treated him like a fart in the wind and just let him go.\n\nThere was no need for him to keep making a fuss.\n\nThe dead can't be brought back to life, and his previous actions were indeed a violation of the heavenly dao.\n\nAfter finishing his meal, Zhou Ze placed a thousand yuan in front of Xu Qinglang.\n\n\"This is for the previous meals, plus for future ones. Let me know when it runs out.\"\n\n\"Yo, got money now?\" A slight smile finally appeared on Xu Qinglang's face. He then pushed the money back towards Zhou Ze and said softly, \"Life isn't easy. Don't be a big spender. You have to think of your home.\"\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze.\n\n\"I'm a man with over twenty properties. I look down on your little bit of money.\"\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze really wanted to say that he would soon be rich too. As long as he earned more money from the dead and then played around by burning spirit money at his door, some idiot would show up and toss a wallet at his shop like a money-scattering acolyte.\n\nBut then Zhou Ze thought again,\n\nEven if he burned a truckload of spirit money, he probably couldn't burn his way into twenty-something properties, right?\n\nUnless an armored car had an accident right in front of his shop...\n\n\"I'm thinking of changing storefronts. What about you?\" Xu Qinglang suddenly asked.\n\n\"Where to?\"\n\n\"Anywhere is better than here.\" Xu Qinglang smiled. \"I plan to move the noodle shop to a county town below. The scale will be a bit smaller, but at least it'll be more popular.\"\n\n\"I'll see,\" Zhou Ze replied dismissively.\n\n\"Alright, I'm heading out.\"\n\nXu Qinglang collected the bowl and chopsticks and walked out of the Underworld Shop.\n\nZhou Ze, meanwhile, trimmed his nails while looking at the symbol on his palm. It was evening, and no customers had arrived yet. Zhou Ze was getting anxious. Before, when he saw no hope, he just muddled through one day at a time. Now that he saw a glimmer of hope for making money, his initiative naturally kicked in.\n\n*Well? Still no customers?*\n\n*Didn't she say I was an incandescent lamp?*\n\n*That I could blind their ghost eyes?*\n\n*Come on!*\n\n*Were they all blinded and got lost?*\n\n\"Creeeak...\"\n\nThe bookstore door was pushed open, and two women walked in.\n\nOne was very young, about the same age as Zhou Ze (Xu Le), and the other looked to be almost fifty, like a mother and daughter.\n\nZhou Ze recognized the young woman.\n\nShe was the first customer since he opened. He remembered she had come in with a Corgi, sat for a while reading a book, and left him a hundred yuan—his first income.\n\nOnly this time, the woman didn't have her Corgi but was with her mother.\n\n\"Sigh, sit here. Be careful, check if there's anything dirty on it,\" the older woman said to the girl.\n\nThe girl bent down, took out a tissue, wiped the plastic stool, and then sat down dejectedly.\n\n\"Pick up a book and read, my dear. There are no problems that can't be solved, no hurdles in life that can't be overcome. Try to look on the bright side,\" the woman advised from the side.\n\n\"Sigh.\" The girl sighed, her face still downcast. She clearly hadn't taken the words to heart.\n\n\"My dear, pick up a book. When you read, you forget about time,\" the woman squatted beside the girl, continuing her attempts to console her, the very picture of a loving parent's heart.\n\nZhou Ze was still trimming his nails, paying them no mind.\n\nJust then, the girl looked at Zhou Ze and said:\n\n\"Boss.\"\n\nThe girl's voice was soft, with a piteous look that could stir compassion, as if she had just gone through a breakup and was at her most vulnerable.\n\nOf course, to a seasoned pro, this was the easiest time to slip in and \"strike.\"\n\n\"You're the boss, right?\" The older woman looked at Zhou Ze, like a mother hen protecting her chick.\n\n\"What is it?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"What are you thinking?\" the woman said warily. \"Daughter, ignore him.\"\n\nThe girl was silent for a moment, but finally spoke up:\n\n\"Beibei is missing.\"\n\nBeibei must be the name of the Corgi.\n\n\"Missing?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Yeah, missing.\" The girl's eyes were red, and as she thought of her beloved dog, tears welled up again. \"When I was cleaning the house, he slipped out without me noticing.\"\n\n\"If it's lost, it's lost. We can just buy another one. What's there to cry about?\" the woman consoled.\n\nZhou Ze stood up and walked over.\n\n\"What are you doing?\" the woman pointed at Zhou Ze.\n\n\"You'll find him,\" Zhou Ze said, ignoring the woman and comforting the girl.\n\n\"Mm.\"\n\nThe girl cried, then reached out and hugged Zhou Ze's shoulders.\n\n\"You scoundrel! She lost her dog, not her man! What are you getting so close for!\" The woman postured as if to rush over and hit Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Is there a place for you to speak here?\"\n\nA black gleam flickered in Zhou Ze's eyes.\n\nThe woman immediately let out a shriek and crumpled to the ground, too scared to blabber on.\n\n\"What's wrong?\" The girl looked up, bewildered. She didn't know who Zhou Ze had just been talking to.\n\nZhou Ze let the girl go. When a person's emotions are at their lowest, the three lamps⁴ on their body are at their weakest, making it easy for dirty things to latch onto them.\n\nFortunately, this woman, perhaps just lonely and talkative after a long time, wasn't actually a bad person.\n\n\"I posted a lost dog notice online. I want to find him,\" the girl said, taking out her phone to show Zhou Ze a picture of the dog.\n\n\"Boss, have you seen him?\"\n\nZhou Ze gave a wry smile. His business was so dead, people hardly ever came, let alone dogs.\n\nBut the woman, who had been scared into a heap on the floor by Zhou Ze, suddenly shouted:\n\n\"I've seen that dog! I've seen that dog, right in my neighborhood! When my husband and that little vixen were at it, I couldn't stand being in the house, so I went out into the neighborhood to clear my head. I saw someone walking this dog!\"\n\n***\n**Footnotes:**\n1.  **\"knows their own damn place\"**: The original Chinese is a coarse slang phrase, `心裡有逼數` (*xīnlǐ yǒu bī shù*), which literally means \"to have a f***ing number in one's heart.\" It means to be brutally self-aware of one's own limitations and status and to not overstep.\n2.  **\"Like birds to the woods...\"**: This is a famous line from the classic Chinese novel *Dream of the Red Chamber*.

    "content": "\"Where is it?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Xingfa Complex. A man and his daughter were walking it, I remember,\" the woman said with conviction. \"I even knew that man when I was alive, even argued with him! To think he actually tried to take advantage of me, tried to hit on me!\"\n\nZhou Ze frowned slightly and warned, \"If you're lying to me or trying to pull some ghostly 'borrow-a-knife-to-kill-someone' trick, I'll make sure you can't even be a ghost anymore.\"\n\n\"How could I, Brother? Even though I'm dead, I'm still a good person. Go ask around my old neighborhood, who doesn't say that Sister Hong is a warm-hearted, good person?\"\n\nZhou Ze waved a hand, signaling for her to be quiet.\n\nThe little girl didn't know who Zhou Ze was talking to. Of course, Zhou Ze's voice was also very low, as if he were muttering to himself.\n\n\"A friend of mine seems to have mentioned that a family in Xingfa Complex has a dog that looks a lot like this one. You should go there and ask,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Really? Okay, I'll go right now.\"\n\nThe girl finished speaking and took out her wallet to pay.\n\n\"Forget it, it's not necessary.\"\n\n\"I should. Thank you for the information, boss.\" The girl took out five hundred yuan and insisted on stuffing it into Zhou Ze's hand.\n\n\"Let's wait until you've found the dog,\" Zhou Ze said, still refusing the money.\n\n\"Well, thank you, boss.\"\n\nThe girl wiped away her tears and left the bookstore.\n\n\"What a good girl,\" the woman said, still sitting on the bookstore's tile floor.\n\n\"You can get lost now.\"\n\n\"Brother, it took me forever to find someone who can hear me talk. Can't you just keep your big sister company and chat for a while?\"\n\nThe woman looked as if she had been desperately holding it all in for a very, very long time.\n\n\"No time.\"\n\nZhou Ze sat back down behind the counter, picked up a nail clipper, and continued trimming his nails.\n\n\"Brother, with your bookstore open here, you probably don't get much business, do you?\" the woman said, still trying to make conversation.\n\nZhou Ze seemed to suddenly remember something and asked, \"Want to go down?\"\n\n\"Go down?\" The woman paused, apparently not understanding.\n\n\"To the place you're supposed to be right now.\" Only then did Zhou Ze remember that he was currently something of a part-time ghost messenger.\n\n\"Can I not go down?\" the woman asked, looking troubled. \"My son has his college entrance exams¹ this year. I want to stay with him until they're over before I go.\"\n\nAh, the things a parent's heart will endure.\n\n\"If your son knew his dead mother was still keeping him company while he studies at night, he'd definitely be moved to tears,\" Zhou Ze teased.\n\nMoved to tears was probably unlikely, but being scared sick and ending up completely bombing his college entrance exams was a very real possibility.\n\n\"I'll just watch from the side,\" the woman said, somewhat aggrieved.\n\n\"Suit yourself.\" Zhou Ze waved his hand, not bothering to say more. The little loli had said when she gave him the job that unless he deliberately crossed the line to act as some blasted Judge of the Underworld, he could otherwise just go by his mood.\n\nBesides, the little loli hadn't given him any performance reports or quotas for how many ghosts he had to collect per month or quarter.\n\n\"Brother, how did you become human?\" the woman asked, very curious.\n\nZhou Ze frowned slightly.\n\nThe woman's body trembled a few times in a row, and she immediately dared not speak again.\n\nAbout fifteen minutes later, the woman muttered to herself that her son should be coming home from his evening self-study session, and left the bookstore.\n\nAfter she left, Zhou Ze specifically went over and flipped over the stool she had just been sitting on. He didn't see a single note of spirit money.\n\n\"A woman who knows how to be frugal, after all.\"\n\nZhou Ze sighed, wondering if perhaps he was too nice.\n\nHe was, at the very least, a temporary ghost messenger, a person on the establishment's payroll. How dare this woman come empty-handed and leave empty-handed?\n\nDo they really not treat temporary workers like proper officials?\n\nPushing open the door, Zhou Ze stepped out of the bookstore, took out a cigarette, and lit it. Next door, Xu Qinglang seemed to have just finished cleaning up and came out wearing an apron. He looked at Zhou Ze, then squatted down beside him and bummed a cigarette.\n\nThe two men squatted in a row.\n\nBehind them was the nearly defunct commercial center; before them, an empty road.\n\n\"Did that little girl's mom pick her up?\" Xu Qinglang asked.\n\n\"She went down,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\n\"Oh, went down.\" Xu Qinglang exhaled a puff of smoke. \"Once you go down, it's hard to come back, isn't it?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" Zhou Ze said, shaking his head.\n\nJust as the little loli had said, when he went to Hell, he had only walked a short stretch of the Yellow Springs Road before coming out. He had never experienced the true horrors of Hell at all.\n\n\"What is Hell actually like?\" Xu Qinglang asked, blowing a smoke ring.\n\n\"I'm not very familiar with it.\"\n\nThere was nothing left to talk about, but going back into their respective shops felt even more boring. After finishing their first cigarettes, the two of them very naturally lit up a second.\n\n\"What about that wife of yours?\" Xu Qinglang asked, knowing full well how to pick at a scab.\n\n\"We're separated,\" Zhou Ze said with a purse of his lips.\n\n\"Heh heh.\"\n\nThen, silence again.\n\nNext, a third cigarette.\n\n\"I have to go back to my hometown for a bit soon. I'll make a new batch of plum juice tomorrow and leave some for you.\"\n\n\"Thanks. You're not from around here?\"\n\n\"I'm from Menghai.\"\n\nMenghai was a county district under the administration of Tongcheng.\n\n\"A relative of mine is getting married. To be honest, I don't want to go, but I have to. After all, it's a friendship forged from playing in the mud together and shamelessly following wedding processions to ask for red envelopes and lucky money.\"\n\n\"Is he asking you to be a bridesmaid?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Yes, a bridesmaid...\" Xu Qinglang caught on and immediately shot Zhou Ze a glare. \"The best man.\"\n\n\"Were you married in your past life?\" Xu Qinglang suddenly asked.\n\n\"Nope,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\n\"Well, that's great. It's like you got a free wife this life.\"\n\n\"She's not...\"\n\nZhou Ze paused, not continuing.\n\nThe lingering attachment...\n\nXu Le's lingering attachment...\n\nIt's still there!\n\nYes, that must be it.\n\n\"Since I'm alive, I should live well. My parents are gone, completely gone. I've come to terms with it. I have to grow up, have to find my own life.\n\nMaybe I'll even find a girlfriend in a little while.\"\n\n\"A boyfriend is more likely,\" Zhou Ze said, blowing a smoke ring, adding insult to injury.\n\n\"Heh heh, since I was little, I've been designing my future wedding in my head—what style, what fashion, what kind of spectacle...\"\n\n\"Isn't that something girls think about?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Can't a man have dreams? You, shut your mouth, or there'll be no juice for you tomorrow!\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded. *Fine, I'll shut my mouth.*\n\n\"I plan to have a traditional-style wedding, a really retro one.\n\nI don't want any luxury cars. I want an eight-bearer sedan chair, just like in the movies.\n\nThen I'll rent a horse, put on a Magua jacket or a Hanfu robe.\n\nThat kind of atmosphere...\n\nYou know?\"\n\nZhou Ze stretched out a hand and pointed forward.\n\n\"You mean like that?\"\n\nXu Qinglang froze for a second, then squinted his eyes. \"What thing?\"\n\n\"You can't see it?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nXu Qinglang's expression hardened. He hurried back into his shop. Soon, he was rubbing something shiny onto his eyes. Then, he let out a cry of alarm.\n\nIndeed, on the empty street ahead, a red, eight-bearer sedan chair was advancing toward them.\n\nThe chair bearers had red sashes tied around their waists and red ceremonial caps on their heads. The eight of them moved in perfect unison.\n\nAs they advanced, their steps followed a rhythm of nine shallow and one deep.²\n\nBecause of this, the sedan chair would jolt every so often, and the bearers, along with the two suona players in front, would hop in unison.\n\nIt had a very festive look.\n\nBut for such a scene to suddenly appear in this deserted area was enough to scare the living daylights out of any passerby.\n\nEven Xu Qinglang, faced with this spectacle, was momentarily slack-jawed and at a loss for what to do.\n\n\"Your wife?\" Zhou Ze asked, pointing at the approaching wedding procession.\n\n\"Bullshit.\" Xu Qinglang took a few steps back, almost retreating into his shop. Seeing Zhou Ze still squatting there, he shouted, \"Aren't you going back inside? That's a ghostly wedding procession!\"\n\n\"Will they toss an embroidered ball?\" Zhou Ze patted his pant legs and slowly stood up.\n\n\"If they catch you, you'll be their press-ganged husband,\"³ Xu Qinglang snorted. \"Do you want to be a bookstore owner, or do you want to be dragged off to be some ghost-woman's husband?\"\n\n\"Is it that serious?\"\n\nZhou Ze was a bit surprised. The ghosts he had seen before didn't have this kind of power—or more accurately, this kind of influence.\n\nIf the master in that sedan chair could really snatch a person's soul to go back with her and \"get married,\" should he intervene or not?\n\nHe could turn a blind eye to that woman—once her son finished his college exams, her lingering attachment would probably fade and she'd dissipate and report to Hell on her own. But this one before him...\n\nWith such a grand procession, this was definitely not some simple character.\n\nZhou Ze still didn't move. Xu Qinglang, standing inside his shop, looked up at the paper talismans pasted above his door but still felt uneasy. Seeing Zhou Ze remain unmoved, he grew even angrier and cursed, \"You're just a rookie ghost! Those are powerful spirits that have been around! Back off, and maybe she'll leave you alone.\"\n\nZhou Ze still didn't move. Vaguely, he could feel the mark on his palm growing slightly hot, as if reminding him that the entity before him needed to be sent down below, otherwise it would affect the mortal realm.\n\nWhen he had let the woman leave earlier, the mark had no reaction, which was a tacit approval. But this time, the mark was warning him.\n\nBeing a temp...\n\n...is not easy.\n\nUsually, when something goes wrong or there's a blunder at work, it's the temporary worker who takes the fall.\n\nZhou Ze was in that very awkward position right now.\n\nThe wedding procession stopped about ten meters away from Zhou Ze.\n\nTwo bearers reached out and lifted the sedan chair's curtain.\n\nIt was empty inside.\n\nOne of the suona players walked toward Zhou Ze and bowed deeply a meter away from him.\n\n\"Our Lady has heard of Your Excellency's recent promotion and has ordered us to invite Your Excellency to her estate to offer our congratulations.\"\n\nThis suona player was handsome and refined, but his skin was very pale, and his blush and lipstick were a bit excessive, just like one of the paper effigies sold in a funeral shop.\n\n\"You became a ghost messenger?\" Xu Qinglang walked out of his shop, a sense of disbelief on his face, as if his dirt-poor next-door neighbor, Wang Xiaodan, had suddenly become the town mayor.\n\n\"If you get rich, don't forget your friends! And you were even hiding it from me!\" Xu Qinglang came over and complained to Zhou Ze. The flair in his manner was so sharp and crisp it could make a poplar tree bend.\n\n\"This humble one has a matter to inquire of Your Excellency,\" the suona player asked, bowing respectfully.\n\n\"Speak! What is it? No problem, it's on him! From now on, he's in charge of this whole area!\" Xu Qinglang said, putting on airs and relishing the role he was usurping, acting fabulously over-the-top.\n\n\"While ordering us to receive Your Excellency, our Lady also wished for us to capture a man to return with us for marriage.\n\nWe've heard that this man has over twenty properties in the mortal world, a perfect match for our Lady.\n\nMay I ask Your Excellency if you know where this man is?\"\n\n\"...\" said Xu Qinglang.\n\n***\n\n¹ **College entrance exams (高考, gāokǎo):** The notoriously difficult and life-defining national college entrance examination in China.\n\n² **Nine shallow and one deep (九淺一深):** A rhythmic phrase originating from classical Chinese erotic literature describing a sexual technique.

    "content": "The times are decadent, and people are not what they used to be!\n\n***\n\nMany people lament this current era, where the whole of society has been scoured beyond recognition by the tides of mammonism, where even marriage is placed on a scale to be traded for equal value.\n\nHowever, in this day and age, even ghosts have started to care about this sort of thing when getting married!\n\nYou have over twenty houses for the living?\n\nWhat a coincidence,\n\nmy mistress has over twenty houses for the dead.\n\nA perfect match!\n\nJoyous, joyous,\n\na joy for all!\n\nAfter the old man with the suona asked this question, the corner of Zhou Ze's mouth twitched subconsciously.\n\nHe was holding back a laugh, and at the same time, deep down, he was feeling truly pleased.\n\nThis neighbor of his, who was always running his mouth about \"I have twenty-something properties,\" was someone Zhou Ze had long wanted to smack. This ghost mistress had truly come at the right time.\n\nWhat goes around, comes around!\n\nXu Qinglang was so scared that sweat started pouring out. He was an occultist, but that amounted to little more than opening his Yin-Yang Eyes, playing with some puppets, and incorporating some tricks from \"Sichuan Opera face-changing.\" He wasn't a Celestial Master Zhang-type figure in the true sense; otherwise, he wouldn't have been so cowardly when facing the little loli.\n\nInstantly snapping back to his senses, Xu Qinglang began to raise his head,\n\nstaring at the sky.\n\nWhat did you say?\n\nI don't understand.\n\nThat person,\n\nI don't know him.\n\nThen, Xu Qinglang's eyelid suddenly twitched, because he saw that Zhou Ze's right hand, which had been at his side, now had its index finger raised and pointed directly at him.\n\n\"@#￥%……*&*!!!!!\"\n\nA torrent of ten thousand bottles of sour plum juice rushed through Xu Qinglang's heart!\n\nThe two suona players walked right up to either side of Xu Qinglang and said respectfully,\n\n\"We invite the young master to enter the sedan.\"\n\nWell, what do you know. So this sedan wasn't here to pick up a Hell Emissary after all, but was specially brought by that ghost mistress to welcome her new groom.\n\nZhou Ze once again redefined his identity as a \"temporary worker\" in his mind.\n\n\"Don't pull me, don't drag me, don't force me!\n\nWatch out, or I'll turn nasty!\"\n\nXu Qinglang was being pushed toward the sedan by the suona players, but he kept struggling nonstop.\n\nHe had just said he wanted to start a new life and find a partner and all that, but he hadn't intended to get involved with a ghost!\n\n\"Zhou Ze, you set me up! You've doomed me!\" Xu Qinglang shouted, giving off the distinct impression of a virtuous maiden being forced into prostitution.\n\nDeath before dishonor,\n\nchastity eternal!\n\n\"Go check it out. Maybe the ghost mistress looks just like Joey Wang. You wouldn't be losing out, would you?\" Zhou Ze said with a smile.\n\nXu Qinglang was pushed into the sedan. The suona player said to Zhou Ze, \"Your Excellency may follow us. We will lead the way.\"\n\nAfter speaking, the suona player even pointed at the electric scooter parked at Xu Qinglang's door:\n\n\"Your Excellency may ride this.\"\n\nZhou Ze remembered that the last time he rode in that ghost driver's paper car, he was still delivered safely to the bookstore's entrance. So, it was clear that some ghostly beings did possess abilities similar to Qimen Dunjia; physical theories likely didn't apply to them.\n\nThe electric scooter belonged to Xu Qinglang. Zhou Ze didn't stand on ceremony. After locking up the shop, he hopped on the scooter and followed the sedan.\n\nThe sedan bearers walked very quickly.\n\nTheir steps still followed the pattern of nine shallow, one deep.\n\nEvery time they hit that \"deep\" step, the eight bearers and two suona players would all hop in unison, causing the bridal sedan to jolt along with them.\n\nImmediately after,\n\nXu Qinglang, sitting in the bridal sedan, would let out a cry of \"Ah!\"\n\nIt was like the light chirp of an oriole, melodious and enticing, sparking one's imagination.\n\nBy the time Zhou Ze had ridden his scooter alongside the bridal sedan, Xu Qinglang lifted the window curtain. Seen from the outside, Xu Qinglang's face was now flushed, and his eyes seemed to radiate a well-moistened autumn shimmer.\n\nHis pearly teeth bit his red lips, the very picture of a shy, lovely, and handsome figure.\n\nJust then, it was time for the bearers' \"deep\" step. The sedan suddenly lifted.\n\n\"Ah!\"\n\nXu Qinglang cried out subconsciously again, a look of vexation on his face as he stared daggers at Zhou Ze, truly overcome with shame and mortification!\n\nZhou Ze held the scooter's handlebars with one hand and waved dismissively with the other, saying with disgust,\n\n\"Shameless.\"\n\n\"This sedan affects the soul! It stimulates the soul!\" Xu Qinglang had no choice but to explain. He was genuinely worried Zhou Ze would think he was lost in enjoyment and unable to pull himself away.\n\n\"An explanation is just a cover-up,\" Zhou Ze said. \"Your mouth says no, but your body is honest.\"\n\n\"...\" Xu Qinglang.\n\nShooting one last hateful glance at Zhou Ze, Xu Qinglang lowered the curtain.\n\nThat glance was like one you'd give to a heartless lover who would willingly sacrifice you for his own fame and fortune!\n\nIn truth, Zhou Ze could see that the sedan bearers and suona players were moving according to a specific rhythm. They were just puppets, their original forms likely being paper effigies from a paper offering shop, somewhat similar to the wooden oxen and gliding horses designed by Zhuge Liang during the Three Kingdoms period.\n\nThe bearers continued their \"nine shallow, one deep.\"\n\nXu Qinglang would let out an \"Ah!\" every so often.\n\nZhou Ze followed along on his little electric scooter.\n\nBefore he knew it, the procession had already passed through the city center and entered the Tongzhou District.\n\nA few years ago, Tongzhou District was still a county under Tongcheng's jurisdiction, having only recently been redesignated from a county to a district. Zhou Ze had been here once before when he was helping the old woman from the morgue find her money.\n\nFinally, the procession of bearers entered a patch of wasteland just off to the side of Jianghai Avenue. The area was surrounded by tall buildings, and this spot had likely been left undeveloped due to some special reason.\n\nThe road inside was no longer easy to drive on. Zhou Ze had no choice but to get off and push the scooter forward.\n\nAfter another few dozen meters,\n\nsuddenly,\n\nthe view opened up completely!\n\nThe originally dark and lonely wasteland was suddenly festooned with lanterns and colorful decorations. Ahead, more than twenty open-air banquet tables were set up, each with ten cold dishes arranged neatly upon it.\n\nA sea of heads, piles of rouge and powder, soft laughter and chatter.\n\nA busybody raised his voice and shouted, \"The groom has arrived!\"\n\nIn an instant, a swarm of powdered and perfumed ladies in skirts rushed over. Zhou Ze felt himself surrounded by a lively flock of chattering women. Some passed right through his body and scooter, back and forth, tirelessly.\n\nAll the while, Zhou Ze's right hand remained tightly clenched, the mark still burning.\n\nActually, even without the mark's reminder, Zhou Ze knew clearly that this place was likely something a Hell Emissary needed to resolve.\n\nBecause the ghosts here, under the call of that ghost mistress, had already become organized. This, of course, could not be tolerated!\n\nBut Zhou Ze kept holding back. For one, he had just become a temporary worker and wasn't in a rush to be the new broom that sweeps clean; otherwise, he might just get himself burned. After all, whenever something went wrong in any department in the mortal world, it was always the temporary workers who came out to take the fall. Zhou Ze figured the underworld was probably much the same, since people from the mortal world were the ones who went to the underworld after they died.\n\nFurthermore, Zhou Ze was also aware that if it were really so easy to handle, why didn't that little loli resolve it herself?\n\nThe other party even dared to come to his door and invite him, a Hell Emissary, to offer congratulations, which was enough to show how fearless they were due to the backing they had.\n\n\"Lower the sedan!\"\n\nThe bearers lowered the sedan in unison. Xu Qinglang was pushed out. He was very reserved, very bashful, and at the same time, overcome with shame and indignation.\n\n\"The mistress invites you.\"\n\nA woman in a black, ancient-style dress walked up to Zhou Ze and Xu Qinglang and curtsied.\n\n\"Let's go.\"\n\nZhou Ze patted Xu Qinglang on the shoulder.\n\nXu Qinglang slapped Zhou Ze's hand away with great disdain but still followed him forward.\n\nThey walked through the banquet area. Watching the various ghouls and ghosts point and whisper at them, Zhou Ze felt genuinely ill at ease. Fortunately, by the time they reached a small, two-story red building, the cacophony of miscellaneous voices finally faded away.\n\nThe building was decorated with lanterns and streamers, hung with large red lanterns, and had fresh New Year's couplets, creating a scene of lively celebration.\n\nThe layout of the house was very similar to a modern one, with the living room in the center where the main door opened. The maid in the black dress gestured for Zhou Ze and Xu Qinglang to enter.\n\n\"Are you excited?\" Zhou Ze suddenly asked. \"If she really has the same air as Joey Wang, don't you get so happy you forget to come home.\"\n\n\"I hope she's into 'one dragon playing with two phoenixes.'\"\n\nXu Qinglang said viciously, clearly intending to drag Zhou Ze down with him if he was going to suffer.\n\nIt was just that Zhou Ze had been so relentless in kicking him while he was down this whole way, as if he was hell-bent on seeing him make a fool of himself!\n\nSo what if he liked to mention \"I have twenty-something properties\" all the time?\n\nWasn't it a fact!\n\nHad he been deliberately showing off or flaunting it?\n\nThey stepped into the main hall, their feet treading on a bright red carpet. Exquisite cross-stitch works hung on the four walls.\n\nA woman in a red wedding dress sat gracefully by a small table.\n\nExquisite dishes and wine were laid out on the table.\n\n\"Your Excellency, my husband, please be seated.\"\n\nThe woman stood and gestured for the two to take their seats.\n\nBecause the woman's face was concealed by a wedding veil, it couldn't be seen clearly.\n\nBut her voice was truly beautiful.\n\nZhou Ze took a seat and pulled Xu Qinglang, who finally sat down reluctantly.\n\n*Since we're here, let's make the best of it,* he thought. *Let's see what tricks she has up her sleeve.*\n\nThe dishes on the small table were exquisite and fragrant. The wine was mellow, its aroma intoxicating.\n\n\"Your Excellency, my husband, please eat.\" The ghost mistress gestured with her hand for the two to dine.\n\nZhou Ze didn't move, maintaining his composure.\n\nXu Qinglang, his face a mask of tragic indignation, downed three cups of wine in succession, then exclaimed, \"Good wine!\"\n\nFollowing that, he began to eat nonstop, completely channeling his grief and indignation into his appetite.\n\nWatching from the side, Zhou Ze's chest heaved, and he covered his mouth with his hand.\n\n\"What's wrong with you? Eat! It's delicious, better than what I make myself.\" Xu Qinglang himself was a chef, so he could naturally tell good food from bad.\n\n*Have you never seen a ghost movie?*\n\nZhou Ze thought to himself.\n\nBut he still said nothing. Instead, he picked up his chopsticks, put some food into Xu Qinglang's bowl, and urged him,\n\n\"Be good, eat up. There's no sour plum juice here, so I don't have an appetite. You know how it is.\"\n\nXu Qinglang grunted twice. Suspecting nothing, he continued to eat. If he had to die, he would die as a ghost with a full stomach!\n\nBesides, it really was delicious!\n\nXu Qinglang was even thinking about whether he should find a chance later to discuss and learn the recipes from the ghost mistress. If these dishes were sold on the market, even the top chefs at five-star hotels couldn't produce such flavor.\n\nAfter waiting for Xu Qinglang to eat his fill,\n\nZhou Ze nodded in satisfaction.\n\nHe asked the ghost mistress, \"Mistress, may I ask how these dishes are made?\"\n\n\"Your Excellency is too kind. This wine was brewed by this humble one from the urine of passersby;\n\nAnd these dishes were made by this humble one with carefully selected, fresh snakes, insects, rats, and ants...\"\n\nXu Qinglang's face changed abruptly.\n\nHe pointed a finger at Zhou Ze, but before he could say anything,\n\nhe went straight to:\n\n\"Bleeeaaargh...\"",

    "content": "Xu Qinglang vomited until the sky turned dark, nearly throwing up his own bile.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head slightly. This kid was still too young. He probably didn't watch enough ghost movies as a child. This classic scene of encountering a ghost in the wild and eating a meal with it was a staple.\n\nThe delicacies on the plates were, in fact, maggots, earthworms, cockroaches, ants, and the like.\n\nThis trope was completely played out.\n\nEven if he didn't have an eating disorder, Zhou Ze wouldn't have touched the food with his chopsticks.\n\nDid you really expect the ghosts here to go grocery shopping every day? And then set up a stove to cook for you?\n\nZhou Ze remembered a case from the past. A man went to visit a friend. The friend said his wife was away on a trip, so he would have to entertain him alone. He stayed at his friend's house for a week, the only drawback being the lack of vegetables; it was all meat dishes. But the meat broth was truly delicious.\n\nAfter he said his goodbyes and left, he ran into a neighbor who told him the friend hadn't left his house in nearly a month, locking himself inside all day.\n\nUpon hearing this, the man immediately threw up.\n\nZhou Ze subconsciously picked up the wine in front of him, then set it back down.\n\nHe’d almost forgotten.\n\nIt was passerby's urine.\n\n\"If my husband is unwell, then please go and rest,\" the Ghost Madam said, looking at the black-gowned maidservant beside her.\n\nThe maidservant nodded and walked over, preparing to help Xu Qinglang up.\n\nXu Qinglang pushed her supporting arm away, sat up straight, and said:\n\n\"Just say what you need to say. I don't want to play any more of these roundabout games.\"\n\nMm, Xu Qinglang was angry.\n\nCompletely furious.\n\nThe Ghost Madam stood up and walked before Zhou Ze. He could clearly smell a delicate fragrance wafting from her. Her graceful figure and voluptuous curves couldn't help but spark one's imagination.\n\nZhou Ze breathed a long sigh of relief inwardly.\n\nHe'd been spending a lot of time with Xu Qinglang, but he was still normal.\n\nHowever, Zhou Ze didn't have the courage to lift the Ghost Madam's red veil.\n\nA beauty reduced to withered bones—it was only to be expected.\n\nLooking at the layout and decorations here, it was clear this Ghost Madam had been dead for a very long time. If you lifted her veil and she was in a good mood, perhaps she'd let you see her face from when she was alive.\n\nIf you were unlucky, she'd directly use a skull-like face, corroded and crawling with maggots, to blind your damn eyes.\n\nZhou Ze remembered a report he'd read in his past life. Back then, it was very popular for husbands to accompany their wives into the delivery room.\n\nMany idealists believed this would make the husband understand his wife's sacrifice and greatness. Later, a Japanese husband who accompanied his wife for childbirth became clinically depressed, developing a psychological trauma. He could no longer live a normal life with his wife, and they ultimately had to divorce.\n\nAnd right now, Zhou Ze was well aware that he had a neighbor prettier than any woman constantly by his side. If he were to be frightened by this Ghost Madam's face, his own orientation might just spiral into an unfathomable abyss.\n\nIn both his past and present lives, it seemed he had never truly found fulfillment with a woman. Zhou Ze had no desire to skip ahead and play a more advanced game this lifetime.\n\n\"Sir Officer, this lowly one invited you here instead of paying a visit myself. It is not that I am impolite or intended to slight you, but truly, I had no other way to leave this place,\" the Ghost Madam pleaded tearfully to Zhou Ze.\n\n\"As for this gentleman,\" she continued, \"the reason he was invited was simply because, over a decade ago when he was but a child, he passed by here and made a jest. He told his companion at the time that if a female ghost were truly like Joey Wong in the movies, he would be willing to marry her.\"\n\nHearing this, Xu Qinglang's jaw dropped.\n\nHe himself had forgotten. That actually happened?\n\nZhou Ze, however, glanced at Xu Qinglang with a look that said: *Who would've thought? You look so effeminate, yet you were so precocious.*\n\n\"Specifically, what is this about?\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't directly say, *You've been very naughty, I'm taking you back to Hell.*\n\nThe little loli once said he was the most self-aware person she’d ever met.\n\nIndeed.\n\nZhou Ze was very much aware of the situation now. With no benefits, no performance metrics, and no assigned task, there was really no need for him to sacrifice himself for the prosperity of Hell.\n\n\"Worry not, Sir Officer. This lowly one is about to depart today, my soul returning to the Netherworld.\" The Ghost Madam smiled, then continued, \"My surname is Bai. I was the daughter of a scholarly family during the Daoguang era. Alas, my fate was cruel. I died suddenly on the eve of my wedding and was buried here. It has been nearly two hundred years since.\n\n\"Though I am a ghost, I have never committed any sinister deeds. I once protected the local villagers, ensuring their peace and prosperity. Mr. Se'an once inscribed a plaque for my shrine, and from that time, I had a temple body and could receive incense offerings.\n\n\"However, in the last sixty years, the shrine fell into ruin and can no longer be found. Now, no one knows that an unorthodox shrine¹ once stood here.\"\n\n\"Who is Mr. Se'an?\" Xu Qinglang asked, blinking.\n\n\"Zhang Jian,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\n\"Oh, him.\" Xu Qinglang understood now.\n\nZhang Jian was a famous figure from Tongcheng in the late Qing dynasty. He had drafted the abdication edict for the Qing Emperor. A top scholar of the late Qing, he was also an industrialist for the nation.\n\nThe \"unorthodox shrine\" the Ghost Madam spoke of didn't refer to some seedy place, but rather to a shrine for a deity not recognized by the imperial court's rites, a place of illicit worship.\n\n\"You're quite formidable then,\" Xu Qinglang said, having recovered from his earlier vomiting spell. After the Ghost Madam explained she'd only invited him over because of a childish remark, he relaxed. As long as he wasn't being forced to be her husband, it was fine.\n\nTo have cultivated for two hundred years and even had a shrine built to receive incense offerings... she should have transcended the level of a mere ghost, right?\n\n\"Now, my cultivation is complete, and I am about to descend to the Netherworld. However, there is one matter I cannot ignore.\"\n\nThe Ghost Madam gave Zhou Ze a slight bow and pleaded:\n\n\"My former physical body, due to the circumstances of its burial, has not decayed for two hundred years and remains lifelike. My soul is now about to enter the Netherworld, but I cannot take my body with me.\n\n\"Furthermore, over these two hundred years, my physical body, influenced by my soul, has begun to show signs of becoming a *sha*.² I do not wish that after my soul departs, I leave behind a body that, should it awaken due to some unforeseen event, would commit atrocities. Therefore, I implore Sir Officer for your help.\"\n\n\"How... do you want me to help you?\"\n\nZhou Ze rubbed his hands together. Since this Ghost Madam planned to go to Hell on her own, that was for the best. This was a voluntary surrender.\n\nNo, it didn't seem like a voluntary surrender. It was more like an ancient rebel army growing strong enough to accept an amnesty from the imperial court, getting their status legitimized and receiving an official title.\n\nBut regardless, as long as it wasn't a head-on confrontation with him, it was fine.\n\n\"I ask that Sir Officer help watch over my physical body, and on the night of the next Cold Clothes Festival, cremate it with bamboo and wood,\" the Ghost Madam said.\n\n\"Help watch over it?\" Zhou Ze thought for a moment, then nodded.\n\n\"Does this mean Sir Officer agrees?\" the Ghost Madam confirmed. \"I thank you, Sir Officer.\"\n\n\"You're too kind.\"\n\nZhou Ze subconsciously picked up his wine cup again.\n\nAnd...\n\nSet it back down again.\n\n\"Then, this lowly one shall take my leave.\" The Ghost Madam's figure began to slowly fade away, her departure swift and clean.\n\nZhou Ze pursed his lips. The next moment, he found that the entire scene around them had vanished. He and Xu Qinglang were sitting on two stone stumps.\n\nThe banquet had disappeared without a trace. As far as the eye could see, there were only jagged rocks and dense, overgrown weeds.\n\nXu Qinglang lit a cigarette, looking a bit melancholic.\n\n\"Disappointed you didn't get to see what your wife looks like?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Why didn't you lift the veil and see for yourself?\" Xu Qinglang snorted.\n\nA long road tests a horse's strength; a long time reveals a person's heart. Tonight, Zhou Ze had kicked him while he was down countless times. Xu Qinglang had noted it all down in his little black book.\n\n\"She's your wife. How could I be so forward?\" Zhou Ze looked around, then stomped his shoe on the ground. \"Is the body of that Lady Bai right under this spot?\"\n\n\"Probably.\" Xu Qinglang was also a bit unsure, but soon, his eyes spotted two rusty shovels lying in the grass ahead. \"I guess so. She even prepared the shovels for us.\"\n\nZhou Ze walked over, and he and Xu Qinglang each took a shovel. Nothing else to be said. Time to dig!\n\nThe two of them dug until dawn, drenched in sweat. Finally, they hit something hard below. Brushing away the dirt, they could make out a redwood coffin.\n\nIt took them another half an hour to completely unearth it.\n\n\"Let's open it,\" Zhou Ze said. \"It's almost morning. Better finish up, or if someone sees us and calls the police, they'll think we're grave robbers.\"\n\n\"You do it,\" Xu Qinglang said, wiping away his sweat. \"I find it disgusting.\"\n\n\"Didn't she say her body hadn't decayed?\"\n\n\"Who knows if that's true?\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. No choice. This was something he had promised to do. Xu Qinglang was just providing friendly assistance. If he wasn't willing to do it, Zhou Ze had to.\n\nPrying open the coffin nails, Zhou Ze stood to the side and gave a hard pull. The coffin lid was lifted. Then, Zhou Ze took out his phone, turned on the flashlight, and shone it down.\n\n\"Heh... She really is quite beautiful.\"\n\nXu Qinglang leaned over for a look. Indeed, the woman lying in the coffin wore a white dress, her long hair draped over her shoulders. Her face was dignified and beautiful, her body showing no signs of decay at all. She looked as if she were merely asleep.\n\n\"She's your wife. You want to, while she's still warm...\"\n\nXu Qinglang suddenly shoved Zhou Ze. \"What nonsense are you spouting? Hurry up and carry her out so we can take her back.\"\n\nThis time, Xu Qinglang was very proactive. He jumped down and lifted the female corpse.\n\nBut the moment he lifted her from the coffin floor, his expression changed instantly. He immediately put the corpse back down, then stood to the side, rubbing his hands nonstop.\n\n\"Hiss... So cold. Bone-chillingly cold. The煞氣 (*sha qi*) on this corpse is so strong, it's clearly on the verge of becoming a *jiangshi*.³ That Lady Bai definitely wasn't telling the whole truth.\n\n\"Out of a woman's vanity, she must have deliberately nourished her own corpse for these two hundred years.\n\n\"Now that her merits are fulfilled and she's ready to leave, she's left behind this huge mess.\"\n\nZhou Ze went down himself. As he lifted the female corpse, he too instantly felt that iciness that seemed to penetrate to his very soul.\n\nBut in the next moment, Zhou Ze felt his own fingernails begin to grow longer. That iciness, the *sha qi* Xu Qinglang had mentioned, started to actively pour into Zhou Ze's nails.\n\nIn that instant,\n\na tingly numbness that felt like ascending to heaven made Zhou Ze's very soul tremble. This seemed to be a form of nourishment.\n\n\"Hah... ooh... hsss... mmm...\"\n\nFrom the side, Xu Qinglang, who was still checking his hands for frostbite, heard Zhou Ze's noises. His face contorted with shock as he pointed at Zhou Ze and exclaimed:\n\n\"You beast!\n\n\"You actually did it while she's still warm!\"\n\n***\n\n**Footnotes:**\n1.  **Unorthodox shrine (yin祠):** A shrine not officially sanctioned by the government or religious authorities, often for local deities, ghosts, or spirits.\n2.  ***Sha* (煞):** A term for a malevolent or baleful entity or energy.

    "content": "Before the sky could brighten, Zhou Ze used his electric scooter to carry the female corpse back to the bookshop. As for Xu Qinglang, he was left behind to wait for a taxi.\n\nAfter all, he had arrived in a sedan chair; there was no sedan chair for the return trip.\n\nUpon returning to the bookshop, Zhou Ze placed the female corpse in the freezer on the second floor. He then went downstairs, took a shower, and changed his clothes. By the time he came out, Xu Qinglang, who had finally managed to hail a cab, had just returned. He walked straight into the bookshop, looked at Zhou Ze's dripping wet hair, and teased him:\n\n\"You need to control yourself.\"\n\n\"Heh heh,\" Zhou Ze replied with only those two words.\n\nXu Qinglang shook his head and left the bookshop without another word. Tonight's events had exhausted him as well.\n\nZhou Ze locked the shop door and went up to the second floor. He stood by the freezer, looking at the female corpse inside.\n\nThe woman's face was exquisite, and she had a remarkable air about her. People in ancient times married young, and it was common for girls to become mothers at fifteen or sixteen. As such, having died before her marriage, Lady Bai's corpse looked about the age of an ordinary high school student, yet she possessed a natural, alluring charm.\n\nXu Qinglang's beauty was that of a peony in full bloom—captivating and bold. The Lady Bai before him, however, was like a reserved daisy.\n\nOf course, Zhou Ze wouldn't indulge in excessive fantasies about a corpse. What he was contemplating was something on another level entirely.\n\nOn the ride back, his ten fingernails had been in constant contact with her as he held her on the electric scooter. It was as if streams of electric current were surging into his body, continuously stimulating his soul and his nails.\n\nFortunately, Xu Qinglang hadn't been with him on the way back. Otherwise, Zhou Ze probably would have ended up screaming in the scooter, just as Xu Qinglang had in the sedan chair. This sort of thing was best kept to oneself.\n\nBy the time he carried her back into the bookshop, Zhou Ze discovered that the icy chill emanating from her body seemed to have dissipated by more than half.\n\nShe was like a rechargeable battery that he had just drained of its power. But it probably wasn't a major issue; lying there, she should be able to naturally recharge herself.\n\nHe held his palms up in front of him, and his nails slowly extended. A blood-red pattern had appeared on the originally black, translucent fingernails. This must be the change from his nails absorbing the corpse's baleful aura.\n\nIt actually looked pretty good.\n\nZhou Ze smiled and reached for the glass of warm water he had just brought upstairs, only to find that the water was already cold.\n\nBecause of the female corpse, the temperature of this entire small second floor was lower than outside, and Zhou Ze's own perception of \"cold\" was already somewhat weak.\n\nIt was a pity it wasn't summer. If it were, with the female corpse here, his shop could save on air conditioning costs. Plus, she would probably work as an insect repellent.\n\nThat night, Zhou Ze made a pallet on the floor next to the freezer and slept very soundly.\n\nThe little loli had once said that if he hugged her, he could fall asleep without needing the freezer. It seemed the female corpse had a similar effect.\n\nWhen he woke up the next morning, Zhou Ze stretched and placed his fingernails on the corpse's lower abdomen. Instantly, the ice-cold sensation washed over him again.\n\nIt was very comfortable.\n\nVery enjoyable.\n\nBut the feeling only lasted for about half a minute before dissipating, which meant that was all the energy the female corpse had managed to recharge overnight.\n\nLady Bai had expressed concern that her body might reanimate, and Xu Qinglang had also said that the dense baleful aura on the corpse could easily turn it into a zombie if stimulated externally. But now, it seemed the probability of that was low. However much baleful aura she gathered, he would just absorb that much each day.\n\nAlthough he didn't know what use this stuff was to him, the sheer pleasure of the sensation was enough to make Zhou Ze happy to continue.\n\nAfter having a meal at Xu Qinglang's shop next door, Zhou Ze sat leisurely in his own store. Before he could decide which book to read, his phone rang.\n\nIt was his sister-in-law.\n\n\"Xu Le, come back for a bit.\"\n\n\"What's up?\" Zhou Ze didn't believe his sister-in-law would suddenly call to check on him. The girl was still in her rebellious phase—a bit self-centered, or rather, selfish and headstrong.\n\n\"Your uncle is at my house. Come and get him,\" his sister-in-law said impatiently.\n\n\"Uncle?\" Zhou Ze frowned slightly. He remembered that Xu Le, like himself, was an orphan. Of course, Xu Le hadn't grown up in an orphanage; his parents had passed away one after another shortly after he was born.\n\n\"Okay, I'm on my way.\"\n\nAfter hanging up, Zhou Ze told Xu Qinglang next door to keep an eye on his shop for him, then hailed a taxi to head back to the Lin family's home.\n\nWang Ke's treatment advice had been to temporarily sever ties with his original social network, but times had changed. Before, Zhou Ze was undocumented, something of a rat scurrying in the streets. Now, he was a temporary civil servant,¹ so he had far fewer things and dangers to worry about.\n\nBesides, Zhou Ze had previously read through the private journal Xu Le had kept on his social media page. It mentioned his uncle, who had supported him through his schooling all these years.\n\nHaving taken over the man's body, there were some things he ought to take care of. What's more, Xu Le had long since gone to hell to be reincarnated. The changes in his own temperament weren't really related to Xu Le; they were more of a side effect of his soul's transmigration.\n\nWhen Zhou Ze arrived at the Lin's apartment building, before he even went inside, he saw an old man in a cotton-padded jacket, his face full of wrinkles, sitting on the steps in the corridor, smoking a dry pipe.\n\nBeside the old man were several fertilizer bags. One likely contained chickens and ducks, while another probably held things like cured sausages.\n\n\"Ah Le!\" The old man saw Xu Le walking up, immediately stood, and walked over to him. He clapped Xu Le firmly on the shoulder. \"My boy, you've gotten taller again.\"\n\nZhou Ze managed a smile. He didn't ask why his uncle was sitting in the stairwell smoking. In truth, there was no need to ask.\n\nEven if his uncle had come out to smoke his pipe so as not to pollute their home, he wouldn't have left the local goods he'd brought outside. This could only mean the Lin family didn't want him there—they hadn't even let him in the door.\n\nRecalling the tone and attitude of his sister-in-law on the phone earlier, it was clear enough how the Lin family felt about his uncle.\n\nOf course, there was nothing to complain about or resent. His relationship with the Lin family was already on the verge of shattering anyway; it wasn't a matter of who was right or wrong.\n\n\"Have you eaten?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Not yet,\" the old man answered honestly.\n\n\"I'll take you to eat.\"\n\n\"Alright.\"\n\nZhou Ze chose a restaurant, ordered a few dishes after they went inside, and also got a bottle of *baijiu*.\n\nThe old man poured for himself and drank alone. After a few sips, it was clear his mood was heavy. Obviously, he had felt the Lin family's coldness. They were in-laws, after all, and now things had gotten to a point where even basic courtesy was ignored.\n\n\"Le, my boy, if you're not happy here, why don't you just come home?\" The uncle patted his own chest. \"The government's targeted poverty alleviation policy is great now. We don't have to worry about getting by anymore. You went to university, so when you come back, we can start some kind of specialty farming or something. We won't live any worse than others.\"\n\n\"Okay, we'll talk about it later,\" Zhou Ze said, brushing him off.\n\n\"Sigh.\" The uncle knew Xu Le didn't drink, so he didn't ask Zhou Ze to join him. He slowly finished the bottle by himself, then ate two bowls of rice. After Zhou Ze paid the bill, he picked up his things and walked out of the restaurant with Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Take these things with you. They don't want them, so you eat them.\" The uncle handed the woven plastic bags to Zhou Ze. \"I need to catch the afternoon bus back.\"\n\n\"Alright.\" Zhou Ze didn't try to make him stay.\n\nThe uncle's alcohol tolerance seemed quite high. Zhou Ze called a taxi for him, paid the driver in advance to take him to the bus station, and then carried the items back to the bookshop.\n\nXu Qinglang was sitting at the entrance, basking in the sun. Zhou Ze placed the pile of local specialties in front of him.\n\n\"Yo, what's this?\"\n\n\"Ingredients for you,\" Zhou Ze said, finding a chair nearby and sitting down.\n\n\"Sure.\" Xu Qinglang didn't stand on ceremony; he hadn't charged Zhou Ze for meals before either. \"By the way, you told me your real name is Zhou Ze, but you never went into detail about your past. What did you do before?\"\n\n\"A doctor,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\nThere was no need to hide these things from Xu Qinglang.\n\nBesides, his identity was legitimate now; he didn't have to fear official scrutiny.\n\n\"A doctor? Then you and your other half really are a pair.\" Xu Qinglang leisurely blew a smoke ring. \"Haven't seen your wife come by in a few days.\"\n\n\"It's over between us,\" Zhou Ze said nonchalantly.\n\n\"Heh heh.\"\n\nThe two shared another cigarette, and then Zhou Ze got up, pushed open the bookshop door, and walked inside.\n\nWhen he left that morning, he had asked Xu Qinglang to keep an eye on things, so he hadn't locked the door.\n\nHe sat down behind the counter, turned on the computer, and clicked an icon. A video feed appeared on the desktop.\n\nA while back, Zhou Ze had bought two pinhole cameras and placed them in the shop. One was positioned at the landing of the stairs, and the other in the upper-left corner of Yikou Bookshop. They weren't expensive; the kind of thing a peeping tom would buy.\n\nHe casually picked up the cup on the counter and took a few sips of water as he began to adjust the playback time on the video.\n\nWhen he went out that morning, he had deliberately left the door unlocked and asked Xu Qinglang to watch the shop for a reason.\n\nYesterday, Lady Bai had invited him over and had also sent a sedan chair for Xu Qinglang. Although she had explained it was due to a jest Xu Qinglang made as a child, Zhou Ze didn't fully believe her.\n\nHe had brought the corpse back and placed it here. If Lady Bai and Xu Qinglang had some other connection, Xu Qinglang should have made a move this morning.\n\nOne can't be too careful. He wasn't even human anymore; naturally, he had to live more cautiously.\n\nAt 11:30 AM, the footage showed Xu Qinglang entering his shop.\n\nZhou Ze took another sip of water, feeling that the water in his cup was somewhat sweet, exceptionally tasty.\n\n*It's probably psychological,* he thought. *Am I feeling smug because I think I've guessed right?*\n\nHowever, the footage only showed Xu Qinglang entering the shop, picking up a few newspapers, sitting and reading for half an hour, then putting the newspapers back where he found them and leaving. He never went up to the second floor at all.\n\nWas I wrong?\n\nWas I just measuring a gentleman's intentions by my own petty standards?\n\nZhou Ze pursed his lips, chuckled to himself, and drained the water in the cup.\n\nJust as Zhou Ze was about to close the video and go wash his face, he suddenly remembered the camera positioned at the stairwell landing. This camera's angle could monitor the stairs and the area around the counter on the first floor.\n\nSince Xu Qinglang hadn't walked further in, there wasn't much point in watching it.\n\nBut because these cheap cameras had small storage capacities, Zhou Ze still had to delete the used memory to free up space.\n\nHe clicked open the video recorded by the second camera and dragged the timeline from beginning to end, just going through the motions.\n\nHowever, in that instant, Zhou Ze thought he saw a white shadow flash by.\n\n\"Hm?\"\n\nZhou Ze instinctively pulled the mouse back. His other hand reached for the teacup again, only then realizing it was empty.\n\nForgetting about getting more water,\n\nhe dragged the mouse, moving the video forward bit by bit.\n\nFinally,\n\nthe screen captured that moment.\n\nA woman in white clothes was slowly walking down from the second floor!\n\nThat corpse...\n\nShe could move!\n\nZhou Ze felt a rush of blood to his head. A sense of crisis hit him directly, and his heart and breathing quickened.\n\nJust as Zhou Ze was processing this,\n\nthe video continued to play.\n\nIn the footage,\n\nLady Bai's corpse walked to the edge of the counter and picked up the water cup that was sitting there.\n\nThen,\n\nlike a dog drinking water,\n\nshe stuck out her tongue and swirled it around in the cup a few times.\n\nAfterward, she put the cup down, like a sleeping person who got up, thirsty for a drink of water in the middle of the night.\n\nShe turned around again and slowly walked back upstairs.\n\nZhou Ze took a deep breath, looking at the cup beside him that he had just drained.\n\nNo wonder when I was drinking the water just now,\n\nI thought it was a little sweet…\n\n---\n¹In Chinese, the term used is a pun: \"臨時工公務猿\" (línshígōng gōngwùyuán). It combines \"臨時工\" (temporary worker) with \"公務員\" (civil servant), but replaces the last character with \"猿\" (ape), which has the same pronunciation (yuán). It’s a self-deprecating slang term for government workers.",

    "content": "Second floor.\n\nBy the freezer.\n\nZhou Ze stood for about half an hour.\n\nLady Bai was still lying inside, exactly the same as when Zhou Ze had gotten up and left in the morning, without the slightest change. But the scene recorded by the camera couldn't be wrong.\n\nEspecially…\n\nthat cup of water.\n\nWhen he first started drinking it, he'd thought it was a bit sweet.\n\nThis wasn't a psychological effect, because he hadn't watched the video before drinking the water.\n\nIn reality, Zhou Ze wasn't too disgusted by the fact that he'd drunk her saliva. After all, just last night he'd seen Xu Qinglang eat so many “delicacies.”\n\nCompared to Xu Qinglang, his own experience this time was just a drizzle.\n\nOf course, he didn't find it \"alluring\" either.\n\nThe person before him, no matter how beautiful, was just a corpse—a two-hundred-year-old corpse that had been lying underground.\n\nThe thought of her not having brushed her teeth for two hundred years was a bit hard for the mildly mysophobic Zhou Ze to accept.\n\nShe could move. And she went downstairs, drank some water, and came back up.\n\nHad Lady Bai not told him the truth?\n\nOr there was another possibility: because of his fingernails last night, this corpse had also undergone some kind of change.\n\nRight now, Lady Bai's soul had already gone to report to Hell. It was unlikely she would deliberately leave a time bomb behind in the mortal world.\n\nThe little loli had once said that ghostly beings in the mortal world had to tuck their tails between their legs and \"behave.\"¹ Anyone who wanted to stir up trouble was just tired of living, tired of their life being too comfortable.\n\nBut to Zhou Ze, there was a world of difference between having a corpse on his second floor and having a *moving* corpse on his second floor. No one wants a dangerous, unstable element right next to where they sleep.\n\n\"Hey, big sis, why don't you wake up so we can have a chat?\"\n\nZhou Ze said, leaning against the edge of the freezer.\n\nHe hoped the female corpse would open her eyes right then—either to fight him or to talk to him. They could agree to disagree, but at least they could break the ice² and stop playing mysterious games.\n\nBut, the female corpse remained lying there, unmoved.\n\nZhou Ze figured that even if he actually dropped his pants and went for it, the female corpse would maintain this state.\n\nHe withdrew his hand, pursing his lips, somewhat at a loss for what to do.\n\nYou can't wake up a person who's pretending to be asleep.\n\nThe next moment, the nail on Zhou Ze's fingertip began to lengthen. Then, Zhou Ze plunged his index fingernail into the female corpse's arm and slowly started applying pressure.\n\n\"*Pfft…*\"\n\nThe nail, like a sharp blade, pierced the female corpse's arm. She didn't bleed. Instead, a cloud of black qi began to spread out, and for a moment, the entire second-floor room became shrouded in a ghostly aura.\n\n\"Zhou Ze, what are you doing!\"\n\nXu Qinglang's shout came from downstairs.\n\nImmediately after, Xu Qinglang rushed up to the second floor without a second thought. Zhou Ze withdrew his hand just then. His fingernail seemed to be coated in a layer of frost; it was a bit stiff, and even a little painful.\n\n\"Are you crazy!\" Xu Qinglang roared, looking at the narrow wound on the female corpse's arm. \"Don't you know that when a Hánbá³ appears, a thousand miles of land turns barren!\n\n\"This female corpse is surely no Hánbá, but if the energy stored in her body leaks out, it's enough to start a plague in Tongcheng!\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't rush to deal with the frantic Xu Qinglang. Instead, he kept staring at the female corpse's arm. The wound he had just made was actually healing on its own.\n\nThis female corpse…\n\naside from her body being cold and breathless, everything else was really no different from a living person's. In fact, her body was even more… active than a living person's!\n\n\"Hey, you and I dug this thing up together! If this thing causes any trouble, I'll have to take the fall too, lose years off my life, and maybe even bring disaster upon my descendants!\n\n\"Same goes for you. If you blow this up, even if you're a grim reaper now, you won't be able to handle the consequences.\"\n\nThe small amount of black qi that had just leaked from the female corpse slowly dissipated. Because the amount was small, and because only Zhou Ze and Xu Qinglang were there—both of whom had stronger resistance—it wouldn't cause any harm.\n\nBut what had just leaked out was merely the tip of the iceberg of what was inside her body.\n\nZhou Ze sighed. \"Xu Qinglang.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Why don't you keep your 'wife' at your place? Didn't your parents just leave? Let her keep you company. After all, you're the one she properly married and brought home in a grand sedan chair.\"\n\n\"What? What do you mean?\" Xu Qinglang was completely bewildered.\n\n\"This thing… she can move on her own,\" Zhou Ze revealed the reason. \"Today, she went downstairs by herself and even drank some water.\"\n\nA look of horror appeared on Xu Qinglang's face. The corner of his mouth twitched, and he took two steps back.\n\nHe had said last night that if anything unexpected happened with this corpse, it would turn into a jiangshi.⁴ And not the dumb-headed, \"Uwaah, uwaah,\" weakling kind from Western movies that you could easily headshot, but a true \"flesh-and-blood-devouring\" jiangshi that might even possess supernatural abilities.\n\n\"Thanks, but I'm getting used to being alone.\"\n\nWhat a joke. There was no way Xu Qinglang would take this hot potato—no, this hot *atomic bomb*.\n\n\"Don't you have some of those paper talismans? Stick one on her,\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"The talismans for my two blades would only have the opposite effect if I stuck them on her. They'd just provoke her,\" Xu Qinglang said with a bitter smile.\n\n\"Then what do we do?\" Zhou Ze felt a headache coming on. \"Haul her out to sea and dump her? If she turns into a jiangshi, at worst she can go bother the Sea Dragon King.\"\n\n\"She can't leave Tongcheng. She was a person of Tongcheng in life, so she's a ghost of Tongcheng in death. The moment her body leaves the Tongcheng area, she'll run into problems. Otherwise, why wouldn't Lady Bai have dealt with the body before her soul went to the Underworld with her merits fulfilled?\"\n\n\"*Slam!*\"\n\nZhou Ze shut the freezer lid directly. Clearly, this problem had no solution.\n\nCouldn't burn it, couldn't move it, and was afraid of causing an incident by dumping it elsewhere.\n\nThe only option was to keep it in his own house and watch over it at his own risk?\n\nZhou Ze now seemed to understand why the little loli had gone down to Hell with a \"*biu*.\" The life of an underworld civil servant wasn't so great after all.\n\nEven after getting into the system, the grassroots workers are always the ones who have it the toughest.\n\nLike himself right now.\n\n\"Look on the bright side. I'll make you some extra plum juice tonight,\" Xu Qinglang offered as comfort.\n\n\"And then?\"\n\n\"And then I'm moving. Didn't I say I was going to open a shop in a county downstream? I'm thinking of moving my plan up.\" Xu Qinglang had a \"better you die than me\"⁵ look on his face.\n\nAfter locking the freezer, Zhou Ze and Xu Qinglang went downstairs together.\n\nXu Qinglang nagged Zhou Ze a bit more not to mess around before heading back to his noodle shop. He had probably been busy with his own things but had sensed the leak of malevolent qi, gotten a huge fright, and rushed over.\n\nZhou Ze sat behind the counter,\n\npicking up the water cup and swirling it in front of him.\n\nHis phone rang. He took it out and saw it was an unknown number.\n\n\"Hello, is this Mr. Xu Le? We're from the Chongchuan Traffic Police Brigade.\"\n\n\"Yes, this is he. What is it?\"\n\n\"Is Xu Dachuan a relative of yours? He was just in a car accident and is now being taken to the People's Hospital.\"\n\n\"Okay, I'm on my way.\"\n\nZhou Ze closed his eyes and let out a grunt of dissatisfaction. Things were annoying enough already, and now something else had come up. Xu Dachuan must be the \"uncle\" he had treated to lunch.\n\nBut he couldn't just not go. Although the man had come to the city specifically to see Xu Le, not him, Zhou Ze had already given the local produce he brought to Xu Qinglang as ingredients.\n\nZhou Ze looked at his fingernails.\n\nIf Xu Dachuan was really in mortal danger,\n\nshould he save him or not?\n\nThinking about the painful backlash he'd suffered after saving the little loli last time, Zhou Ze couldn't help but shudder. *Forget it. Let's just hope he's not seriously hurt.*\n\nHe walked out of the shop, hailed a cab, and sent Xu Qinglang a message on WeChat during the ride, telling him he was heading out for a bit and to keep an eye on things.\n\nBy the time he arrived at the People's Hospital, it was already eight in the evening. Zhou Ze asked at the front desk and learned that Xu Dachuan was not in life-threatening danger and had already been moved to a ward. He felt a sense of relief.\n\nPushing open the ward door, Zhou Ze froze for a second as he walked in. He saw Doctor Lin standing by Xu Dachuan's bedside, keeping him company.\n\nOne of Xu Dachuan's legs was propped up, likely broken, and he had a few scrapes on his face, but his spirits were still good. He was quite animated while chatting with his nephew's wife.\n\nAs Zhou Ze walked over, his eyes met Doctor Lin's.\n\n\"Thank you. Sorry to trouble you,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"It's what I should do,\" Doctor Lin stood up and added, \"I wasn't home during the day. I'm sorry.\"\n\n\"It's fine,\" Zhou Ze waved his hand.\n\nDoctor Lin left the ward, and Zhou Ze stayed to chat a bit more with his \"uncle.\" The long-distance bus had gotten into an accident before it even left the city. Xu Dachuan was just a bit unlucky; he had fallen and fractured his left leg, while the other passengers only had minor scrapes.\n\nXu Dachuan didn't seem to care much about his injury, repeating over and over, \"My nephew's wife is a good person.\"\n\nZhou Ze smiled, told Xu Dachuan to get some rest, and then left the ward.\n\nDoctor Lin was standing by the nurses' station. A young female nurse was sitting there, looking a bit unwell.\n\nZhou Ze was about to leave, but he had to say goodbye to Doctor Lin. The two of them hadn't been in touch for a long time, but it was important to keep up appearances.\n\nBut just as he got closer, Zhou Ze heard the sound of a baby crying. It was very faint, like a kitten.\n\nAt first, Zhou Ze didn't think anything of it, but as he approached Doctor Lin, he noticed the baby's crying became clearer.\n\nCould it be that Doctor Lin was being haunted by a little ghost?\n\nZhou Ze was still observing, deliberately stepping to stand behind Doctor Lin to get a better look.\n\n\"It's okay, Dr. Lin. I have a weak stomach, it's an old problem. I'll take some medicine later and I'll be fine,\" the young nurse said, thanking Doctor Lin for her concern.\n\n\"Take good care of yourself,\" Doctor Lin said comfortingly.\n\nIt was then that Doctor Lin noticed the somewhat… \"furtive\" Zhou Ze standing behind her.\n\n\"You…\"\n\n\"Wait a second.\" Zhou Ze held up a hand, listened carefully again, and finally looked at the young nurse's stomach.\n\nThe sound wasn't coming from Doctor Lin, but from inside the young nurse.\n\nHaving been a doctor before, Zhou Ze immediately understood what was going on.\n\n\"You're pregnant,\" Zhou Ze said to the young nurse. This wasn't a time for Zhou Ze to be tactful or worry about saving face.\n\n\"What?\" The young nurse looked completely baffled.\n\n\"What nonsense are you talking about? Little Chen isn't married and doesn't have a boyfriend,\" Doctor Lin said, glaring at her \"husband.\"\n\n\"I don't know who you got pregnant by, but you'd better go get a check-up right now. Also, a word of warning, you're at risk of a miscarriage,\" Zhou Ze said with great certainty.\n\nThe fetus was very unstable. The faint crying was the instinctive sorrow of an unborn child, which was why Zhou Ze hadn't worried about her feelings.\n\nA human life was at stake.\n\nHearing this, Nurse Chen shot to her feet, a look of anxiety on her face. Clearly, she hadn't known she was pregnant, but she knew she'd had \"high-risk\" relations, so the possibility of conception was high.\n\nDoctor Lin saw it too and immediately rushed off with Little Chen.\n\nZhou Ze stretched, thinking what a pity it was that Xu Le, that guy, had studied civil engineering. If Xu Le had studied medicine, he would probably soon become the most famous doctor not just in Tongcheng, but in the entire province of Su.\n\nHe went downstairs, bought a case of milk and some daily necessities for Xu Dachuan, and delivered them to his ward before coming out again. This time he really intended to leave; the one at home was genuinely making him uneasy.\n\nAs it happened, Doctor Lin was coming out of the elevator, her expression somewhat grave.\n\n\"What's wrong?\"\n\n\"How did you know Little Chen was pregnant?\" Doctor Lin asked.\n\n\"I've studied some traditional Chinese medicine,\" Zhou Ze lied. \"How are things over there?\"\n\n\"Little Chen wants to keep the baby, but it's hard to say if she can. She hadn't been paying any attention to it herself,\" Doctor Lin said, then added, \"Are you heading back? Wait for me to change, I'll give you a ride.\"\n\nAnd so, Zhou Ze left the hospital in Doctor Lin's Cayenne.\n\nNeither of them spoke much on the way. Their \"marital\" relationship had dropped to a freezing point after the last incident.\n\nAs they neared the bookstore, Zhou Ze felt he should find something to talk about, otherwise the silence was just too oppressive. He said, \"You've posted a lot of photos in Hanfu on your Moments. You like it a lot?\"\n\n\"Mhm,\" Doctor Lin nodded.\n\n\"I quite like it too.\" Zhou Ze rubbed the tip of his nose. \"Do you have any Hanfu? Maybe you could wear it for me to see someday?\"\n\nDoctor Lin didn't answer, seeming disinclined to take up the topic.\n\nThe car stopped in front of the bookstore. Zhou Ze got out. To his surprise, Doctor Lin also got out, looking like she intended to go into the bookstore with him.\n\n*Heh, this woman is really resilient. Isn't she afraid of getting… you-know-what-ed by me again like last time?*\n\n\"I'm going to grab a few magazines to read at work,\" Doctor Lin said.\n\n\"Okay.\" Zhou Ze nodded. He knew this was Doctor Lin's way of indirectly expressing a desire for reconciliation. *This woman, she really has it tough.*\n\nTo put it in the style of Lu Xun: This woman had once again bowed her head to the feudal rites—that is, to her nominal \"husband.\"\n\nIn ancient times, Doctor Lin would have been a typical example of a pitiful woman poisoned and persecuted by feudal propriety.\n\nPushing open the bookstore door, Zhou Ze was surprised to find Xu Qinglang sitting on a plastic stool, reading a book. But the book in his hands was clearly upside down. What the hell was he reading?\n\nXu Qinglang managed to squeeze out a smile for Zhou Ze, but it was uglier than a crying face.\n\nDoctor Lin gave the man, who was prettier than most women, a couple of extra glances, then walked straight towards the bookshelves to pick out magazines.\n\nZhou Ze handed Xu Qinglang a cigarette and asked in a low voice, \"What's wrong with you? You're completely out of it.\"\n\nJust then,\n\nthe sound of footsteps came from the top of the stairs. A woman in an ancient-style white dress descended gracefully, her posture elegant, her presence exuding a natural tenderness.\n\nWhen she saw Zhou Ze,\n\nshe gave a slight curtsy,\n\nand said very respectfully,\n\n\"You've returned.\"\n\nThe magazine Doctor Lin had just picked up,\n\nfell to the floor.\n\nAt the same time, she said coldly,\n\n\"It seems I won't need to wear it for you to see after all.\"\n***\n**Footnotes:**\n\n¹ **夾著尾巴「做人」 (jiāzhe wěibā \"zuòrén\"):** Lit. \"to be a 'person' with one's tail between one's legs,\" an idiom for behaving cautiously and submissively.\n\n² **把窗戶紙給戳開 (bǎ chuānghùzhǐ gěi chuōkāi):** Lit. \"to poke a hole in the window paper,\" an idiom for revealing something that is obvious but has been left unsaid.\n\n³ **旱魃 (Hánbá):** A drought demon from Chinese mythology.\n\n⁴ **殭屍 (jiāngshī):** A type of reanimated corpse in Chinese folklore, often translated as \"hopping vampire\" or \"zombie.\"\n\n⁵ **死道友不死貧道 (sǐ dàoyǒu bù sǐ píndào):** Lit. \"the Daoist friend dies, not the poor Daoist,\" a cynical phrase meaning \"better you than me.\"",

    "content": "\"Looks like I won't need to try it on for you after all.\"\n\nDr. Lin was indeed a very traditional woman, but not the ancient kind who wouldn't dare to complain even if her husband took a concubine, for fear of gaining a reputation for jealousy.\n\nShe had her compromises, but at the same time, she had her principles.\n\nShe could force herself to accept Zhou Ze's assault on her last time, and she could also force herself to slowly accept \"Xu Le\" (Zhou Ze) as he became more and more assertive and domineering.\n\nBut she could not accept Zhou Ze having an extramarital affair. That was her bottom line.\n\nShe was angry.\n\nVery, very angry.\n\nShe even wanted to turn around and walk away.\n\nThe reason Dr. Lin hadn't left yet was that she was waiting for Zhou Ze's response. No matter what, Zhou Ze ought to give her some kind of answer, and then things between them could finally be resolved.\n\nEven if it meant going back to face her mother's accusations and her father's fury over her marriage disgracing the family, she would still accept it.\n\nHowever, Zhou Ze didn't respond.\n\nNo explanation.\n\nIt seemed to be a silent admission.\n\nThe light in Dr. Lin's eyes immediately dimmed.\n\nHe didn't even need to explain?\n\nIn fact, Dr. Lin had misunderstood Zhou Ze. Right now, Zhou Ze hadn't even processed what was happening; he hadn't even noticed Dr. Lin's feelings.\n\nFrom Zhou Ze's perspective, he felt a terror so great that the hairs on his back were standing on end.\n\nThis female corpse...\n\nwas actually alive!\n\nAnd it wasn't as simple as just coming downstairs for a drink of water like during the day. She had actually walked right up to him, bold as brass, to talk to him, to interact with him!\n\nAnd when he recalled his \"fingertip tour\" over her body during the day, which he had done to \"awaken\" her...\n\nZhou Ze was instantly seized by the urge to rush out of the shop and run as far away as he could.\n\nNow he understood why Xu Qinglang was sitting there foolishly, holding his book upside down. He was too scared to move!\n\nThe scene fell into an awkward silence.\n\n\"Hello.\" The female corpse had a smile on her lips. After greeting Zhou Ze—like a Korean or Japanese wife standing at the entryway to say \"Welcome home\" to her husband returning from work—she deliberately looked at Lin Wanqiu with a playful gaze.\n\n\"Hello,\" Dr. Lin replied icily.\n\nJust then, Zhou Ze took a deep breath. He reached out and pulled Xu Qinglang up, forcing him to stand.\n\n\"Wanqiu, let me introduce you. This is my good friend and neighbor, the owner of the noodle shop next door who has over twenty demolition-compensation apartments, Xu Qinglang!\"\n\n\"Hello,\" Xu Qinglang said to Lin Wanqiu, but his eyes remained fixed on the female corpse beside him.\n\nHe was truly as delicate as could be, like a frightened little quail.\n\n\"Hello,\" Lin Wanqiu said.\n\n\"And this...\" Zhou Ze pointed to the female corpse. \"Is Xu Qinglang's beloved.\"\n\n\"Right... what?\" Xu Qinglang was stunned. But in the next moment, Zhou Ze's hand applied a little force, and Xu Qinglang stumbled, leaning right against the female corpse.\n\n\"Yes, this is my beloved. Her surname is Bai, and her name is Bai Su Z... Bai Susu,\" Xu Qinglang said, looking at Lin Wanqiu while casually placing a hand on the female corpse's shoulder in a show of intimacy.\n\nIn an instant,\n\nthe same icy chill from last night pierced him straight to his soul.\n\n\"Ah... oh oh oh oh... ffffff... mmm...\"\n\nAfter a series of shivers, Xu Qinglang let go of her and said, \"Haha, darling, you're so soft. I love touching you. Hahahahaha!\"\n\n\"You two carry on. Wanqiu, come outside for a moment. I have something to tell you.\"\n\nWith that, Zhou Ze took Lin Wanqiu's hand and, ignoring whether she was willing or not, pulled her straight out of the bookstore.\n\n\"Hey, Xu Le, I just remembered something important I need to tell you too, like how I have too many apartments and want to give you one.\"\n\nXu Qinglang waved, making a move to follow Zhou Ze out.\n\nThe female corpse stood to the side, not moving, looking demure and serene.\n\nHowever, Xu Qinglang felt a terrifying chill wrap around his neck, as if he would be torn to shreds the moment he took another step outside.\n\nXu Qinglang wisely chose to stop, then chuckled nervously.\n\n\"Don't be angry, honey. How could I give our property away? We'll wait for the government to lift the limit to twenty children and let our kids inherit it all. You'll even get a Hero Mother medal then.\"\n\nXu Qinglang's expression was miserable as he sat back down on the plastic stool.\n\nZhou Ze pulled Dr. Lin out of the book house and all the way to where she had parked her car by the roadside.\n\n\"What is it? Say it,\" Dr. Lin asked.\n\n\"You seem to have gained some weight recently. Don't eat late-night snacks.\"\n\nAfter saying this, Zhou Ze pushed Dr. Lin towards her car.\n\n\"Hurry up and drive back. If you have nothing to do at night, go for a run or jump some rope or something.\"\n\n\"What on earth is wrong?\" Dr. Lin grabbed Zhou Ze as he was about to turn and go back into the bookstore.\n\n\"Don't worry about it. Just go, now,\" Zhou Ze urged.\n\nDr. Lin said no more. She got into her car, started the engine, gave Zhou Ze one last deep look, and drove away.\n\nZhou Ze let out a long sigh of relief, then squatted down by the roadside and lit a cigarette.\n\nTo be honest, he didn't want to go back to the bookstore. And reason told him that going with Dr. Lin was the smartest choice. But he couldn't. He was the one who had dug the female corpse out of that plot of land.\n\nZhou Ze didn't have a saintly complex; he actually hated trouble. But regardless, even setting aside his current status as a temporary Ghost Emissary, if he let the female corpse run amok and cause trouble in Tongcheng, in his hometown, he would honestly feel a little guilty.\n\nAs for Xu Qinglang, who was still in the bookstore...\n\nOh,\n\nXu Qinglang was still in the bookstore. Almost forgot.\n\nSuch a sucker.\n\nEven after dying,\n\nstill such a sucker.\n\nHe blew out a smoke ring, dropped the cigarette butt on the ground, and stamped on it forcefully. Then, Zhou Ze walked straight towards the bookstore.\n\nAs he pushed open the bookstore door, a black light began to swirl in Zhou Ze's eyes, and at the same time, his fingernails grew out.\n\n\"You're back again.\"\n\nThe female corpse was still standing there, her posture beautiful, but the playful mockery in her eyes was much clearer than when Dr. Lin had been present.\n\n\"Get your ass back to the second floor and lie down quietly,\" Zhou Ze barked, pointing at the female corpse. Whether he could win or not, it never hurt to strike a pose first.\n\n\"Do you guys prefer Durex or Jissbon? I have both at my place, I'll go get them for you.\"\n\nXu Qinglang said, once again getting up to leave.\n\nHe deeply regretted it.\n\nHe should have moved out during the day. Why did he have to linger here?\n\nHowever, the female corpse shot out a hand and grabbed at Xu Qinglang.\n\nA delicate shout escaped Xu Qinglang's throat: \"Heaven and Earth are boundless, the Mystic Heart's True Dharma!\"\n\nA copper mirror appeared in Xu Qinglang's hand, pointed at the female corpse.\n\nBut in that instant, the copper mirror shattered, and Xu Qinglang was sent flying, crashing against the bookstore wall.\n\nThe female corpse's might,\n\nterrifyingly powerful!\n\nZhou Ze charged forward immediately. This was his first real fight, and honestly, he had no confidence.\n\nHowever, the female corpse's gaze fixed on Zhou Ze's hands, and then she began to retreat, not daring to take a single step forward.\n\n\"Cough, cough...\"\n\nXu Qinglang climbed up from the floor, one hand on his lower back. He had expected Zhou Ze to be swept aside just like him, but instead, he saw Zhou Ze continuously forcing the female corpse back. He immediately felt it was unfair.\n\n\"Fuck, no holding back at all, huh!\"\n\nFinally, the female corpse was forced back against a wall. But in the next moment, she finally snapped and lunged at Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze just subconsciously reached out and swiped forward.\n\n*CRASH...*\n\nWith a loud crack, the female corpse was slammed heavily against the wall, which even caved in slightly.\n\nThe white dress over the fallen female corpse's chest was torn open. If not for the undergarment she wore, she would have been completely exposed.\n\n\"Damn, he's that fierce!\" Xu Qinglang stared, dumbfounded.\n\nAt the same time, he recalled his original plan to use force on Zhou Ze to find out the secret of his reincarnation. A wave of fear washed over him.\n\nThis neighbor of his had truly never fought before. Xu Qinglang was certain that Zhou Ze's earlier fear and apprehension of the female corpse were not an act.\n\nThe reason was simple:\n\nthis neighbor didn't even know he himself could fight so well!\n\nIndeed, Zhou Ze didn't know how to fight.\n\nHe grew up in an orphanage, a very clean one where the children got along well, knowing how to care for and encourage each other. After growing up, he became a doctor, a job meant for saving people. In his spare time, he had no interest in boxing or practicing MMA.\n\nAnd so,\n\nnow that Zhou Ze actually had to fight, even he felt his technique was a bit ugly.\n\nBecause the female ghost was afraid of his fingernails, his fighting style was like shrews scratching each other's faces. It had none of a Ghost Emissary's flair.\n\nCompared to the style points Little Loli got by just opening her mouth and intoning, \"The Underworld has its order, the Yellow Springs can be crossed,\" he was far, far inferior.\n\nBut none of that mattered right now. As long as it was effective.\n\nFor Zhou Ze, who had walked back fully expecting to be torn to shreds by the female corpse, the current situation was truly wonderful.\n\n\"Ah!\"\n\nThe female corpse was sent flying again. Every time she got near Zhou Ze's fingernails, the black energy on them would instantly pierce her body, causing immense damage.\n\n\"Heaven and Earth are boundless, the Mystic Heart's True Dharma!\"\n\nTwo talisman papers appeared in Xu Qinglang's hands. He slapped them onto the floor. For a moment, the chill in the bookstore seemed to lessen. And every time the female corpse landed, the talismans would tremble, and the spot beneath her would burn as if a fire had been lit there.\n\nThe female corpse's gaze hardened. She didn't dare face Zhou Ze anymore and chose to break through from the side. She was very fast, attempting to smash through the bookstore's glass door to escape.\n\nHowever, Zhou Ze was getting more and more into the zone.\n\nAs the saying goes, even if you haven't eaten pork, haven't you seen a pig oink?¹\n\nFrom the Hong Kong films of his childhood to later Wuxia and Xianxia movies, everyone had seen enough of the general tropes.\n\nZhou Ze spread his hands, his dark eyes fixed on the door.\n\nAs the female corpse tried to smash through the glass door, black streaks of light suddenly appeared on it, like scratches left by fingernails.\n\nThe female corpse let out a bloodcurdling scream and was violently thrown back, landing on the floor.\n\nZhou Ze slowly walked forward, steadying his own breathing at the same time.\n\nHowever, the female corpse, having been \"dragged\" back, immediately fell to her knees. She pointed a finger at Zhou Ze with one hand and covered her face with the other.\n\n\"Sob, sob, sob, sob, sob...\"\n\n\"I'll beat you to death, you whimpering monster!\"\n\nXu Qinglang pulled out another talisman paper.\n\nBut the female corpse started pointing at Zhou Ze, crying with great grievance.\n\n\"You touched me, and then you hit me! You're not human!\"\n\nThe corner of Zhou Ze's mouth twitched subconsciously.\n\nFor the female corpse who had just exerted such immense pressure and terror on him and Xu Qinglang to suddenly act like this... it truly felt like a complete tonal shift.\n\nBut Zhou Ze still replied very seriously in a deep voice:\n\n\"I'm a ghost.\"\n\n---\nPS: Asking for recommendation votes. Throw them all at me. Dragon² just found out our top spot on the new book chart was snatched.\n\nIn that case, let's snatch it back.\n\n---\n¹ A Chinese proverb meaning that one can have knowledge about something through observation, even without direct experience.\n² \"Dragon\" (龙) is likely the author's nickname.",

    "content": "\"I merely wished to tease you a little, Sir. Why did you have to be so cruel?\n\nYou truly are a heartless and fickle man, Sir. You touched me, took liberties with me...\n\nAnd then you turn around and refuse to take responsibility. What's more, you take your anger out on me because of your wife.\"\n\nThe female corpse shed tears as she muttered to herself, looking utterly miserable. Paired with the white dress on her body, which was now practically shredded into strips, she was a truly pitiable sight.\n\nPeople often say that those who live to their seventies or eighties become as cunning as foxes. The female corpse before them, however, had lived for two hundred years and weathered the vicissitudes of time.\n\nZhou Ze ignored the female corpse's \"lament\" and turned his head to look at Xu Qinglang.\n\n\"Can we kill her?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"...\" The female corpse.\n\nXu Qinglang shook his head, then nodded.\n\n\"What does that mean?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"The baleful energy inside her is a problem. If she self-destructs at the last moment and her baleful energy leaks out, it will definitely harm the innocent people nearby,\" Xu Qinglang explained. \"That would be very troublesome.\"\n\n\"Mmm-hmm,\" the female corpse chimed in. She had given up on the idea of continuing to play the sympathy card with Zhou Ze. The most heartless are the unfaithful lovers; clearly, Zhou Ze was now on her blacklist.\n\n\"But she wouldn't dare pull a stunt like that. Her soul is already in Hell. If she causes any grievous harm in the mortal world, her soul in Hell will be punished as well. So, she can still be killed.\"\n\nWith a cigarette dangling from his lips, Xu Qinglang, who had just been panicking like a quail about to be forced upon, was now able to watch the show and make wisecracks with the super-powered Zhou Ze by his side.\n\n\"Don't kill me, don't kill me! She is she, I am I! We are two different people!\" the female corpse cried out hastily. She could tell that the two men before her truly wanted to solve the problem of her once and for all.\n\nAny intelligent life form has an instinct for survival, and the female corpse was no exception.\n\n*A thousand sails pass by the sunken ship; ten thousand saplings flourish before the withered tree.*[^1]\n\nThe female corpse was not, in fact, Madam Bai. To a certain extent, she was an independent life form, an \"intelligence\" born from Madam Bai's physical body over two hundred years. However, the female corpse and Madam Bai were still inextricably linked.\n\nXu Qinglang was right. The female corpse dared not do anything too excessive in the mortal world. Even in death, she would not choose to act recklessly and cause the Madam Bai in Hell to suffer punishment.\n\nZhou Ze squatted down in front of the female corpse. \"Then what did you mean just now? You were just playing around?\"\n\nThe female corpse nodded.\n\n\"Heh heh.\" Zhou Ze chuckled twice. Thinking about it now, he was still a bit too \"young.\" Inexperienced as a new ghost emissary, he had actually agreed to Madam Bai's request.\n\n\"Isn't there any way to control her?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"You can control her by extracting a wisp of her corpse soul blood. But she has to be willing to give it to you voluntarily,\" Xu Qinglang suggested from the side.\n\nThe female corpse's head snapped up, her eyes flashing with intense hatred as she stared daggers at Xu Qinglang. At that moment, it was as if Xu Qinglang was her greatest enemy.\n\n\"Either die, or hand over your soul blood. You choose,\" Xu Qinglang said with a smile playing on his lips.\n\n\"You... choose.\" Zhou Ze also looked at the female corpse. Clearly, he agreed with Xu Qinglang's suggestion.\n\nZhou Ze was a neat freak. He had no desire for a repeat of the female corpse inexplicably coming downstairs to clean his cup with her tongue.\n\n\"Fine, I'll give it to you.\" The female corpse took a deep breath, as if to bury her current resentment and anger. Then, she closed her eyes. Immediately, a wisp of something resembling a red earthworm emerged from between her eyebrows.\n\nZhou Ze reached out and pinched the thing with his fingernails, then pulled it out and placed it in his palm. It was slightly warm, a bit moist, and slippery.\n\nAfter handing over her soul blood, the female corpse's spirit immediately flagged. She was on the verge of fainting, only managing to stay upright through sheer will.\n\n\"Go clean yourself up in the bathroom and then go lie down. From this day forward, you are not to take a single step out of this bookstore without my permission,\" Zhou Ze warned.\n\n\"Yes, Sir.\" The female corpse lowered her head, her posture extremely submissive. With her soul blood in his grasp, she had no choice but to bow.\n\n***\n\n\"Smack.\"\n\nZhou Ze threw the bottle of medicinal wine onto the table. He was clearly just applying liniment for Xu Qinglang, but it sounded as if he were doing something disgusting.\n\n\"Rub it in yourself.\"\n\n\"Hey, don't be like that. You're not hurt, but I was thrown against the wall. I've got so many bruises. Don't you have even a shred of compassion?\" Xu Qinglang grew more agitated as he spoke. \"Zhou Ze, ever since you came here, have you noticed that I've been constantly having bad luck?\"\n\n\"It's fate.\" Zhou Ze refused to take the blame. \"By the way, that incantation you were chanting earlier sounded really familiar.\"\n\n*Heaven and Earth are boundless, the Mystic Heart's righteous law.*\n\n\"It's from a TV show.[^2] I thought it sounded cool, so I used it. It actually doesn't help with casting spells at all,\" Xu Qinglang admitted honestly.\n\n\"So it's like adding your own background music?\"\n\n\"Hmph...\" Xu Qinglang rolled his eyes and started applying the medicinal wine himself. \"There's some plum juice in the kitchen. Take it with you. I'm not opening the shop tomorrow morning; I need to rest more.\"\n\n\"I'm heading back to rest.\" Zhou Ze stood up, took the plum juice, and left. After returning to the bookstore, he went straight up to the second floor.\n\nThe female corpse had obediently washed herself clean and was lying in the freezer, wearing Zhou Ze's clothes.\n\nThe white shirt was a bit large on her, the hem hanging down to cover the curve of her upturned rear. She wasn't wearing any pants, her legs crossed as she lay inside, her eyes alluring.\n\nZhou Ze reached out and tapped the side of the freezer. \"I remember Madam Bai saying she died before her wedding.\"\n\nTherefore, Madam Bai should have been a virgin. But the female corpse before him had a rather promiscuous air about her.\n\n\"That's because she didn't tell you that she was drowned by her father for shaming the family after he discovered her illicit affair with a poor scholar before the wedding.\"\n\n\"Oh. So you're an experienced old hand?\"\n\n\"Of course. Do you have any idea how much thought and effort she put in to make me not look as horrifying as a drowning victim?\"\n\n\"Women, in the end, are vain.\" Zhou Ze shook his head. \"Go to sleep.\"\n\nWith that, Zhou Ze placed a pillow next to the freezer and lay down.\n\nHaving the female corpse beside him, the chill emanating from her body felt very comfortable—even more pleasant than lying in the freezer himself.\n\nHe slept soundly. When he woke up the next morning, Zhou Ze opened his eyes to see a pair of long legs dangling leisurely in front of him, the arch of the feet held at a perfect angle.\n\nIf she were wearing stockings or high heels...\n\nWhen facing the female corpse, Zhou Ze found he could be much more relaxed.\n\nNeither of them was human, so there was no need for pretense or hypocrisy. It was, in a way, more pure.\n\n\"If you can't hold back, I can lie down. I know you really want to do that kind of thing.\n\nBottling it up for too long can't be good, especially since your body isn't your original one. It could really cause problems, you know.\"\n\nThe female corpse spoke magnanimously, smiling as she added, \"Don't worry, I can't get pregnant.\"\n\nZhou Ze walked down the stairs to wash up, then began to cook instant noodles. Once everything was ready, he took out the plum juice and struggled through his morning meal.\n\n\"It's painful, isn't it? Eating human food.\" The female corpse sat on the steps, her head turned to the side as she watched Zhou Ze.\n\n\"It's none of your business.\"\n\n\"You're already dead, yet you insist on living like a human. Don't you find it tiring?\"\n\n\"You're talking a bit too much,\" Zhou Ze said with a slight frown.\n\n\"You said yesterday that I'm not allowed to leave the bookstore. So besides talking to you, what else can I do?\"\n\nZhou Ze grabbed the mop and broom from behind the counter and threw them all at the female corpse.\n\n\"Clean.\"\n\n***\n\nThe sun was wonderful today. The female corpse knelt on the bookstore's tiled floor, wiping it with a rag, while Zhou Ze moved a plastic stool outside the shop to sit and bask in the sun.\n\nIt wasn't until noon that Xu Qinglang finally opened his shop door and came out. He took a cigarette from Zhou Ze, glanced at the scene inside the shop, and smiled.\n\n\"You've trained her well.\"\n\nZhou Ze kept his eyes squinted, enjoying the sunlight.\n\nXu Qinglang blew a smoke ring, then said as if he'd just remembered something:\n\n\"Your sign is well-made. It's got a lot of style. Makes mine next door pale in comparison. I'm thinking of getting a custom sign made too.\"\n\n\"Posing as a man of culture?\" Zhou Ze chuckled.\n\n\"Why not?\" Xu Qinglang raised an eyebrow. \"If I lay out my twenty-some property deeds, who can say I'm not cultured?\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head helplessly.\n\n\"Come on, help me brainstorm. I think yours, 'Listen with skepticism, for this is what I have heard,' is pretty good. I'm thinking the horizontal inscription for my couplet will be 'Life is like a dream.' How about it? Sounds sophisticated, right?\n\nBut for the couplet itself, I think it's best to have something related to 'eating,' so it fits my restaurant, right?\n\nI just can't think of a good one. Do you have any suggestions?\"\n\nZhou Ze pondered for a moment, then said, \"You really want to hear it?\"\n\n\"Just say it,\" Xu Qinglang urged.\n\nZhou Ze glanced at the female corpse inside the room and said:\n\n\"Man eats from the earth his whole life,\n\nThe earth eats man but once.\n\nHorizontal scroll:\n\nLife is like a dream.\"\n\n---\n[^1]: A famous poem by Liu Yuxi of the Tang Dynasty, symbolizing renewal and the relentless march of time.\n[^2]: A reference to the classic Hong Kong film franchise *A Chinese Ghost Story*.",

    "content": "\"Here, try it. The new version of the sour plum juice.\"\n\nXu Qinglang placed a glass on Zhou Ze's counter. This glass of sour plum juice looked richer in color than the previous version. Swirling it in his hand, it felt like holding a glass of wine.\n\n\"What's different?\" Zhou Ze didn't drink it, asking first.\n\n\"The flavor is heavier, a bit like aged yellow wine. The kick comes later. It'll let you eat without having to wolf down your food like before, raising your quality-of-life index.\"\n\n\"Hmph. Such intimacy.\"\n\nThe female corpse, who was organizing the bookshelf nearby, remarked sourly.\n\nZhou Ze took a sip. Unlike the sour plum juice he'd had before, this one was bracingly sweet with a pleasant aftertaste. The flavor... was quite good.\n\nHowever, this didn't seem to be the feeling he was after.\n\nBut, not long after tasting it, Zhou Ze felt a sharp, sour cramp in his gut.\n\n\"*Hiss...*\"\n\nHis body began to tremble uncontrollably.\n\nThat acidic aftertaste...\n\nSo overpowering.\n\nHis ten fingers curled slightly, then slowly unfurled. Zhou Ze nodded, very satisfied.\n\n\"You've been very thoughtful,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Don't mention it.\" Xu Qinglang smiled faintly. \"I plan to make this one of my signature side dishes. It's just a shame that few people would probably like this flavor.\"\n\n\"Mm.\" On this point, Zhou Ze agreed.\n\n*Squeak.*\n\nThe bookstore door was pushed open, and a group of students walked in. There were quite a few of them, seven or eight, and they all looked like the goody-two-shoes type.\n\n\"Boss, what's the WiFi password?\" a girl asked.\n\nZhou Ze pointed to the wall, where it was written.\n\n\"Phew...\"\n\nThe students each found a plastic stool and sat down. Then, a girl took some homework out of her backpack and distributed it for the others to copy.\n\nWinter break was about to end, so this was a fairly normal sight.\n\nZhou Ze, of course, wasn't so bored as to go over and lecture these kids on the importance of studying and the disadvantages of copying someone else's homework. He tapped his finger on the counter, and the female corpse understood, coming over to pour him a glass of warm water.\n\nAt that moment, the girl who seemed to be the leader walked over to the bookshelf and casually flipped through the books. After picking a few, she came to Zhou Ze. \"How much?\"\n\n\"Ninety-five,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\n\"Here, keep the change.\"\n\nThe girl was generous, tossing down a hundred-yuan bill.\n\nZhou Ze took the money and said nothing more.\n\nAround five in the afternoon, the students finished their homework and left, and the bookstore returned to its proper state of desolation.\n\nXu Qinglang wasn't in the shop; he'd gone to order a custom sign. Of course, he wouldn't be ordering the kind of sign Zhou Ze had suggested:\n\n\"Man eats dirt his whole life; dirt eats man but once.\"\n\n...because anyone with half a brain could see that such a sign wasn't fit for a restaurant, but rather for flanking a tombstone.\n\nThe female corpse was actually quite efficient at her work. Today, she'd cleaned both the first and second floors. Aside from occasionally striking a pose to show off her charms, she was basically flawless.\n\nShe hadn't said where she would go, and Zhou Ze hadn't asked.\n\nOf course, Zhou Ze remembered Lady Bai's reminder: \"On the next Winter Clothes Festival,¹ incinerate the corpse with bamboo and wood.\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't know if Lady Bai was aware that her own corpse had, in fact, long since gained sentience.\n\nIf she knew, yet still entrusted it to him, while also telling him the method and time for its cremation, what was he to make of that?\n\nLast night, the female corpse had admitted that even if Zhou Ze were to strike her down, she wouldn't willingly undergo martial dissolution and let her Demonic Qi leak out to harm the innocent, which would implicate Lady Bai in Hell.\n\nAnd yet,\n\nIt seemed Lady Bai simply wanted to be rid of this trouble cleanly.\n\nFrom this perspective,\n\nThis female corpse he was using as a maid,\n\nWas actually a pitiful person.\n\n\"What's your name?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"My surname is Bai,\" the female corpse replied.\n\n\"Bai what?\"\n\n\"Bai Yingying.\"\n\n\"Bai *Ying-ying*?\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded. *What a strange name.*\n\n\"Actually, you don't have to struggle so much to eat.\" The female corpse stretched, her impressive figure accentuated. \"It's like how you can sleep so soundly when you're with me.\n\n\"Your soul is tainted with the aura of Hell, but your body is still that of a living person.\n\n\"You need to sleep, need to eat, to sustain your physical body. But your soul doesn't need these things, so it instinctively resists and rejects them.\"\n\n\"Go on.\"\n\n\"I can feed you from now on.\" The female corpse gave a bashful smile. \"Food that passes through my mouth, carrying my... juices, will be imbued with a ghostly aura. When you eat it then, it won't feel so unpleasant.\"\n\nZhou Ze suddenly understood why the glass of water last time had tasted a bit sweet. It wasn't because the female corpse had a \"sweet mouth,\" but for this very reason.\n\n\"Thank you.\"\n\n\"Don't be polite.\"\n\nA man in a leather jacket walked up to the shop door. His clothes were a bit tacky, his hair somewhat disheveled, and his face was flushed; he must have been drinking.\n\nHe paced outside for two laps before finally pushing the door open and entering the bookstore.\n\nAt first, Zhou Ze paid him no mind, but soon, his gaze sharpened.\n\nThis man... he knew him.\n\nSun Tao, his former assistant. A... very promising young doctor.\n\nThe female corpse's gaze also sharpened. She gently poked Zhou Ze in the waist and said in a soft, cloying voice:\n\n\"Sir, that thing... can I eat it?\"\n\nEat a person?\n\nZhou Ze frowned slightly.\n\n\"Sir, didn't you notice? On that man's back.\"\n\nThus reminded, Zhou Ze stood up and saw a dark, grubby thing stuck to the man's back.\n\nAn ordinary person might not know what it was, as it looked rather abstract—somewhat like a black worm, yet with certain peculiar, human-like features.\n\nBut Zhou Ze, due to his former profession, recognized it at a glance—a premature infant.\n\n\"Wuu wuu... wuu wuu...\"\n\nAs if sensing Zhou Ze's attention, the infant let out a faint whimper.\n\nThe sound was somewhat familiar. Zhou Ze searched his memory and finally found the source.\n\nNurse Chen.\n\nTo be precise, it was the sound that had once come from Nurse Chen's belly, though back then, only Zhou Ze had been able to hear it.\n\nZhou Ze felt no secret delight at his ability to perform this sort of \"paternity test.\"\n\nWhat welled up in his heart was only sorrow.\n\n*So the child wasn't saved after all?*\n\nWhen the female corpse said she wanted to eat it, she didn't mean the man, but the soul of that infant boy.\n\nZhou Ze shot her a glare. The female corpse pouted, not daring to say more, and could only stand to the side, resentfully swallowing her saliva while rubbing the heavy weight on her chest.\n\n\"I don't eat the food of the living, and every night you use me like an alchemical furnace to harvest my Demonic Qi. If I don't get some nourishment soon, *these* will shrink, and then you won't be able to sneak glances at me while I work.\"\n\nZhou Ze was stunned for a moment. She'd been aware of his gaze all along?\n\n\"You devil,\" the female corpse chided coquettishly.\n\n\"Boss, you got any alcohol?\" Sun Tao called out.\n\n\"Try next door,\" Zhou Ze replied, but still stood up and poured him a glass of water.\n\nAfter all, he was a subordinate he had once mentored. He himself had grown up in an orphanage, while Sun Tao had grown up in a single-parent home. In the past, Zhou Ze had ignored even adoring fans like Dr. Lin, yet he had shown great care for this junior named Sun Tao.\n\nThere was no other reason than the fact their personalities were very similar. Their childhood experiences made them better understand the meaning of struggle and hard work; both wanted to fight and claw their way to a better life to prove themselves.\n\n\"*Pfft... Hahahahaha...*\" Sun Tao took the water, gulped down a large mouthful, and then burst out laughing. \"Boss, why are you looking at me like that? I'm not interested in men, you know.\"\n\n*With such a beautiful man living next door, I wouldn't stoop to being interested in you.*\n\nSun Tao sat down on a plastic stool, bit his lip, and then shook his head.\n\n\"Boss, do you have kids?\"\n\n\"We're not ready for them yet. He thinks I'm too young,\" the female corpse interjected, desperately trying to insert herself into the drama.\n\nSun Tao looked up at the female corpse. She looked to be high school age at most, and he immediately chuckled.\n\n\"You really are still young.\"\n\nThe female corpse turned away in a huff, then swallowed another mouthful of saliva.\n\n\"I was supposed to have a child,\" Sun Tao said with some emotion.\n\n*You do have a child*, Zhou Ze thought. *And that child is hanging on your back.*\n\nWith the development of modern medicine and the \"modernization\" of people's thinking, terms like \"abortion\" were no longer so jarring, but few people understood that the resentment of an unborn infant is actually the most potent of all.\n\nThese miscarried infants were also the most likely to turn into ghosts. Of course, their ability to seek revenge was actually very weak.\n\nAt most, driven by resentment, they would linger around their so-called parents for a time before dissipating on their own.\n\nThe female corpse wanted to eat it because this type of infant, not having been fully born, was like an unsprouted seed. To a being like her, its \"nutritional value\" was extremely high.\n\n\"What happened?\" Zhou Ze asked. \"Did your girlfriend not agree?\"\n\nZhou Ze remembered that although Nurse Chen had been anxious and shocked, she had said she wanted to keep the baby.\n\n\"No, she was willing. But I wasn't. I chickened out. I made her get rid of the baby.\"\n\nFor some reason, Sun Tao felt a strong urge to talk to this bookstore owner. In him, he found the familiar feeling of an old big brother.\n\nAnd that old big brother had been gone for more than half a year.\n\n\"Chickened out?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Her parents already looked down on me. Heh, her family... they're well-off.\" Sun Tao raised his head, as if trying to hold back tears.\n\n\"But what's done is done,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"But I wasn't willing to use this to coerce her family. I don't want my colleagues, my friends, to think I used those kinds of tactics to marry into their family.\n\n\"I don't want people to think I'm a 'Phoenix Man.'²\n\n\"I don't covet their family's money, or anything else.\n\n\"I don't want to get married and have a father-in-law and mother-in-law looking down on me, not to mention their whole clan of relatives.\n\n\"I grew up in a single-parent home, so I understand better than anyone that dignity is something you have to earn for yourself.\"\n\n\"Even if she was willing?\"\n\n\"Her being willing is one thing, but I wasn't willing. I want to live with dignity.\n\n\"Heh. When I first started in the field, an old big brother told me that dignity, and how others treat you, are things you have to earn with your own two hands. I haven't achieved anything yet, so I don't want to...\"\n\nZhou Ze took a deep breath, then asked, \"Did that big brother of yours ever tell you one more thing?\"\n\n\"What?\" Sun Tao asked, surprised.\n\n\"And that is: when you're having your fun, don't forget to wear a... condom.\"\n\nAfter speaking, Zhou Ze swung his fist and smashed it right into Sun Tao's face.\n\n*Pow!*\n\nSun Tao took the heavy punch for no apparent reason, collapsing to the ground, a look of utter confusion on his face.\n\n\"Don't make excuses. Don't prattle on about dignity. Don't say anything else.\n\n\"You're just selfish. Utterly and completely selfish.\"\n\nWith that,\n\nZhou Ze kicked Sun Tao again as he lay on the ground.\n\n*Thud!*\n\nSun Tao curled up. He was in pain, and also drunk, but he still shouted angrily:\n\n\"Are you crazy?! Attacking people!\"\n\n\"That's right, I am crazy! I was fucking blind back then, thinking I should train you and give you a leg up!\"\n\nJust then,\n\nThe coiled mass that had been clinging to Sun Tao's shoulder crawled in front of Zhou Ze,\n\nletting out a \"squeak squeak squeak\" sound from its mouth.\n\nThe female corpse heard it.\n\nZhou Ze heard it.\n\nBut Sun Tao couldn't hear it.\n\nHis unborn child, who had never truly seen this world with its own eyes,\n\nwas now baring its teeth,\n\nand at the person who was hitting its father,\n\nit let out an angry cry...\n\n***\n\n¹ A day in the tenth lunar month when families burn paper clothing for the spirits of their ancestors to wear in the winter.\n² A term for a man from a humble rural background who marries a wealthier city woman.

    "content": "周澤坐了下來，沒繼續打人，的確，他確實沒理由去打人，是否要孩子是人家自己的自由，也是人家可以掌握的權力；\n\n\n\n  而且，\n\n\n\n  現在連唯一的苦主，\n\n\n\n  都不願意自己出手打人。\n\n\n\n  「呵……」\n\n\n\n  周澤點了一根煙。\n\n\n\n  孫濤從地上爬了起來，指著周澤喊道：「你有毛病吧，我要報警，我要去驗傷。」\n\n\n\n  「你該打。」周澤頭也沒抬吐出一口煙圈。\n\n\n\n  「你……你……你……」孫濤指了指周澤，然後直接推開書店的門走了出去，他心裡暗道晦氣，今天怎麼會莫名其妙地跑到這家書店來。\n\n\n\n  那個嬰兒還想跟著一起出去，卻被周澤一把抓住。\n\n\n\n  嬰兒在掙扎，很不滿，但周澤沒理會他的反應，依舊把他按在地上。\n\n\n\n  「你還跟著做什麼，再跟下去，你連下輩子的機會都沒了。」周澤說道。\n\n\n\n  「吱吱吱吱…………」\n\n\n\n  嬰兒還在掙扎，根本聽不進周澤的話語。\n\n\n\n  「上差。」女屍湊到了周澤跟前，目送秋波，含著討好的意思，顯然，她以為周澤把嬰兒留下來是打算給她進補的。 \n\n\n\n  是吧，\n\n\n\n  大部分男人都有一個養成夢。\n\n\n\n  女屍覺得自己正適合，\n\n\n\n  無論是從年齡還是從身材上來說。\n\n\n\n  「上差……嘛……嗯……嘛……老闆……嗯……嘛……嘛……」\n\n\n\n  女屍搖曳身姿，恰到好處地抖了抖。\n\n\n\n  然後人慾靜而肉不止；\n\n\n\n  蔚為壯觀。\n\n\n\n  「人家可是還會繼續長大的哦，只要營養跟得上。」\n\n\n\n  「滾。」\n\n\n\n  「…………」女屍。\n\n\n\n  「幫我看住他，不准他跑，如果你偷吃了，你也跟著一起死。」周澤面無表情地站起來。\n\n\n\n  「是，老闆。」\n\n\n\n  女屍只得蹲下來，雙手將嬰兒抓住。\n\n\n\n  「老闆，他不會報警吧？」女屍是怕麻煩。\n\n\n\n  「不會，他這種人不會吵鬧到全世界都知道他喝醉酒被打了的。」\n\n\n\n  「呵，死要面子的傢伙。」女屍不屑道。\n\n\n\n  其實，周澤有一句話沒說，那個傢伙的性格，其實和當初的自己一樣。\n\n\n\n  周澤看了看自己的右手手掌位置，緩緩地閉上眼，在心裡默念著什麼，然後再睜開眼， \n\n\n\n  嗯，\n\n\n\n  什麼都沒發生。\n\n\n\n  緊接著，周澤蹲下來，伸出自己的手掌，對著那個嬰兒探了過去。\n\n\n\n  嗯，\n\n\n\n  依舊什麼都沒發生。\n\n\n\n  邊上抓著嬰兒的女屍一開始很莫名其妙，但很快反應出周澤要做什麼了，然後身體微微顫抖，這是強忍著不去笑。\n\n\n\n  周澤瞥了女屍一眼，「忍住不就別忍了。」\n\n\n\n  是的，周澤自己都得苦笑。\n\n\n\n  小蘿莉說把地獄之門的鑰匙放在自己手中，然而當自己第一次打算開門將鬼送進去時，卻不知道到底該如何打開。\n\n\n\n  總之，小蘿莉應該不可能單純地只是和自己開一個玩笑，將一個類似刺青的東西印在自己手中。\n\n\n\n  「哈哈哈哈哈哈……妾身怎麼好意思笑話老闆你呢………\n\n\n\n  哈哈哈哈哈…………妾身不敢對老闆不敬的………………\n\n\n\n  哈哈哈啊哈。」\n\n\n\n  「好了，你知道怎麼開麼？」周澤問道。\n\n\n\n  女屍搖了搖頭，「老闆，這個我是真的不知道，或者，有什麼口訣？」\n\n\n\n  周澤聞言，默默地回憶許清朗對自己說過小蘿莉收回他父母亡魂時的畫面。 \n\n\n\n  當即，他攤開手，沉聲道：\n\n\n\n  「陰司有序，黃泉可渡。」\n\n\n\n  「呼…………」\n\n\n\n  玻璃門外，有枯黃的落葉吹過，\n\n\n\n  好像還有一隻烏鴉「哇……哇……哇」飛走；\n\n\n\n  書店裡，依舊靜悄悄的。\n\n\n\n  總之，還是沒反應。\n\n\n\n  「或者，換個口訣？」女屍建議道，「每個人都有自己適合的一款吧？」\n\n\n\n  「難道你讓我喊芝麻開門？」周澤反問道。\n\n\n\n  「這個，就看老闆你的喜好什麼體位了。」\n\n\n\n  女屍一副童言無忌的樣子。\n\n\n\n  周澤記起來那晚打架時，許清朗也喊過「天地無極，玄心正法」的口訣，然後出符和出銅鏡；\n\n\n\n  但事後正如許清朗說的那樣，那只是他以前看電視劇覺得這兩句台詞B格很高，所以才套用的，類似於電影裡主角登場時的BGM。\n\n\n\n  其實，沒卵用。\n\n\n\n  現在想來，可能小蘿莉張開嘴，伸出舌頭說的那句「陰司有序，黃泉可渡」應該也是類似於增加B格的話語。\n\n\n\n  看來，小蘿莉在趣味性上和許清朗沒什麼區別，哪怕她是一名資深鬼差。 \n\n\n\n  周澤心念一動，左手食指指甲開始長長。\n\n\n\n  女屍露出了畏懼的神色，她怕周澤，而且最怕的是周澤的指甲，在這指甲上，有讓她畏懼的氣息。\n\n\n\n  這讓周澤自己都有些懷疑，當初那個死在自己面前的老人，可能並非那麼簡單。\n\n\n\n  偷渡客也分兩類，一類就像是以前的自己，得夾著尾巴做人，一類就像是小蘿莉所說的蓉城的那一位，搞出了很多事情，甚至連鬼差們都覺得很難辦很棘手。\n\n\n\n  總之，那個傳染自己灰指甲的老者，應該沒那麼簡單。\n\n\n\n  黑色的指甲刺入了周澤右手掌心的印記，緊接著，當周澤將指甲抽出來時，一道黑色的絲線被周澤扯了出來。\n\n\n\n  像是滾熱的焦糖一樣，很粘稠，卻又不斷裂。\n\n\n\n  扯出來的絲線被周澤畫了一個方框，\n\n\n\n  隨即，\n\n\n\n  方框懸浮起來，\n\n\n\n  裡面也開始變成黑色，空悠悠的，一股股陰風開始吹來。\n\n\n\n  女屍手中的嬰兒開始掙扎，顯然，他不想回到地獄裡去。\n\n\n\n  人死如燈滅，\n\n\n\n  但真的能看得開的人，不多。\n\n\n\n  多少七老八十甚至一輩子喪盡天良壞事兒做盡的人都想著辦法舔活著，就別提這個小嬰兒了。 \n\n\n\n  但周澤清楚，將他送入地獄，去期待新的開始和輪迴，才是最正確的選擇。\n\n\n\n  不需要徵求他的意見，在這個時候，周澤顯得很蠻橫，他直接從女屍那裡將嬰兒抓了過來，而後直接丟入了這黑黢黢的方框裡。\n\n\n\n  隨後，方框慢慢地消散，空氣中瀰漫著淡淡的燒焦味道。\n\n\n\n  女屍吐了吐舌頭，沒說什麼。\n\n\n\n  周澤則是有些出神，說到底，這是自己第一次將鬼物送回地獄，上次那個希望陪著自己兒子高考的婦人，周澤都沒這麼做。\n\n\n\n  「地獄，你去過麼？」周澤問道。\n\n\n\n  「沒有。」女屍老老實實地回答，「而且我下不去的。」\n\n\n\n  女屍沒有自己的靈魂，\n\n\n\n  殭屍不入五行，不落人回。\n\n\n\n  這聽起來似乎很牛逼，\n\n\n\n  但後面要加上一句：\n\n\n\n  人憎鬼厭，天棄之！\n\n\n\n  意思就是女屍如果沒事做出去遛個彎，也有一定概率大白天一聲旱雷砸中她然後直接灰飛煙滅。\n\n\n\n  這個世界，對她來說，就是這般不友好。\n\n\n\n  人有陽間，\n\n\n\n  鬼有地獄，\n\n\n\n  兩者接不屬的存在，就是異端。 \n\n\n\n  周澤坐回到了櫃檯後面，他不覺得高興，只覺得有些枯燥和無聊。\n\n\n\n  如果說將陽間比作一個生產線，那麼自己所做的，無非就是將報廢的產品丟進焚化爐里回爐重造。\n\n\n\n  「老闆，這裡有一疊這個。」\n\n\n\n  女屍從瓷磚上撿起幾張冥鈔，遞給了周澤。\n\n\n\n  周澤有些意外，他沒料到這次居然也有報酬。\n\n\n\n  「閻王好見，小鬼難纏。」女屍說完這句話後就有些後悔，但還是硬著頭皮道：「鬼差送人上路，過路扒皮，本就是題中應有之義。\n\n\n\n  想來，是他母親曾給他燒過紙錢吧。」\n\n\n\n  周澤點點頭，將冥鈔收下，自己櫃檯後面抽屜里放著上次剩下的冥鈔，哪怕加上這幾張，還是有點少。\n\n\n\n  「你還有沒有認識的朋友？介紹點生意來做做，做人……哦不，做鬼也要多讀書，才能更好地進步。」\n\n\n\n  「老闆，妾身只認識一些孤魂野鬼，他們也早就斷了香火供奉，根本就沒錢，而且他們也不敢到您跟前來，如果被您收了去，豈不是白白給您送了業績？」\n\n\n\n  「業績？」周澤還是第一次聽到這個，「做鬼差也有業績？」\n\n\n\n  「難道沒有？」女屍有些疑惑道。\n\n\n\n  「我不知道啊。」周澤聳了聳肩，他是真的不知道，因為小蘿莉就給自己留了一句「你是我見過最有逼數的」然後就： \n\n\n\n  biu\n\n\n\n  的一下，下去了。\n\n\n\n  也沒給自己留下一本《鬼差的行為守則》或者《如何當好一個有理想有奮鬥有追求的鬼差》。\n\n\n\n  「想來，應該是有的吧。」女屍有些為難道：「就像是我家那位夫人一樣，逗留陽間兩百年，護佑鄉澤，兢兢業業，也無非是想著回地獄後能贖以前的逗留之罪同時還能謀求一個官身。\n\n\n\n  若是當初她的那座廟不被毀掉，香火還在的話，根本用不了這麼久的時間。」\n\n\n\n  「你還認識其他鬼差麼？」周澤問道。\n\n\n\n  「妾身哪裡能認識那麼多上差呀。」\n\n\n\n  「哦。」周澤點點頭，看來以後得找懂行的人問問。\n\n\n\n  這時候，外面傳來了電瓶車的聲音，是許清朗回來了。\n\n\n\n  「哎喲我去，累死我了。」\n\n\n\n  許清朗走進書店，給周澤丟了一根煙。\n\n\n\n  「不是去訂牌匾的麼？」周澤問道。\n\n\n\n  「那個訂好了，然後我順路去進了一批貨，最近灣仔碼頭打特價，我多囤了一些，可把我累的。」\n\n\n\n  「你的水餃不是現做的？」\n\n\n\n  「嘿嘿，快餐店裡的可樂還是從隔壁超市買的再賣出去的呢，我哪有那個閒工夫天天在家裡包餃子。」 \n\n\n\n  「灣仔碼頭，挺適合你的。」\n\n\n\n  「對吧，我也喜歡那個口味……嘿，不聊了，我先回去裝冰箱。」許清朗跟周澤擺擺手，回到自己店裡去了。\n\n\n\n  等許清朗走後，女屍忽然「噗哧」一笑。\n\n\n\n  周澤有些意外，「你聽懂了？」\n\n\n\n  女屍笑道：\n\n\n\n  「他確實長得很好看啊，大部分男的和他在一起都會變彎的吧。\n\n\n\n  所以，\n\n\n\n  彎仔碼頭。」\n\n\n\n  ——————\n\n\n\n  PS：鑑於發書以來書評區經常有讀者留言說「作者抄襲了《他從地獄來》或者作者開頭和《他從地獄來》很相似，龍做一個統一回復吧：\n\n\n\n  《他從地獄來》就是龍寫的書。",

    "content": "In recent years, Tongcheng had become a rather famous place—not for its economy, nor for its local snacks, but for its college entrance exams.\n\nFor the majority of third-year high school students across the country, the Tongcheng Mock Exams were formidable enough to rival the Huanggang Secret Papers.\n\nOf course, these matters originally had no bearing on Zhou Ze. His bookstore had long since shed its dependence on \"business from the living,\" having already upgraded and transformed its industrial structure to make money from the dead.\n\nHowever, the fatty who had sought him out last time had found him again.\n\nHis purpose was simple. The next semester was the college entrance exam semester, and the fatty planned to go big again with a business selling pirated secret papers.\n\nThere were probably many ins and outs to this, even an extremely complex chain of interests. Zhou Ze wasn't very clear on the details; in fact, Zhou Ze believed Xu Le wouldn't be clear on them either.\n\nThe reason the fatty wanted to pull Xu Le in, both last time and this time, was purely to leverage Xu Le's network of student contacts.\n\nIn all this, Xu Le was actually a middleman who satisfied both parties.\n\nGoofy and dumb,\n\nbut for that very reason, the most reassuring.\n\nPiracy was an unavoidable hurdle in contemporary Chinese society. The so-called \"knockoff\" culture that had spun off from it seemed to be booming, so much so that it was gradually shedding its derogatory connotations and becoming a neutral term.\n\nBut at the end of the day, it was still illegal. Although the current social climate made the phenomenon almost inescapably common, if your luck ran out and you were targeted, it was bound to be a lot of trouble.\n\nZhou Ze turned the fatty down. The fatty left, a bit dejected. Standing at the door on his way out, he lit a cigarette and fiddled with his gold chain, from which the gold powder was flaking off.\n\nHe cursed,\n\n\"Fucking idiot.\"\n\nZhou Ze, however, simply continued to sit behind the counter, reading his book. The fatty's visit was nothing more than a minor interruption in his recent life.\n\nThe female corpse, as usual, sat in a chair with her eyes closed after tidying up the bookstore, leaning against the wall as if she were in a daze or feigning sleep.\n\nThe lives of the two of them had taken on an air similar to that of an old lady's foot-binding cloth.\n\nZhou Ze was perfectly content. He recalled that his greatest wish in his past life had been to live just like this—squandering his days, wasting time, reading books, and spacing out.\n\nHe didn't have to be ready to face emergency patients at any moment, nor did he need to constantly push himself to climb the ladder, bit by bit.\n\nAs for the female corpse, she had lain in a coffin for two hundred years and was long accustomed to boredom and silence. This was just a drop in the bucket.\n\nCompared to the \"still-as-water\" calm of the bookstore, Xu Qinglang was far more ambitious and driven. He was a man of considerable wealth and didn't have any great aspirations in the world of metaphysics; instead, he was focused on how to make money and build a career through his own abilities.\n\nFor that reason, Xu Qinglang was extremely annoyed by the decadent air of the master and servant duo next door!\n\n\"Look at you, lazy as a dead man every single day.\" After finishing his day's work, Xu Qinglang came over as usual to have a smoke and sling some taunts at Zhou Ze.\n\n\"I am a dead man, originally.\" Zhou Ze waved his hand and blew a smoke ring.\n\n\"Look at you, a man who's lived two lifetimes, and you still barely have two cents to rub together. I'm a man with over twenty properties, and I'm still working my ass off.\"\n\nAs was his custom, after denigrating Zhou Ze, he had to praise himself.\n\nZhou Ze glanced at Xu Qinglang and chuckled. \"Are you preparing your own dowry?\"\n\n\"A dog's mouth can't spit out ivory tusks.\"¹ Xu Qinglang raised his head and looked at the night sky (the ceiling). \"I want my retirement to be a bit more comfortable.\"\n\n\"Your twenty-something properties were already enough to attract a Ghost Madam to come carry you off in an eight-bearer sedan chair for a wedding. If you work a little harder, make a little more money, buy a few more properties, maybe next time a Female Ghost King or something will think you're a good match. Then I, a humble Ghost Emissary, could bask in your reflected glory.\n\nIf you get rich, don't forget me.\"\n\n\"Heh heh.\" The female corpse, who had been feigning sleep nearby, chimed in support of her boss.\n\n\"It's almost eight. I need to get ready,\" Xu Qinglang said, checking the time.\n\n\"For what?\" Zhou Ze was a little surprised.\n\nNormally, Xu Qinglang turned in quite early at night.\n\n\"The Confucian Temple is opening its gates tonight. The college entrance exams are just a few months away, aren't they? I have a relative back home whose kid is taking the exam this year, and they asked me to go burn some incense for him at the temple.\"\n\n\"You're willing to do that?\" Zhou Ze knew Xu Qinglang's personality. Calling him aloof and selfish was going a bit too far, but he was generally too lazy to bother with anything other than making money.\n\n\"I ate at their house when I was a kid, and they helped me out. Otherwise, I don't even know if I would've lived long enough to get my demolition compensation money. So this is a debt I have to repay,\" Xu Qinglang said in all seriousness.\n\n\"Mm,\" Zhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"Hey, want to come along?\" Xu Qinglang suddenly invited. \"Help me grab the first incense?\"\n\n\"Do they even care about first incense at the Confucian Temple?\"\n\n\"Hey, it's a good omen, isn't it?\"\n\n\"I'm not strong enough.\" Zhou Ze had seen how crazy people got when fighting for the first incense. With his physique, he really couldn't handle it. Not unless he cleared a path with his fingernails, but he couldn't just take down everyone around him, could he?\n\n\"Ask her.\" Xu Qinglang pointed at the female corpse. \"Strong as an ox. She can run interference for me.\"\n\nThe female corpse frowned, preparing a sarcastic retort.\n\n\"Don't you want to go out for a stroll?\" Xu Qinglang raised his eyebrows.\n\nThe words on the tip of the female corpse's tongue were immediately swallowed. A smile bloomed on her face.\n\nIn all this time, she hadn't taken a single step outside the bookstore.\n\nWith no other choice, Zhou Ze had to agree. He didn't feel safe letting the female corpse run out on her own. She might be as attentive as a maidservant now, but you can't know what's in a person's heart—let alone in a zombie that has no \"heart.\"\n\nZhou Ze was even convinced that if his powers were to disappear one day, the first one to eat his flesh and blood would likely be this very female corpse who was now so fawning and obsequious towards him.\n\nThe three of them took a taxi to the Confucian Temple. To say it was a sea of people outside would be an exaggeration, but it was still surrounded by three layers of people on the inside and three more on the outside.\n\nPity the hearts of parents everywhere.\n\nOutside the temple, Xu Qinglang met up with the relative and his wife he had mentioned—a middle-aged couple who looked very honest and kind.\n\nTheir son, of course, hadn't come. Everyone was here to vie for a good omen; no one was foolish enough to believe this could actually guarantee getting into a good university. There were basically no student-aged people at the scene; they were probably at home studying.\n\nThe Confucian Temple in Tongcheng performed its \"gate washing\" ceremony after the New Year. As for why it wasn't before the New Year, perhaps the old master Confucius and his scholars felt that competing for incense with that crowd of ox-demons and snake-spirits, mountain sprites and wild monsters during the New Year festivities was beneath their dignity.\n\nIt was better to do it after the New Year.\n\n*I watch as your gates are deserted and forlorn, while my temple is swarmed with believers, thus demonstrating my class.*\n\nAs for the specific reason, and how things were done in other parts of the country, Zhou Ze had no idea. The thing about customs is that they are just inexplicable rules; who could really say for sure?\n\nJust like that recent internet sensation about a father-in-law in the city next to Tongcheng kissing his daughter-in-law at a wedding, which was then excused as some so-called local custom. That made even less sense.\n\nWith a *creak*,\n\nthe red wooden doors swung open.\n\nIn an instant, the waiting parents transformed into \"feral beasts,\" charging into the Confucian Temple.\n\nThe female corpse led the charge, with Xu Qinglang and his two relatives following close behind, giving him the grand air of Zhao Zilong at the Battle of Changban.\n\nZhou Ze didn't join the frenzy. He just squatted on the curb outside, smoking.\n\nAs he smoked, Zhou Ze was surprised to find the cigarette in his hand suddenly go out.\n\nZhou Ze relit it, but the next puff was completely tasteless.\n\n\"Heh heh.\" Zhou Ze dropped the cigarette butt and looked around. He knew that his cigarette had just been taken as an incense offering.\n\nTo ignore the pure incense and refuse the proper tribute,\n\njust to take a puff of a mortal's cigarette...\n\nwho knows what kind of ox-demon or snake-spirit this was.\n\nNaturally, Zhou Ze didn't feel any \"Damn it, how dare you steal my smoke\" kind of anger. A month ago he was still an illegal stowaway, and he'd only been promoted to a temporary worker half a month later.\n\nHe had none of the arrogance of someone who had \"ascended to heaven with his chickens and dogs,\"² nor the domineering air of \"this road is mine.\"\n\n*Clang!*\n\nA gong sounded,\n\nso abrupt and piercing in the night.\n\nZhou Ze followed the sound with his eyes.\n\nFrom the flowerbeds behind the Confucian Temple, a short, dwarfish old man emerged. He held a bronze gong and had a cigarette dangling from his mouth as he hopped his way out.\n\nThe old man shot a deliberate glance at Zhou Ze, then opened his mouth and blew out a smoke ring, as if to thank him for the cigarette.\n\nZhou Ze smiled back.\n\nHe lit the rest of the cigarettes in his pack with his lighter, arranged them one by one on the ground, and kept only one for himself.\n\nSoon, the cigarettes on the ground all went out. The dwarfish old man hopped even more cheerfully, seeming to take a greater liking to this junior who knew how to play along. His small pockets were bulging, likely full of cigarettes.\n\nThe dwarfish old man cleared the way with his gong.\n\nBehind him, a group of people slowly followed.\n\nIt wasn't the crowd of parents who had just squeezed into the temple,\n\nbut a group of bizarrely dressed people.\n\nThe few at the front wore feathered fans and scholars' robes, their steps faltering, their faces ashen, slowly following the old man's pace.\n\nBehind them were two men with greasy, long queues, their gazes vacant, who also followed the old man forward.\n\nThe clothes of the people who followed them became more and more modern. The last few were even wearing modern clothes, no different from ordinary high school students.\n\nHowever, some of their faces were a sickly green, while others had shattered skulls.\n\nOut of professional habit, Zhou Ze quickly deduced that the last few students had died either from poisoning or from jumping off a building.\n\nOne of them looked a little familiar. He seemed to recall seeing his photo while scrolling through the news a few years ago. The student had performed poorly on a mock exam and, under the pressure, committed suicide by jumping from a building.\n\nThe dwarfish old man walked forward, beating his gong, while the group of \"scholars and students\" behind him followed like string puppets.\n\nThey were like a parade procession,\n\ncircling the Confucian Temple.\n\nAnd the nearby pedestrians,\n\naside from Zhou Ze, could not see them.\n\n*Bang!*\n\nThe gong rang out.\n\n\"To live in peace, you need not build a tall mansion; within books, there is a house of gold!\" the dwarfish old man roared in a hoarse voice.\n\n*Bang!*\n\nThe gong rang out again.\n\n\"To marry a wife, don't despair for lack of a good matchmaker; within books, there is a face like jade!\"\n\nThe dwarfish old man continued to shout.\n\nAfter circling the Confucian Temple three times,\n\nthe bizarre procession slowly vanished.\n\nA short while later,\n\nthe parents who had finished burning their incense began to walk out of the Confucian Temple.\n\nTheir faces were filled with satisfaction,\n\nwith anticipation,\n\nand with the earnest hope that their children would become dragons.\n\n***\n\n¹An idiom meaning you can't expect good words from a foul mouth.\n\n²An idiom meaning when one person gains power, their whole circle benefits.",

    "content": "許清朗和女屍包括那一對中年夫妻都出來了，那對中年夫妻臉上喜洋洋的，顯然，在女屍的幫助下，他們搶奪到了頭香。\n\n\n\n  不管有用沒用，總歸是一個好兆頭。\n\n\n\n  哪怕不迷信的家長，在孩子大考之前，也會送個粽子加一個年糕，寓意「糕粽」（高中）。\n\n\n\n  女屍的臉色有些不是很好看，眾人一起往回走時，她一個人落在後面。\n\n\n\n  「我們去吃夜宵吧，燒烤咋樣？」許清朗提議道。\n\n\n\n  他自己開飯館，但可不會讓自己大晚上地去準備燒烤；\n\n\n\n  許娘娘的皮膚寶貴得很，怎麼能接受這般煙燻火燎？\n\n\n\n  只是，許清朗說完這個提議後就後悔了。\n\n\n\n  這一行人里，\n\n\n\n  有一個殭屍，還有一個不食人間煙火的活死人，\n\n\n\n  想想吃飯時的畫面，這兩位就呆坐在那裡一動不動，像是廟裡的泥胎塑像在享受煙火一樣。\n\n\n\n  這畫面，想想都沒食慾了。\n\n\n\n  「你們去吧，我們先回去。」周澤說道。\n\n\n\n  「那怎麼好意思。」中年男人說道。\n\n\n\n  「沒事兒，叔，我們去吃，他們小兩口自己散散步。」\n\n \n\n  許清朗拉著中年夫妻走了。\n\n\n\n  周澤沒急著打車，和女屍一起沿著沒多少人的小馬路走著。\n\n\n\n  天氣開始轉暖了，晚上也沒以前那麼涼了。\n\n\n\n  「怎麼了？」周澤問女屍。\n\n\n\n  女屍從文廟裡走出來後，一直悶悶不樂。\n\n\n\n  「不舒服。」女屍回答道。\n\n\n\n  「還沒停經？」\n\n\n\n  兩百年了啊。\n\n\n\n  「…………」女屍。\n\n\n\n  沉默了一會兒，女屍才開口道：「文廟裡幾個塑像盯著我，感覺怪怪的。」\n\n\n\n  「你覺得他們在看你？」周澤問道。\n\n\n\n  「嗯。」女屍點點頭。\n\n\n\n  「你覺得他們反感你？」\n\n\n\n  「嗯。」女屍繼續點點頭。\n\n\n\n  「你覺得因為你是殭屍，所以原本不該去那個地方的？」\n\n\n\n  「嗯。」女屍還是點點頭。\n\n\n\n  「聖人主張，有教無類。」周澤笑了笑，伸手在女屍頭上拍了拍，道：「你是殭屍，是人憎鬼厭的一類存在，但你去文廟，是幫人上香去的，也是給他們貢獻了香火人氣兒。\n\n\n\n  你覺得他們在看你， \n\n\n\n  可能是因為你的特殊，所以他們在留意你。\n\n\n\n  就像是一群草原狼里忽然混進來一隻哈士奇，換誰都會多看一眼是吧？\n\n\n\n  當然，也有可能他們本就是一堆泥胎，他們的眼睛據說還是用驢屎球兒捏出來的，因為這樣看起來更靈動更有光澤。\n\n\n\n  一切的一切，只是你給自己心理壓力。」\n\n\n\n  「但如果，他們真的是在看我呢，如果他們真的對我有意見……」女屍還是有些遲疑。\n\n\n\n  「那他們就不配被供奉在廟裡當那勞什子聖人！」\n\n\n\n  周澤擲地有聲，\n\n\n\n  「聖人享千秋百代香火供奉，若是連這點氣量都沒有，那他還有什麼臉舔坐在廟宇供奉台桌上？\n\n\n\n  一個假聖人，又有什麼好怕的。」\n\n\n\n  女屍看著周澤，嘴角噙著微笑，道：「老闆，你剛剛說的話真的很霸氣。」\n\n\n\n  「那是。」周澤享受著自己女僕的馬屁。\n\n\n\n  「但老闆，你是鬼差，冥冥之中自有定數，對於普通人來說，牽連可能不大，但對您來說，不一樣。\n\n\n\n  再加上，您是開著書店，屬於聖人氣運照拂的一行，你這樣腹誹聖人，對您，真的不好。」\n\n\n\n  女屍難得的跟周澤掏心窩子說出這些話，放在以往，她是巴不得周澤去作死的； \n\n\n\n  跳吧跳吧，把自己跳死了我正好給你收屍，然後把你指甲卸下來磨成粉當珍珠粉泡茶喝，\n\n\n\n  哦不，餵豬！\n\n\n\n  「還是那句話，不做虧心事兒，不怕鬼……聖人敲門。」\n\n\n\n  周澤抬頭看了看路燈，繼續道：\n\n\n\n  「我上輩子治病救人，不收紅包，不虧底線，一直恪守著醫德。\n\n\n\n  這輩子哪怕成了鬼，借屍還魂之後，也沒做出任何一件虧心事兒。\n\n\n\n  有什麼好怕的？」\n\n\n\n  周澤深吸一口氣，重複道，「沒什麼好怕的。」\n\n\n\n  女屍聞言，目露沉思。\n\n\n\n  周澤這番話，不是中二的宣言，更像是一種對自己的警告。\n\n\n\n  二人繼續漫無目的地往前走著，晚風微涼，卻很是宜人。\n\n\n\n  終於，女屍停下了腳步，問道：「老闆，你要去哪裡？」\n\n\n\n  周澤停下了腳步，下意識地環視四周，愕然發現自己居然走入了一家小區門口。\n\n\n\n  熟悉的環境，\n\n\n\n  熟悉的傳達室，\n\n\n\n  熟悉的傳達室里在晚上偷睡曠工的門衛，\n\n\n\n  熟悉的快遞收發櫃。 \n\n\n\n  他居然就這樣散步著，\n\n\n\n  自然而然地走回到自己以前住的小區。\n\n\n\n  雖然在書店一個月了，但在潛意識裡，這裡，才是他的家。\n\n\n\n  孤兒院長大的他，更懂得家的含意，同時，對房子，也更執著。\n\n\n\n  不過好在他買房時，通城房價還沒漲到後面那麼離譜，也是因為他參加工作後就迫不及待地著手準備當房奴，反而是撿了個西瓜，惹得之後買房的同事們很是羨慕。\n\n\n\n  然而，周澤現在連以前的微信和QQ都無法找回了，手機驗證沒辦法弄，找列表里好友幫你驗證，要麼被別人當神經病要麼把別人嚇死。\n\n\n\n  就連自己的房子，也是在自己死後，被醫院那邊幫忙賣了，錢以自己的名義捐給了孤兒院。\n\n\n\n  周澤不反感這個做法，畢竟他在世沒有其他親人。\n\n\n\n  「這裡，是我以前的家。」周澤對女屍道。\n\n\n\n  「那麼，上去看看？」女屍建議道。\n\n\n\n  「已經被賣了。」周澤唏噓道。\n\n\n\n  「就當故地重遊了。」\n\n\n\n  周澤點點頭，走了過去。\n\n\n\n  進了8棟2單元，上了電梯，到了第五層。\n\n\n\n  周澤走到了一戶門前，門還是那個門，買主應該沒來得及重新裝修吧？ \n\n\n\n  甚至連門口的墊子，也沒變。\n\n\n\n  以及，門口擺放著的那顆仙人球，也在那裡。\n\n\n\n  周澤伸手，在罐子地下摸了摸，摸出了一把鑰匙。\n\n\n\n  那時候，自己經常晚上被喊去醫院出急診，很多次忘帶手機或者鑰匙之類的，所以，他的備用鑰匙就放在這裡，省的自己進不了家門。\n\n\n\n  抱著試試看的心態，將鑰匙塞進去，扭動。\n\n\n\n  「咔嚓……」\n\n\n\n  門鎖開了。\n\n\n\n  門沒換，\n\n\n\n  鎖也沒換麼？\n\n\n\n  周澤有些意外，推開門，順手開了燈。\n\n\n\n  客廳里的陳設，一切照舊。\n\n\n\n  周澤甚至還看見了自己的拖鞋，換了拖鞋走了進來，女屍也跟著一起進來。\n\n\n\n  「老闆，還是以前的樣子麼？」女屍問道。\n\n\n\n  「嗯，這也是讓我最奇怪的地方。」\n\n\n\n  的確還是以前的樣子，\n\n\n\n  但這不符合常理。\n\n\n\n  尋常人買了房子後，不應該把死人用過的東西都丟掉麼？\n\n\n\n  怎麼可能還一直留著，而且全部保存，不嫌晦氣？ \n\n\n\n  或許，可能是接手自己房子的人，只是拿來投資？並不是真的自己住？\n\n\n\n  周澤在沙發上坐了下來，仿佛在此時，他又變回了自己。\n\n\n\n  每次疲勞地回到家裡，看看電視，煮一點夜宵，日子過得緊湊，卻也充實。\n\n\n\n  女屍去燒了茶水，給周澤倒了一杯，然後道：\n\n\n\n  「老闆，你死了大半年了吧？」\n\n\n\n  「七個月了。」\n\n\n\n  周澤回答道，但怎麼感覺這個對話有點怪？\n\n\n\n  「但這裡這麼幹淨，可不像是七個月沒人住的樣子。」女屍提醒道。\n\n\n\n  周澤點點頭，的確如此，這裡，收拾得很乾淨，應該有人在定期打掃。\n\n\n\n  但周澤很難想像，買了自己房子的人，懶到什麼都不丟什麼都不換，甚至連門鎖都保留的地步。\n\n\n\n  周澤推開臥室門，發現居然連自己被褥和床單都是以前自己用的。\n\n\n\n  「老闆，我去沖個澡吧，剛剛在文廟裡被那些老東西盯著看這麼久，身上都起雞皮疙瘩了。」\n\n\n\n  「去吧，把熱水器先開一下。」周澤提醒道，「浴巾在衛生間門口的廚櫃裡。」\n\n\n\n  如果，\n\n\n\n  一切陳設真的照舊的話。 \n\n\n\n  女屍去洗澡了，她很愛乾淨，女人，本就是愛乾淨的，她前世又是大家閨秀，一躺棺材兩百年，沒辦法洗澡，多難受。\n\n\n\n  所以她基本早上洗一遍，晚上洗一遍，浪費了周澤好多水費。\n\n\n\n  但一想到她給自己店裡做服務生，也沒要工錢，周澤也就忍了。\n\n\n\n  拉起窗簾，周澤站在陽台上，看著前面夜晚燈光瑩瑩。\n\n\n\n  這裡，\n\n\n\n  是他的家。\n\n\n\n  它沒變，\n\n\n\n  但已經不再屬於自己。\n\n\n\n  物是人非，\n\n\n\n  真正意義上的物是人非啊。\n\n\n\n  拿出煙，點燃，周澤吐出一口煙圈。\n\n\n\n  心裡，有些失落，他以為自己應該能看開的，但實際上他不能。\n\n\n\n  正如他親手將那個嬰兒丟入地獄等待輪迴一樣，\n\n\n\n  他現在深切意識到，\n\n\n\n  作為一個活人，他對陽間的留戀，真的難以用文字去描述出來。\n\n\n\n  哪怕是自己，此時都有一種衝動，把自己的房子，重新買回來。\n\n\n\n  至於說錢，\n\n\n\n  以他的能力，真要違規弄點錢， \n\n\n\n  很難麼？\n\n\n\n  這種衝動，好不容易被壓制下去了，周澤清楚，這是一條不歸路，是潘多拉的盒子，一旦打開，自己肯定無法收的住手。\n\n\n\n  周澤覺得自己是一個自律的人，但無論任何時候，能避免的時候都不要去嘗試對「人性操守」方面去做測試。\n\n\n\n  「咔嚓……」\n\n\n\n  很意外地，\n\n\n\n  門那邊傳來鑰匙入鎖的聲響。\n\n\n\n  主人回來了？\n\n\n\n  周澤轉過身，從陽台走回客廳，他在想該如何向主人解釋自己現在在這個屋子，但也沒過多緊張。\n\n\n\n  說一千道一萬，他好歹是個鬼差，如果最後真的因為私闖民宅被抓到派出所去，\n\n\n\n  這也太虧待自己了吧？\n\n\n\n  自律是自律，但也沒必要自虐啊。\n\n\n\n  這裡，畢竟是他以前的家。\n\n\n\n  只是，當門被推開後，\n\n\n\n  走進來的，\n\n\n\n  居然是一道熟悉的身影。\n\n\n\n  林醫生站在門口，看著站在客廳里的周澤，臉上露出了震驚和慌亂之色，道：\n\n\n\n  「你……你怎麼會在這裡？」\n\n\n\n  周澤也是一時語塞， \n\n\n\n  買下自己房子的，\n\n\n\n  居然是林醫生？\n\n\n\n  「你聽我解釋。」林晚秋。\n\n\n\n  「你聽我解釋。」周澤。\n\n\n\n  二人一起說這句話，\n\n\n\n  對於林晚秋來說，她很慌亂，因為她覺得周澤是發現了自己「精神出軌」的證據，\n\n\n\n  找到了這裡，她是他的妻子，卻買了另外一個男人留下的房子，還一直打掃收拾這裡，因為那個男人的原因，拒絕和他同房過夫妻生活。\n\n\n\n  林醫生覺得自己很理虧。\n\n\n\n  好在，這種尷尬的氛圍並沒有持續多久，\n\n\n\n  因為更尷尬的事情出現了，\n\n\n\n  「老闆，我衣服被我不小心弄濕了。」\n\n\n\n  女屍一邊說著一邊就裹著一條浴巾走了出來，\n\n\n\n  走到了，\n\n\n\n  客廳里，\n\n\n\n  站在了周澤和林晚秋的，\n\n\n\n  中間。",

    "content": "最怕空氣忽然的安靜……\n\n\n\n  周澤抿了抿嘴唇，林醫生低下頭，也是有些如釋重負。\n\n\n\n  一個精神出軌，\n\n\n\n  一個「身體出軌」，\n\n\n\n  一個人犯錯是愧疚，\n\n\n\n  兩個人一起犯錯是男女平等。\n\n\n\n  周澤在這個時候笑了起來，笑得有些恣意。\n\n\n\n  是了，\n\n\n\n  在自己死後，買下自己房子的，居然是自己現在的「妻子。」\n\n\n\n  的確，林醫生有錢，她在通城買個死過戶主的二手房，很輕鬆，而且，似乎只有她才會打掃這裡，同時保持這裡的格局一直沒有變。\n\n\n\n  感動？\n\n\n\n  當然感動。\n\n\n\n  周澤是周澤，哪怕現在進入的是徐樂的身體，但他代入的，還是他周澤本人的視角。\n\n\n\n  徐樂已經是過去式了，不管這個孩子的感情生活是否崎嶇是否沒有尊嚴，周澤都不會過多的理會。\n\n\n\n  就像是大過年的，大家一起吃年夜飯時，桌上一個二貨忽然拿出手機對大家說看看非洲一些地方的難民食不果腹瘦成皮包骨頭了你們飯還吃得下去麼？\n\n\n\n  有這樣一個女人，像是魔症了一樣一直記著自己，懷念著自己， \n\n\n\n  作為一個男人，\n\n\n\n  怎麼可能不驕傲，不感動？\n\n\n\n  「找我的衣服換上去。」周澤指了指白鶯鶯。\n\n\n\n  女屍點頭，「哦」了一聲，這次不比上次，她是不敢再由著性子覺得好玩所以故意火上澆油什麼了，規規矩矩地去了周澤臥室找了周澤的干整衣服換了走了出來。\n\n\n\n  林醫生還是站在原地，什麼都沒說。\n\n\n\n  她似乎有一種解脫，也有一種釋然，然而，周澤沒讓她把這種情緒繼續下去，而是走上前，伸手攥住了林醫生的手，很認真地道：\n\n\n\n  「有件事，我要告訴你，跟我走。」\n\n\n\n  拉著林醫生的手，周澤帶著些許蠻橫，和她出了門，進了電梯，白鶯鶯跟在後頭，一言不發，她知道自己現在多說多錯。\n\n\n\n  只能說，這一切都太巧合了。\n\n\n\n  下了樓，周澤走到了林醫生的卡宴旁邊，伸手示意林醫生把車鑰匙給他。\n\n\n\n  周澤決定了，要把自己的身份告訴她，不管她是否能接受，不管她是否類似於古代故事裡的「葉公好龍」。\n\n\n\n  總之，周澤想要把真相告訴她，他不想扭捏了，也不想再去遮遮掩掩，畢竟此一時彼一時，當初自己是黑戶，而現在自己已經洗白了。\n\n\n\n  沒理由，委屈著自己。 \n\n\n\n  「你沒駕照。」林醫生提醒道。\n\n\n\n  「鑰匙給我。」周澤很強硬地說道，帶著不容置疑。\n\n\n\n  他要帶她去醫院，去那熟悉的手術室，用實際行動告訴她自己的真實身份；\n\n\n\n  否則，他擔心純粹用語言去描述她可能會覺得自己是「可憐丈夫的臆想症」發作。\n\n\n\n  林醫生把車鑰匙給了周澤，然後三人都上了車。\n\n\n\n  周澤坐在駕駛位置，林醫生坐在副駕駛位置，白鶯鶯乖乖地坐在後面。\n\n\n\n  車子發動，倒車出去，\n\n\n\n  周澤看起來熟練自如，\n\n\n\n  徐樂那個二貨連個駕照都沒有，\n\n\n\n  自己，可是一個老司機啊。\n\n\n\n  然後，\n\n\n\n  只聽得「吱吱吱吱吱…………」的刺耳摩擦聲傳來，車身也震了一下。\n\n\n\n  周澤沉默了，\n\n\n\n  車裡另外兩個女人也沉默了。\n\n\n\n  卡宴的車身撞在了電線桿上，硬生生地摩擦了一輪。\n\n\n\n  漆黑的夜裡，仿佛又有一隻很勤快的烏鴉，\n\n\n\n  極為湊巧地再度從空中飛過，\n\n\n\n  不時地發出「哇……哇……哇」的聲響。 \n\n\n\n  空氣，又再度極為尷尬的安靜下來。\n\n\n\n  周澤解開了安全帶，道：「你來開吧。」\n\n\n\n  「去人民醫院？」\n\n\n\n  林醫生換好位置問道。\n\n\n\n  「對，人民醫院。」坐在副駕駛位置上的周澤伸手捂著額頭，然後輕輕地撞擊著車窗。\n\n\n\n  太長時間不開車，再加上又換了身體，他的車技，生疏太多了。\n\n\n\n  但不管有再多的理由，\n\n\n\n  剛剛真的好丟臉啊。\n\n\n\n  車子上路，很快就上了東快速路高架。\n\n\n\n  車內很安靜，林醫生不說話，哪怕她不知道周澤為什麼要去醫院，但她並沒有問。\n\n\n\n  兩個人現在的夫妻關係，\n\n\n\n  真的是已經千瘡百孔了。\n\n\n\n  白鶯鶯坐在後車座上看著窗外的風景，她許久沒能出來，雖然白夫人以前幾乎天天和她聊天說話，但這外面的世界，她真的很少有機會親自走出來看看。\n\n\n\n  再加上，她清楚自己現在不適合說話。\n\n\n\n  周澤忽然坐直了身子，道：「那輛車，是在逆行？」\n\n\n\n  在低水泥牆的另一側，是高架路的另一條反向道，有一輛白色的轎車在那裡，但車頭，是和周澤這邊車頭朝向是一致的。 \n\n\n\n  這意味著對方是在逆行。\n\n\n\n  也就在此時，\n\n\n\n  隔壁車道上開過一輛大巴車，遠光燈打得很是刺眼。\n\n\n\n  緊接著，就是急剎車的刺耳摩擦聲。\n\n\n\n  周澤下意識地閉上雙眼，同時雙手捂住了自己的頭，那輛大巴在隔壁車道，不可能撞到自己，但這一幕，幾乎是他印象中最可怕的畫面。\n\n\n\n  當初的自己就是在下班途中被一輛大貨車這樣子撞過去的，\n\n\n\n  此時的一切，勾動了他內心最恐怖也最不願意回憶的一幕。\n\n\n\n  「砰！」\n\n\n\n  沉悶的撞擊聲傳來，林醫生馬上停下了車。\n\n\n\n  隔壁車道上，那輛大巴車和那輛逆行的白色小轎車相撞，小轎車被頂出去，隨後又被大巴車車頭重重地撞在了水泥欄杆上，車身完全變形。\n\n\n\n  打了雙閃，林醫生迅速下車，看著蜷縮在副駕駛位置上瑟瑟發抖的丈夫，她的眼裡露出了些許失望之色，但還是馬上打開了後備箱，將警示牌拿出來在車子後面擺放，隨後，她馬上翻過了欄杆去了對面。\n\n\n\n  她是一名醫生，她需要盡到自己的責任，事故發生時，如果周圍有專業的救護力量，受害者的性命是能夠有很大概率保全下來的。\n\n\n\n  「老闆？」坐在後面的白鶯鶯喊道。 \n\n\n\n  周澤放開了雙手，有些茫然地環視四周，他看見隔壁車道的事故現場，林醫生已經趕過去了。\n\n\n\n  「和我一起下去，救人。」\n\n\n\n  周澤下了車，雙腿有些發軟。\n\n\n\n  這是人的一種自我保護意識，精神的創傷被勾動出來，往往會連帶著自己的身體產生虛弱保護反應。\n\n\n\n  深吸一口氣，周澤沒有絲毫的猶豫，也翻過了欄杆去那邊準備救人。\n\n\n\n  白鶯鶯跟著一起過去。\n\n\n\n  大巴車的司機臉上也有血，應該是撞車時頭砸到了方向盤或者什麼地方了，大巴車上下來了另外三個人，應該是乘客什麼的，總之，這輛大巴車很空。\n\n\n\n  「這他娘的有病吧，高架上逆行，找死別害人啊！」大巴車司機一隻手捂著自己的額頭傷口一邊罵道。\n\n\n\n  換做誰遇到這種倒霉事兒都會很生氣。\n\n\n\n  「別喊了，救人！」林醫生對大巴車司機呵斥道。\n\n\n\n  事故責任以後再論，現在把轎車裡的人救出來再說。\n\n\n\n  「喂，你還有意識麼？可以回答我麼？」林醫生對著變形轎車裡的人喊道。\n\n\n\n  但沒有得到回應。\n\n\n\n  大巴車司機罵罵咧咧地但還是參與到了救援之中，這條路本就有些偏僻，屬於高架上很少有車走的路段，偶有車經過，但也沒停下來好奇地觀望，直接開走了。 \n\n\n\n  「把車門扳開！」周澤建議道。\n\n\n\n  「沒有設備，怎麼扳？」林醫生情緒有些激動，尤其是在自己丈夫不懂還要瞎指揮的時候，她更心煩氣躁。\n\n\n\n  車裡有兩個人，一個女人和一個孩子，現在情況很不好，兩個人都渾身是血，而且在呼喊下沒有絲毫的回應。\n\n\n\n  車門被撞到向內變形，幾乎就卡在了那裡。這個需要消防隊過來用專門的設備才能剪開。\n\n\n\n  周澤上前，伸手抓住了車門，白鶯鶯這個時候也過來，她是殭屍，力氣當然大，和周澤一起發力。\n\n\n\n  只聽得「咔嚓」一聲，\n\n\n\n  車門直接被卸了下來，順帶著白鶯鶯還將車座椅後背給壓了下來。\n\n\n\n  林醫生看得一愣，\n\n\n\n  大巴車車主和車上的幾個乘客也是看得一愣。\n\n\n\n  這是運氣好，卡得很輕吧。\n\n\n\n  周澤彎腰下去，一隻手護住對方的脖子一隻手抓著對方的腿，將女人先小心翼翼地拖了出來，隨後，他又去將男孩的身體給拖了出來。\n\n\n\n  林醫生先檢查了女人的身體，面色凝重，等到男孩被拉出來，她又去檢查了男孩的身體，神情一下子變得黯然下來。\n\n\n\n  死了，\n\n\n\n  都死了。 \n\n\n\n  「死了？」大巴車車主有些不敢置信地問道，同時臉色很是難看，他這是倒了血霉了啊，「這幫混蛋，大晚上地出來害人啊，把我害慘了啊！」\n\n\n\n  「打電話報警和打120。」林醫生的手機留在車裡，對大巴車車主喊道。\n\n\n\n  大巴車車主雖然很氣憤，但還是拿出手機開始打電話。\n\n\n\n  周澤卻將女人和男孩的身體都翻了過來，林醫生看到周澤這個舉動，有些不解。\n\n\n\n  「我剛把他們拉出來時順手檢查了一下，他們身上外傷很多，都是車禍時造成的。\n\n\n\n  但是，他們有一個共同點，在他們的後腦勺位置都有頭骨凹陷的創傷，不出意外，應該是致命傷。\n\n\n\n  我覺得可能是被人用包著棉布的錘子砸出來的。」\n\n\n\n  「這是什麼意思？」林醫生馬上跟進檢查了一下那個位置的傷痕，馬上明白過來道：「他們是在車禍前就已經死了！」\n\n\n\n  是的，否則你很難解釋兩個人都在一個位置遭受了相同的致命創傷，這太巧合了，巧合得幾乎不可能成立。\n\n\n\n  「死了的人，被安排在了車子裡，又逆行。」周澤看著林醫生，面帶微笑，道：「然後偽裝成車禍，很不錯的意外事件。」\n\n\n\n  緊接著，周澤側過臉，看向身後正在打電話報警的大巴車車主，周圍原本站著的幾個大巴車上的乘客，也都慢慢地向四周包圍過來。\n\n\n\n  大巴車車主也看著周澤，臉上也露出了一抹意味深長的笑容，對著手機另一頭道：\n\n\n\n  「老闆，點兒有點背，碰到幾個愛管閒事兒的倒霉鬼。」",

    "content": "作為一名外科醫生，周澤能夠輕鬆地檢查出屍體死亡的異樣，那麼，那些專業對口的法醫，顯然也能夠發現。\n\n\n\n  也因此，在周澤看來，這次車禍的製造，實際上很失敗，甚至，只是「徒有其表」，根本經不起推敲。\n\n\n\n  也不知道是這幫人還有其他後手或者手段把這個案子完美地補全成一個意外事件，又或者，這幫人真的只是「菜鳥」？\n\n\n\n  當然了，現在不是思考這個問題的時候，因為這幫人似乎不打算繼續囉嗦下去。\n\n\n\n  「抓住他們，然後把他們車開走。」\n\n\n\n  大巴車司機看了看時間，現在時間很寶貴。\n\n\n\n  手下幾個人直接撲了上來，對於他們來說，一個瘦弱的男子加上兩個年輕的女人，根本翻不起什麼浪花。\n\n\n\n  白鶯鶯側了側頭，看了看周澤，她在等周澤的命令。\n\n\n\n  林醫生站在原地，看得出，她很緊張，但她沒有尖叫也沒有大喊，能做到這一步，已經很不容易了。\n\n\n\n  絕大部分人面對這個情況，哪怕是平時再自詡膽子比天大的傢伙，嚇得跪地求饒喊著「我什麼都沒看見」估計都是很正常的。\n\n\n\n  「不准殺人。」周澤提醒道。\n\n\n\n  「哈哈。」大巴車車主聞言笑了起來。 \n\n\n\n  只可惜，周澤這話不是對他說的。\n\n\n\n  白鶯鶯應了一聲「好咧」，然後直接沖了過去。\n\n\n\n  周澤後退一步，抓住了林醫生的手，道：「沒事的，有我在。」\n\n\n\n  沖在前面的白鶯鶯腳下差點一個踉蹌，\n\n\n\n  老娘在前面衝殺，\n\n\n\n  你居然還有閒情逸緻回去恩恩愛愛？\n\n\n\n  小三，\n\n\n\n  哦不，女僕也是有尊嚴的好伐！\n\n\n\n  林醫生抿了抿嘴唇，她自責道：「對不起。」\n\n\n\n  是她停車打算救人，才讓眾人遭遇到這場危機，所以她道歉。\n\n\n\n  「應該的，職業犯賤。」周澤苦笑道，上次在電影院，他也是這樣衝進去的，只能說，有些職業習慣，是真的改不掉了。\n\n\n\n  女屍剛被塞了一把狗糧，下手不自覺地重了一些。\n\n\n\n  「小娘皮，來，哥哥疼你。」\n\n\n\n  一個男子張開手準備把這個高中生小姑娘給抱住。\n\n\n\n  頭兒不讓他們在這裡殺人，而是準備把他們帶走，畢竟這裡的事兒不能拖得太久。\n\n\n\n  然而，他的手抱了一個空。\n\n\n\n  緊接著，他的左臂被女屍給抓住。 \n\n\n\n  「咔嚓……」\n\n\n\n  「咔嚓……」\n\n\n\n  「咔嚓……」\n\n\n\n  林醫生聽得身體一顫，周澤也是覺得有些刺耳，\n\n\n\n  甚至覺得「妙脆角」GG在這裡取音的話效果肯定比現在GG更好，\n\n\n\n  嘎嘣脆。\n\n\n\n  男子張大嘴，他甚至連疼都喊不出來了，女屍再度向前一步，一腳踹中了男子的小腿。\n\n\n\n  「嘎吱……嘎吱……嘎吱……」\n\n\n\n  又是三聲脆響。\n\n\n\n  可比克也能來取音當GG放了，周澤心想。\n\n\n\n  「我……艹……」\n\n\n\n  男子蜷曲在地上，一條胳膊被完全廢掉了，另一條腿也被完全斷掉了，整個人像是一隻癩蛤蟆躺在地上只能哀嚎和蠕動。\n\n\n\n  周澤沒有絲毫地惻隱之心，他不准女屍殺人，是因為陽間的事兒，只能交給警察去處理，他相信這個國家的司法機關會讓一切罪惡無所遁形。\n\n\n\n  但眼前的這些人，畢竟是冷血殺人犯，而且還準備對自己出手，周澤也沒聖母心態爆棚到覺得這樣對待他們很可憐。\n\n\n\n  天知道他們剛剛打算怎麼對付自己三人？\n\n\n\n  如果自己還是前世那個醫生，女屍也只是高中女孩兒，那誰來可憐他們？ \n\n\n\n  「砰！」\n\n\n\n  「咣當！」\n\n\n\n  「啪！」\n\n\n\n  另外兩個男子被直接放倒，也是一樣，骨骼斷裂，雖然不致死，但已經被廢掉了。\n\n\n\n  以周澤的專業眼光來看，這倒在地上的三個人哪怕去醫院救治後，下半輩子也多半生活不能自理。\n\n\n\n  大巴車車主的手機落了下來，砸在了地上。\n\n\n\n  他下意識地咽了口唾沫，\n\n\n\n  只覺得眼前的一切，是如此的不真實。\n\n\n\n  他沒帶噴子，因為之前計劃著是要面對交警和警方的審訊和排查，所以自然不可能帶什麼違禁品。\n\n\n\n  他原以為哪怕多出了周澤這幾個「熱心腸」的人，這件事也不至於出現太大的變數。\n\n\n\n  哪怕出現了變數，他也依舊能夠將其掌控住。\n\n\n\n  然而，現在的問題就很嚴峻了，因為這個女孩走到了他面前。\n\n\n\n  「我…………」大巴車車主剛剛演技十分精湛，現在卻連話都說不出來。\n\n\n\n  「砰！」\n\n\n\n  女屍伸手將大巴車車主直接掀翻在了地上，一隻腳踩在了他的脖子上。\n\n\n\n  「停一下。」\n\n\n\n  周澤喊道。 \n\n\n\n  女屍停下了，沒問為什麼。\n\n\n\n  周澤走上前，蹲下來，伸手在大巴車車主長著絡腮鬍子的臉蛋上拍了拍，\n\n\n\n  然後又覺得自己很多此一舉，將手在女屍的褲管上蹭了蹭，\n\n\n\n  這傢伙臉上，好油膩啊。\n\n\n\n  「…………」女屍。\n\n\n\n  「你們，還有其他人麼？」\n\n\n\n  周澤現在要考慮的，就是如何把一切後患都解決掉了，他自己倒是不怕什麼，但這件事紙包不住火，萬一收拾了小的、大的跑了，對方把報複目標放在了林醫生身上怎麼辦？\n\n\n\n  可沒有千日防賊的道理。\n\n\n\n  之前，小蘿莉說過，蓉城有位自己的同類，越俎代庖，自己當起了判官，周澤自然不可能步他的後塵。\n\n\n\n  雖然感情上，周澤的確很神往他，覺得他很牛逼，也很有夢想。\n\n\n\n  但這件事，已經影響到自己日常生活了，他必須親自出手做一個了結。\n\n\n\n  女屍直接對著大巴車車主的左臂砸下去。\n\n\n\n  「嘎吱……」\n\n\n\n  「啊啊啊！！！沒了，沒了……就我們幾個，我們都是打工時認識的……就我們幾個了，我們是被僱主僱傭來的。」\n\n\n\n  周澤點點頭，然後看向了女屍，道：「有什麼辦法，能讓他們不記得這件事？」 \n\n\n\n  周澤不想惹麻煩，甚至不想上新聞。\n\n\n\n  女屍做了一個抹脖子的動作。\n\n\n\n  周澤搖搖頭，不能殺，至少，不能由自己來殺。\n\n\n\n  「或者，老闆你用你的指甲刺他們一下，能讓他們神智混亂一段時間，像是喝醉了酒一樣，然後就斷片兒了。」\n\n\n\n  「刺多少？」周澤問道。\n\n\n\n  「刺一點點吧，不然真可能就死了。另外，我知道老闆你是不想惹麻煩，回去後把您剩下的那些紙錢都燒了，麻煩就不會上門了。\n\n\n\n  但估計也不能有人往店門口丟錢了。」\n\n\n\n  周澤抬頭看了一眼遠處的林醫生，隨即默默地走到每個地上躺著的歹徒身邊，用自己的小拇指上長出來的黑指甲不露聲色地一個一個刺了過去，這幾個人都渾身顫慄，口吐白沫，緊接著很快就不省人事。\n\n\n\n  但，都沒生命危險。\n\n\n\n  環視四周，這裡應該沒有攝像頭，否則他們也不會選擇這裡當設計意外的現場，周澤拿起他們其中一個人的手機撥打了報警電話，然後把手機丟掉。\n\n\n\n  做完了這一切，周澤對著那邊的林醫生招招手，然後坐回了林醫生的車裡。\n\n\n\n  林醫生也坐進了駕駛室里。\n\n\n\n  「先開走，別停在這裡。」周澤提醒道。 \n\n\n\n  「好。」林醫生深吸一口氣，然後發動了車子。\n\n\n\n  「別告訴別人這件事。」\n\n\n\n  車子在行駛過程中周澤提醒道。\n\n\n\n  「為什麼？」林醫生顯然是有些不能理解。\n\n\n\n  周澤伸手指了指後面，\n\n\n\n  「她是太極八卦掌傳人，因為和別人比武切磋時不小心把別人打殘了，所以逃難到我這裡來的，剛剛也是她救了我，所以我們的身份不能曝光，不然她就得被警察抓走。」\n\n\n\n  坐在後面的女屍翻了個白眼，\n\n\n\n  這話，騙鬼呢。\n\n\n\n  林醫生沉默不語，也不知道她是否真的信了，只是繼續默默地開著車。\n\n\n\n  車子還是開往人民醫院那裡，對於林醫生來說，哪怕周澤一開始沒說去那裡，她也會下意識地開向那裡，畢竟那裡是她的工作單位，在那裡，她可以得到安全感。\n\n\n\n  車子駛入了人民醫院停車場，三人都下了車。\n\n\n\n  林醫生沒問周澤要去哪裡，她是想不到周澤想要去的地方其實是急診室，她只是有些沉默地往前走。\n\n\n\n  女屍湊在周澤耳邊道：「你今晚還表白麼？」\n\n\n\n  她很聰明，從林晚秋買下周澤生前的房子等細節，其實已經推測出了很多內幕。 \n\n\n\n  「又不是瓊瑤劇，我要整那麼苦情做什麼？」周澤聳了聳肩。\n\n\n\n  雖然路上出了一道小插曲，讓林醫生現在還有些魂不守舍，但周澤並不打算放棄原本的打算。\n\n\n\n  這樣子的一個女人，又是自己現在這具肉身的合法妻子，\n\n\n\n  不把真相告訴她讓她晚上可以心安理得地和自己睡，\n\n\n\n  自己腦子進水了麼？\n\n\n\n  瞞來瞞去，曲曲折折，可歌可泣，然後再歇斯底里，那是瓊瑤阿姨喜歡的套路，他周澤，不喜歡。\n\n\n\n  林醫生在停車場出口處的長椅上坐了下來，周澤在其身邊坐下。\n\n\n\n  女屍很知趣兒地沒湊上來。\n\n\n\n  兩個人挨著坐著。\n\n\n\n  林晚秋深吸一口氣，她俏麗的面容在月光下顯得更加的精緻。\n\n\n\n  周澤在旁邊欣賞著，\n\n\n\n  有這樣一個美麗的女人，還是一個這樣好看的人……妻，\n\n\n\n  一直思念著已經死去半年多的自己，\n\n\n\n  成就感，真的爆棚啊。\n\n\n\n  「剛剛的事，真的沒關係麼？」林醫生顯然還沒完全從剛剛的事情上脫離出來。\n\n\n\n  「我們沒做錯事，對吧？」周澤安慰她。 \n\n\n\n  林醫生點點頭。\n\n\n\n  「就像是那些很英勇的緝毒警察，他們也會隱瞞自己的身份，他們的家人也會如此，這是為了保證他們的安全，這是他們做出的偉大犧牲。」\n\n\n\n  「所以，你是怕報復？」\n\n\n\n  「嗯。」\n\n\n\n  「好，我懂了。」林醫生點點頭。\n\n\n\n  周澤抬起手，準備把女人給摟住，然後接下來就是「見證奇蹟發生的時刻」，結果林醫生先開口道：\n\n\n\n  「你和她，到底是什麼關係。\n\n\n\n  徐樂，請你認真回答我，這次，不管你回答什麼，我都信。」林醫生看著周澤問道，「我也都原諒。」\n\n\n\n  「真的沒關係。」周澤苦笑道，只能說兩次都太巧了。\n\n\n\n  林醫生又沉默了，正當周澤打算開口說話時，林醫生主動地伸手攥住了周澤的手，周澤愣了一下。\n\n\n\n  「徐樂，我對不起你，我一直愛著另一個男人，你應該已經發現了，否則你不可能出現在那個屋子裡。\n\n\n\n  雖然我和那個男人是清白的，但我承認我精神上出軌了，我對不起你，因為你才是我名義上的丈夫。」\n\n\n\n  「沒關……」\n\n\n\n  周澤剛打算說話，林醫生又開口道： \n\n\n\n  「我們的事，我已經想通了。\n\n\n\n  兩個選擇給你，\n\n\n\n  一，是我們離婚，我自己補償你一百萬，書店，也是你的。」\n\n\n\n  「離什麼婚啊。」周澤說道。\n\n\n\n  「二，我會努力忘掉那個男人，會踏踏實實選擇和你過日子，做你的……真正的妻子，彌補我之前，對你的虧欠。\n\n\n\n  徐樂，我願意嘗試，去把我的一切都給你，盡一個妻子的義務和責任。」\n\n\n\n  說這些話時，林醫生眼圈泛紅，她，認命了。\n\n\n\n  「好……哎，等一下。」\n\n\n\n  周澤腦子一時有些轉不過彎來，這關係有點亂，他得先理理，緊接著周澤終於想通了細節，氣得馬上站起身手指著林醫生有些口不擇言道：\n\n\n\n  「不行，\n\n\n\n  你得繼續出軌！」\n\n\n\n  「…………」林醫生。\n\n\n\n  「噗……」遠處裝作在看風景實際上一直在以自己超於常人的聽覺偷情八卦的女屍直接笑噴了，\n\n\n\n  然後捂著肚子蹲了下來，\n\n\n\n  「哈哈哈哈，笑得人家肚機痛！」\n\n\n\n  ————\n\n\n\n  龍很開心看到章節彈幕里有有大家活躍的身影，這意味著一本書的熱度，龍每章的章節彈幕都會看好幾遍，然後看到大家的靚評也會記錄下來。 \n\n\n\n  所以，之前大家開玩笑說的「一樓很有道理」，這種善意的玩笑，還是不要再開了，也不要再故意刷這種回復，儘量正常交流一下劇情。\n\n\n\n  因為，\n\n\n\n  影響龍抄書評了！\n\n\n\n  最後，有個通知，《深夜書屋》會在4月1號上架！\n\n\n\n  然後，在3月31號那天的章節里，川兒會在這本書里回歸。\n\n\n\n  彌補龍的遺憾，也是彌補大家的遺憾，\n\n\n\n  然後，\n\n\n\n  等上架那天，重新拿回本就屬於我們的成績！",

    "content": "「不行，你得繼續出軌！」\n\n\n\n  「…………」林醫生。\n\n\n\n  林醫生紅唇微張，她有些不知所措，也有些不明所以。\n\n\n\n  是自己「丈夫」還沒原諒自己？\n\n\n\n  又或者，自己「丈夫」本身就有著帶著某種顏色帽子的情節？\n\n\n\n  林醫生在愧疚和壓力下選擇了妥協，其實，她所說的兩個條件，只要選擇方不傻或者沒那麼單純，都肯定會選擇第二個。\n\n\n\n  第一個是拿一百萬外加一個虧損的書店，\n\n\n\n  第二個，則是包括她的人和她的錢一起到手，有了她的人，還缺一百萬？\n\n\n\n  況且，她又不是丑富婆。\n\n\n\n  然而，對於周澤來說，他面對的局面更困難一些。\n\n\n\n  老子忙活了大半天，結果你說你要忘記我，轉而準備認命去和徐樂那個小王八蛋安心過日子？\n\n\n\n  周澤不可能允許這種情況發生，\n\n\n\n  原本是他綠了別人，美滋滋，\n\n\n\n  成就感biubiubiu，\n\n\n\n  現在變成自己被綠了，就不是那麼美好了。\n\n\n\n  周澤伸手，指著自己的臉，很認真地道：\n\n\n\n  「我不是徐樂，我是周澤。」 \n\n\n\n  林醫生愣住了，\n\n\n\n  然而二人沉默了許久，\n\n\n\n  最後，林醫生嘆了口氣，道：\n\n\n\n  「不管你選擇哪一條，我承認我對不起你，但你不該這樣戲弄我，或者，你心裡還有怨氣，是麼？」\n\n\n\n  周澤聳了聳肩，「我真的是周澤，我出車禍死了，但莫名其妙地醒來後，穿越到了這傢伙身上。我不知道你平時看不看小說和電視劇，總之這種穿越的橋段應該不是很罕見才對。」\n\n\n\n  「你說什麼……就是什麼吧。」林醫生附和道。\n\n\n\n  但周澤清楚，眼前的女人估計是打算明天給自己聯繫心理醫生了，要是再絕一點，把自己強制送精神病醫院都可能。\n\n\n\n  遠處，傳來了120急救車的聲音，醫院大樓那邊也一下子沸騰起來。\n\n\n\n  「我去看看。」林醫生站起身，打算暫時放棄對自己「丈夫」的談話，在她看來，自己「丈夫」精神受刺激不小。\n\n\n\n  但也正因為這般，她心裡對徐樂產生了更多的愧疚。\n\n\n\n  一直偷聽八卦的女屍在看見林晚秋走後，來到了周澤身後，道：\n\n\n\n  「老闆，為什麼不讓她看看你的灰指甲？」\n\n\n\n  「又或者讓她看看你是不是涼的？」周澤反問道。 \n\n\n\n  女屍嘟了嘟嘴，道：「好像也不是不可以，她手伸進去摸一下，也該懂了。」\n\n\n\n  「我想唯美一點。」周澤說道，「儘量平緩一點。」\n\n\n\n  「矯情。」女屍在這個時候大著膽子諷刺了一下自家老闆。\n\n\n\n  「對，就是矯情，當初你是大家閨秀還跟酸書生幽會，不也是矯情麼？」周澤伸了個懶腰，「走，跟我進去。」\n\n\n\n  「去醫院？」\n\n\n\n  「廢話，那邊的動靜這麼大，肯定是出了大事故，傷者肯定不少，急診主治醫生肯定人手不足。那些實習醫生經驗不夠膽氣也不夠，應付不了這個局面。」\n\n\n\n  周澤一邊說著一邊和女屍一起走入了醫院，然後直接拐入了醫務人員的更衣室。\n\n\n\n  「但是老闆，這和你有什麼關係？」\n\n\n\n  周澤選了一件和自己身材差不多的白大褂換上，然後系上口罩，\n\n\n\n  「我上輩子就是一名醫生，林醫生當時是我帶的實習生。」\n\n\n\n  「嘿嘿，師生戀。」女屍也換了一件白大褂，帶著些許激動之色道：「老闆，那我要做什麼？」\n\n\n\n  「給我選個BGM。」周澤拉了拉手套說道。\n\n\n\n  「BGM？」女屍愣了一下。\n\n\n\n  「因為我要開始裝逼了。」 \n\n\n\n  周澤深吸一口氣，又重重地吐了出來，\n\n\n\n  熟悉的感覺，\n\n\n\n  我回來了。\n\n\n\n  …………\n\n\n\n  現在的大夫和我那時候的大夫差別好大。」女屍穿著護士裙有些彆扭。\n\n\n\n  「嗯。」周澤不置可否。\n\n\n\n  「弄得我都有些茫然了。」女屍感慨道：「感覺自己和這個世界已經有些脫節了，看來以後我得多出去走走。」女屍試探性地說道。\n\n\n\n  「別扯了，你連灣仔碼頭都知道是什麼意思，還好意思說自己脫節了？」周澤很快反擊道。\n\n\n\n  女屍吐了吐舌頭，道：「老闆，你以前是做什麼醫生的？我聽說做婦產科醫生挺好的。」\n\n\n\n  「你躺在棺材裡也看小說？」周澤反問道。\n\n\n\n  「什麼？」女屍有些不明所以。\n\n\n\n  「金眼科，銀外科，髒活累活婦產科。」\n\n\n\n  周澤笑了笑，「只有外面不知道的人或者受一些其他文學作品影響的人才會覺得婦產科很美好，很愜意。」\n\n\n\n  這時候，電梯打開，一輛擔架車被幾名護工推了過來。\n\n\n\n  周澤馬上走過去，問道：「怎麼回事？」\n\n\n\n  實習醫生本能地像是回答自己「師傅」一樣回答道：「患者意識喪失。」 \n\n\n\n  周澤目光一凝，馬上翻身坐到了擔架車上一邊對其做心肺復甦按壓一邊喊道：\n\n\n\n  「快，推搶救室！」\n\n\n\n  在這個時候，周圍幾個護工和護士一起推著擔架車向里走，過道里不少病人和家屬只能匆忙讓路。\n\n\n\n  「前面人閃開！」周澤喊道。\n\n\n\n  剛剛處理完一個傷者傷口的林醫生擦了擦額頭的汗珠走出來，看著那個跪坐在擔架車上做心肺復甦的身影，整個人愣了一下。\n\n\n\n  然後馬上向那邊跑了過去，\n\n\n\n  他到底要做什麼，\n\n\n\n  這裡可是醫院啊！\n\n\n\n  到了搶救室，周澤直接下令：「推搶救車，準備氣管插管！」\n\n\n\n  「是。」實習醫生應了一聲，周圍的幾個護士見實習醫生都應答了，也就自然而然地跟著命令做事。\n\n\n\n  他們互相以為周圍人認識這名新醫生，實際上這就是最大的誤會，當然，這也是因為情況緊急，外加周澤的語氣和指揮確實讓人感覺不出是「假醫生」。\n\n\n\n  周澤站在病床頭部，親自做插管，\n\n\n\n  同時伸手向左邊攤開：「拔導絲。」\n\n\n\n  「是。」女護士馬上將東西遞到周澤手中。\n\n\n\n  周澤又對身邊的那位實習醫生道：「聽位置。」 \n\n\n\n  「好。」之前還有些緊張的實習醫生在這個時候也不緊張了，很多年輕醫生就是這樣，技術過硬，但確實不適合獨當一面，更適合在有人指揮下當一個工兵。\n\n\n\n  他戴上了聽診器，開始聽位置，然後對周澤點頭道：「位置沒問題。」\n\n\n\n  周澤點點頭，「換人，繼續壓。」\n\n\n\n  「是。」\n\n\n\n  邊上的另一名護士馬上過來取代了之前那位繼續做心肺復甦。\n\n\n\n  這時候一名護士看著旁邊顯示器，驚道：「患者室顫。」\n\n\n\n  周澤抬起頭，「準備除顫。」\n\n\n\n  「明白。」\n\n\n\n  實習醫生當即拿出剪刀剪開了患者身上的衣服，周澤取代了之前的護士開始親自做心肺復甦，同時道：\n\n\n\n  「充電兩百焦。」\n\n\n\n  「明白。」女護士馬上準備好，然後道：「充電完畢。」\n\n\n\n  這個時候，林醫生掀開帘子走了進來，看見正在組織搶救的那個身影。\n\n\n\n  沒錯，是徐樂，是自己的丈夫。\n\n\n\n  林醫生伸手指著周澤，她很憤怒，她不知道自己丈夫到底出了什麼問題，他剛剛對自己說自己是周澤，自己覺得可能他是癔症了，但自己絕對不允許他拿患者的生命開玩笑！ \n\n\n\n  「準備放電，閃開！」周澤對著周圍人提醒道，然後著重地盯了一眼林醫生。\n\n\n\n  林醫生身體一顫，一種熟悉的感覺襲遍全身，\n\n\n\n  熟悉的畫面，\n\n\n\n  熟悉的語氣，\n\n\n\n  熟悉的風格，\n\n\n\n  在這個時候，她甚至連話都說不出來。\n\n\n\n  第一次除顫之後，周澤繼續做心肺復甦，目光一直盯著顯示器。\n\n\n\n  但情況並沒有好轉，周澤直接道：「再來一次，充電兩百焦！」\n\n\n\n  「是。」女護士重新準備，然後道：「充電完畢。」\n\n\n\n  「閃開。」\n\n\n\n  周澤再一次進行除顫。\n\n\n\n  電擊之下，患者身體整個人顫了了一下。\n\n\n\n  身邊的實習醫生繼續做心肺復甦，\n\n\n\n  周澤看著顯示器，上面顯示終於恢復正常。\n\n\n\n  「恢復功率，拉個心電圖。」周澤對身邊實習醫生道。\n\n\n\n  「好。」\n\n\n\n  實習醫生馬上去準備，然後將心電圖的報告紙遞給了周澤。\n\n\n\n  周澤拿在手中看了一眼，道：「急性心梗，聯繫心內科，馬上準備急診PCI。」 \n\n\n\n  「好，明白。」實習醫生擦了擦汗，長舒一口氣。\n\n\n\n  周澤這個時候也走出了急救室，\n\n\n\n  林醫生就站在外面，看著他的目光，帶著懷疑，帶著不敢置信，帶著激動，同時，還帶著恐懼。\n\n\n\n  周澤直接呵斥道：\n\n\n\n  「愣著做什麼，這麼多病人呢，去救人！\n\n\n\n  想哭想害怕等下班回家自己躲在床上抱著洋娃娃哭去。」\n\n\n\n  林醫生當即哭了出來，\n\n\n\n  當初的他，\n\n\n\n  也是這樣訓自己的。\n\n\n\n  下一刻，\n\n\n\n  林醫生直接衝過來，雙手抱住了周澤，把自己的臉直接貼在了周澤胸口位置。\n\n\n\n  周澤愣住了，\n\n\n\n  他預想過很多個坦白後林醫生的反應，\n\n\n\n  害怕？\n\n\n\n  崩潰？\n\n\n\n  恐懼？\n\n\n\n  但唯獨沒料到這個畫面，\n\n\n\n  臥槽，\n\n\n\n  這就投懷送抱了？\n\n\n\n  這就OK了？\n\n\n\n  周澤一直都很好奇，自己以前那麼光棍兒沒情趣的一個人是怎麼收穫當時還是小萌妹的林醫生的芳心的。 \n\n\n\n  現在他好像明白了一些，\n\n\n\n  林醫生不會有斯德哥爾摩綜合症吧？\n\n\n\n  訓著訓著，罵著罵著，她反而喜歡上自己了？\n\n\n\n  不過，好像這種症狀的女人似乎也會接受床第之間某些普通人難以接受的情、、、、趣？\n\n\n\n  嘿嘿；",

    "content": "黃昏時候的太陽，像是紅通通的蘋果，又像是小妹妹的臉蛋被烤熟了。\n\n\n\n  周澤坐在書店裡，整理著最新的一批帳單，書店的運營已經步入了拮据，關鍵問題還是在於自己從徐樂那裡繼承的財產，實在是太少了。\n\n\n\n  如果不是那次從盜版書商那裡抽回了份額，很可能這店鋪已經沒辦法運轉下去了。\n\n\n\n  那晚從醫院回來，周澤就將剩下的冥鈔全都燒了，周澤還蹲在門口抽了半包煙等了好一會兒，的確，沒人過來丟錢了。\n\n\n\n  按照女屍的說法，這波叫用陰德去擋災。\n\n\n\n  鬼給的冥鈔，相當於陰德，你需要錢時，可以拿來「換」錢，需要避難時，可以拿來抵消掉麻煩。\n\n\n\n  上次事兒有新聞報導了，一個富豪買兇僱人殺妻。\n\n\n\n  有一個小道消息稱嫌疑人說好像當時有一個高中女生出現打了他們一頓，當然這個不會有人信的，\n\n\n\n  又不是美少女戰士。\n\n\n\n  總之，那件事算是落幕了，周澤的冥鈔也沒白燒。\n\n\n\n  許清朗從隔壁過來，手裡捧著兩杯茶，他的生活格調是越來越高了。\n\n\n\n  原本一個勤奮向上的有為青年，\n\n\n\n  在擁有了二十幾套房之後，\n\n\n\n  也終於開始貪圖享受步入了墮落的節奏。 \n\n\n\n  二人坐在櫃檯邊一起喝茶。\n\n\n\n  「你那位媳婦兒，最後怎麼了？」許清朗問道。\n\n\n\n  「她說她要安靜一段時間，和思考一段時間。」周澤回答道。\n\n\n\n  坦白的過程很平穩，\n\n\n\n  甚至可以說順利得有些過頭了。\n\n\n\n  林醫生對自己的喜歡，甚至有一種向「病態」發展的趨勢，但好在，她還是一個理智的人。\n\n\n\n  徐樂死了，他周澤借屍還魂，種種不可思議的事情發生在她的面前，你讓她一下子全盤接受，繼續和自己「夢中情人」兼職「現任丈夫」過上沒羞沒臊的幸福生活，\n\n\n\n  有點難。\n\n\n\n  「已經不錯了，她比我想像中堅強。」許清朗笑了笑，「普通人估計得嚇瘋了。」\n\n\n\n  周澤不置可否。\n\n\n\n  許清朗本不該知道這件事，很顯然是有人泄密了，\n\n\n\n  泄密者不需要去找就知道是誰，\n\n\n\n  那位白鶯鶯女士。\n\n\n\n  「對了，問你件事兒。」周澤很認真地問道，「徐樂開店時，就這麼窘迫麼？」\n\n\n\n  「沒啊，我覺得他過得挺瀟灑的，不過他死之前我也沒怎麼和他打交道，一個很木訥的傢伙，賊沒趣。 \n\n\n\n  但他錢應該挺多的，我記得那時候他經常在書店裡接濟他的那些親戚，出手很大方。」\n\n\n\n  許清朗說完後又瞥了一眼周澤，甚至還伸出舌頭舔了舔嘴唇，\n\n\n\n  「還是你有趣。」\n\n\n\n  一時間，腰肢搖動，媚眼如波，當真讓人心神蕩漾。\n\n\n\n  「你不去當鴨，真是可惜了，原本可以做一代鴨王的。」\n\n\n\n  「還能不能好好地聊天？」許清朗生氣道。\n\n\n\n  「這是讚美。」\n\n\n\n  「呵……」許清朗伸手指了指周澤，「你還是關心關心你自己吧。」\n\n\n\n  「關心我什麼？」周澤伸手指了指這個書店，「最近生意不景氣啊，活人碰不到幾個就算了，就連鬼都不見幾個。」\n\n\n\n  「你和你那醫生老婆，準備怎麼發展？我是覺得，她只是需要一段時間緩衝一下，然後還是會接受的。\n\n\n\n  畢竟，她那種女人，說實話，你賺到了，天曉得在這個時代背景下居然還有這種類似古代大家閨秀的產生，她父母肯定也是個奇葩。」\n\n\n\n  「嗯。」周澤點了點頭，自己那岳父岳母，確實很奇葩。\n\n\n\n  岳父當過醫院院長，自己也經營過一家醫療公司，按理說應該是絕對的成功人士，但在某些方面，卻顯得很封建很頑固。 \n\n\n\n  「這樣子的女人，只要你馴服了她，她會心甘情願地給你相夫教子。」許清朗露出了嚮往之色，「我也想要這種女人。」\n\n\n\n  「你已經是了。」周澤補刀。\n\n\n\n  「還是說說你的問題吧，你以後要和她生活在一起的是吧？」\n\n\n\n  「應該吧。」周澤說道。\n\n\n\n  「那肯定也會睡一起的吧？」許清朗伸出手，抖了抖，繼續道：「我說的『睡』，是一個包含著很多複雜動作和特殊體位的動詞，你能懂吧？」\n\n\n\n  周澤點點頭，他依然不知道許清朗到底是什麼意思。\n\n\n\n  「嗯，那麼，你的問題來了，你現在用的是徐樂的身體，如果你們真的睡了，是不是也意味著徐樂把你給綠了？」\n\n\n\n  許清朗眯了眯眼睛，這一刻，他笑得很促狹。\n\n\n\n  然後，\n\n\n\n  周澤陷入了沉思。\n\n\n\n  「甚至，你的DNA，也不是原本的你的，而是徐樂的，也就是說，你們在經過了『睡』這個極其複雜豐富的動詞過程之後，生出來的孩子。\n\n\n\n  其實也不是你的孩子，而是徐樂和林晚秋的孩子。\n\n\n\n  對吧？」\n\n\n\n  然後，\n\n\n\n  周澤再度陷入了沉思。 \n\n\n\n  許清朗越說越起勁，看著周澤繼續沉默，他心裡簡直有一種說不出的暢快！\n\n\n\n  當初白夫人讓手底人抬著八抬大轎過來接自己時，\n\n\n\n  是周澤偷偷伸出指頭指向自己，\n\n\n\n  這個仇，他可是記在小本本上了！\n\n\n\n  周澤喝了一口水，不動聲色。\n\n\n\n  「是不是覺得很憂慮很彷徨？」許清朗問道。\n\n\n\n  「爽的是我自己。」周澤回答道。\n\n\n\n  許清朗皺了皺眉，繼續道：「但是這身體是徐樂的，你和她睡時，是徐樂的身體。」\n\n\n\n  「爽的是我自己。」\n\n\n\n  「但孩子DNA……」\n\n\n\n  「爽的是我自己。」\n\n\n\n  許清朗雙手猛地一拍柜子，呵斥道：\n\n\n\n  「我擦咧，你不能想得這麼開啊！」\n\n\n\n  「反正爽的是我自己，徐樂那貨早就下地獄也不知道走到哪兒去了，可能都喝了孟婆湯投胎去了，我在意這個做什麼？\n\n\n\n  我爽了就是了。」\n\n\n\n  許清朗氣得胸口一陣起伏，他也不知道自己為什麼生氣，\n\n\n\n  但就是好氣哦！\n\n\n\n  「好了，不扯了，再扯下去就要變成精神和肉身上的辯論問題了，都快到哲學的高度了。」周澤示意結束這個有點無聊的討論。 \n\n\n\n  「你高興就好。」許清朗怨氣滿滿。\n\n\n\n  「對了，有件事需要問你一下。」周澤想到了另外一件事。\n\n\n\n  「說。」\n\n\n\n  「你還認識其他鬼差麼？」周澤問道。\n\n\n\n  「我之前帶著爹媽的亡魂過日子，還敢去認識鬼差？」許清朗反問道。\n\n\n\n  「好了，我知道了。」\n\n\n\n  看來還是得抽時間去文廟那邊看看了，上次看見那個敲鑼的侏儒老者，應該也是有編制的。\n\n\n\n  「你到底想問什麼？」許清朗問道。\n\n\n\n  「我想問問鬼差有沒有什麼業績表這類的，升職加薪福利的這種。」\n\n\n\n  「應該……有的吧。」許清朗沉思了一會兒，道：「你看像白夫人，都能通過積攢功德，從一個逗留人間的女鬼回到地獄去謀求一個官身，你應該也是有的。\n\n\n\n  那個小蘿莉沒跟你說？」\n\n\n\n  周澤搖搖頭。\n\n\n\n  「我也是覺得你這鬼差來得有點太簡單了，我估摸著，可能她是有什麼其他嚴重的事兒需要去處理，所以暫時把這差事丟給你應付一下。」\n\n\n\n  「你的意思是，我這是真的臨時工？」\n\n\n\n  「呵呵，等人家事情處理完了，估計你就得騰窩了，到時候人家心情好，就對你睜一隻眼閉一隻眼，如果心情不好，直接把你抓回地獄也是有可能的。」 \n\n\n\n  「她到底是要去處理什麼事情？」周澤自言自語道。\n\n\n\n  緊接著，周澤腦海中浮現出老道直播時那個畫面中的喝粥青年，\n\n\n\n  蓉城，\n\n\n\n  冥店？\n\n\n\n  再聯想一下小蘿莉在聽到自己提起蓉城時的反應，\n\n\n\n  好像，\n\n\n\n  還真是有可能。\n\n\n\n  但不管如何，自己這個臨時工的身份，不能輕易地再還回去，當黑戶的日子，可不舒服。\n\n\n\n  許清朗回自己店裡去了，臨走時給周澤說了聲「元宵節快樂」。\n\n\n\n  周澤也在收拾東西，同時吩咐白鶯鶯出去給自己買幾條煙和一些圓子回來，他得更改計劃，今晚就去文廟找那個侏儒老者聊聊天。\n\n\n\n  也就在這會兒，書店門被推開，走進來一個穿著白色羽絨服的男子。\n\n\n\n  「阿樂哥！我來接我爸出院的。」\n\n\n\n  周澤愣了一下，腦子裡開始思索，大概猜出了男子的身份，應該是自己大伯的孩子，年紀比自己小一些，和徐樂應該是堂兄弟。\n\n\n\n  徐大川上次來城裡看自己，離開時出了車禍輕微骨折，周澤後來去看過一次，醫療費什麼的林醫生都墊付了，他也就沒再過多關心。\n\n\n\n  「你好。」周澤回應得有些冷淡。 \n\n\n\n  「阿樂哥，最近手頭缺點錢花花，你看我爸這一摔，起碼回家後還得靜養倆月的，也不能出去打工賺錢了。」\n\n\n\n  堂弟對著周澤笑了笑。\n\n\n\n  「給過大伯營養費了。」周澤給過一些，徐大川不肯收，還是周澤偷偷塞進他衣服里的。\n\n\n\n  「嘿，阿樂哥，我最近又談了個女朋友，手頭有點兒緊，哥，接濟一下弟弟唄。」堂弟這是直接開口要了。\n\n\n\n  「我這兒，生意也不好。」周澤沒打算給。\n\n\n\n  「哥，你這就不夠意思了。」堂弟不開心了，道：「上次的事兒還是我找人幫你弄的呢。」\n\n\n\n  「啥事兒？」\n\n\n\n  「哥，不厚道了啊，辦完事兒就不認了？我跟你說，我這不是厚著臉皮跟你要錢，你看我這大半年，有上門來跟你提錢的事兒嘛。\n\n\n\n  上次的事兒，那個司機保證不會說漏嘴，再說他已經關了大半年了，再關個半年多也就出來了，他腦子蠢才會說破是吧，他口肯定也嚴，不然就從違法駕駛變成故意殺人了。\n\n\n\n  弟弟我這次真的是手頭緊，哥，你就接濟我千兩千的，等我有錢了再還你成不？」\n\n\n\n  周澤拿起櫃檯上的茶杯，聽到這裡，忽然微微皺眉，道：\n\n\n\n  「到底什麼事兒，我聽不明白。」 \n\n\n\n  「哥，你這就打算過河拆橋了啊？\n\n\n\n  半年前可是你讓我幫你聯繫一個卡車司機花錢讓他故意撞死那個醫生的，\n\n\n\n  你可不能忘了我的功勞啊……」\n\n\n\n  「咔嚓……」\n\n\n\n  周澤手中的玻璃杯，\n\n\n\n  直接被捏碎了。",

    "content": "「阿樂哥？」堂弟看著周澤就這樣捏碎了玻璃杯，看著周澤掌心鮮血不斷地滴落，整個人嚇得下意識地連續後退好幾步。\n\n\n\n  「阿樂哥，你手頭緊的話，就算了，真的就算了。」堂弟顯然是怕了，說話時都帶著一點點哭腔。\n\n\n\n  他們是綁在一根繩子上的螞蚱，談不上誰威脅誰，當然，他一開始只是打算靠著這個人情再蹭點錢花花。\n\n\n\n  如果把自己的堂哥逼急了，\n\n\n\n  是的，他堂哥是主謀，他呢？\n\n\n\n  他也是參與者，甚至從中牽線搭橋，罪名不見得比堂哥輕，至於那位卡車司機，幾乎就是殺手了。\n\n\n\n  所以，他不敢把自己堂哥逼得太急，他也怕。\n\n\n\n  周澤終於明白自己對徐樂借屍還魂後為什麼徐樂身上的錢這麼少，書店虧損是一方面，另一方面則是因為徐樂將自己大部分的錢都花在那件事上了。\n\n\n\n  很荒謬，\n\n\n\n  很可笑，\n\n\n\n  到頭來，\n\n\n\n  自己的死因，居然是這樣子的一個結果。\n\n\n\n  頹然地坐回了椅子上，周澤看著自己掌心處插著的玻璃渣子，看著自己鮮血不停地滴落下來。\n\n\n\n  他沒去止血，也沒覺得有多疼，\n\n \n\n  甚至，他覺得很是有趣。\n\n\n\n  哪怕是再優秀的黑色幽默劇也寫不出現在自己所感受到的諷刺吧？\n\n\n\n  那個他一直覺得很懦弱，\n\n\n\n  很沒骨氣，\n\n\n\n  很廢物，\n\n\n\n  甚至卑微得讓自己都覺得有些可憐的男人，\n\n\n\n  竟然是買兇殺自己的主謀！\n\n\n\n  一切的一切，兜兜轉轉，仿佛又回到了一個圓。\n\n\n\n  是的，\n\n\n\n  你可以說因果循環報應不爽！\n\n\n\n  是的，\n\n\n\n  你可以理解成因果天註定！\n\n\n\n  是的，\n\n\n\n  你可以歡呼老天有眼，出來混的，總是要還的！\n\n\n\n  但這些都是旁觀者的看法，在旁觀者看來，他們期待看見一個罪惡的故事以一個壞人被懲罰好人被補償的結局作為收尾。\n\n\n\n  這會讓旁觀者覺得很有安全感，讓他們覺得很美好，\n\n\n\n  讓他們在吃晚餐時心情不錯多吃兩口米飯。\n\n\n\n  然而，\n\n\n\n  誰又能為自己原本的人生買單？\n\n\n\n  周澤微微地低下頭，他的身體開始慢慢地抽搐起來， \n\n\n\n  強烈的憤怒感開始充斥自己的全身。\n\n\n\n  周醫生，\n\n\n\n  周主任，\n\n\n\n  自己從孤兒院走出來，步步荊棘，步步不易！\n\n\n\n  自己沒關係沒背景，硬生生地靠自己的努力靠自己的實力在醫院系統里往上爬，一邊恪守著自己的醫德操守，一邊希望獲得更大的成功和更高的位置。\n\n\n\n  自己戰戰兢兢，如履薄冰！\n\n\n\n  自己好不容易在那個年紀爬到了那個位置，\n\n\n\n  自己好不容易憑藉自己的醫術在圈子裡揚名，\n\n\n\n  自己付出了多少汗水？\n\n\n\n  深夜躺在床上時一次次對自己的激勵和鼓舞，\n\n\n\n  甚至，多少次咬碎了牙往肚子裡咽！\n\n\n\n  沒啦，\n\n\n\n  都沒啦！\n\n\n\n  就是因為這個王八蛋廢物，\n\n\n\n  他發現了自己老婆對自己的暗戀，\n\n\n\n  他自己的媳婦兒不和自己睡，\n\n\n\n  他委屈，\n\n\n\n  他憤怒，\n\n\n\n  他不甘！\n\n\n\n  他不會反思自己為什麼會丟掉一切尊嚴主動去當這個上門女婿， \n\n\n\n  他不會反思自己為什麼會處處受人看不起，\n\n\n\n  他不會反思自己，\n\n\n\n  也不會反省自己，\n\n\n\n  他把發泄憤怒的目標對準了自己！\n\n\n\n  自己如果真的和你老婆有什麼不清不楚的關係也就算了，\n\n\n\n  但那時候的自己，根本早就忘了自己多年前曾帶過的那個實習生小萌妹！\n\n\n\n  自己根本毫不知情，\n\n\n\n  但就在下班途中，在自己帶著蛋糕和禮物準備去孤兒院陪孩子們慶祝六一的紅綠燈路口，\n\n\n\n  那輛收了錢的大貨車司機，\n\n\n\n  就直接一踩油門，\n\n\n\n  直接踩碎了自己好不容易拼搏奮鬥回來的人生！\n\n\n\n  「阿樂哥，那個，我先走了，你好好注意身體。」\n\n\n\n  堂弟不敢再在這裡繼續逗留下去了，轉身推開書店玻璃門離開，他還要接自己老爹出院回家，再加上現在周澤這個情況，他還真怕刺激到了這個有些文青病平時文文弱弱但狠起來連他都覺得害怕的堂哥！\n\n\n\n  「我要弄死那個傢伙，弄死他！用從她那裡拿到的錢，弄死他啊啊啊啊啊啊！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！」\n\n\n\n  堂弟至今還記得半年前的那個傍晚，堂哥把好幾沓錢放在自己面前說這些話時的面容扭曲。 \n\n\n\n  這個曾被自己在背地裡笑話，覺得骨子軟，懦弱，甚至不惜攀龍附鳳倒插門連孩子都不能跟自己姓的堂哥，\n\n\n\n  在那個黃昏，\n\n\n\n  徹底改變了他在自己心裡的形象。\n\n\n\n  看著堂弟的背影，周澤流血的手掌，指甲一次次地長出來，又消退。\n\n\n\n  那一縷縷黑氣，不停地在指尖環繞。\n\n\n\n  周澤的眼眸，也有著血色和黑色暴戾的光澤不停地交織。\n\n\n\n  這是他的仇人，\n\n\n\n  謀殺自己的主謀之一，\n\n\n\n  他想把這個人永遠地留下來，\n\n\n\n  他想讓白鶯鶯把這個人當作食物，吸乾他全身的血，讓他變成一具人干！\n\n\n\n  但他，就這樣走了，\n\n\n\n  而周澤，自始至終，\n\n\n\n  都沒有出手。\n\n\n\n  甚至連站起來喊一聲「站住」都沒有。\n\n\n\n  理智，\n\n\n\n  這該死的理智，\n\n\n\n  這讓人絕望讓人幾乎崩潰的理智！\n\n\n\n  周澤清楚，自己不能殺他。\n\n\n\n  哪怕他不去計較自己鬼差的身份，為自己復仇而引發的其他後果， \n\n\n\n  就說如果殺了他，\n\n\n\n  那個在監獄裡的司機得知這件事後會怎麼想？\n\n\n\n  會不會覺得自己是在殺人滅口？\n\n\n\n  那麼，自己難道還要再去把那個司機一起殺了？\n\n\n\n  是啊，司機才是謀殺自己的第一殺手啊！\n\n\n\n  是那個該死的混蛋，在那個夜晚，一直盯著自己，然後在紅綠燈路口闖紅燈主動撞向了他！\n\n\n\n  堂弟該死，\n\n\n\n  那個司機也更該死的！\n\n\n\n  但如果把這兩個人都殺了，無論用何種方式去隱藏布置什麼意外現場，\n\n\n\n  警方肯定能發現其中的異常的。\n\n\n\n  到時候，一條線也就清晰了！\n\n\n\n  其實，\n\n\n\n  事情最關鍵的是，真正的花錢買兇殺人的人，是現在的周澤啊！\n\n\n\n  他才是真正的主謀！\n\n\n\n  如果要復仇，殺了他們，等於是暴露了自己。\n\n\n\n  他們已經毀了自己第一個人生了，\n\n\n\n  難道說，\n\n\n\n  還要因為他們再毀掉自己好不容易得到的借屍還魂的機會？\n\n\n\n  毀掉自己， \n\n\n\n  現在第二個人生？\n\n\n\n  周澤雙手握拳，重重地捶在了櫃檯上。\n\n\n\n  「砰！」\n\n\n\n  一陣天旋地轉，\n\n\n\n  周澤身子一個踉蹌，整個人後退了好幾步，後背貼著牆角，緩緩地坐了下來。\n\n\n\n  鮮血淋漓的手捂著自己的眼睛，\n\n\n\n  另一隻手無意識地在瓷磚上刮蹭著。\n\n\n\n  你很憤怒，\n\n\n\n  但你卻沒有辦法去發泄，\n\n\n\n  這，\n\n\n\n  艹蛋的人生！\n\n\n\n  這狗日的天理昭昭，\n\n\n\n  這簡直王八蛋一般的因果循環！\n\n\n\n  我上輩子，救了很多人啊，也幫了很多人啊！！！\n\n\n\n  周澤眼角有淚水滴落下來，\n\n\n\n  每個人，都有自己脆弱的時候，唯一能做的，只是用手掌遮住自己正在流淚的雙眼；\n\n\n\n  每個人，也都有自己怨天恨地埋怨世道不公的時候，並不是每個人都是純粹的機器人，總是能在遇到時候冷靜地去從自己身上進行分析。\n\n\n\n  周澤上輩子，自認為沒做過什麼虧心的事情，在他手中，有很多病人的性命被保住，很多人的人生和家庭被他給拯救。 \n\n\n\n  他沒去放任自流，也沒有去同流合污，哪怕有著極強的往上爬和往上鑽的功利心，但他依舊恪守著自己做人做醫生的本分，也因此，自己往上爬的時候，所面對的難度和所需要的付出，比其他會低頭的人更大！\n\n\n\n  櫃檯一角，有一張冥幣落在那裡，\n\n\n\n  應該是那晚回來後自己燒的紙幣里剩下的一張。\n\n\n\n  正如白鶯鶯所說的那般，死人給的冥鈔，相當於陰德。\n\n\n\n  呵呵，\n\n\n\n  或許是因為上輩子老天看自己積德了太多，所以這輩子給了自己補償。\n\n\n\n  讓自己「重生」回來，直接擁有一個美麗的妻子，讓自己擁有一家書店，甚至，為了彰顯他的「青天大老爺」的英明，\n\n\n\n  讓自己從地獄裡出來，魂魄在路邊搖搖晃晃即將崩潰消散時，\n\n\n\n  撞見了被一個小毛賊錯手殺死的徐樂。\n\n\n\n  讓自己，繼承了徐樂的人生。\n\n\n\n  讓這個本來主謀殺了自己的傢伙，付出在老天爺看來理所應當的代價。\n\n\n\n  但……誰又問過他周澤是否同意？\n\n\n\n  乃至於，\n\n\n\n  弄得現在的自己，\n\n\n\n  連復仇都沒辦法去做！ \n\n\n\n  那個混蛋，走到自己面前，說買兇撞死那個醫生的事情時，\n\n\n\n  自己只能頹然地坐在那裡，\n\n\n\n  一動不動！\n\n\n\n  夕陽下的餘暉，\n\n\n\n  灑落在書屋的門口邊角，\n\n\n\n  帶走今日，\n\n\n\n  最後一抹殘存的微暖。\n\n\n\n  「對了，我這兒剛開發了一個新款的草莓汁，你要不要先嘗一嘗口味，我再做做改進？」許清朗端著一個酒杯推開門走進來。\n\n\n\n  看見坐在牆角手上鮮血淋漓的周澤，他愣了一下，馬上放下草莓汁跑了過來，在周澤身邊蹲下。\n\n\n\n  「你怎麼了？」許清朗問道。\n\n\n\n  「為什麼……這不公平……不……這該死的公平。」周澤喃喃自語。\n\n\n\n  許清朗沉默了，他不知道周澤發生了什麼事情變成現在這樣，這個一直以來他所認識的周澤不管什麼時候都閒得很理智很雲淡風輕。\n\n\n\n  甚至在嚴謹和刻板之中，還時不時和你開開玩笑，這是一個很自律的人，但自律的人往往在遇到打擊後崩潰時，更加地無助。\n\n\n\n  此時的周澤，讓許清朗仿佛看見了那天被小蘿莉在店裡收走父母亡魂時的自己。\n\n\n\n  他埋怨不公平， \n\n\n\n  因為隔壁的周澤也是一個鬼，\n\n\n\n  但小蘿莉卻放任了他的存在，轉而收走自己父母的亡魂。\n\n\n\n  許清朗嘆了一口氣，\n\n\n\n  伸手摟住了周澤的肩膀，讓周澤的額頭靠在自己的胸口，同時也跟著一起附和道：\n\n\n\n  「兄弟，雖然不知道發生了什麼事兒，但你現在的情緒，我能感同身受。\n\n\n\n  再牛逼的蕭邦，也彈不出咱的悲傷。」",

    "content": "左手三條煙，右手一袋圓兒，\n\n\n\n  身上還背著一個靚麗的挎包包。\n\n\n\n  白鶯鶯不會浪費任何一次周澤准許她出書店的機會，天知道她是如何以這般快的速度在買了煙和湯圓之後還買了一個挎包！\n\n\n\n  推開書店的門，\n\n\n\n  白鶯鶯看見兩個男人抱在一起的畫面，當即放下東西捂住雙眼，\n\n\n\n  同時叉開手指縫隙使勁地看著，\n\n\n\n  不忘跺跺腳嬌羞道：\n\n\n\n  「嚶嚶嚶，\n\n\n\n  我是不是回來的不是時候？」\n\n\n\n  許貴人，\n\n\n\n  哦不，\n\n\n\n  許清朗回瞪了一眼白鶯鶯，那一抹哀怨的風情，簡直要化作夏天的露水滴淌出來。\n\n\n\n  這磅礴的深閨怨氣，\n\n\n\n  恐怖如斯！\n\n\n\n  讓白鶯鶯都有些懷疑到底自己是殭屍還是面前的這個麵館店老闆才是殭屍？\n\n\n\n  「東西買回來了？」周澤站起身。\n\n\n\n  整理了一下自己的衣服。\n\n\n\n  許清朗也跟著站起身，假裝系起了扣子。\n\n\n\n  「老闆，都買回來了呢。」白鶯鶯乖巧地回答道。 \n\n\n\n  「好，我出去一下。」\n\n\n\n  周澤走過去，將煙和湯圓提起來，對白鶯鶯道：「你看家吧。」\n\n\n\n  「好嘞。」\n\n\n\n  當周澤走出店裡後，白鶯鶯和許清朗互相對著鬥雞眼。\n\n\n\n  「看什麼看，屍體。」許清朗沒好氣道。\n\n\n\n  「你如果繼續躲在柜子里，我就看不到了。」白鶯鶯反諷道。\n\n\n\n  「你是冰噠，冰噠！能凍成冰棍的冰！」\n\n\n\n  許清朗繼續反擊！\n\n\n\n  「呵，你水路不通，\n\n\n\n  走旱道容易容易碰到劫匪有血光之災。」\n\n\n\n  白鶯鶯犀利地反擊。\n\n\n\n  「哼！」\n\n\n\n  「哼！」\n\n\n\n  兩個人不歡而散，許清朗回麵館去了，白鶯鶯則是學著周澤的樣子坐在櫃檯後面的老闆椅上，倒了一杯熱水，然後隨後拿了一本書假裝很有氛圍地看了起來。\n\n\n\n  …………\n\n\n\n  周澤打算去一趟文廟，生活不管給你多少悲傷，你總得先承受著，然後該怎麼活還怎麼活。\n\n\n\n  就像是短暫假期的最後一天晚上，一想到明天就要早起上班就讓人很是絕望， \n\n\n\n  很想自暴自棄，卻還是只能給自己設置好鬧鐘。\n\n\n\n  這就是生活，對於一些成功人士來說，人們總是會津津樂道關心他成功的秘密，羨慕他此時的風雲際會。\n\n\n\n  這就像是孕婦剛剛生了小寶寶後，親朋好友都來恭喜她，卻沒人關心為了懷上這個寶寶當初被艹了多少次。\n\n\n\n  話糙理不糙吧。\n\n\n\n  周澤只能自我安慰。\n\n\n\n  至於那個所謂的堂弟以及那位貨車司機，如何去回應他們，得從長計議，至少，周澤不是一個如此大度的人。\n\n\n\n  他做不來類似蓉城那位同行的囂張霸氣，但這件事牽扯到自己的「命案」，肯定不能一筆輕輕揭過。\n\n\n\n  拿出手機，準備打車，卻恰巧看見一條微信消息：\n\n\n\n  「在做什麼？」\n\n\n\n  是林醫生發來的消息。\n\n\n\n  周澤有些遲疑，也有些猶豫，老實說，他現在心情有些複雜，因為徐樂之所以要殺他，也是因為這個美麗的女醫生一直在暗戀自己。\n\n\n\n  好吧，被一個漂亮女人暗戀，\n\n\n\n  被一個漂亮的人…………妻暗戀，\n\n\n\n  被一個漂亮的同時貞操還在的人……妻暗戀，\n\n\n\n  確實很讓人自豪和驕傲。 \n\n\n\n  但自己上輩子，\n\n\n\n  就是被她這樣奶死的啊！！！！！\n\n\n\n  「在店裡。」周澤還是回復了消息。\n\n\n\n  他不是徐樂，不會那麼沒擔當，他和徐樂的兜兜轉轉因果報應，和林醫生，沒絲毫地關係。\n\n\n\n  而且說實話，在自己死後一步一步發現林醫生對自己的那種迷戀後，他對這個女人，說沒好感，那是不可能的。\n\n\n\n  尤其上周在醫院的坦白，\n\n\n\n  她很害怕，\n\n\n\n  也很惶恐，\n\n\n\n  甚至身體都在顫抖，\n\n\n\n  但她依然毫不猶豫地把自己抱住。\n\n\n\n  老天爺瞎沒瞎眼，周澤不清楚，但林醫生的存在，確實是相當於自己重生歸來生活中最大的一個亮點。\n\n\n\n  「我在你店外的路上。」\n\n\n\n  周澤抬起頭，環視四周，果然，在馬路拐角處看見了一輛白色的瑪莎拉蒂。\n\n\n\n  上一輛卡宴那晚被自己開車時刮蹭到了電線桿上了，顯然，林醫生是又換了一輛。\n\n\n\n  萬惡的拜金主義思潮啊！\n\n\n\n  周澤走過去，打開了車門，在副駕駛位置上坐了下來。\n\n\n\n  林醫生有些拘謹，也有些不知所措，但可以看出來，她主動來見自己，是抱著很大的勇氣。 \n\n\n\n  畢竟，自己是一個鬼。\n\n\n\n  「徐樂，他已經……」\n\n\n\n  周澤微微皺眉，他現在不想聽到任何關於「徐樂」的事情。\n\n\n\n  「別提他了，就當他一直沒存在過。」周澤很生硬地打斷道。\n\n\n\n  「那這樣……會不會讓你覺得……我是個壞女人？」林醫生問道。\n\n\n\n  三從四德，\n\n\n\n  雖然沒那麼死板教條，但事實上，林醫生確實因為父母的關係深受封建餘毒思想的毒害。\n\n\n\n  現在自己的丈夫是周澤，\n\n\n\n  那原本的徐樂呢？\n\n\n\n  「別想那麼多。」\n\n\n\n  周澤搖搖頭。\n\n\n\n  事實上就是這般詼諧，\n\n\n\n  當林醫生知道徐樂是周澤後，說話的語氣和身段都放低了許多，仿佛又回到了當初自己還只是一個實習生的時期，而周澤，依然是她的老師。\n\n\n\n  當時，周澤對於她們這幫實習生，無論男生女生可沒有半分客氣，直接拿來當「實習狗」來使用，髒活累活以及買咖啡，全讓他們去做。\n\n\n\n  而周澤，在坦白之後，也慢慢地在林醫生面前展現出了那種「高人一等」的姿態。\n\n\n\n  大男子主義的傾向開始越發明顯。 \n\n\n\n  被愛的，總是有恃無恐。\n\n\n\n  「好。」林醫生點了點頭。\n\n\n\n  然後，\n\n\n\n  沉默。\n\n\n\n  周澤不想沉默，他看了看林醫生，發現她今天穿著粉紅色的羽絨服，下身著牛仔褲，身材曲線雖然完美地凸顯出來，配合她的氣質也著實很好看，但周澤總覺得缺了點什麼。\n\n\n\n  「下次穿絲襪吧，我喜歡看女人穿絲襪。」周澤說道。\n\n\n\n  林醫生愣了一下，俏臉泛紅，\n\n\n\n  她覺得自己應該悲傷一下，在猜測到徐樂很可能已經死去之後，她作為妻子，應該悲傷一下，而不是這般在車裡，受到來自周澤的調戲。\n\n\n\n  但那種羞惱的感覺，卻讓她無法反抗。\n\n\n\n  或許，\n\n\n\n  她其實是一個壞女人吧。\n\n\n\n  一個精神出軌的，壞女人。\n\n\n\n  林醫生閉上眼，在心裡認命了。\n\n\n\n  「跟你說話呢。」周澤提醒道。\n\n\n\n  「哦……好。」林醫生應了一聲，臉更紅了。\n\n\n\n  周澤嘴角露出了一抹笑容，\n\n\n\n  他知道，自己之所以會說話這麼放肆，也有著故意報復徐樂的原因，或許，他也不是一個好男人。 \n\n\n\n  好了，\n\n\n\n  一個心裡認為自己不是一個好女人，另一個認為自己不是一個好男人，\n\n\n\n  放在古代，他們幾乎就是潘金蓮和西門大官人的翻版。\n\n\n\n  至於中間那位武大郎，\n\n\n\n  誰在乎呢？\n\n\n\n  「你餓了麼？」林醫生問道。\n\n\n\n  「不餓。」周澤回答。\n\n\n\n  然後，\n\n\n\n  又是沉默。\n\n\n\n  周澤現在真心覺得自己上輩子一直是光棍可能並不僅僅是因為自己痴迷於工作無暇顧及其他，可能是因為他本身情商就很低。\n\n\n\n  你說你跟陌生女孩聊天總是冷場嘛，這正常，\n\n\n\n  但你和自己合法妻子聊天還會冷場，肯定就是自己有一些問題了。\n\n\n\n  「我們，就這樣生活下去吧，我的事，不要告訴別人，就當我是……徐樂好了。」周澤咬牙切齒地說出了那兩個字。\n\n\n\n  「好。」林醫生點點頭，這也是她所想的。\n\n\n\n  一切，照舊。\n\n\n\n  「但有一點我要提醒你一下。」\n\n\n\n  「您說。」\n\n\n\n  「在床上的時候，你只准喊我周澤。」周澤用小拇指掏了掏耳朵，「我不希望聽到你忽然喊出徐樂兩個字，沒有人的時候，你也只能喊我的名字。」 \n\n\n\n  在床上的時候？\n\n\n\n  林醫生的心忽然漏了半拍，\n\n\n\n  她雖然早就為人婦，但依舊是處子之身，\n\n\n\n  這種話題和暗示，\n\n\n\n  真的很讓人羞恥！\n\n\n\n  但她還是鬼使神差地點了點頭，輕輕地應了一聲，\n\n\n\n  「好。」\n\n\n\n  周澤真的覺得這位林醫生，確實有一點點斯德哥爾摩綜合症。\n\n\n\n  如果當初的徐樂不是那麼怯懦的話，而是簡單粗暴，\n\n\n\n  可能也就能得償所願了，也就不會便宜了自己。\n\n\n\n  但換個念頭想一想，如果徐樂簡單粗暴了，也就不會再恨自己買兇殺自己了吧？\n\n\n\n  那到底是得到一個完璧之身的林醫生好？\n\n\n\n  還是自己上輩子繼續活著好？\n\n\n\n  哪個才是真的好？\n\n\n\n  周澤伸手拍了拍自己的額頭。\n\n\n\n  「您怎麼了？」林醫生關切地看著周澤，「您身體，是不是因為那件事……會出現一些問題？」\n\n\n\n  哎喲我去，\n\n\n\n  「您」的稱呼都出來了，\n\n\n\n  周老爺一陣飄飄然。 \n\n\n\n  這林醫生可能不僅僅是斯德哥爾摩綜合症了，可能還是一個抖M。\n\n\n\n  不對，\n\n\n\n  等一下，\n\n\n\n  好像有哪裡不對勁？\n\n\n\n  身體出問題？\n\n\n\n  周澤馬上看向林醫生，\n\n\n\n  男人的身體怎麼可能容許出問題?\n\n\n\n  不存在的！\n\n\n\n  周澤看了看車座，前面有點擠啊。\n\n\n\n  「下車。」周澤說道。\n\n\n\n  「嗯。」\n\n\n\n  林醫生雖然不知道要做什麼，但還是下了車。\n\n\n\n  周澤打開了後車門，指了指裡面，道：「進去。」\n\n\n\n  林醫生一臉莫名其妙地進去了。\n\n\n\n  「我得證明一下，我沒問題。」周澤自言自語道。\n\n\n\n  此時已經天黑，\n\n\n\n  外加自己書店這塊區域人跡罕至。\n\n\n\n  「你的胃口，不是不好麼？」坐在後車座上的林醫生一臉不解地問道。\n\n\n\n  周澤身體僵了一下，\n\n\n\n  她說的身體有問題指的是自己不能吃飯？\n\n\n\n  呼…… \n\n\n\n  長舒一口氣，\n\n\n\n  卸下了心理壓力，\n\n\n\n  但依舊要輕裝上陣！\n\n\n\n  但周澤還是道：「我要證明另一個方面也沒問題。」\n\n\n\n  「什麼問題？」林醫生還是一臉不解。\n\n\n\n  然後，周澤也鑽入了後車座，\n\n\n\n  把車門關上。\n\n\n\n  天很黑，\n\n\n\n  車很抖，\n\n\n\n  他們幹了個爽。",

    "content": "「額，難道我猜錯了？」\n\n\n\n  侏儒老者歪了歪頭，\n\n\n\n  「道行又退步了，唉喲。」\n\n\n\n  侏儒老者掏出一根煙，自顧自地抽起來，很惆悵啊。\n\n\n\n  周澤平復了一下情緒，他總不能說，你算得好像有那麼幾分道理？\n\n\n\n  「老前輩，我來是想問一下關於鬼差的事情。」\n\n\n\n  「鬼差？」侏儒老者皺了皺眉，「我說你這個後生沒事做問鬼差的事兒做什麼，那幫人可不是那麼好相與的，你遇到他們還是得躲著點他們。\n\n\n\n  你有肉身，能活過來，這是大機緣，自顧自地偷著樂吧。」\n\n\n\n  老者很不理解地說道。\n\n\n\n  周澤微微皺眉，眼前的老者，看不出自己是鬼差？\n\n\n\n  雖然自己是臨時工，但以這個老者之前推演的手段來看，絕對不是什么半桶子水，但他卻根本沒能發現自己的鬼差身份。\n\n\n\n  這是否意味著，小蘿莉的確是把自己當臨時工，除了一個所謂的「地獄之門」，她其實還有其他重要的東西根本就沒給自己？\n\n\n\n  許清朗曾說過那個蘿莉來也匆匆去也匆匆，肯定不是真的想要交接班而已，她只是有事情需要去忙，暫且抓了自己當了個免費的壯丁。\n\n\n\n  至於抓自己當壯丁的理由也很簡單，不就是看重自己不會主動惹事兒，不會在代班的時候給她惹麻煩麼？ \n\n\n\n  但這個身份，周澤是必須要掌握的，他已經有一次人生被毀掉了，這次的人生，他必須完全捏在手裡，而鬼差的身份，則是最好的護身符，讓他不至於淪為黑戶惶惶不可終日。\n\n\n\n  周澤對著老者攤開了手掌，讓那個標誌展露在老者面前。\n\n\n\n  老者面色當即一凝，隨即呼吸都隨之滯緩了片刻，同時眼珠子「茲遛」一轉，而後恍然大悟道：\n\n\n\n  「我懂了，那個長舌頭女娃子，把你拉出來當代班的了。」\n\n\n\n  侏儒老者背著雙手，在土堆兒上來迴轉著圈兒，像是在思考著什麼問題，周澤在旁邊沒出聲打擾他。\n\n\n\n  終於，老者又問道：「你問老夫鬼差的事兒，意欲何為？」\n\n\n\n  「為地獄和諧，為陽間和平，更好地貢獻自己的力量。」\n\n\n\n  「哦。」老者搖搖頭，又點點頭，「嘿，老夫知道你想做什麼，你想對那個長舌頭女娃子，取而代之？」\n\n\n\n  周澤沒反駁，\n\n\n\n  沒反駁也就是意味著默認。\n\n\n\n  「辦法不是沒有，而且很簡單。」侏儒老者沉吟道，「念在你今晚給我帶了這麼多禮物的份兒上，我就告訴你。」\n\n\n\n  「洗耳恭聽。」\n\n\n\n  「文廟裡頭，住著的都是聖人，聖人在上，人走人間道，鬼往奈何橋，聖人們一眼洞明。 \n\n\n\n  你說，是這個理兒不？」\n\n\n\n  「是。」周澤點了點頭。\n\n\n\n  「長舌頭丫頭給你這把鑰匙，相當於給了你半個身份，但她隨時可以拿走。」侏儒老者沉吟道：「但只要你進了文廟，由老夫我親自禱告聖人，你再在聖人面前表表態，做做保證，表表決心。\n\n\n\n  也就是把你之前所說的那番漂亮話，再說得更漂亮一些，只要其中一個聖人點頭，你的身份，就算坐實了。\n\n\n\n  但有一點需要切忌，聖人目光如炬，洞悉一切，一旦你心存歹念，又或者日後做出什麼出格的事兒來，那麼制裁你的除了陰司法規，更有聖人之怒！」\n\n\n\n  侏儒老者一臉嚴肅。\n\n\n\n  「就這麼簡單？」周澤反問道。\n\n\n\n  「何其難也。」侏儒老者嘆了口氣，「想要獲得聖人垂青，賜予你身份，這只能是一種法子，一種姑且試試的法子。」\n\n\n\n  周澤點點頭，道，「那就試試吧。」\n\n\n\n  侏儒老者走到文廟門口，對著裡面吹了一口氣，門後就傳來了「咔嚓」的聲響，應該是大紅木門的門閂落下了。\n\n\n\n  「你且先進去，好好在聖人像前說道說道，接下來，由老夫來替你安排。」\n\n\n\n  周澤伸手推開門，看了看身邊的侏儒老者，見對方站在那裡不動，有些奇怪道： \n\n\n\n  「老前輩不和我一起進去？」\n\n\n\n  「見笑了，我只是聖人座下一條走狗，哪敢沒事瞎到聖人面前晃悠，你身上有半個官身，但且進去。」\n\n\n\n  周澤猶豫了一下，還是邁開步子，走了進去。\n\n\n\n  老者雙手輕輕一合，木門再度閉合。\n\n\n\n  「跟聖人好好說道說道！」\n\n\n\n  隨後，老者又取出一根煙咬在嘴裡，不需要點，香菸自己就直接燃燒了。\n\n\n\n  一根煙抽完，老者笑了笑，取下自己的鑼鼓，用力一敲！\n\n\n\n  只聽得一聲脆響，\n\n\n\n  老者吊著嗓子吼道：\n\n\n\n  「天乾物燥，小心火燭！」\n\n\n\n  緊接著，\n\n\n\n  又是一聲鑼響：\n\n\n\n  「天乾物燥，小心火燭！」\n\n\n\n  老者敲著鑼，在文廟門口載歌載舞，有點像是東北跳大神的。\n\n\n\n  他身材矮小，蹦跳起來更顯憨態可掬。\n\n\n\n  「小子，你且繼續和聖人像多聊聊，多表表態，老夫幫你上達天聽！」\n\n\n\n  侏儒老者衝著文廟裡喊了一嗓子。\n\n\n\n  「好，辛苦前輩了。」 \n\n\n\n  周澤的聲音從牆後面傳來。\n\n\n\n  「不辛苦，不辛苦，以後你多給我帶幾條煙時不時來看看我就好了，老夫我也沒了子孫後代，也斷了香火奉承，現在想抽根煙，都難得很。\n\n\n\n  文廟裡倒是不缺吃的喝的，但聖人老爺面前的東西，給我十個膽子我也不敢碰啊。」\n\n\n\n  侏儒老者「哈哈哈」大笑，\n\n\n\n  然後繼續歡快地敲起了自己的鑼。\n\n\n\n  「天乾物燥，小心火燭！」\n\n\n\n  「砰！」鑼響！\n\n\n\n  「天乾物燥，小心火燭！」\n\n\n\n  「砰！」鑼響。\n\n\n\n  鑼響一次比一次低沉，\n\n\n\n  與此同時，侏儒老者原本那柄用白布包裹著的棒槌開始浸透出了血色。\n\n\n\n  一開始，\n\n\n\n  血色只是淡淡的星星點點，但隨著一次次敲鑼，血色開始蔓延。\n\n\n\n  開始變得濃稠，也開始變得刺目，\n\n\n\n  到最後，\n\n\n\n  侏儒老者每次敲擊時，都能敲出一大片血漿來，印染了他的衣服，也讓他原本憨態可掬的形象，染上了一些猙獰！\n\n\n\n  「天乾物燥，小！心！火！燭！」 \n\n\n\n  「砰！」\n\n\n\n  最後一聲鑼響，\n\n\n\n  侏儒老者直接將手中通紅滿是鮮血的鑼鼓一股腦地丟入了文廟之中，同時提著嗓子喊道：\n\n\n\n  「聖人睜眼嘍，邪祟受法嘍！」\n\n\n\n  喊完最後這一嗓子，\n\n\n\n  老者整個人如遭電擊，他的身體比之前變得模糊了許多，甚至隱約有渙散的趨勢。\n\n\n\n  但他還是放肆地笑著，同時對著裡面喊道：\n\n\n\n  「舒服麼，現在你舒服麼！」\n\n\n\n  「不舒服。」\n\n\n\n  周澤的聲音從圍牆後面傳來。\n\n\n\n  「不舒服就對了，後生，老夫今天再教教你，什麼叫世事無常，人心難測！\n\n\n\n  人心隔肚皮，何況是一隻鬼！\n\n\n\n  老夫豁出去一甲子的陪侍的功德，也要請聖人把你鎮殺嘍！」\n\n\n\n  「我和你……有仇？」\n\n\n\n  圍牆另一側周澤的聲音傳來，帶著濃濃的不解。\n\n\n\n  「仇？當然有仇！」侏儒老者身體一陣恍惚，但還是繼續喊道：「老夫不去投胎，不落輪迴，不奔往生！\n\n\n\n  沒日沒夜陪侍著這文廟，伺候著這些祖宗， \n\n\n\n  為的，\n\n\n\n  還不就是為了給後人積攢點陰德，蒙陰一下子孫麼！\n\n\n\n  老夫這一脈因祖上行過禍亂之事兒，導致人丁稀薄，所以老夫才不得已為之，滯留此地，只求香火通達不斷！\n\n\n\n  但在一年前，老夫最後一代子嗣，單傳子嗣，居然沒了！\n\n\n\n  你讓我這一甲子的陪侍裝孫子又有什麼意義？」\n\n\n\n  侏儒老者哭喊道，\n\n\n\n  「天天陪著這些泥胎塑像，很有趣麼？\n\n\n\n  哈哈哈，老天有眼，那日『洗門』爭頭香，我只是瞥了你一眼，借了你一根煙抽抽。\n\n\n\n  根本就沒看出來什麼，\n\n\n\n  今兒個剛才讓我好好算了算，去你的六味地黃丸！\n\n\n\n  你讓老夫算出來了你和我最後一代子孫的夭折有密不可分的關係！\n\n\n\n  這是你造的因，今兒個就由你來接這個果！\n\n\n\n  老夫用六十年陪侍的功德換你一個魂飛魄散，\n\n\n\n  你值了！你不虧！」\n\n\n\n  「你那個後代，死在手術台上？」圍牆後的周澤問道。\n\n\n\n  「不，不是死在手術台上，他死在一場車禍里。」\n\n\n\n  侏儒老者抹淚道，身形雖然模糊了許多，但是他的眼淚，似乎也帶著血紅的斑點。 \n\n\n\n  「我上輩子又不是開車的。」\n\n\n\n  周澤還想說自己上輩子也是被車撞死的。\n\n\n\n  「那個酒駕的王八蛋，他本該死了的，陽壽也該盡了的，但你硬是在手術台上把他救了回來，給他強行撐了半個月的命！\n\n\n\n  最後，他時辰到了，酒駕出車禍死了，但也連累了我那可愛的乖曾曾曾孫兒，也一起在車禍里走了。\n\n\n\n  你說，\n\n\n\n  這是不是你的因果？\n\n\n\n  這是不是你造的孽！\n\n\n\n  這是不是你欠的債！」\n\n\n\n  「你這腦迴路，真強大。」周澤感嘆道。\n\n\n\n  從剛開始復仇的亢奮狀態中慢慢恢復平靜的侏儒老者忽然發現了一件極為詭異的事兒，按理說自己折了一甲子的陪侍功德請文廟裡的一位聖人睜一次眼。\n\n\n\n  依照那些泥胎聖人的一貫尿性，平日裡懶散得要死，只要睜眼前方有鬼物，哪怕是正牌鬼差也都能一併鎮殺了，何況還不是正牌的周澤？\n\n\n\n  眼下的周澤，不應該在聖人一眼之下，魂魄分崩，靈魂飄散，正在承受著莫大的痛苦麼？\n\n\n\n  怎麼每次回應自己時都語氣輕鬆？\n\n\n\n  這不對，\n\n\n\n  這不對勁！ \n\n\n\n  「你怎麼會沒事，你怎麼會沒事！」\n\n\n\n  侏儒老者忽然吼道，\n\n\n\n  他可是一股腦葬送掉一甲子陪侍的功德啊！\n\n\n\n  周澤從圍牆另一側後面走了出來，\n\n\n\n  看著侏儒老者。\n\n\n\n  文廟的廟宇被長方形的圍牆圍著，之前周澤說話時就站在另一側圍牆外面，所以侏儒老者站在正門位置時聽起來，就像是周澤站在廟裡對自己回話一樣。\n\n\n\n  侏儒老者整個人如遭電擊，一臉不敢置信地看著出現在文廟外面的周澤，\n\n\n\n  「你怎麼在外面，你怎麼出來的！」\n\n\n\n  周澤對著後面努了努嘴，道：\n\n\n\n  「你在這個單位混了這麼久，\n\n\n\n  都不知道這裡其實是可以走後門的麼？」",

"「你在這個單位混了這麼久，\n\n\n\n  都不知道這裡其實是可以走後門的麼？」\n\n\n\n  這裡的後門，可不是指的走人際關係的潛規則，而是指的是文廟除了前門之外，的確還有一個後門。\n\n\n\n  這個世界上，沒有無緣無故的愛，天上掉餡兒餅根據力學計算是能夠砸死人的。\n\n\n\n  如果侏儒老者只是提點自己幾句，再雲裡霧裡說一些神秘莫測的話，仿照菩提老祖給孫猴子後腦勺敲三下，說不得周澤還會細細思量，覺得比較逼真和踏實一些。\n\n\n\n  但怪就怪在侏儒老者實在是太熱情了，熱情得讓周澤有些覺得不真實。\n\n\n\n  難道近些年鬼裡面也開始掀起了學雷鋒做好事的風潮？\n\n\n\n  尤其是在老者拒絕和自己一起進入文廟後，周澤心裡也就提起了一些謹慎和小心，文廟不是很大，周澤從正門進去馬上就從後門出去繞了過來。\n\n\n\n  事實證明，周澤的選擇是正確的。\n\n\n\n  正如老者自己所說的那般，人心尚且隔肚皮，何況是鬼？\n\n\n\n  再者，讓周澤覺得有些荒謬的是，老者要報復自己的原因，竟然是因為那個……\n\n\n\n  自己救了一個病人，然後半個月後那個病人酒駕出車禍，連累了侏儒老者的孫子也在車禍中喪生。 \n\n\n\n  侏儒老者居然就遷怒了自己，認為如果當初自己不竭盡全力把那個病人的命給救回來，他孫子就不會死。\n\n\n\n  多麼清奇的腦迴路。\n\n\n\n  「我上輩子是個醫生，治病救人，是我的本分。」周澤微笑道，「我不認為自己做錯了什麼，你恨我，甚至恨到了這種地步，真的很沒道理。\n\n\n\n  或許，你只是覺得自己子孫後代斷絕了，自己白白陪侍了這泥胎塑像一甲子成了竹籃打水一場空，所以心裡有怨氣，想要找個人發泄出來，你就選擇了我？」\n\n\n\n  侏儒老者目光惡狠狠地盯著周澤，舔了舔嘴唇，聲音沙啞道：\n\n\n\n  「這就是你造的孽，該死的人，你為什麼要救起來！」\n\n\n\n  「在醫生眼裡，經過全力救治最後卻死去的人才是死人。你說的理由，我不承認，那種所謂的因果，更是狗屁不通。」\n\n\n\n  如果自己救了的人，他們犯了什麼事兒，因果都得算到自己頭上的話，那豈不是滑天下之大稽？\n\n\n\n  周澤記得有個英國老兵回憶錄上寫過，一戰時他親自俘虜過元首，本有機會睜一隻眼閉一隻眼把這個小矮個給槍斃了，但他沒那麼做，把他當作戰俘收攏了。\n\n\n\n  難道說日後第三帝國造的孽，都得算到那位英國老兵頭上？\n\n\n\n  周澤搖搖頭，和這傢伙道理是說不通了，下一刻，周澤十指指甲開始長長，黑色的氣息在指尖來回地環繞。 \n\n\n\n  「你這是要斷送了小的，連老的也一波帶走了麼？」侏儒老者氣急敗壞道，「這裡是文廟，是聖人安息之所，就是正牌鬼差也不敢放肆！」\n\n\n\n  「去你媽的。」\n\n\n\n  周澤直接走向了侏儒老者，\n\n\n\n  「老子只奉行一個道理，你剛剛想要弄死我，那我現在就要把你弄死！\n\n\n\n  上輩子的仇現在不方便報，眼下的仇如果還繼續揭過去，那周澤的脾氣未免也太好了！\n\n\n\n  活人暫且弄不得，鬼我還弄不得麼？\n\n\n\n  侏儒老者想要逃跑，但周澤的手直接抓住了他，同時將他狠狠地向後一拉！\n\n\n\n  「嘩啦！」\n\n\n\n  侏儒老者發出了一聲慘叫，身體更加透明。\n\n\n\n  「我不要去地獄，我不要去地獄，聖人，救我，救我！」\n\n\n\n  只可惜，\n\n\n\n  文廟裡的那些泥胎們依舊不動如山，如果他們真的有靈，又豈會讓侏儒老者家徹底斷了香火？\n\n\n\n  「誰說要把你送地獄了？」周澤笑了笑，「你以為你還有機會下地獄麼？」\n\n\n\n  說完，周澤直接向前刺過去，而後雙手撐開，心中積攢的戾氣在此時得到了爆發，侏儒老者的魂體直接分崩！\n\n\n\n  很簡單， \n\n\n\n  也很乾脆，\n\n\n\n  在收拾白鶯鶯之前，周澤不知道自己居然那麼能打；\n\n\n\n  而現在，他對自己的力量，尤其是對鬼物的能力，有著一種很充實的信心，雖然侏儒老者之所以能夠被輕易地解決掉也和他獻祭了一甲子陪侍功德魂體虛弱有很大的關係。\n\n\n\n  周澤不知道自己這麼做會不會有什麼後遺症，也不清楚自己剛剛連下地獄的機會都不給老頭符不符合小蘿莉的心中有逼數路線。\n\n\n\n  但如果老是學王八憋著，總覺得會把自己憋出問題來。\n\n\n\n  撣了撣肩膀上的灰塵，周澤拿出手機打了車。\n\n\n\n  上車後，司機很熱情，還主動給周澤分了一根煙，這讓周澤一時間有些「受寵若驚」，然後一邊抽菸一邊敷衍著和司機聊天時，\n\n\n\n  同時還偷偷地用燃燒的菸頭燙了一下車門，\n\n\n\n  車門沒被燒穿。\n\n\n\n  周澤心下安然，實在是被上次的紙車弄得有些疲憊了。\n\n\n\n  回到書店時已經是凌晨一點的光景，白鶯鶯坐在櫃檯後面看著電腦，有些生澀地操控著滑鼠。\n\n\n\n  周澤洗完澡換了一身衣服，準備上樓去休息時，發現白鶯鶯還坐在電腦後面一動不動。\n\n\n\n  她不上去自己怎麼睡覺？ \n\n\n\n  周澤走到白鶯鶯身後，發現這女屍竟然在玩單機遊戲搶灘登陸，打得很是激動。\n\n\n\n  「休息了。」周澤提醒道。\n\n\n\n  「哦。」白鶯鶯應了一聲，沒反應過來。\n\n\n\n  「我說，休息了。」周澤加重了聲音。\n\n\n\n  「哦，好！」白鶯鶯吐了吐舌頭，退出了遊戲，然後乖乖地上了樓。\n\n\n\n  二樓有兩張涼蓆，冰櫃暫時被挪到了角落裡，一人一張涼蓆躺下來，若是外人不小心進來上了二樓一看可能還以為是兩具放在草蓆上的屍體擺在那裡。\n\n\n\n  「老闆，你今天，累了吧？」白鶯鶯試探性地問道。\n\n\n\n  周澤沒回話，今晚的事兒，他不想多說，尤其自己多次過家門而不入的事兒，實在是沒什麼好吹噓的。\n\n\n\n  白鶯鶯見周澤不搭理自己，也就乖乖地閉上眼，自她身上不斷地散發出些許陰氣，讓周圍的溫度開始降低下來，也讓周澤的精神緩緩地放鬆。\n\n\n\n  唔，\n\n\n\n  睡覺了。\n\n\n\n  …………\n\n\n\n  「咕嘟…………咕嘟…………咕嘟…………」\n\n\n\n  像是開水沸騰的聲音，\n\n\n\n  周澤緩緩地睜開眼，發現自己正漂浮在一座水潭上，周圍熱浪滾滾，像是躺在浴室大池子裡一樣。 \n\n\n\n  遠處，有一條很寬敞卻也很泥濘的道路，有一群群白色的身影在沿著道路麻木的前行。\n\n\n\n  這裡，好熟悉。\n\n\n\n  周澤慢慢地坐起來，發現自己居然能坐在水面上，不會落下去。\n\n\n\n  「你也來了。」\n\n\n\n  一道男子的聲音在周澤身邊響起。\n\n\n\n  周澤猛地轉過頭，這才看見自己身側竟然站著一個穿著衛衣的年輕男子。\n\n\n\n  在衛衣男子身邊，有一道匍匐著的小巧身影，像是一隻貓。\n\n\n\n  男子戴著衛衣帽子，看不真切他的臉，但卻給周澤一種很熟悉的感覺。\n\n\n\n  只不過一時半會兒間，周澤想不到他是誰。\n\n\n\n  「別緊張，這裡是夢。」衛衣男子說道，「莊周舞蝶，我們作為死人，夢回地獄，也是很常見的一件事。」\n\n\n\n  「你是誰？」周澤問道。\n\n\n\n  「名字，在這裡有意義麼？」\n\n\n\n  男子反問道。\n\n\n\n  周澤一時語塞，的確，衛衣男子說得很清楚了，只有死人，才會夢回地獄，大家都已經死了，互報姓名，有什麼意義？\n\n\n\n  「他們要來抓我了。」衛衣男子說道。\n\n\n\n  「抓你？」周澤愣了一下，「抓你回地獄？」 \n\n\n\n  「呵……」衛衣男子笑了一聲。\n\n\n\n  緊接著，衛衣男子轉身準備離開，他身邊的那隻貓也慢慢地跟著他一起準備離開。\n\n\n\n  忽然間，周澤腦海中想到了什麼，當即道：「你是蓉城的那位？\n\n\n\n  老道開冥店的員工？」\n\n\n\n  衛衣男子停下了腳步，側過頭，看向周澤，「員工？」\n\n\n\n  「難道……不是麼？」\n\n\n\n  「是就是吧，你認得那個老道？」對方問道。\n\n\n\n  「算是吧。」周澤應了一聲。\n\n\n\n  「哦。」衛衣男子伸手指了指四周，周圍的白霧越來越濃重了，他開口道：「夢就快醒了。」\n\n\n\n  「這是我第一次做這種夢。」周澤說道。\n\n\n\n  「慢慢地就會習慣的。」衛衣男子似乎因為周澤和老道的關係，想多說幾句話，沒有再急著離開，他伸手指了指腳下的潭水，「這水潭，還記得麼？」\n\n\n\n  周澤看了看腳下，點了點頭。\n\n\n\n  「下去！」\n\n\n\n  衛衣男子走到周澤身邊，伸手按住了周澤的肩膀，然後兩個人一起沉入了潭水之中。\n\n\n\n  潭水清澈無比，在水中，能見度很高。\n\n\n\n  「有沒有發現，少了點什麼？」衛衣男子問道。 \n\n\n\n  「那個……那個女人……不見了。」\n\n\n\n  周澤環視潭水四周，發現了問題，那個當初自己第一次下地獄時碰見的無面女，不見了！\n\n\n\n  「哦。」衛衣男子應了一聲，緊接著，周澤就看見對方帽子下出現了兩道泛紅的光澤，這是對方的眼睛。\n\n\n\n  血紅色的眼眸！\n\n\n\n  一時間，一種磅礴的恐懼感開始襲來。\n\n\n\n  可怕的危機感忽然降臨，\n\n\n\n  周澤十指上的指甲也長出來，眼眸里也出現了黑色的光暈。\n\n\n\n  「你要做什麼？」周澤警備道。\n\n\n\n  衛衣男子笑了笑，伸手指了指他，「看看你自己。」\n\n\n\n  周澤低下頭，看向自己身下，\n\n\n\n  他愕然發現，\n\n\n\n  在自己身上竟然纏繞著一層又一層的黑色頭髮，這些頭髮究竟是什麼時候出現，他自己都沒能發覺。\n\n\n\n  「她已經來找你了。」衛衣男子提醒道。\n\n\n\n  …………\n\n\n\n  清晨的陽光，給人一種暖洋洋的感覺，許清朗泡了一杯茶，搬著藤椅坐在店鋪門口曬著太陽，這個時候還不會有人點外賣，他也樂得清閒。\n\n\n\n  一輛計程車在前面路口停了下來，從上面下來一個高中生模樣的女孩。 \n\n\n\n  女孩長得很清秀，臉上略帶些嬰兒肥，已經算是半出落的一個美人胚子了。\n\n\n\n  女孩兒走到了書屋門口，見書屋上鎖了，當即伸腳踹了一腳門：\n\n\n\n  「徐樂，你個王八蛋給我出來！」\n\n\n\n  但沒反應。\n\n\n\n  許清朗抿了口茶，道：「找他啥事兒？」\n\n\n\n  「我姐請病假在家一個多星期了，每天把自己關在屋子裡不出門，茶飯不思的，肯定是徐樂這王八蛋又惹我姐生氣了！\n\n\n\n  我今兒就喊他回去，讓他跟我姐道歉。」\n\n\n\n  「你姐？」許清朗琢磨出味道來了，「你姐昨晚應該很累吧。」\n\n\n\n  「你這話什麼意思？」小姨子皺眉問道。\n\n\n\n  「沒啥意思，大人感情的事兒，小孩子別亂插嘴，管好自己的小男朋友就可以了。」許清朗一副教育小女生的架勢。\n\n\n\n  「你這人好怪，別以為自己長得好看本小姐就不敢抽你！\n\n\n\n  我們家的事兒，輪的著你說話麼？」\n\n\n\n  小姨子舉起手，示意我真的要抽啦！\n\n\n\n  許清朗「嘁」了一聲，悠哉悠哉地道：「放心吧，你姐和你姐夫關係，好著呢。」\n\n\n\n  其實有句話許清朗沒說，在心底說的：那就是林醫生看起來挺傳統的一個女人，誰知道也能玩兒得那麼開放。 \n\n\n\n  克服心結迎接新生活的速度，如此之快。\n\n\n\n  嘖嘖，\n\n\n\n  果然，愛情的力量確實是強大的，也是不可理喻的，古往今來，多少痴男怨女化作飛蛾撲向這把叫做愛情的火焰之中。\n\n\n\n  「你這是什麼意思？」\n\n\n\n  「沒什麼意思，算了，給點小建議吧，告訴你姐，她那輛卡宴空間比那輛白色瑪莎拉蒂更大一些，人在裡面做事兒時更舒服。」\n\n\n\n  「瑪莎拉蒂？」小姨子疑惑道。\n\n\n\n  「是啊，你姐的新車不是麼？」\n\n\n\n  「我姐從一個多禮拜前就沒再出門，哪裡來的新車，還瑪莎拉蒂。」\n\n\n\n  小姨子莫名其妙地看著許清朗，然後像是想到了什麼，猛地又踹了書店門一腳：\n\n\n\n  「好啊，徐樂，我懂了！\n\n\n\n  你吃我家的，\n\n\n\n  用我家的，\n\n\n\n  這開書店的錢也是我姐出的，\n\n\n\n  現在翅膀硬了，又傍上別的富婆了是吧，\n\n\n\n  那個富婆還開著瑪莎拉蒂來約你是吧！\n\n\n\n  徐樂，你這叫吃裡爬外，沒良心！」\n\n\n\n  「啪！」\n\n\n\n  一聲脆響傳來， \n\n\n\n  小姨子嚇了一跳，\n\n\n\n  扭過頭看向身邊躺在藤椅上的許清朗，\n\n\n\n  剛剛是許清朗手中的水杯摔落下去的聲響。\n\n\n\n  許清朗張開嘴，一臉地驚恐，\n\n\n\n  然後猛地跳下了藤椅，\n\n\n\n  對著書屋的門就是一陣亂踹：\n\n\n\n  「天殺的，\n\n\n\n  你他娘的快醒醒啊，\n\n\n\n  還睡你麻臭嗨啊，\n\n\n\n  你那晚真的搞鬼啦！」",
