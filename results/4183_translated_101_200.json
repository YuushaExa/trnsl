    "content": "The most frightening thing in life is to accept your fate.\n\n  Because accepting your fate means you stop struggling, and your life will proceed along its current, predetermined path, without too many waves or surprises.\n\n  You can see what you’ll be like in five years; you can guess what you’ll be doing in ten.\n\n  But, what life needs most is, in fact, also to accept your fate.\n\n  To be down-to-earth, safe, and sound, no longer entertaining miscellaneous thoughts, just living your own life. Tranquility is the ultimate reward of a simple, ordinary life.\n\n  Whether you accept your fate or not is purely a matter of personal choice.\n\n  Zhou Ze sat on the bookstore sofa, having spaced out for the entire afternoon. It felt as if he had thought about many things, and yet also as if he hadn't thought about anything at all.\n\n  In the glass, his blurry reflection stared back. Unconsciously, he no longer found it awkward to look in the mirror.\n\n  Human adaptability is truly powerful. Even if it’s your skin, even if it’s the trajectory of your life, once you get used to it, it no longer feels like a big deal.\n\n  This was his bookstore. This was his life from now on.\n\n  He reached out and touched the fresh buzz cut that Bai Yingying had just given him.\n\n  It was neat, clean.\n\n  Zhou Ze saw Tang Shi standing at the entrance. She had been standing there for three hours, from noon until the afternoon, barely moving.\n\n  Zhou Ze didn't go ask her what she was doing. Everyone needs moments to be alone and zone out, and at times like these, they don't need comfort from others.\n\n  He took out his phone and logged into his WeChat. No new messages, and no replies.\n\n  Obsessed with the self from his past life, obsessed with this life's Xu Le,\n\n  Zhou Ze was truly getting weary.\n\n  In truth, it might be better to just live this life, as this new self, in a down-to-earth way.\n\n  Whether he could let it go or not, it didn't really matter.\n\n  After all, what's past is inescapable,\n\n  and what's future has yet to come.\n\n  He took out his small booklet, leafing through it, feeling its texture.\n\n  Zhou Ze felt that the rest of his life would be bound to it. At the very least, they would be bound together for a long, long time.\n\n  It seemed that female ghost messenger had a booklet too, but Zhou Ze had asked, and Bai Yingying said they hadn't found it. Perhaps that booklet had already scattered to the winds. After all, at that time, the booklet was already on the verge of collapsing. With the demise of the female ghost messenger, its final reason for existence would have also vanished.\n\n  Tang Shi finally moved. She slowly squatted down, her hands on her knees. Perhaps her legs had gone numb or were cramping from standing for so long.\n\n  Zhou Ze smiled.\n\n  Then Tang Shi turned her head. Seeing Zhou Ze gloating through the glass, a smile also appeared at the corners of her mouth, but this smile seemed somewhat reserved.\n\n  It was as if, in that moment, she had become a different person.\n\n  The her from before wasn't this serious.\n\n  The little monkey hopped in front of Zhou Ze, brandishing a toy hammer. Zhou Ze reached out and patted it on the head.\n\n  All this time, Zhou Ze had never understood what the deal was with the mud the little monkey brought back, but its effects seemed to be quite good. He thought that if the bookstore didn't make money in the future and he couldn't get by, he could always open an apothecary.\n\n  The \"Ancestral Five Finger Mountain Black Jade Bone-Mending Ointment Set\"¹?\n\n  Not a bad idea.\n\n  \"Squeak squeak squeak squeak...\"\n\n  The little monkey held a cell phone, waving it at Zhou Ze.\n\n  The monkey's phone had been bought by the old Taoist, which was enough to show how much the old Taoist doted on the monkey.\n\n  \"What is it?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n  The monkey pointed at the speakers on the bookstore wall, then pointed at the phone.\n\n  \"Connect to the Bluetooth speaker?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n  The monkey looked baffled.\n\n  But that seemed to be it, so it nodded anyway.\n\n  Taking the monkey's phone, Zhou Ze helped it connect to the Bluetooth. The monkey tested it, playing a song from *Monkey King: Hero is Back*, and sound immediately came from the speakers.\n\n  The monkey was very happy.\n\n  Next, the background music in the bookstore was changed again and again by the monkey. Fortunately, there were no customers in the store at the moment, so Zhou Ze let the monkey play.\n\n  Actually, the background music in many large shopping malls is chosen with great care.\n\n  For example, if the music at the beginning is Li Yugang's *Along the River During the Qingming Festival*, and a mall security guard or some internal staff sees a familiar-faced habitual thief walk in, they will immediately notify the control room, and the people there will promptly change the background music.\n\n  The next song might be Michael Jackson's *Beat It*, or perhaps *You're So Vicious*. Then, the shopkeepers will remind the customers around them that a thief has arrived and to be careful.\n\n  Malls everywhere basically have this kind of unspoken rule. Sometimes, even on a bus, if the driver sees a familiar habitual thief get on, he will press a button to send a notification.\n\n  So, if you're on a bus and hear \"Passengers, please take care of your personal belongings...\" don't ever treat it as a perfunctory, meaningless recording.\n\n  And these thieves,\n\n  have basically become beings who come with their own BGM.\n\n  When they walk in,\n\n  their unique BGM begins to play.\n\n  On the bookstore's counter, a hanging television was playing *Shaolin Soccer*.\n\n  It was also at this moment that Zhou Ze realized he hadn't seen the old Taoist all afternoon. But soon, three \"drip\" sounds came from inside.\n\n  The little monkey understood. It changed the music, and soon, the Bluetooth speaker began to play:\n\n  \"The waves rush... the waves flow... the river's waters surge on, forever without rest...\"\n\n  Accompanied by the theme song from *The Bund*, the old Taoist, dressed in a brand-new Taoist robe that was a complete change from his previous dejected and sloppy image, walked out slowly from the stairwell.\n\n  There must have been an electric fan placed in the hallway behind him, blowing his long robes about. Say what you will, he really did have the air of a celestial being.\n\n  Holding a peach-wood sword,\n\n  he performed a flourish,\n\n  and with feet treading the Seven Stars pattern, the old Taoist looked majestic and awe-inspiring!\n\n  Zhou Ze reached up and rubbed his chin. It was a good thing it was the old Taoist. If any other Taoist or monk dared to show off like this in a bookstore run by a ghost, they would have been dead countless times over by now.\n\n  The little monkey held up the phone, the camera aimed at the old Taoist, finding the right angle. Zhou Ze glanced over and saw that the little monkey was live-streaming for the old Taoist.\n\n  Alright then,\n\n  this monkey was truly clever.\n\n  A little too clever.\n\n  On the live-stream screen, a barrage of bullet comments scrolled by:\n\n  \"First floor is mine. Can I eat some shit without anyone seeing?\"\n\n  \"Holy shit, old Taoist, good fucking afternoon to you!\"\n\n  \"Old Taoist, it's been almost half a year. You're finally back on stream!\"\n\n  \"Taoist Master, I missed you so much! You've been gone for so long, I really, really missed you!\"\n\n  \"Naughty Taoist Master, hiding for so long without coming out. *whimper whimper*, gonna tweak your little pipe, *whimper whimper*.²\"\n\n  \"Are you still selling hell money? It's been out of stock!\"\n\n  \"Did you guys see that? On the left side of the screen, there's a tuft of yellow fur. What the hell is that? Is it a monkey?\"\n\n  \"Hahaha, are you trying to say a monkey is filming for him? The guy above must be an idiot, right?\"\n\n  _**Footnotes:**_\n¹ A joke name combining several famous elements from Chinese culture: Five Finger Mountain (where the Monkey King was imprisoned), and Black Jade Bone-Mending Ointment (a famous fictional panacea from the wuxia novels of Jin Yong).\n² \"嚶嚶嚶\" (*yīng yīng yīng*) is an onomatopoeia for whimpering, often used online in a cutesy or mock-cutesy way, similar to \"uwu\". \"擼你小管管\" (*lū nǐ xiǎo guǎn guǎn*) is a crude, flirtatious, and weird piece of internet slang, literally meaning \"rub/stroke your little pipe/tube\".

    "content": "April 1, 2018,\n\n\n\n Zero 20:00\n\n\n\nRongcheng,\n\n\n\nLight rain,\n\n\n\nMicro-style Level 3\n\n\n\nThe underworld shop in the old street has been closed for a long time. Even if it is a neighborhood neighborhood, it is not clear when this underworld shop was opened.\n\n\n\nBecause it is not like the breakfast shop on the street, many people go to every day, nor are they like clothing stores. You can go shopping at home after get off work, and you can try clothes if you don’t buy them.\n\n\n\nMost people, Ning hoped that this person would not go to the underworld shop to buy things\n\n\n\nNaturally, in life, I deliberately ignored this underworld shop\n\n\n\n  Of course,\n\n\n\nWhen did it close?\n\n\n\nOf course, not many people care, but occasionally I found that the store was actually in the middle of the day, which was a little surprised\n\n\n\nThere is a fat man who would park at the door every few days with the police car, look at the shop closed, draw a few smokes, and then leave.\n\n\n\nThe young ladies in the old street who run the oldest and most passionate business are really unbearable for this. Every time I am afraid to send the guests who just asked to drink water in my house.\n\n\n\n  Continuous expenses,\n\n\n\nDon't dare to ask for it\n\n\n\nThe massage parlor next to the underworld shop has been closed for a long time. He said that the boss entered a murder case a few years ago. Although he was innocent later, there were too many things at home, and she had not returned to Chengdu for a long time.\n\n\n\nOccasionally, an old customer came over and was thinking about the boss's handwriting. He didn't know that if he often asked her for massage, it would be comfortable, but it was probably getting closer to the days when he walked into the next door to choose a clothes dress.\n\n\n\nLife is still such a life,\n\n\n\nThe teahouse in the streets and alleys of Rongcheng is full of relaxed and comfortable writing\n\n\n\nThis is a leisurely city, and it is also a city to enjoy. When the cold winter just goes and the summer is not coming, the whole city is immersed in its own snoring.\n\n\n\n  Satisfaction,\n\n\n\nComfortable,\n\n\n\nOccasionally turn around,\n\n\n\nWrap a thin blanket,\n\n\n\n  Um,\n\n\n\nKeep sleeping\n\n\n\nThere are naturally no people in the old street in the early morning. Apart from a few midnight snacks, I am still waiting for not many businesses.\n\n\n\nThat dark shop,\n\n\n\n  Lightning\n\n\n\nThe light is very dark, and you can only see it, and ordinary people can't even see it.\n\n\n\nIn the underworld shop, there are two rows of chairs, two chairs in the center, one is a long man sitting, and the other is a little girl sitting, pink and cute, a little girl\n\n\n\nThe two sides of the lower head,\n\n\n\nSome people are wearing croaker clothes and long sleeves;\n\n\n\nSome people wear high hats and stagger;\n\n\n\nSome people's eyes are zig-shaped and they are turning at the same time;\n\n\n\nSome people are wearing big belly, so fat\n\n\n\nThe rouge smell on their faces is much heavier, and it even looks a bit unrealWhether they are laughing, pursing their ears, or urging, they always give people a sense of depression, just like the 108 Luohan in the temple, even if their image is so cute,\n\n\n\nAs an adult, he dare not really laugh at them\n\n\n\nIt seems that there are two eyes staring at you in the dark,\n\n\n\nIf you look carefully, you can find that the style of clothing that helps people is actually very similar to those papermen placed in a corner of the Netherworld Shop, as if the clothes that were really taken off the papermen and put on themselves.\n\n\n\nVery funny,\n\n\n\nVery ridiculous\n\n\n\nBut it really feels like this\n\n\n\nEveryone's lips were wearing strange Yin Hong, as if she was deliberately smearing her rouge on her lips, which was very annoying and dazzling.\n\n\n\nJa Baoyu said that he likes to eat the rouge on his sister's mouth the most, but if he sees the rouge here, he will probably be shocked.\n\n\n\nIn the air,\n\n\n\nThe scent of dust filled with the\n\n\n\nAmong the crowd, there is a small brazier with charcoal fires placed inside. At the same time, a slit on the shelf will fly over automatically and fall into the charcoal fire to burn.\n\n\n\nAt the door, there is a woman, a long-lived woman\n\n\n\nShe lowered her head slightly, covering her face with long hair\n\n\n\n  Grave figure, stylish body,\n\n\n\n A ordinary person sees her and probably expects her to spread her hair and see her true face. Everyone has curiosity and pursuit of beauty.\n\n\n\nHowever, everyone here didn't have the mind because they knew this woman... had no face\n\n\n\n\"Not yet\"\n\n\n\nThe long man sitting next to Xiao Luli said in a deep voice, slightly browsing\n\n\n\n\"Let everyone wait a little longer\"\n\n\n\nXiao Luli said\n\n\n\nThe long man must light the head, and then said, \"Protect the energy and extend the time we stay in the sun as much as possible.\"\n\n\n\nA black talisman flew out of the long man's cuffs and fell around\n\n\n\nEveryone here reached out to take a talisman paper and posted it on their foreheads. Even the man himself posted a talisman to himself.\n\n\n\n  A moment,\n\n\n\nThe entire store was silent, and the people who posted talismans on the top were no longer moved, as if they had been imposed on the immobilization method.\n\n\n\nThis makes them look like they are even different from the paper people already in the Netherworld Shop.\n\n\n\nXiao Luoli stood up, holding a talisman in her hand, and walked to the faceless woman.\n\n\n\nThe faceless woman raised her head quietly,\n\n\n\n\"My clone is destroyed\"\n\n\n\n\"It's just a clone.\" Xiao Luoli didn't think it was\n\n\n\n\"I stayed to monitor him,\" reminded the faceless woman\n\n\n\n\"You said, after I go back, he will still be in his place.\"\n\n\n\nXiao Luoli smiled slightly,\n\n\n\n\"He just gave me a place to serve in the middle of the day and helped me take charge of the keys of the ground. A city can't tolerate the third ghost\"\n\n\n\n\"Then what should I do?\"\n\n\n\nThe faceless girl asked,\n\n\n\n\"You can't attract him without me.\"\n\n\n\n\"The ghost messenger in Tongcheng plus I already have two, one of them has collapsed. This is the place I reserved for you.\" Xiao Luoli reached out and grabbed the stern woman's sternness, \"When the matter here is over, I will help you arrange an identity to stay in the sun.\"\n\n\n\nThe faceless woman lowered her head again\n\n\n\n\"I'm very curious about one thing, why are you so obsessed with that guy. He is just another toy created by Tongcheng. Oh no, it's just a gift.\"\n\n\n\n  \"gift\"\n\n\n\nThe faceless girl hid under the long hair and smiled twice.\n\n\n\n\"In my opinion, this gift is heavier than the one you are waiting for.\"\n\n\n\nXiao Luoli narrowed her eyes slightly. She could hear something in the faceless girl. This woman born on the road of Huangquan and in the pond of resentment has existed for a long time, so she can naturally know more unknown things.\n\n\n\n\"Oh, it seems that I have to ask him well after I go back.\"\n\n\n\nThe hair on the faceless woman suddenly scattered at this time, and the faceless face began to condense a girl's face. Her expression was very painful, as if she was tying.\n\n\n\n\"She, you can't control it yet.\" Xiao Luoli was a little surprised\n\n\n\n\"It's so stingy,\" the faceless woman replied, \"I have a certain will, it's worse than you, no worse.\"\n\n\n\nXiao Luoli smiled slightly, reached out and wiped the talisman in her hand into the charcoal fire.\n\n\n\n\"Finally...it's just a thrust without intention.\"\n\n\n\nThe fire is faint,\n\n\n\nThe night is quiet,\n\n\n\nA string of Mars burst out from the charcoal brazier:\n\n\n\n\"Baji\"\n\n\n\n …………………\n\n\n\n\"Baji\"\n\n\n\n\"Baji\"\n\n\n\n\"Baji\"\n\n\n\nThe old street in the light rain has some striking feelings. It is not so smooth on the road, and you can see the small water pits everywhere.\n\n\n\nA man in a robe walked on this slightly muddy path.\n\n\n\nHis head was hidden under the wardrobe, and his figure seemed to be completely integrated with the night behind him.\n\n\n\n  \"Meow\"\n\n\n\nBy his side,\n\n\n\nThere was a cat with white body, following him step by step with elegant steps\n\n\n\nOne person, one cat,\n\n\n\nUnder the dim road lights, two long shadows were drawn out\n\n\n\nThere are occasional voices coming from all around.\n\n\n\nThe empty and quiet place is spiraling above the old street, and it will not be dispersed for a long time\n\n\n\nThe man's figure is not burly, but it gives people a feeling of being soaring. He is like a soundless knife. As long as he is unsheathed, he can break the dark side of the curtain.\n\n\n\nIn front, there is a late-night snack, and the owner is a couple\n\n\n\nThe business tonight was not good. My husband sat next to him and kept coughing, obviously he had a cold.The man walked to the seat.\n\n\n\nThe boss raised his head, saw the man, smiled and said:\n\n\n\n\"I haven't seen it for a long time.\"\n\n\n\n\"Yes\" the man answered\n\n\n\n\"Meow\" white cat also responded to a sound\n\n\n\nThe boss started making soup and fish slimming soup. She knew he only ate this one.\n\n\n\nIn the middle of the night, drinking a bowl of tender fish soup is a pleasure. It is better to be calm during the ages.\n\n\n\nThe boss was still coughing there. When he saw the customer eating, he was browsing. He thought he was giving up on him, so he could only smile apologetically and go over.\n\n\n\nThe man was stunned. He knew that the boss would be wrong. He always had this expression when eating.\n\n\n\nBut tonight, it was a little cold.\n\n\n\nOtherwise, he can save money on eating, and ignore it if he can ignore it.\n\n\n\nPut down the bowls and chopsticks and gave money. The man turned around and walked deeper into the old street. The white cat was still following him, never leaving.\n\n\n\nNo matter how deep the night is,\n\n\n\nPeople can always find a place to stay in their homes\n\n\n\nThe man walked to the entrance of the Netherworld Shop and was in full force\n\n\n\nThe white cat was sent to the stage and found a familiar position.\n\n\n\n  Yes,\n\n\n\nFamiliar location\n\n\n\nWhen did you?\n\n\n\nWhat he likes to do most is to move out a chair, sit on the stage, and silence the sun without moving.\n\n\n\nThe owner of the massage parlor next door would also talk about him as an old man.\n\n\n\n  The eyes were slightly on the side, and she hadn't come back yet\n\n\n\nSome people will never come back when they leave, but some people will still look at themselves after they leave.\n\n\n\nHe thought he had always been alone.\n\n\n\nEven if he suddenly disappears in this world, no one will notice that people who like to be alone always like to dye themselves lonely and get more sense of security.\n\n\n\nIt is precisely because someone is looking at him,\n\n\n\nIt is precisely because someone cares about themselves,\n\n\n\nThat's why he came back,\n\n\n\nHe needs an explanation.\n\n\n\nGive an explanation to those who care about themselves,\n\n\n\nAt the same time, give yourself an explanation\n\n\n\nGoing to the stage,\n\n\n\nBefore coming to the door,\n\n\n\nHe didn't knock on the door.\n\n\n\nThis is his home, he has the key\n\n\n\nThe keyhole is inserted into the door lock.\n\n\n\nThe faceless girl behind the door suddenly flew up.\n\n\n\nXiao Luoli stood up straight like a little adult.\n\n\n\nThe talisman on the head of the two rows of chairs disappeared instantly,\n\n\n\nEveryone opened their eyes in a row.\n\n\n\nLooking towards the door\n\n\n\n\"Squeak...\"\n\n\n\nThe door was pushed open from outside\n\n\n\nXiao Luoli looked at the person outside the door and smiled:\n\n\n\n\"I finally caught you\"\n\n\n\nThe man slammed his head slightly and signaled that the other party had a wrong statement.\n\n\n\n  The right way to deal with it:\n\n\n\n  \"No,\n\n\n\nIt's me,\n\n\n\nCome back”",

Sweat was already trickling down his temples, his clothes practically half-soaked.\n\n  When he had first appeared, he still possessed the ethereal, immortal-like bearing of a celestial sage. Every movement carried a convincing air of transcendence.\n\n  But right now, he was more like an elderly rock-and-roll fanatic. He had just sung more than a dozen songs in a row, all of them the kind you had to belt out, screaming until his voice was shredded, screaming as if he might cough up blood at any moment.\n\n  \"Taoist Master, we're all friends here, we're all friends! Stop singing!\"\n\n  \"Taoist Master, my mom asked me why I'm watching the stream on my knees.

Do that trick again!\"\n\n  \"Upstairs +1!\"\n\n  \"Sword dance, fist forms!\"\n\n  \"Shout-rapping!\"\n\n  \"Anything but singing...\n\n  ...\"\n\n  \"Alright, then I'll sing another song for everyone!\"\n\n  The old Taoist cleared his throat, looking ready to continue singing.\n\n  \"...\" - Viewer No. 1.\n\n  \"...\" - Viewer No. 2.\n\n  \"...\" - Viewer No. 3.\n\n  The old Taoist directly selected the song.\n\n  It was Xiao Yiqing's \"Burial Song.\"\n\n  \"Sleep now, sleep now,\n\n  Please wander no more!\n\n  Sleep now, sleep now,\n\n  Forget all your sorrow...\"\n\n  \"Do you think he's gone mad?\"\n\n  Tang Shi, who was standing beside Zhou Ze, suddenly spoke.\n\n  Zhou Ze shook his head and said calmly, \"It's because the person you've been waiting for has returned today, so you're all happy.\"\n\n  \"Actually, he's just feeling wretched inside,\" Tang Shi said, her expression gradually turning cold. \"Did you know, the old Taoist gave that monkey a name.\"\n\n  \"Oh? What is it?\"\n\n  \"Xiaoqiang.\"\n\n  Zhou Ze wouldn't spoil the mood by pointing out how much the name resembled that of a certain small crawling insect.\n\n  \"Xiaoqiang was the old Taoist's former roommate. They met in Rongcheng.\"\n\n  \"Where is he now?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n  \"Dead.\"\n\n  Zhou Ze pressed his lips together.\n\n  \"He died helping us escape.\"\n\n  At this, Tang Shi paused, then continued:\n\n  \"So, this isn't just happiness at welcoming him back.\n\n  Actually,\n\n  This is revenge.\n\n  Today,\n\n  Is not a day to celebrate an old friend's return.\n\n  It's a day of vengeance.\n\n  A debt of blood,\n\n  Must be paid in blood.\"\n\n  With a flick of her finger, the red ink on the bar counter splattered out, wrapping around her wrist like a blood-red bracelet, alluring and unsettling.\n\n  \"I don't understand.\" Zhou Ze shrugged. \"Since you all already escaped, and someone even sacrificed themself for it, why would he voluntarily go back?\"\n\n  \"Before I answer that, can I ask you a question first?\"\n\n  \"Go ahead.\"\n\n  \"That temple spirit last time, and that problematic senior ghost emissary from Tongcheng a while back... why weren't they able to kill you?\"\n\n  Zhou Ze didn't know how to answer.\n\n  He couldn't possibly say that he wasn't really sure himself. It was like getting drunk, taking a nap, and waking up to find...\n\n  Oh,\n\n  The person who wanted to kill me,\n\n  Is dead.\n\n  Hahahaha,\n\n  That idiot actually died just like that,\n\n  And I don't remember a thing,\n\n  Hahahaha!\n\n  Tang Shi answered for him:\n\n  \"Because you're not the only one,\n\n  Who can improve.\"\n\n  \"That confident, are you? In that case, I really should raise my expectations.\"\n\n  Zhou Ze didn't hope the Little Loli would return unscathed.\n\n  He wouldn't be fooled by her appearance; he knew that if the Little Loli came back unharmed, and had even completed her mission, then it would be her turn to settle scores with him.\n\n  The identification booklet in his hand, the key to the Gates of Hell that he now controlled but which originally belonged to the Little Loli—he would probably be forced to hand them all over.\n\n  The matter of the driver's death was still unresolved, but it at least proved that the Little Loli was no kind soul.\n\n  All anyone wanted was their own interests. The living bustled about all day for their interests, and in truth, it was the same even after death.\n\n  Before Lady Bai descended into Hell, her meritorious deeds complete, she had specifically instructed him to dispose of her corpse, which was Bai Yingying. She was worried her body, left in the mortal world, might do something uncontrollable and affect her in Hell, so she told Zhou Ze to burn Bai Yingying with bamboo during the next Winter Clothes Festival.\n\n  In countless myths and legends, even the deities in the heavens had their own selfish schemes and petty calculations, so one couldn't expect that bunch of ghost emissaries to be devoted to serving the country and its people.\n\n  Tang Shi flicked her wrist, and the red ink spattered onto the floor, creating the terrifying effect of flowing blood. Under Tang Shi's deliberate control, it became extremely grim and frightening, even appearing to drip.\n\n  \"One more thing. Why didn't you go back?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n  Revenge, after all, was just a brawl.\n\n  You call your people, I call mine, we pick a spot, and we throw down.\n\n  The Little Loli's side had called up quite a few ghost emissaries and even brought the Faceless Woman, but on this side, it seemed to be just that one guy alone.\n\n  \"I asked him if he needed me to go back. My injuries are almost healed. He said no.\"\n\n  \"Was he just trying to comfort you and keep you out of danger, or is he that confident?\"\n\n  Tang Shi smiled.\n\n  A smile like a blossoming flower.\n\n  Zhou Ze had never seen Tang Shi look like this.\n\n  She bent over,\n\n  Clutching her stomach,\n\n  Seemingly laughing so hard it hurt. Crystalline tears slowly trickled from the corners of her eyes.\n\n  She choked out:\n\n  \"He said, 'You think plane tickets are free?'\"\n\n  ...\n\n  Inside the spirit money shop,\n\n  Two rows of ghost emissaries stood. The moment they fully awakened, the shop was instantly coated in frost, forming crystalline patterns of ice.\n\n  It was as if this place had become an ice chamber.\n\n  The immense yin energy was so dense it felt like it could condense and drip out, suffocatingly so.\n\n  If a living person were to wander in here, they would probably go home and fall gravely ill.\n\n  Ghost emissaries,\n\n  Were ghosts, after all.\n\n  Liang Chuan frowned.\n\n  He was a little unhappy.\n\n  Because his home had been dirtied. The frost would eventually melt into water, a real pity for the fine rosewood furniture in the shop.\n\n  What was most unpleasant was that,\n\n  The ones who had dirtied his home,\n\n  Were all uninvited, not guests he had willingly asked to come.\n\n  \"We've been looking for you for a long time.\"\n\n  The long-bearded man, who had previously been sitting beside the Little Loli, now stood up and walked over.\n\n  The situation was decided.\n\n  This capture operation, which had taken a long time and mobilized ghost emissaries from all over, was finally coming to an end.\n\n  A stowaway who had returned to the mortal realm from Hell without authorization was a heretic that needed to be struck down to begin with. What's more, this guy had actually been killing people in the mortal world—acting as a Judge of the Underworld without the title.\n\n  Utterly arrogant.\n\n  He was courting death!\n\n  The Faceless Woman stood at Liang Chuan's side, watching him. She remembered how many times she had almost caught him and prevented him from leaving Hell, but he had managed to escape every time.\n\n  This time,\n\n  She would no longer be the one left resentful and furious.\n\n  Liang Chuan's gaze swept over the crowd, his face expressionless. Behind him, the white cat swayed its tail languidly, even occasionally licking its paws to groom its fur.\n\n  \"I can give you a choice.\"\n\n  The Little Loli took a step forward, standing before Liang Chuan.\n\n  \"Obediently let your soul leave this body and allow us to take it directly back to Hell. You secretly escaped from there in the first place. Returning is your proper path now.\"\n\n  The long-bearded man added gravely, \"If you force us to act, you should know that you have absolutely no chance of escape this time. If your soul returns, at most you'll suffer some more punishment and be reborn into the animal realm. That's better than being utterly annihilated.\"\n\n  \"Oh.\"\n\n  Liang Chuan responded with a single syllable.\n\n  He knew.\n\n  This bunch of ghost emissaries wanted to save themselves the trouble, to subdue their enemy without a fight. It was already difficult for them to operate in the mortal world unless they were willing to possess a body, but that came with great risks and uncertainty. That was why they kept a low profile in the mortal world and were reluctant to use too much force.\n\n  Then, Liang Chuan looked at the Faceless Woman beside him and said:\n\n  \"You captured her?\"\n\n  The Faceless Woman lifted her head. Her hair parted, and on her smooth face, the features of a woman began to appear. She was in great pain, struggling, roaring, and bellowing.\n\n  She was dead.\n\n  Her soul had been taken by the Faceless Woman.\n\n  Liang Chuan licked his lips,\n\n  And slowly lowered his head.\n\n  \"That's the second one.\"\n\n  They had used his friends' lives to force him to show himself.\n\n  And they,\n\n  Had succeeded.\n\n  \"Killing the living damages our yin-virtue. We didn't want to do it either. This is your own fault for not knowing what's good for you.\"\n\n  The Little Loli continued:\n\n  \"If you had just been obedient and not resisted in the first place, those two wouldn't have had to die. Also, we know you have several other people you're close to.\"\n\n  \"Is this... another threat?\"\n\n  Liang Chuan asked, his head still bowed.\n\n  \"I am merely stating a fact. We are ghost emissaries, guardians of the order between the worlds of yin and yang. You cannot defy us.\"\n\n  \"Heh heh...\"\n\n  Liang Chuan slowly raised his head.\n\n  His eyes,\n\n  Were crimson!\n\n  The Little Loli's heart suddenly lurched. She instinctively braced herself for the young man in front of her to lash out.\n\n  However,\n\n  Her body suddenly trembled.\n\n  A hand of white bone had, at that very moment, pierced through her spirit body. She froze in place, then turned her head in disbelief to look behind her.\n\n  The long-bearded man...\n\n  His eyes were crimson,\n\n  His face contorted in a struggle.\n\n  He was clearly being controlled!\n\n  But,\n\n  How was that possible!\n\n  In a single move,\n\n  He had directly controlled the most senior ghost emissary present!\n\n  Why was this happening?\n\n  Why?\n\n  Liang Chuan lifted his head,\n\n  _**_Opened his mouth,\n\n  Tilted his neck slightly,\n\n  And his ten fingers began to dance in the empty air before him, as if playing a piano:\n\n  \"Shhh,\n\n  This piece,\n\n  Can you hear it?\n\n  This is,\n\n  The 'Burial Song' I am playing for you.\"\n\n***\n\n**Footnotes:**\n¹ \"Shotacon\" is slang for attraction to young boys.

    "content": "There were no lengthy opening remarks,\n\nno tedious self-introductions,\n\nand certainly no moronic back-and-forth of announcing attack names.\n\nThis slaughter, taking place in a Netherworld Shop, a slaughter not meant for the living,\n\nkicked off its prelude in just such an abrupt manner.\n\nThe \"Dirge,\"\n\nfor whom does it toll?\n\nThe roles of hunter and prey wavered. The party that had been so confident, so sure of their plan, was suddenly seized by an illusion: that they might not be the ones left standing at the end.\n\nA hand of white bone, wreathed in cold flames, had punched through the little loli's soul, leaving behind a large, burning hole. The little loli could only retreat, her face grim as she stared at the wound in her soul.\n\nThey had wanted to conserve some energy, knowing that the man before them, the one who had escaped their last encirclement, was no easy foe.\n\nBut they had been equally convinced that for this second encirclement, with so many Underworld Emissaries gathered and their target forced to walk right into their trap, victory was already in their grasp.\n\nExcept,\n\nthis current situation,\n\ndid this look like victory was in their grasp?\n\nA twisting, stabbing pain from the depths of her soul assaulted the little loli relentlessly.\n\nShe dared not move recklessly. This ball of flame came from the long-bearded man; it was his signature technique. And she had been caught completely off guard, utterly without defense.\n\nShe even feared that,\n\nif she couldn't suppress this injury, she might just dissipate into nothingness.\n\nA soul, which seems more ethereal and untraceable than a body, free from the worries of aging, sickness, and death, is in fact, at least in this mortal realm, far too fragile.\n\nAnd her physical body, she hadn't brought it with her. Now, she was beginning to regret that.\n\nIf her host body were here right now, she wouldn't be in such a passive position.\n\n\"Ugh...\"\n\nHer mouth opened.\n\nThe little loli's tongue began to extend, stretching longer and longer, attempting to extinguish the flames still flickering on her abdomen.\n\nThe tongue was constantly melting away,\n\nbut it was also constantly growing longer.\n\nThis was a method of healing using her own vital energy. Normally, she would never be so willing to expend it, but right now, she had no other choice.\n\nBecause,\n\nthe trepidation deep in her heart,\n\nwas growing ever clearer!\n\nFor the first time,\n\nshe began to wonder,\n\ntonight,\n\nwould she be able to leave this place alive?\n\nThe long-bearded man, meanwhile, could be seen struggling with all his might. He was the most senior Underworld Emissary present, with a decent chance of being promoted to Head Constable.\n\nOne must understand, in the mortal realm, the Judges of the Underworld almost never manifested, and the Head Constables mostly operated in the Netherworld Bureau. The ones who could move most freely between the human world and Hell were the Underworld Emissaries.\n\nBut a veteran Emissary just like that, in the short time after that person opened the door,\n\nhad been controlled, turned into a puppet!\n\nIf time were turned back half an hour,\n\nwho among them would have ever imagined this scene?\n\nHe resisted, he struggled, for his dignity, and for his very existence.\n\nBut in the next moment, when Liang Chuan spoke, he actually spoke along with him.\n\nPerfectly synchronized,\n\nin eerie unison:\n\n\"This dirge.\"\n\n\"This dirge.\"\n\n\"Is played for all of you.\"\n\n\"Is played for all of you.\"\n\n\"Listen, and be on your way.\"\n\n\"Listen, and be on your way.\"\n\nThe long-bearded man stretched out his withered arms. Both limbs were little more than bone wrapped in a thin layer of skin. At the palms, it was stark white bone, without even that decorative layer of skin.\n\nFor so many years,\n\ncountless souls had been captured by his hands, sent to Hell, sent into the cycle of reincarnation, converted into his own merits and achievements. And now, he was like a string puppet, manipulated by another,\n\nmanipulated by his original prey.\n\n*You take me for your prey?*\n\n*Fine.*\n\n*Then I'll be your master.*\n\nThe Faceless Woman let out a piercing shriek, her long hair flying out to envelop Liang Chuan. She knew that if she couldn't succeed tonight, she would be left with nothing.\n\nLeaving Hell, leaving that pool of water, even with the aid of the Underworld Emissaries, had been a huge drain on her. If she returned with nothing to show for it, she wouldn't even be able to leave Hell next time.\n\nThat pool of water would become her eternal prison. She would even have to worry if her weakened self would be influenced by that crowd of souls on the Yellow Springs Road, eventually falling completely, merging into their collective, moving from one end to another.\n\nShe was unwilling to lose.\n\nShe could not lose.\n\nShe didn't want to be like before, standing in the pool of water, watching these people leave while she could only roar in fury!\n\nLiang Chuan turned his head to the side, looking at the Faceless Woman. His deep crimson eyes seemed to hold two blood moons. At the same time, two lines of bloody tears flowed from his sockets. One could imagine that he was not as relaxed and carefree as he appeared on the surface.\n\nHowever, the tapping of Liang Chuan's ten fingers grew a bit quicker than before.\n\nThere was no piano before him, so naturally, no sound was produced.\n\nBut that urgent rhythm,\n\nseemed to strike at the bottom of everyone's heart,\n\npounding against their heartstrings again and again!\n\nThey were Underworld Emissaries, guardians of order in the realms of Yin and Yang. Since ancient times, it had always been them escorting souls to Hell.\n\nBut today,\n\nsomeone had begun to send *them* off!\n\nThe Faceless Woman's facial features contorted. She originally had no expression, but at this moment, her face began to ripple with bumps and hollows. Even her long hair, which possessed a special power, now became like the venomous snakes on Medusa's head, not attacking others, but turning back to devour her.\n\nThe soundless music of the piano was all-pervasive.\n\nThis was a vortex.\n\nNo one could be spared!\n\nA strange sound emanated from within the Faceless Woman's body, as if calling out to something, creating a kind of resonance with Liang Chuan.\n\n\"You said you wanted to be an emissary of Hell.\n\nI...\n\npromise you.\"\n\nThis sentence was not spoken for the Faceless Woman, but for the soul she had swallowed.\n\nBeing a loner, having a friend isn't easy, and this time, he had lost two.\n\nHe had found Xiaoqiang's soul. Although it was in a deep slumber, it would one day awaken.\n\nYuecheng's soul was right here, before his eyes. He would send her to the destination her heart desired.\n\n*You all say I'm a Judge?*\n\n*Then I'll be the Judge.*\n\n*So what?*\n\nLiang Chuan raised his hands, then brought them down sharply.\n\nThe Faceless Woman jerked her head up, her body beginning to contort. The soul she had been suppressing, deliberately not fully consuming, was now, with the help of an external force, launching a counterattack against her.\n\nThat girl's soul, which she had originally used to threaten him, had now become a bomb hidden inside her own body, one that seemed capable of detonating her from within.\n\nTwo different shrieks and screams tore out from within the Faceless Woman's body. Two women were biting, slaughtering, devouring each other.\n\nLiang Chuan had provided the arena,\n\nset the stage.\n\nThe rest,\n\nwas up to their own contest.\n\nHe had faith in her. She was even more suited for the role of Hell's emissary than he was.\n\nThe surrounding Underworld Emissaries were certainly not standing by and watching the show. They attacked in unison. Now, they no longer cared about depleting their vital energy, or if it would affect their stay in the mortal realm.\n\nThey knew the situation was already spiraling out of control.\n\nNow, they had to forcibly wrestle everything back to the rhythm they desired.\n\nIn an instant, Subjugation Rods, Soul-Suppressing Banners, Soul-Capturing Bells, and other such implements came whistling toward Liang Chuan. But the long-bearded man blocked Liang Chuan's path with an almost selfless abandon.\n\nHe was powerless to fight back, but he grimly endured every blow, his soul beginning to fracture in a short amount of time.\n\nHe was clearly the hunter,\n\nyet at this moment, he was sacrificing himself to protect his prey.\n\nHe was more devoted than the most loyal of servants!\n\nThe Faceless Woman fell to her knees, shrieking ceaselessly. Ordinary people couldn't hear it; the neighbors on the street continued to sleep. But the cats and dogs on the old street sensed the keen abnormality. They didn't dare make a ruckus, only curling up in their nests, trembling.\n\nThis was a struggle in which no living person or creature could participate.\n\nThis was a battle to the death among a group of grim reapers in the human world.\n\nThe result of the battle,\n\nfor the losing side,\n\nwas that they wouldn't even get to be a ghost!\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nA black Subjugation Rod pierced the long-bearded man's chest. At the same time, Liang Chuan's figure staggered slightly. He felt a wave of dizziness, and the crimson glow in the long-bearded man's eyes had vanished.\n\nHe looked down at the black Subjugation Rod that had pierced his soul, then looked at his own spiritual body, so tattered it seemed a gust of wind could blow it away.\n\nIn his eyes,\n\nwas utter disbelief.\n\n*Why did it end up like this?*\n\n*Why did it turn out this way!*\n\n\"Kill him! Refine his soul!\"\n\nIn the distance, the little loli, still suppressing her severe injuries, shrieked,\n\n\"He's finished! His lamp has run out of oil! I want him to suffer a fate worse than death! I will personally brand his soul with the Pillar of Blazing Bronze for ten years!\"\n\nFinish him while he's weak.\n\nThe long-bearded man collapsed to his knees in despair.\n\nThe Underworld Emissaries in front bypassed him and continued their charge toward Liang Chuan.\n\nThe order of the Netherworld Bureau could not be profaned. If word of today's events got out, they would become the laughingstock of the Underworld. So the man before them had to be dealt with!\n\nLiang Chuan's staggering figure leaned against the doorframe.\n\nHis ten fingers had already fallen limp. His body was long since drenched in sweat.\n\nHis vision,\n\nseemed to be blurring as well.\n\nIn a daze,\n\nhe saw ferocious Underworld Emissaries pouncing toward him, and right now, he was so tired. What he really wanted to do was just lean against this doorframe,\n\nkeep leaning,\n\nwait for the sun to rise tomorrow,\n\nwait for the golden sunlight to sprinkle upon his body,\n\nwait to be enveloped by that warm, lazy comfort.\n\nOver two thousand kilometers away, an old Taoist priest was hosting a livestream, cheering him on.\n\nIt was just a shame he never used a smartphone, so he couldn't watch the stream.\n\nThere was a cold girl, biting her lip, laughing and crying for him, crying and laughing.\n\nLiang Chuan raised his head.\n\nHe didn't regret the things he had done, not one bit.\n\nBut,\n\nhe had people he was bound to, people he had wronged.\n\n\"One person does the deed, one person bears the consequences\" was, most of the time, just a simple and beautiful fantasy.\n\nJust as a Subjugation Rod was about to smash down on his head,\n\nhe raised a hand,\n\nlooked down at the white cat still grooming its fur,\n\nand called out:\n\n\"Pu'er!\"\n\nIn an instant,\n\nunder the dim yellow streetlight,\n\nthe cat's shadow began to stretch,\n\nand stretch,\n\nstretching so long,\n\nit seemed as if it could swallow the entire old street...\n\n————\n\nLong¹ has no saved chapters, as everyone knows. These two chapters were written in the first half of the night.

    "content": "A white cat, its fur like snow, the most exquisite and purest white in this world, possessed of a rare spirit and clarity.\n\nBut its shadow was black, a desperate black, like a demon's grasping arms extending from beneath the ground, constantly spreading, constantly covering.\n\nAnd with it,\n\ncame curses and despair!\n\nFlickering in the cat's eyes was the exact same gleam that had been deep within Liang Chuan's own, the depth of its crimson like churning magma, suffocatingly intense!\n\nIf one were to look closely,\n\none could still vaguely discern the wailing figures of countless souls and resentful ghosts, and bones piled high as mountains within the cat's eyes.\n\nA pair of feline eyes,\n\nimprinted with the deepest and most terrifying portrait of Hell.\n\nThat was Purgatory.\n\nThat was Asura.\n\nThat was the place where all beings found rest and their final madness.\n\nIt was the origin point of life.\n\nIt was the final destination for all things!\n\nAnd that place,\n\nwas one that even ordinary Ghost Envoys were not qualified to approach.\n\nBecause there, there was no essential difference between a Ghost Envoy and an ordinary resentful ghost.\n\n\"Meow!\"\n\nThe cat's cry\n\nechoed through the entire old street,\n\ninstantly making the hearts of the swarming Ghost Envoys tremble.\n\nAt that moment, they seemed to forget that they were in the mortal realm, feeling as if they had returned to Hell, to that sunless place.\n\nIn the mortal realm,\n\nthey were mysterious beings who existed beyond people's sight, living within tales of the strange and myths. They were no different from the old gods on high mountains; in fact, they were even more down-to-earth, and people feared them like tigers!\n\nBut in the Underworld, in Hell, they were just the lowest-level civil servants.\n\nAs the cat cried out,\n\nthe red in Liang Chuan's eyes, which had been fading, gradually returned. Blood no longer flowed from his sockets; what needed to flow had already run dry. But that deep crimson hue condensed once more.\n\nIn fact,\n\nit was even more intense than before!\n\nTonight's theme\n\nwas revenge.\n\nWhat came before\n\nwas merely the prelude!\n\nWhat comes next\n\nis the true symphony!\n\nMy departed friends,\n\nI will carry your souls with me\n\nto witness everything tonight!\n\nMy blood has run dry.\n\nNow,\n\nit's your turn to bleed...\n\nHis ten fingers trembled once more, the pale, slender joints dancing gracefully. He was playing, he was performing, creating his own notes in the midnight hour.\n\nAll in the audience\n\nmust die!\n\nAmong the Ghost Envoys, three more suddenly had their eyes turn crimson, and without hesitation, they attacked the comrades beside them.\n\nYou captured me.\n\nYou used the lives of those around me to force my hand.\n\nYou believed you stood on the side of justice.\n\nYou were contemptuous of everything.\n\nYou looked down on an ant like me who returned as a stowaway.\n\nYou felt you were high and mighty.\n\nYou felt you were incomparably noble.\n\nYou felt your will was the only correct one.\n\nThen today,\n\nI'd like to see\n\njust how noble\n\nyou can be!\n\nI want to see,\n\nwill you cry?\n\nWill you feel pain?\n\nWill you panic?\n\nAre you,\n\nin the end, just like ordinary people?\n\nAfter stripping away your glamorous exterior and status,\n\ndo you,\n\nperhaps,\n\nalso possess fear!\n\nHis ten fingers interlaced, trembling at twice their previous frequency. The notes of death poured out. Inside the netherworld shop, the Ghost Envoys fell into chaos, beginning to slaughter one another.\n\nOne was controlled for a second, striking his comrade.\n\nBut in the next second,\n\nhe was free from control, and in his confusion, the comrade he had just attacked retaliated.\n\nOne after another, the Ghost Envoys became like marionettes before Liang Chuan.\n\nHe could move whichever one he wanted.\n\nHe could play with whichever one he wanted.\n\nHe could mess with whichever one he wanted.\n\nTo mock you,\n\nto play with you,\n\nto watch you kill each other in fear and bewilderment,\n\nthis is my\n\ngift to you!\n\nYou said I wanted to be a Judge, that I committed a great taboo.\n\nThen today,\n\nas you wish,\n\nI will judge your lives and deaths!\n\nIn a corner of the netherworld shop, the little loli who had been licking her wounds with her tongue\n\nwatched all this, dumbfounded.\n\nShe saw her colleagues ahead of her, madly slaughtering one another without mercy.\n\nShe saw the crimson in their eyes flashing relentlessly.\n\nShe saw the man they were hunting leaning against the doorframe,\n\nhis eyes crimson,\n\nyet with a smile on his lips,\n\nadmiring it all!\n\nEverything was so unreal, so despairing.\n\nThis is a dream.\n\nThis must be a dream.\n\nI'm definitely in a dream.\n\nDefinitely in a dream!\n\nYes,\n\nthis isn't real.\n\nThis can't possibly be real.\n\nHow could this possibly be real!\n\nIf Zhou Ze had been there at that moment to see the little loli completely terrified, he would likely have sighed with immense feeling. The little loli, who he had once seen as his greatest threat,\n\nwas now truly scared into an ordinary, airheaded loli,\n\ncurled up over there,\n\nshivering.\n\nIt was a pity she was a spiritual body without a physical form.\n\nOtherwise, if Zhou Ze were here, he could have lifted her skirt to see if she'd also wet herself from fear.\n\nOf course, in Tongcheng, over two thousand kilometers away from Rongcheng, Zhou Ze was not entirely without sensation. The palm of his right hand, where the mark was, throbbed with a stabbing pain, so intense that Zhou Ze found it hard to bear and could only clench his fist tightly.\n\nAlthough he wasn't sure what was happening,\n\nZhou Ze had a premonition.\n\nThe little loli, who would have been a great deal of trouble for him had she returned to Tongcheng, was now in immense trouble herself. The key to the Gates of Hell she had left him was shifting, which meant she was gradually losing her control over it!\n\nOnce she was truly unable to return,\n\nthis key\n\nwould be his. And... completely and utterly his!\n\nWith the credentials already in hand, and the key soon to be his,\n\nhe would be a legitimate Ghost Envoy!\n\n...\n\nRongcheng.\n\nThe old street.\n\nChaos.\n\nChaos.\n\nUtter chaos.\n\nThe entire northern part of the old street\n\nhad become a free-for-all.\n\n\"When I enter Hell,\nI will walk the path paved with white bones;\n\nWhen I enter Hell,\nI will pick the most beautiful spider lilies of the other shore;\"[^1]\n\nWatching the frenzied scene before him,\n\nLiang Chuan smiled, very pleased.\n\nHe recited softly, like a narrator for this insane and tragic farce,\n\nproviding the voice-over for this stage play, so thick with the smell of blood you could almost wring it out.\n\nHis fingertips were still dancing.\n\nThe melody was still pouring out.\n\nIt wasn't over yet.\n\nIt couldn't stop yet.\n\nThe white cat was now soaked in blood, which slowly stained its pure white fur, but it stood its ground resolutely, right beside Liang Chuan.\n\nLiang Chuan's eyes could no longer be seen in his sockets, which were now deeply sunken. His whole being had become somewhat gaunt and withered, as if a gust of wind could blow him over.\n\nBut the bloody light deep within his eye sockets\n\ncontinued to ripple.\n\nNot enough.\n\nStill not enough.\n\nTruly,\n\nit's still not enough!\n\n\"When I enter Hell,\nI will drink the murkiest waters of the Yellow Springs;[^2]\n\nWhen I enter Hell,\nI will pass through endless curses;\n\nWhen I enter Hell,\nI will face the void of darkness.\"\n\nTo these Ghost Envoys, the recitation was like a death summons, urging them to push their slaughter to a climax, driving them to plunge their weapons more forcefully into their comrades' bodies.\n\nSouls were shattering.\n\nScreams were echoing.\n\nRoars were bellowing.\n\nThey knew what they were doing.\n\nBut the most painful part was that they knew what they were doing!!!\n\nThey couldn't stop.\n\nThey couldn't stop at all.\n\nThey had already lost themselves, able only to complete their actions under the man's gaze.\n\nAt this very moment,\n\nthey felt as if they could truly perceive a Judge standing before them, holding a Judge's brush, recounting their sins, and sending them to the execution ground!\n\nBut since time immemorial,\n\nit had only ever been them, the Ghost Envoys, escorting others to be thrown into the boiling oil cauldrons of Hell while collecting gratuities.\n\nWhen had it ever been their turn to be bound and subjected to such torture?\n\nThe slaughter\n\ncontinued.\n\nThe despair\n\nalso continued to spread.\n\n\"When I enter Hell,\nI will be buried in a boundless sea of blood;\n\nWhen I enter Hell,\nI will offer myself to the devil;\n\nWhen I enter Hell,\nI will indulge in solitude;\n\nWhen I enter Hell,\nI will never look back.\"\n\nThe recitation began to quicken, the rhythm becoming clearer. Liang Chuan grew more and more lost in the moment, immersed in the non-existent rhythm, adrift in the atmosphere he had created for himself.\n\nAn ordinary person seeing this would think he had a problem, that this was the self-entertainment of a madman.\n\nOnly,\n\nthis group of Ghost Envoys in the netherworld shop\n\ntruly experienced this terror, truly sensed this despair!\n\n\"When I enter Hell,\nI will no longer be lost;\n\nWhen I enter Hell,\nI will no longer wander;\n\nWhen I enter Hell,\nI will abandon thought;\n\nWhen I enter Hell,\nI will cast aside all clutter.\"\n\nThe Faceless Woman, who had been kneeling in the corner, now also began to slowly recite the same words as Liang Chuan. She slowly stood up.\n\nShe raised her hand,\n\nand pushed aside her hair.\n\nOn her previously featureless face,\n\nher facial features were slowly emerging.\n\nThis time,\n\nthere was no struggle,\n\nand no resistance.\n\nAmidst the chanting,\n\nit was as if many things had already been settled!\n\nHer mouth split open,\n\nrevealing red lips, a pert tongue, and pearly teeth. Her entire face became clear.\n\nIt was a moving face.\n\nIt was a lovely face.\n\nIt was a young face.\n\nThe woman looked at Liang Chuan, chanting along with him.\n\nLiang Chuan reached out and patted the woman's head, as if stroking his own dear sister.\n\nHer dream was to become an apostle of Hell. She was devoted to it, dedicated to it.\n\nSo,\n\nhe gave her this chance.\n\nThis was her choice. No hesitation, no sadness, no misgivings.\n\nTheir eyes met, and they continued to recite together:\n\n\"When I enter Hell,\nI will bury the past;\n\nWhen I enter Hell,\nI will obscure the future;\n\nWhen I enter Hell,\nthe world will no longer have me!\"\n\nAs they recited this, the white cat had become a blood-red cat. It collapsed, unable to hold on any longer. And Liang Chuan slowly slid down against the doorframe.\n\nUsing his last ounce of strength,\n\nhe recited the final passage:\n\n\"When I enter Hell,\nI will eventually return!\"\n\n\"Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!.........\"\n\nThe souls of the Ghost Envoys,\n\none by one, self-destructed.\n\nOne by one, they dissipated between heaven and earth.\n\nAs if to mark this symphony\n\nwith its own unique,\n\nfinal rest.\n\n---\n[^1]: **Spider lilies of the other shore (彼岸花):** Also known as the Red Spider Lily or *Lycoris radiata*.

    "content": "\"Boss, are we still open for business today or not?\"\n\n  Bai Yingying walked up to Zhou Ze, a mournful look on her face.\n\n  Zhou Ze took a sip of water with a smile, shook his head, and said, \"They're happy today. Let them have their fun.\"\n\n  Then,\n\n  Zhou Ze saw the spirit money on the floor and the bloody ink scroll Tang Shi had made. He looked at Bai Yingying with some pity and consoled her,\n\n  \"Tonight, I'll make those two responsible for cleaning up.\"\n\n  \"Mhm, you got it!\"\n\n  The silly girl, Bai Yingying, cheered up at once.\n\n  \"Get me another cup of coffee and a newspaper.\"\n\n  Zhou Ze rubbed the palm of his right hand. The pain was slowly fading, but his sense of ownership over the Key to the Gates of Hell was growing stronger. It was just that this series of stimuli had left him mentally fatigued.\n\n  He was already severely injured and had only just woken up. His body was still a bit weak and couldn't handle too much commotion.\n\n  Bai Yingying diligently brought over the coffee and newspaper, then scurried upstairs. Since the boss said they weren't open today, she was going back to her room to play for a chicken dinner.¹\n\n  She'd heard that new weapon skins had just been released, and she had already decided to pawn another one of her burial goods to buy them.\n\n  Too bad Bluehole didn't know she existed,\n\n  or they would have really given her an award—for being a true die-hard player!\n\n  Zhou Ze, meanwhile, continued to sit by the window, flipping through the newspaper in his hands.\n\n  The racket over there was still going on. Zhou Ze had thought no more customers would show up, but one actually did.\n\n  This gave Zhou Ze a strange feeling:\n\n  *Ha,*\n\n  *There's actually someone who isn't afraid of death?*\n\n  The arrival was a regular customer, walking a corgi. She was the very first client from when Zhou Ze had his old shop; back then, she had lost her beloved dog and found it with Zhou Ze's help.\n\n  Xu Qinglang had wanted to show off his twenty-something properties to her,\n\n  but she told him that his resettlement housing was provided by her family's real estate company. This left Xu Qinglang depressed for days. An attempt to show off that backfired so spectacularly was naturally hard to swallow.\n\n  \"Boss, it's pretty lively in here,\" the young woman said, sitting down in front of Zhou Ze.\n\n  Zhou Ze pushed his own coffee towards her. \"I haven't touched it.\"\n\n  The girl shook her head. \"I won't have this. What's going on with them?\" She pointed at Tang Shi and the old Daoist, who were still making a scene.\n\n  \"Oh, we just opened. Hired a circus troupe to liven things up.\"\n\n  The girl smiled, it was hard to tell if she believed him or not. She walked over to the counter, poured herself a glass of water, and came back.\n\n  \"Boss, remember I told you I'd be willing to invest if you opened a new shop.\"\n\n  \"It's a losing business. I'm afraid of dragging you down with me.\"\n\n  \"I just happened to be passing by today and saw the 'Late-Night Bookstore' sign. I hesitated for a moment, but it turns out you really did move. Alright, this is a good location. I just came in to say hi. See you next time.\"\n\n  The girl came and went quickly.\n\n  Zhou Ze picked up his coffee, took a sip, and was about to pick up his newspaper again when he noticed a dark figure had appeared by the window.\n\n  Zhou Ze turned his head to look out the glass window. An old woman was standing there, her features withered and her expression numb.\n\n  He reached out and tapped on the windowpane. The woman turned her head and looked over.\n\n  Still oblivious.\n\n  \"Hey, are you two done yet?\"\n\n  Zhou Ze shouted towards Tang Shi and the old Daoist.\n\n  They were also winding down. The old Daoist was panting from all the singing and had collapsed on the floor. Tang Shi was no longer laughing or crying.\n\n  Zhou Ze motioned for Tang Shi to look outside his window. Tang Shi understood, went out, and soon, the old woman was forcibly herded into the shop.\n\n  \"Can you send her to Hell?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n  He was a bit weak right now and couldn't open the Gates of Hell.\n\n  \"The kind where her soul scatters and her spirit disperses?\"\n\n  Tang Shi asked.\n\n  \"Never mind.\"\n\n  Zhou Ze looked at the old woman and noticed her eyes were vacant. Aside from glancing at people for a moment at the beginning, she just stared numbly in one direction the rest of the time.\n\n  Following her gaze, Zhou Ze saw that she was staring at the clock hanging on the wall.\n\n  A customer had arrived.\n\n  He wasn't feeling well and it wasn't convenient to receive her,\n\n  but he couldn't just kick her out.\n\n  \"Let's keep her in the shop. Wait until tomorrow when I've recovered some energy, and I'll see if I can open the Gates of Hell to send her down.\"\n\n  Even a mosquito's leg is meat. Zhou Ze wasn't about to be picky, nor would he let it go.\n\n  \"Who's going to watch her?\"\n\n  Tang Shi asked.\n\n  In the bookstore, there were, at most, only four people capable of keeping an eye on a ghost.\n\n  Zhou Ze was one, Xu Qinglang another, Tang Shi a third, and Bai Yingying a fourth. The old Daoist, being a half-baked amateur, didn't count.\n\n  But Xu Qinglang had gone back to his hometown today and wasn't around.\n\n  Zhou Ze was weak and couldn't do it.\n\n  That just left Tang Shi and Bai Yingying. Miss Tang's implication was that he should call his maid down from her game to watch the ghost; she certainly didn't have the spare time to do his odd jobs.\n\n  But Bai Yingying had just gone up to play her game. Zhou Ze didn't have the heart to call her back down now.\n\n  This silly girl had pawned her burial goods to open the bookstore for him, and she was always busy with chores inside and out.\n\n  She even had to help him bathe and sleep with him.\n\n  He really couldn't bring himself to take away her hobby time.\n\n  \"Alright then, just leave her here. It doesn't look like she's going to run off anyway,\" Zhou Ze could only shrug.\n\n  \"Heh, the ghosts around here might be drawn over because of you, but they'll quickly realize what kind of place this is. Then they'll get scared, start to avoid it, and finally, slip away when you're not looking.\n\n  The fear of death is human nature. Ghosts are no exception.\"\n\n  Zhou Ze pointed at the old woman, who was still staring at the clock.\n\n  \"I feel like there's something wrong with her head. Can ghosts get dementia?\"\n\n  \"I haven't done any research on the subject.\"\n\n  \"Forget it. If she leaves, she leaves. I can't send her straight to Hell, and I can't just shatter her soul today, can I? This is a delivery station, not a slaughterhouse.\"\n\n  \"Do as you please.\" Tang Shi prepared to get up and go upstairs.\n\n  \"Hey,\" Zhou Ze called out to her.\n\n  Tang Shi didn't stop. She walked even faster.\n\n  Clearly, she knew what Zhou Ze wanted to say—something she was even more reluctant to do than watch a ghost!\n\n  \"Boss, that felt incredible!\"\n\n  The old Daoist scrambled up. He'd already ended his livestream, and the monkey had put its phone down and run to the counter to find something to eat.\n\n   _“Old Daoist, feeling better now?”_ Zhou Ze asked.\n\n  \"Much better. Haven't felt this good in a long time.\"\n\n  The old Daoist was so earnest that Zhou Ze almost felt bad for him.\n\n  But Zhou Ze still said, \"Clean this place up.\"\n\n  \"...\" The old Daoist.\n\n  It was hard to say if it was because of the racket Tang Shi and the old Daoist had made, but in any case, for the rest of the night, no other customers showed up besides the old woman.\n\n  Zhou Ze leaned back on the sofa, playing on his phone for a while before looking at the newspaper again. He was an invalid now, and even moving around wasn't easy, so he could only recuperate obediently.\n\n  The old Daoist spent over two hours cleaning the shop. Then he sat down in front of Zhou Ze, pounding his lower back and groaning,\n\n  \"Mah back... it's gonna break.\"\n\n  \"You're getting on in years anyway. It's no big deal if your back is bad,\" Zhou Ze teased.\n\n  The old Daoist said aggrievedly, \"I may be old, but doesn't the poem go, 'A silkworm spins silk until its death; a candle only stops weeping when it's ash'? At my age, I figure I should help a few fallen women if I can.\n\n  You know, people living in this world ought to help each other out.\"\n\n  Zhou Ze couldn't be bothered with the old Daoist's dirty jokes. He turned his head, cracked his neck, and realized the old woman was actually still standing there.\n\n  The old Daoist couldn't see her because he hadn't applied any ox tears, so he had no idea a strange ghost had been standing in the shop all this time.\n\n  As for Zhou Ze, to be honest, he had just been distracted. After experiencing a temple deity like the Green-Clad Goddess and the major incident with that problematic underworld emissary, he really couldn't be expected to pay much attention to these small fries.\n\n  However, after several hours had passed, the old woman was surprisingly still there.\n\n  She was still standing in the same spot, motionless, just staring at the wall clock.\n\n  *Could it be that this old lady was in the clockmaking business when she was alive?*\n\n  *But that's not right either,*\n\n  *Zhou Ze's wall clock only cost a few hundred yuan, a cheap piece of junk. It wasn't some antique collection piece. Was it really worth staring at for so long?*\n\n  Just then, Bai Yingying came downstairs. She had finished her game and looked pretty happy, so she must have gotten her chicken dinner.\n\n  \"Boss, shall we go upstairs and sleep?\"\n\n  The silly girl was always this direct.\n\n  The old Daoist looked at Zhou Ze with a hint of envy.\n\n  A strange thought suddenly popped into his head: did all male ghosts who crawled out of Hell get to enjoy such romantic fortunes?\n\n  His previous boss, when he ran a spirit shop in Rongcheng, also had beautiful women proactively show up every night, right on time, to sleep with him. Back then, he and Xiaoqiang had been incredibly envious.\n\n  *Xiaoqiang,*\n\n  The old Daoist sighed.\n\n _“Oh, there's still someone standing here,”_\n\n  Bai Yingying said upon seeing the old woman. She walked up to her and waved a hand in her face. The old woman remained unmoved, continuing to stare at the clock.\n\n  \"Hey, hey, hey! Hey, hey, hey! Look at me! If you don't look at me, I'll eat you.\"\n\n  Bai Yingying chirped, bobbing her head in front of the old woman, but she still didn't react.\n\n  \"Boss, did you or that Miss Tang knock her silly?\"\n\n  \"She's been like this ever since she came in.\"\n\n  Zhou Ze pushed himself to his feet and walked over with Bai Yingying's support.\n\n  Just then,\n\n  the hour hand pointed to the six o'clock position.\n\n  \"Dong... dong... dong... dong... dong... dong!\"\n\n  The wall clock began to chime.\n\n  The old woman, who had been staring blankly just a moment before, suddenly threw her arms open and let out a hysterical laugh. The sound startled Zhou Ze.\n\n  He wasn't scared by the ghost itself;\n\n  it was purely the feeling of someone suddenly shouting at you from behind while you're walking down the street.\n\n  \"Hahahahaha, it's time, it's time!\n\n  I can die now,\n\n  I can die now,\n\n  I can finally die!\"\n\n  The old woman jumped and skipped around on the floor excitedly,\n\n  as if liberated,\n\n  as happy as a child of seventy-odd years.\n\n  \"Granny, have you got a screw loose or something?\" Bai Yingying asked, baffled. \"You died a long time ago. Your soul's been out of your body for ages.\"\n\n _Hearing this,_\n\n  the old woman froze.\n\n  She looked around with a face full of disbelief.\n\n  She must have realized this wasn't her home,\n\n  this was a strange place,\n\n  a strange bookstore.\n\n  The old woman pointed to her own face and looked at Bai Yingying in confusion:\n\n  \"I'm already dead?\"\n\n  \"That's right,\" Bai Yingying said as if it were the most obvious thing in the world.\n\n  The old woman suddenly collapsed to the floor,\n\n  and began to wail,\n\n  \"I died too soon! It's over, it's over!\n\n  Died too soon, died too soon,\n\n  It's completely over,\n\n  I'm totally screwed...\"\n\n***\n¹ \"Play for a chicken dinner\" is a literal translation of the Chinese slang 吃雞 (chī jī), which originates from the victory message \"Winner, winner, chicken dinner!\" in the video game *PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG)*.

    "content": "\"Is there something wrong with her head?\" Bai Yingying was completely baffled.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head too. To be honest, he couldn't figure out what was going on either. When he was a doctor, he'd often encountered people who chose auspicious dates for their C-sections, but he had never seen anyone insist on dying at a specific time.\n\nHe guessed that when the old woman was alive and lying on her deathbed, she must have been staring at the family clock, timing the exact moment she would breathe her last.\n\nJudging by the way the old woman was wailing her heart out, she definitely wasn't faking it. She was already dead, so what was the point of putting on an act? Who was she being hypocritical for?\n\nIt's just that her incessant crying was getting on Zhou Ze's nerves. The Old Taoist couldn't hear it, but he could. His sleep quality was already poor; how was he supposed to rest later with this racket?\n\nZhou Ze didn't have the heart of a saint; besides, he'd eaten his own conscience not long ago. The old woman's crying wouldn't elicit any concern from Zhou Ze, only annoyance.\n\n\"Scare her. Make her shut up.\"\n\nZhou Ze gestured to Bai Yingying.\n\nBai Yingying nodded, bared her fangs, and the aura of a zombie instantly billowed out. As expected, the old woman stopped crying. She was scared stiff.\n\nAt the same time, the lingering attachment that bound the old woman was slowly dissipating.\n\nThe only reason ordinary spirits could remain in the human world was a wisp of lingering attachment. Once that attachment vanished, they would naturally return to where they belonged.\n\nThe souls that Hell's Messengers needed to capture and escort to the underworld were those whose attachments were difficult to dispel, or those who had become resentful ghosts. Those were the ones that counted toward performance credit.\n\nIn other words, if Zhou Ze had sent the old woman off earlier, it would have counted as performance credit. Though not much, it was still something.\n\nBut now, the old woman could return to the underworld on her own. Even if Zhou Ze risked his wounds reopening or fainting to open a Gate to Hell for her, it would just be a thankless effort to give her an express ride. He wouldn't get a single thing out of it.\n\nThe old woman's soul was slowly fading, gradually beginning to sink into the ground.\n\n\"Boss, why are your hands shaking?\"\n\nBai Yingying, who had been supporting Zhou Ze all this time, sensed something was wrong.\n\n\"I'm heartbroken.\"\n\nThose two words escaped Zhou Ze's lips.\n\nHe finally understood what the little loli meant about the potential consequences of keeping Bai Yingying around. Damn it all, some ghosts were attracted to him, only to be scared into immediate enlightenment by the zombie and obediently descend into Hell without another peep.\n\nWhat was left for him to do?\n\nOf course, this wasn't something he could forcibly change. Besides, he'd already had his surprise for the day: the key to the Gate to Hell and the news that something major had likely happened to the little loli. That was worth far, far more than the performance credit from a single soul.\n\nHe slept relatively peacefully that night.\n\nWhen he woke up the next day, Zhou Ze found that some of his strength had returned. He wasn't as weak as the day before. Without waiting for Bai Yingying to help him, Zhou Ze propped himself up with his hands and stood.\n\nHe was a bit unsteady, but he was on his feet.\n\n\"Boss, are you alright?\"\n\nBai Yingying watched anxiously from the side, afraid Zhou Ze would suddenly fall. This was especially true when Zhou Ze indicated he didn't need help going down the stairs.\n\nIn his current physical state, Zhou Ze was about as mobile as an elderly man or woman with bad legs.\n\nBai Yingying was genuinely worried that if Zhou Ze fell and broke an arm or a leg, or something more dramatic like becoming paralyzed, that idiotic electric \"whoosh whoosh whoosh\" wheelchair the Old Taoist had bought might actually come in handy.\n\nEarly in the morning, the female corpse's train of thought was a bit jumpy.\n\nHer mind began to automatically conjure an image of her boss sitting in the electric wheelchair, going \"whoosh whoosh whoosh whoosh whoosh.\"\n\nAdd a pacifier in his mouth,\n\nand it was just...\n\n\"Hahahahaha...\"\n\nMid-laugh, Bai Yingying stopped. She saw Zhou Ze had turned his head and was looking at her.\n\n\"Zombie transformation acting up?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nBai Yingying shook her head.\n\n\"A bout of corpse-lepsy?\" Zhou Ze asked again.\n\nBai Yingying immediately shook her head again.\n\nShe didn't dare tell him what she had just secretly imagined, or her boss would surely impale her once he recovered.\n\nYes,\n\nimpale her with his fingernails.\n\nZhou Ze felt that his maid's wires were crossed this morning. He said again:\n\n\"Make a few noises for me.\"\n\n\"Ying ying ying.\"\n\nAh, back to normal.\n\nSlowly making his way down the stairs, holding the railing, Zhou Ze felt a sense of accomplishment, like when he was learning to walk as a child. To be honest, he never wanted to experience that kind of drunken blackout again.\n\nThe pleasure was temporary, instantaneous, followed by an extended period of weakness and listlessness.\n\nIt was like taking too much of *that stuff* and being a mighty stud in bed for one night, only to wake up the next day with a sore back, weak knees, and possibly even dying on the spot from a stroke during sex.\n\nThe Old Taoist was already up. No matter how late he went to bed, he always rose early. He had a fixed routine and would even practice a set of boxing forms in the morning.\n\nAs an enthusiastic Old Taoist dedicated to the cause of caring for fallen women, he understood the importance of maintaining his physical fitness.\n\nWhen Zhou Ze came down, the Old Taoist had already finished his boxing and was huddled with the little monkey, talking to it.\n\nThe Old Taoist was holding some black mud in his hands, with a large bag of it on the floor.\n\nZhou Ze frowned slightly.\n\nThat was the stuff the little monkey had smeared on his wounds when he was injured. The effect was remarkable, no less potent than the \"Black Jade Bone-Mending Paste\"¹ from wuxia novels.\n\nThe only problem was the smell, and for someone with a cleanliness obsession like Zhou Ze, having several layers of mud slathered on his body was nothing short of torture.\n\nBut what came next,\n\nwas a scene that made Zhou Ze feel as if the torture had been intensified.\n\nThe Old Taoist held the plastic bag filled with dirt up to the little monkey.\n\nTo be precise, he held it under the little monkey's crotch, while making \"shhh shhh shhh...\" sounds with his mouth.\n\n\"My little ancestor,\n\n\"Hurry up and pee,\n\n\"We're counting on this stuff to get rich now,\n\n\"Good boy,\n\n\"Hurry, pee, good boy, shhh shhh shhh...\"\n\nZhou Ze's face darkened.\n\nThe mud that had been smeared on his body,\n\nwas actually...\n\nit was actually...\n\nit was actually made like that!\n\n\"Oof!\"\n\nWith lightning-fast reflexes, Bai Yingying caught Zhou Ze just as he was about to fall.\n\nThe Old Taoist heard the commotion and turned around.\n\nHe flashed Zhou Ze a smile as bright as the sun outside, waving a hand full of black mud in greeting.\n\n\"Mornin', Boss!\"\n\nHeaven have mercy.\n\nIf Zhou Ze hadn't happened to be injured recently,\n\nthe Old Taoist would have died who knows how many times already.\n\n...\n\nFrom noon to afternoon, the bookstore was generally closed for business. This bookstore, located in a prime, expensive section of South Street's city center, was just that willful, just that stylish.\n\nHowever, if customers came in wanting to buy books or have a drink, they wouldn't be turned away.\n\nBut to reduce his own workload, Xu Qinglang had previously hung out a sign:\n\n\"This establishment has a 100-yuan minimum charge.\"\n\nThis was enough to scare off eighty to ninety percent of potential customers.\n\nZhou Ze had let it be. Fewer random people meant less work for everyone.\n\nOf course, it wasn't as if there were no well-off tycoons who came by. Just after Zhou Ze had finished his meal and was fighting off a wave of nausea, a middle-aged man with slicked-back hair and a yellow jacket walked in.\n\nHe seemed very pleased with the quietness of the shop. After ordering a glass of ice water, he took out his laptop and began working on the sofa.\n\nBefore long, his laptop's speakers, apparently on full blast, began to play:\n\n\"The first Macau online casino is live! Beautiful dealers dealing cards online...\"\n\nThe Old Taoist heard the music and knew the song.\n\nHis ears perked up, and he immediately sidled over, as if he had found a kindred spirit.\n\nBut when he saw the screen, the Old Taoist was dumbfounded. Where were the promised Japanese \"quality educational\" action films? What the hell were all these chips on the screen?\n\n\"You play online gambling too?\" the man asked with interest, seeing the Old Taoist approach.\n\nWhat kind of person was the Old Taoist? He could become sworn brothers with a monkey.\n\nHe could swindle cute fans in his livestream into buying hell money.\n\nHe could swindle coal bosses from Liaoning into shipping their coal to sell in Shanxi.\n\nHe immediately said:\n\n\"Yeah, I play. A couple hands now and then, but not for big stakes. It's not very interesting, really. Not exciting enough.\n\n\"I usually like to go to Macau to have some fun, just to unwind.\"\n\nAs he spoke, the Old Taoist even used his pinky to clean out his ear, the very picture of nonchalant ease.\n\nAt the same time, the Old Taoist had the little monkey lean forward so he could reach out and pat its head.\n\nThe flex was immense.\n\nSee this?\n\nA nationally protected golden snub-nosed monkey is my pet.\n\nThat's not much worse than those Arab tycoons who keep leopards, right?\n\nThe man was stunned at first. He didn't know if the Old Taoist's previous boasts were true, but this golden snub-nosed monkey wasn't fake.\n\nBesides, to open a bookstore like this in the city center on South Street, you were either crazy or so rich you were burning money for fun.\n\nInstantly, the man warmed up to the Old Taoist, cordially inviting him to sit beside him and giving him a detailed introduction to how his website worked.\n\nZhou Ze listened from the side, then took out his phone, wondering if he should call the police.\n\nMost online gambling in the country was a scam. They trick you into depositing money, let you win a little at first, and then fatten you up for the slaughter. These were all old tricks from ancient gambling dens, but countless people still fell for them.\n\nBecause no matter how the tricks changed, it didn't really matter.\n\nThe key was the greed in people's hearts; it was passed down from generation to generation, unchangeable.\n\nBut the conversation that followed made Zhou Ze temporarily hold off on dialing the police.\n\nBecause the Old Taoist maintained his high-and-mighty act, displaying a disdainful attitude toward common gambling games like lotteries. This made the man go all-in to woo this crazy, rich client.\n\nFinally, he said directly:\n\n\"There's a really exciting game, but I don't know if you'd dare to play, Boss?\"\n\n\"Pfft. I've even dared to bathe a ghost. You think I'm scared of your 'exciting game'?\"\n\nSomeone could testify to this; the Old Taoist wasn't bluffing.\n\n\"Just say it, what are we betting on?\" the Old Taoist urged.\n\nThe man hesitated for a moment, but still said:\n\n\"We bet on lives!\"\n\nIn an instant, Zhou Ze, who had been sipping his coffee and listening to the conversation nearby, felt the spoon in his hand tremble slightly.\n\nIn his mind, an image surfaced of the old woman from last night, standing in the shop, staring intently at the wall clock, so focused on the time that she didn't even know she was dead.\n\nAnd then there was the sacrificed police officer whom he had personally sent on his way.\n\nBefore leaving, he had told Zhou Ze about the gambling syndicate he was investigating.\n\nThey didn't bet on anything else,\n\nthey didn't play any other games,\n\ninstead,\n\nthey bet on lives!\n\n***\n\n¹A fictional miraculous healing ointment from the wuxia novel *The Heaven Sword and Dragon Saber* by Jin Yong.",

    "content": "\"Gambling with life?\n\n\"Like underground fighting? The kind where you sign a death waiver?\"\n\n\"No, of course not. Boss, I can guarantee you've never seen anything like it.\"\n\nThe old Daoist's interest was piqued. He'd been a wanderer for half his life, a real man of the world.¹ Though he wore Daoist robes and came from a long line of hereditary Daoists, by his generation, what shady dealings or unorthodox paths hadn't he seen?\n\nIf you haven't eaten pork, haven't you at least seen a pig run?²\n\n\"Heh, go on then, tell me. I really don't believe there's anything I haven't seen.\"\n\nThe old Daoist lifted his robes with the ethereal air of a celestial being.\n\n\"Let me be clear up front, the minimum buy-in here is fifty thousand.\" The man looked at the old Daoist. \"And you don't have to worry about me swindling you. This business of ours is getting very, very big, and we just take a commission, so whether you win or lose, our platform is guaranteed to make a profit.\"\n\nThe old Daoist snorted. Clearly, he wasn't willing to part with the money.\n\nHe'd done his fair share of swindling and cheating, and he certainly wasn't about to get pecked in the eye by a sparrow in his old age.³ And besides, he was quite fond of his coin purse.\n\n\"I'm interested,\" Zhou Ze said suddenly.\n\nYes,\n\nhe was interested.\n\nWhether it was the old crone from last night,\n\nor the good policeman he himself had sent to Hell,\n\nthey had all, directly or indirectly, brought up this phrase \"gambling with life.\"\n\nZhou Ze really wanted to see just what kind of game this \"gambling with life\" was.\n\nFive or six lost souls had already entered Hell because of this \"gambling with life.\"\n\nThis...\n\nwhat kind of game was it, really?\n\nThe man glanced at the somewhat sickly-looking Zhou Ze sitting there.\n\nThe disdain on his face was palpable.\n\n*He's not bad looking, quite handsome, actually.*\n\n*But one look and you can tell he's just a bookstore clerk.*\n\n*You're interested,*\n\n*heh,*\n\n*do you even have the money?*\n\nHe didn't say it out loud,\n\nbut his expression and his eyes made it perfectly clear.\n\n*You've got the look of a penniless schmuck.*\n\n*I've sized up countless people, could I be wrong?*\n\nZhou Ze licked his lips.\n\nHe thought about laughing to ease the awkwardness,\n\nbut then realized that laughing with Bai Yingying and the old Daoist present might also be awkward.\n\nBut this moment of not knowing whether to laugh or not,\n\nwas, in fact, even more awkward...\n\nAnd then,\n\n*I'm so mad.*\n\n*I really want to send you to Hell.*\n\n*How dare you make me feel awkward!*\n\nSeeing his boss's expression begin to shift, the old Daoist's heart immediately skipped a beat.\n\nAs a veteran Daoist who had served two \"ghost bosses,\" he had a wealth of experience in kissing ghostly ass!\n\nRight then,\n\nhe slammed his hand on the table.\n\nAnd said directly:\n\n\"Dammit, it's only fifty thousand! That's chump change, no problem, no problem at all.\n\n\"Stop looking down your nose at people. I'll transfer you the money. I'm not afraid of you trying to pull a fast one.\n\n\"Anyone who dares to fool me...\n\n\"I have my ways of sending them to Hell!\"\n\nThe old Daoist flashed a smile, showing his white teeth.\n\n\"Fine, to Hell with it then.\" The man took out his phone. \"I'll open an account for you first, you can just transfer the money in.\"\n\nHe didn't find the threat of being sent to Hell to be anything special, assuming the old Daoist was using underworld slang for \"if you scam me, I'll have you whacked.\"\n\nHe could never have dreamed that,\n\nin this bookstore,\n\nsending people to Hell,\n\nwas the *real* revenue-generating business.\n\n\"Open two accounts. I'll transfer you one hundred thousand.\"\n\nThe old Daoist transferred the money without a second thought, then sidled up to Zhou Ze with a grin, inviting the boss to come see what this 'gambling with life' game was all about.\n\nHe really wasn't afraid of this guy running off with the money.\n\nAs the saying goes,\n\nthe King of Hell is easy to meet, but the minor demons are hard to deal with.\n\nOf course, he couldn't say these words to his boss, or he probably wouldn't even know how he died.\n\nUnfortunately, the old Daoist was still unaware that in the last two days—from volunteering to scrub Zhou Ze's back, to gifting him an electric wheelchair, to playing with mud—he had already skirted the edge of death several times.\n\n\"Where did you get so much money?\"\n\nZhou Ze asked.\n\n\"I started streaming again. The donations from yesterday were huge,\" the old Daoist explained.\n\n*There's something wrong with this world.*\n\n*Something is very, very wrong!*\n\nEven someone as calm and composed as Doctor Zhou couldn't help but fall into deep thought.\n\nHis neighbor, Xu Qing, was very rich.\n\nHis maid was very rich.\n\nHis wife was very rich.\n\nAnd now,\n\nthe old Daoist he'd taken in could easily pull out a hundred thousand!\n\nAnd looking at himself, he was still a man in the red.\n\nThe man was delighted to have roped in two new clients. He immediately turned his laptop toward them and began a detailed explanation of the specific rules, adding:\n\n\"Don't worry, this game is absolutely thrilling. This is a high-end game truly meant for the rich, because in this game, you can gamble on a person's life, and decide their fate.\n\n\"So, what do you think?\n\n\"Doesn't it make you feel like a grim reaper?\"\n\nThe man cracked a joke, thinking himself witty and humorous.\n\nHearing this, the old Daoist's mouth twitched.\n\n\"Heh,\" said Zhou Ze.\n\n...\n\n\"Boss, we really should have brought Bai Yingying. She'd be more convenient for serving you.\"\n\nThis time, the old Daoist was self-aware enough not to foolishly offer his back, even as Zhou Ze hobbled forward on his cane.\n\n\"If she came, there'd be no one to watch the bookstore,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\n\"Ah, but isn't Miss Tang still there?\"\n\n\"Her? Watching the store?\"\n\nZhou Ze looked at the old Daoist.\n\nThe old Daoist looked at Zhou Ze.\n\nBoth of them silently shook their heads.\n\nAlright,\n\nenough said.\n\nEverything was understood without a word.\n\nJust imagine Miss Tang Shi watching the store alone.\n\nA customer with a short temper might come in demanding coffee or hurrying her to find a book,\n\nand a fountain pen would probably fly over and riddle them like a honeycomb briquette.\n\n\"Boss, watch your step, it's a bit steep ahead.\"\n\nLeaning on his cane, Zhou Ze scanned his surroundings.\n\nThis was a part of Tongcheng's urban area. It wasn't exactly remote, but it was a fair distance from the city center and located in an older district. Several small clinics and hospitals had opened here, along with a number of inns.\n\nOf course, none of these small hospitals looked particularly legitimate.\n\nThere weren't many people on the streets, and if your nose was sensitive enough, you could catch the faint smell of disinfectant. All in all, the place gave off an unsettling feeling.\n\n\"The address is this way, right?\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Yes, it should be here.\"\n\nThe two of them walked into an alley that revealed a hidden world within, with many doors. Zhou Ze and the old Daoist knocked on one with the number plate 203.\n\nSoon, a middle-aged man opened the door. He had a cigarette dangling from his lips, and his eyes scrutinized Zhou Ze and the old Daoist.\n\n\"Let me see your account numbers,\" the middle-aged man said.\n\n\"Here.\" The old Daoist handed him his phone.\n\nThe man checked it, nodded, and smiled. \"You've already placed your bets? You bet before even coming to take a look?\"\n\n\"That's why we're here to look now,\" the old Daoist explained.\n\n\"Alright, come on in.\"\n\nThe middle-aged man stepped aside, coughed, hawked up a thick wad of phlegm and spat it on the ground, then wiped his nose with the back of his hand.\n\nZhou Ze and the old Daoist stepped inside. The room was cramped, containing a spring mattress and several pieces of equipment. It somewhat resembled an ICU in a hospital—though, of course, far more rudimentary.\n\nIn the corner, two cameras were mounted, providing a full, no-blind-spot surveillance of every nook and cranny of the room.\n\nAn old man lay there, so gaunt he looked like a mummy lying in a pyramid. Even his skin had turned a dark brown.\n\nOne bed,\n\none old man,\n\nprofoundly embodied the idiom: *the oil is spent, and the lamp has gone out.*\n\nOn the bedside table sat half a bowl of thin porridge.\n\nThe old man's eyes were half-closed. He would open them from time to time but paid no mind to Zhou Ze and the old Daoist. He seemed to have grown used to it; people must have come in to see him like this often.\n\nComing to see him,\n\nto see exactly when he would die.\n\nHe was the subject of many people's wagers.\n\nMany had already placed bets online as to how long this old man could live.\n\nOne month? Two months? Three months?\n\nThe odds for each time period were different, just like betting on soccer.\n\nDuring this time, the old man was not allowed to receive any treatment. The instruments here were only to monitor his physical condition, which would be compiled into data sheets and uploaded to the platform daily for bettors and potential bettors to see and analyze.\n\nAt the same time, bettors had the right to come and see the old man's condition in person.\n\nAfter all, *what's learned from paper is always shallow; to truly know, one must act.*⁴\n\nIs it absurd?\n\nNo,\n\nit's not absurd.\n\nThe old man was staring at a wall clock.\n\nOn the wall, where he could see it as soon as he opened his eyes, was a digital clock displaying the date and time.\n\nIn him,\n\nZhou Ze saw a trace of the old crone from last night.\n\n\"Boss, what's his illness?\" The old Daoist knew Zhou Ze used to be a doctor and would likely have an accurate assessment.\n\n\"Cancer. Terminal,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\n\"Oh, a fatal disease.\"\n\n\"It's fatal, yes, but with proper treatment, his life could be prolonged. At the very least, his suffering could be reduced.\"\n\nClearly, this old man would not receive any treatment, because the platform's terms and conditions stated that any form of treatment would be a breach of contract.\n\n\"Seen enough, you two?\"\n\nThe man walked over, holding a bowl of instant noodles.\n\n\"Let's go,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Go?\" The old Daoist was confused.\n\n*How can we just go?*\n\n*Fuck, we have to save him!*\n\n*This is real gambling with life!*\n\n*Just letting everyone watch a man die!*\n\n\"What's the point of staying? He himself knows why we're here,\" Zhou Ze said, gesturing toward the old man.\n\nIt was obvious.\n\nThe old man knew he had been denied treatment.\n\nAnd,\n\nhe also understood why people like himself and the old Daoist came to see him every day.\n\nJust like that old crone.\n\nThey all understood.\n\nIn fact,\n\nthey were even cooperating.\n\nJust like that old crone, who held on just to die after that specific day. It was her obsession, one that caused her to die without realizing she was dead, becoming a lost soul who wandered into the bookstore.\n\n\"This...\"\n\nThe old Daoist's conscience still pricked him, but he followed his boss out nonetheless.\n\nAt the doorway,\n\nthe middle-aged man leaned against the wall, slurping his instant noodles, and called out, \"Hey, want some inside information?\"\n\n\"What inside information?\" the old Daoist asked, turning his head.\n\nThe middle-aged man rubbed his fingers together.\n\nThe meaning was obvious: if they wanted inside info, they'd have to spend more money.\n\n\"You can add to your bet. It's not a loss, really,\"\n\nthe man added, as if giving a kind tip.\n\n\"Heh, who are you to him? Why should we believe you?\" the old Daoist retorted.\n\nAs he saw it, the man was just a gatekeeper, a caregiver at best.\n\n\"I've placed a bet, too.\"\n\nThe man took a sip of noodle broth and jerked his chin toward the room.\n\nHe said:\n\n\"He's my father.\"\n***\n**Footnotes:**\n¹ **Man of the world:** The original Chinese, `闖蕩江湖的主兒 (chuǎngdàng jiānghú de zhǔ'er)`, refers to someone experienced in the ways of the world, often in less-than-reputable circles.\n² **If you haven't eaten pork...:** A common Chinese saying, `沒吃過豬肉，難道還沒見過豬跑？ (méi chīguò zhūròu, nándào hái méi jiànguò zhū pǎo?)`, meaning that even if you haven't experienced something firsthand, you have enough worldly knowledge to understand it.\n³ **Pecked in the eye by a sparrow:** A Chinese idiom, `被麻雀啄了眼 (bèi máquè zhuóle yǎn)`, meaning an experienced person being duped or outsmarted by a novice.\n⁴ **What's learned from paper...:** A famous line from a poem by Lu You, `紙上得來終覺淺，絕知此事要躬行 (zhǐshàng délái zhōng jué qiǎn, juézhī cǐ shì yào gōngxíng)`, emphasizing the importance of practical experience over theoretical knowledge.",

    "content": "Twenty thousand initial subscriptions,\n\n  The best result Dragon has had since I started writing,\n\n  Thank you all for your support!\n\n  For a niche supernatural novel to achieve such a result, Dragon is already proud enough.\n\n  Our initial subscriptions have broken the previous all-time record for initial subscriptions in the supernatural genre by five times,\n\n  Five times!\n\n  Here, I want to thank the fellow senior authors who encouraged me back then, thank you to Buzheng Ge, Zhouzi Ge, Xiao Qi Ge, Naiqi Ge, Xuanshui Niang, and other big brothers. At that time when Dragon was at his most lost, they either comforted Dragon or proactively gave me chapter recommendations.\n\n  In fact, many of the senior authors who went out of their way to encourage Dragon, Dragon didn't know or wasn't familiar with before; we had never interacted.\n\n  Because of this, adding flowers to brocade is easy, but the kindness of sending charcoal in a snowstorm is something Little Dragon will never forget.\n\n  I also want to thank the supernatural genre's Editor-in-Chief, Yisuo Ge, and my editors, Zhusha Jie and Ziliang Ge.\n\n  I still remember, the last time I stumbled was before the New Year.\n\n  Originally, the plan I discussed with the supernatural genre editors was to release the new book after the New Year, but in the end, Dragon went ahead and changed the decision on my own.\n\n  With no book to work on, I felt anxious, as if life had lost its purpose. Unable to casually scroll through the book review section, unable to read the chapter comments, I felt very lost and uneasy.\n\n  Then Dragon called my editors and said, \"I want to release a new book.\"\n\n  At that moment, the editors were already at the airport, preparing to head home for the New Year holiday. They made calls to rearrange things for Dragon, almost delaying their trips. In the end, Dragon was able to release the book before the New Year.\n\n  At that time, Dragon made a promise: Let me release the book, and while I can't guarantee anything else, the one thing I can guarantee is that my new book will get 10,000 initial subscriptions!\n\n  As a die-hard fat otaku, the \"Fat Dragon\" as my readers call me,\n\n  Honestly,\n\n  This fatty, me, besides knowing how to write books and stories, I really have no other skills.\n\n  Thank you to my old readers for your constant companionship, and thank you to the new readers for joining and for your support.\n\n  I stumbled once two months ago. This time, Dragon has gotten back up, and the height I'm standing at is double what it was last time.\n\n  This is all thanks to everyone's deep affection for Dragon,\n\n  Dragon can only repay everyone with better stories.\n\n  Many people have asked Dragon if I'm going to compete on the monthly ticket rankings.\n\n  To be honest, Dragon doesn't have the energy to compete anymore. Starting from the latter half of *Terror Broadcast*, Dragon has been mentally exhausted, and my body has also been vaguely showing some problems. Then, these past few months have been filled with so many things, so many twists and turns; two new-book launch periods felt no less stressful than taking the college entrance exams twice.\n\n  After I'm done handling the launch matters in these next few days, Dragon still has to make a trip to the hospital.\n\n  Tired. I'm really a bit tired. During the launch period for *Midnight Bookstore*, on more than one occasion, I've experienced back pain while sitting in my chair and sudden nosebleeds.\n\n  This body, after all, isn't made of iron.\n\n  However, what I was thinking at the time was, even if I were to die and be lying in my coffin, I would have to bang on the coffin lid a few times and shout:\n\n  \"Tell me the initial subscription numbers after the launch, or I won't be able to rest in peace.\"\n\n  The first two chapters after the launch, some readers might feel the style is a bit different from before. Actually, that was Dragon's own catharsis.\n\n  All that frustration, bottled up for two months—in that moment, Dragon vented and released it all.\n\n  If I didn't let it out, it would have been unbearable!\n\n  Dragon also knows that many old readers, just like Dragon, also needed to vent a little.\n\n  I'm not saying all this to sell a sob story just so I can push harder for the monthly ticket rankings.\n\n  What Dragon wants to say is, the monthly ticket rankings, Dragon doesn't plan on competing for them.\n\n  The time when Dragon truly improved the most was while writing *Terror Broadcast*. Every day, I focused all my attention on writing the chapters well, then publishing them. For that entire year, I never competed on the rankings, nor did I post any non-story chapters. I just concentrated on how to write stories, how to improve my writing skills, and then I wrote Uncle Fugui,\n\n  And wrote the line \"Life and death are decreed by fate; riches and honor are determined by heaven.\"\n\n  In fact, sometimes Dragon even hesitates to post remarks at the end of a chapter, afraid it might affect everyone's reading experience.\n\n  *Midnight Bookstore*,\n\n  The title itself has already set the tone for this book.\n\n  This is a bookstore that opens late at night,\n\n  A story that takes place in the dead of night when all is quiet.\n\n  \"Listen to it with skepticism; thus I have heard,\"¹\n\n  The stories told in the book are also things Dragon has heard through the grapevine, and I'm just retelling them to you all in a different way. Please don't take them too seriously, just listen casually, as a pastime, a way to relieve boredom.\n\n  So, let's try our best not to ruin this atmosphere.\n\n  Dragon is also unwilling to lose my mental balance just to compete on the rankings, or to ruin the pacing and story for the sake of mass-releasing chapters.\n\n  Monthly tickets, I'll still ask for them when I should. If you have monthly tickets, please cast them for Dragon. For example, this month's \"New Book\" monthly ticket ranking—we are determined to win first place.\n\n  As for the rest, like competing on the overall rankings, I'll leave it up to everyone's own initiative. If you have tickets, feel free to cast them for Dragon. If you enjoyed reading, you can leave a tip.\n\n  A penny or a dollar, it's all love;\n  A Helmsman or an Alliance Leader,² it's all affection.\n\n  Of course, the more the merrier.\n\n  After this,\n\n  Dragon plans to lock myself away, ignoring everything else, and just focus wholeheartedly on writing the story. And everyone can just focus wholeheartedly on reading the story.\n\n  May the years be quiet and good,\n\n  May the Bookstore's results get better and better,\n\n  Finally,\n\n  I wish everyone good health.\n\n***\n**Footnotes:**\n¹ A phrase often found in Buddhist scriptures and traditional storytelling, implying that the tale is hearsay and the listener should not take it as absolute fact.\n² \"Helmsman\" and \"Alliance Leader\" are titles given to readers on Chinese web novel platforms who donate a certain amount of money to the author, similar to tiers on Patreon.",

    "title": "Chapter 109 Am I dead?",
    "content": "\"He's my dad.\"\n\nA single, light-as-air sentence,\n\nyet it landed with the force of a thunderclap.\n\nThe middle-aged man took out a pack of cigarettes from his pocket, stuck one in his own mouth, and offered another to Zhou Ze and the old Daoist.\n\nThe old Daoist, numb, didn't move.\n\nZhou Ze, however, calmly accepted the cigarette and lit it.\n\n\"So, have you made up your minds?\" the middle-aged man continued his pitch. \"Don't worry, I won't screw you over. I can show you the bet I placed. You can just place yours for the same time as me.\"\n\n\"You really are a good son,\" Zhou Ze said, exhaling a smoke ring.\n\nThe middle-aged man's brow furrowed slightly, and he gave a cold laugh. \"This deal, are you in or out? Just say it.\"\n\nHe wasn't stupid; he could obviously hear the sarcasm in Zhou Ze's words.\n\n\"We're in. Why wouldn't we be?\" said Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Good. Five thousand. Not too steep, right? You've already put down a hundred thousand—two bets, a hundred thousand. Another five thousand to guarantee you a solid win.\"\n\nAt the mention of money, the middle-aged man grew excited, completely unbothered by Zhou Ze's earlier mockery.\n\n\"What if your dad doesn't make it?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"No way. He's my dad, and he knows I've got money on it too. Don't you worry, I'll cheer him on. I'll make him hang on for dear life. Even if he has to die, he'll die after the deadline.\"\n\nThe middle-aged man wore an expression of someone who had everything under control.\n\nAt that moment,\n\nit was as if father and son's hearts were truly linked.\n\nA thick father-son affection permeated the air, so moving and admirable it was hard not to be touched.\n\n\"You can never be sure when someone will die,\" Zhou Ze reminded him. \"Not even a reaper can be certain.\"\n\nReapers cannot simply take the life of a living person. Of course, it wasn't impossible, but the price was far too great. A single misstep could lead to eternal damnation.\n\n\"Heh, if you're so capable, have a reaper come and take my dad away right now.\"\n\nThe middle-aged man spat out another thick glob of phlegm, then took out his phone.\n\n\"Just transfer the money to me directly. As soon as it comes through, I'll show you my bet.\"\n\n\"This humble Daoist will transfer my fist into your damn face!\"\n\nThe old Daoist balled his fist and smashed it right into the man's forehead.\n\n*Thump!*\n\nThe middle-aged man was completely stunned by the punch, stumbling and falling to the ground. He tried to get up and fight back, but the old Daoist glared at him with eyes as wide as a bull's.\n\nHe lost his nerve.\n\nYou really can't expect a man who'd bet on his own father's life to have much backbone or spirit.\n\n\"You just wait! You hit me, didn't you? I'm calling the police!\"\n\nThe man scrambled to pick up his phone, which had fallen to the ground.\n\n\"Go on, call them. We'll wait,\" said Zhou Ze.\n\nThe man's eyelid twitched. He didn't dare call the police, he really didn't. He snatched his phone, shot the old Daoist a venomous glare, and then retreated into the house, slamming the door and locking it from the inside.\n\nThe old Daoist let out a long breath, turning around somewhat dejectedly to face Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Boss, I'm sorry. I was impulsive.\"\n\n\"It's fine.\" Zhou Ze was unconcerned. He asked, \"Why did you suddenly get so worked up?\"\n\n\"The biggest regret of my life is that when my father was on his deathbed, I was out of town and didn't make it back in time to see him one last time.\n\n\"What that devil's spawn said, it truly sickened me. He's a complete animal. His conscience has been eaten by dogs, making money off his own father's life.\"\n\nZhou Ze flicked the ash from his cigarette and said nothing.\n\n\"Boss, you don't feel anything else?\" the old Daoist asked, pursing his lips. \"Anyone would be disgusted by an animal like that, right?\"\n\n\"I'm an orphan.\"\n\n\"...\" went the old Daoist.\n\nZhou Ze smiled, blew out a smoke ring, and said, \"Actually, I saw a lot of similar things back when I was at the hospital. At first, I couldn't understand it either.\n\n\"I was even furious.\n\n\"There are no filial sons at the bedside of the long-term sick. Of course, there are plenty of unfilial ones, but the vast majority of people really do want to get treatment for their family members.\n\n\"Although the national medical insurance and rural cooperative medical systems are becoming more widespread and medical conditions are improving year by year, if someone really contracts a terminal or critical illness, it's like throwing money into a bottomless pit.\"\n\nZhou Ze tossed his cigarette butt to the ground, mimicking a \"throwing\" motion.\n\n\"A human life is more important than money,\" the old Daoist insisted, holding his ground.\n\n\"A human life is indeed more important than money, and 'life is priceless' is a slogan everyone knows by heart. But the value of anything can actually be measured; it just depends on your perspective.\n\n\"For example, a family goes into massive debt to treat a critically ill elder, reducing an ordinary family to destitution. And then the elder's illness still might not be cured, and they pass away anyway.\n\n\"What happens then to the family's life, the children's education and future?\n\n\"I once encountered a situation where an old man secretly ran away from the hospital. We found him. His son was very filial, willing to sell everything he owned to pay for his father's treatment. He got on his knees and begged his father to go back to the hospital.\n\n\"But the old man didn't want to be a burden to his son. He said either let him go home to wait for death, or he'd run into the road and get hit by a car. In short, he didn't want to stay in the hospital, spending money and dragging his son down.\"\n\nHearing this, the old Daoist pursed his lips.\n\n\"This is the helplessness of life. This kind of helplessness has run through all of history, both here and abroad. People are always forced to face certain trade-offs, and sometimes, those trade-offs are truly cruel.\"\n\nThe old Daoist gave a bitter smile. \"So, are we still calling the police?\"\n\n\"We are. Why wouldn't we?\" Zhou Ze looked at the old Daoist. \"Life can sometimes be helpless, but life should not be desecrated.\n\n\"It can wither away in helplessness, but it shouldn't be churned in a septic tank.\n\n\"Betting on human life, treating the lives of their own kind like fighting cocks, crickets, or dogs, just for kicks and thrills... those people deserve to go to hell.\n\n\"When we get back, I'll give you some hell money. You should burn it.\"\n\nHearing this, the old Daoist subconsciously rubbed his hands together and said sheepishly,\n\n\"Oh, I couldn't possibly accept that. Boss, it's my duty to do things for you. It's only a hundred thousand yuan, right? What's the big deal? Am I that petty of a person?\"\n\nThen, as if afraid Zhou Ze would change his mind, the old Daoist quickly added,\n\n\"But if you insist on giving it, Boss, it wouldn't be right for me to refuse your kindness.\"\n\n\"You're overthinking it. The hell money is for you to burn to gain some netherworld merit. Then you can turn yourself in as an accomplice witness. You participated in the gambling too, but your merit should offset your crime. Coupled with the effect of the hell money, you'll be fine.\"\n\n\"...\" went the old Daoist.\n\nZhou Ze leaned on his cane and started walking. The old Daoist followed behind, crestfallen, probably cursing Zhou Ze in his head over and over again.\n\nJust then, Zhou Ze suddenly stopped.\n\n\"Tired, Boss?\" the old Daoist asked.\n\n*The boss abuses me a thousand times, I treat the boss like my first love.*\n\nThe old Daoist knew the fundamental rule of serving a ghost: otherwise, he might turn you into one, too.\n\n\"There's a problem. What time is it now?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"4:30 in the afternoon,\" the old Daoist said after checking his phone.\n\n\"Then why is the sky so overcast?\" Zhou Ze pointed upward.\n\n\"It's probably going to rain,\" the old Daoist guessed.\n\n\"But the weather forecast said no rain today,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"If the weather forecast predicts an eighty percent chance of rain tomorrow, it just means ten people at the station took a vote, and eight of them thought it would rain, so there's an eighty percent chance of rain.\"\n\n\"Then, what about over there?\" Zhou Ze pointed to the sky in the distance.\n\nThe old Daoist looked and was stunned. Over there, the sky was clear for miles, the sun shining brightly.\n\nThis strange, sharp division in the sky was truly unnerving. This wasn't Yunnan, this wasn't a high plateau; this was the Yangtze River Delta plain. A scene of \"sun in the east, rain in the west\" was still very rare here.\n\n\"Something's wrong,\" Zhou Ze said. He then looked to his right at a large gate with a sign that read \"Xinrui Hospital.\" Inside the gate stood a large clock.\n\nIt was one of those large, decorative clocks, massive in size.\n\nZhou Ze pushed open the gate and walked in, the old Daoist following behind him.\n\n\"Hey, what are you two doing?\"\n\nAt that moment, a hospital security guard approached them.\n\nThis hospital was actually very small, and probably didn't have the proper certifications. All its departments, including the inpatient ward, were housed in a small three-story building. There was only one security guard, but he wasn't some old man; he was a burly man whose face was all muscle, despite the security uniform he wore.\n\n\"Just taking a look,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\n\"What's there to see,\" the guard barked.\n\n\"Hey, what's wrong with you? The hospital's open, but you won't let people in?\" the old Daoist shot back.\n\nEver heard of the fox borrowing the tiger's might?\n\nThis humble Daoist was a dog backed by a ghost's power.\n\n*I'll scare you to death!*\n\nWait, that didn't sound quite right.\n\n\"This isn't a place for seeing a doctor. If you're sick, go somewhere else. And this is private property, no sightseeing allowed. Go on, get out, get out...\"\n\nThe security guard completely ignored the old Daoist and moved to drive them away.\n\nZhou Ze stared at the large clock at the entrance of the hospital's main hall, lost in thought.\n\nThe old Daoist stepped forward, physically blocking the guard, their bodies colliding.\n\n*My boss is doing something very important... well, he's spacing out, but you still can't disturb him!*\n\n\"You want to get physical?\" the guard said, pointing at the old Daoist.\n\n\"Go on, you try it!\" the old Daoist retorted just as fiercely.\n\nWhen it came to fisticuffs, the old Daoist truly wasn't afraid!\n\n\"Do you know what this hospital does?\" Zhou Ze asked, still looking at the clock.\n\n\"None of your damn business. This place is a crematorium, and that has nothing to do with you either. If you know what's good for you, scram. And if you lost money gambling, don't come here making trouble. Go find the bookie!\" the guard yelled.\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\n*So he knows.*\n\nThen Zhou Ze reached out and patted the old Daoist's shoulder.\n\n\"Let's go.\"\n\n\"Boss, why are you so... oh, what a relief. Haha, no fighting is good, no fighting is good. Harmony brings wealth, harmony brings wealth.\"\n\nThe old Daoist laughed it off, then followed Zhou Ze out.\n\nThe security guard glanced at the two men leaving and snorted through his nose.\n\nBack on the street outside, Zhou Ze lit another cigarette.\n\nThe old Daoist was a bit deflated.\n\nHe felt that this boss wasn't as inspiring to follow as the previous one. If it had been the last boss, when that bastard said \"He's my dad,\" the former boss would have probably arranged for the father to see his black-haired son off to the grave.\n\nThis current boss was too by-the-book, too self-disciplined.\n\n\"He's a living person. He's not under my jurisdiction,\" Zhou Ze explained.\n\n\"Mm,\" the old Daoist grunted listlessly.\n\n\"Old Daoist, I really don't like this place,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"This humble Daoist doesn't like it either,\" the old Daoist echoed.\n\n\"What time is it?\" Zhou Ze asked again.\n\n\"Four forty-three.\"\n\nZhou Ze held the cigarette between his fingers, nodded, and said,\n\n\"It's about to come out.\"\n\n...\n\nThe security guard picked up his walkie-talkie. \"Hey, monitoring room, it's me. I chased off those two guys who just came in. They didn't seem like they were here to cause trouble over losing money.\"\n\nJust as he finished speaking, the walkie-talkie suddenly erupted with a dense burst of static.\n\n\"Hello? Hello?\" The guard tapped the walkie-talkie. \"What a piece of junk.\"\n\n*Dong... Dong...*\n\nThe large clock beside him began to chime.\n\nThe guard instinctively turned his head, then frowned. He scratched his head and leaned in closer. *Damn it, it's not on the hour. Why are you chiming?*\n\nFour forty-three... and four minutes.\n\nJust then, the guard suddenly saw the gears inside the great clock grinding against each other. The sound was loud and terrifying,\n\nand it carried with it the texture of juices being crushed and splattered, like a huge slab of pork being ground in a blender.\n\nThe guard was completely bewildered and took an involuntary step back.\n\nAnd then,\n\nhe saw, from within the great clock,\n\na hand slowly reaching out.\n\nThe hand looked as if it had just been crushed by gears; it was a bloody, mangled mess, covered in a dense layer of tiny holes.\n\nMaggots peeked their heads in and out of the holes.\n\nThis image\n\nwas an absolute nightmare for anyone with trypophobia.\n\nThe temperature all around\n\nplummeted in an instant,\n\ngiving one the illusion of having been dropped into an ice cellar.\n\nThe guard began to tremble uncontrollably. He wanted to run, he wanted to scream, but his legs felt as if they were filled with lead, unable to move at all.\n\nThe hand slowly closed around the guard's neck.\n\nA terrifying strength emanated from the arm, pulling the guard closer to the large clock.\n\nThe guard's face was pressed against the clock's outer casing, his features nearly distorting.\n\nA grim, trembling voice came from the walkie-talkie:\n\n\"What... time... is it... Am... I... supposed... to be dead... yet?\"",

    "content": "Tick… tock… tick… tock… tick… tock…\n\nThe hands of the clock were moving.\n\nFew people ever paid attention to this subtle change. People always talked about cherishing time, chanting that an inch of time is an inch of gold, but those who truly did so were few and far between.\n\nBut many people have had this kind of experience: suddenly, you fall silent and hear the \"tick-tock\" of the clock's hands. You can clearly perceive time slipping quietly away, and along with it, your life.\n\nThis was a quiet that was terrifying the more you thought about it, a quiet that gave you goosebumps. In the great unseen, it was as if there truly was a Book of Life and Death that had already recorded the fates of all people.\n\nPeople lived merely to walk through this process.\n\nAs recorded in the Book of Life and Death, they were born.\n\nAnd as recorded in the Book of Life and Death, they would die.\n\nThis was the great terror hidden within time.\n\nIn the basement of the Unlicensed Hospital, the space wasn't very large, but it was divided into small rooms, each containing a bed.\n\nSome beds had people lying in them.\n\nSome beds had people lying in them until recently.\n\nAnd some beds were waiting for the next person to lie down.\n\nThis place wasn't hell, but it carried the rasping breath of the Grim Reaper.\n\nAll around, doctors and nurses moved about ceaselessly. But here, in this hospital, they were not the angels in white known for saving the dying and healing the injured.\n\nThey merely observed, recorded, and logged the data of each target, then uploaded it to the internet in real-time.\n\nIt was like soccer betting, where the odds constantly change. A star player on a team is suddenly injured, the head coach is abruptly replaced—all sorts of on- and off-field variables could cause the odds to shift.\n\nIt was the same here. Each person's vital signs would be eagerly and carefully read by gamblers sitting in front of their computer screens.\n\nThey probably never read their own parents' medical records with this much focus.\n\nFrom the real-time video surveillance, from between the lines of the various data points, they sought their own judgment and threw down their chips.\n\nThis was a game of betting on lives. What the gamblers gained here was not just the return on their odds, but also the thrill of controlling life.\n\nAnd this thrill was built upon the trampling of their own kind.\n\nA woman who had been lying on a bed suddenly struggled to sit up for some unknown reason. At that moment, the nearby doctors and nurses were in the middle of a shift change, and the staff in the monitoring room might have been slacking off, as no alert was issued for the woman's unusual movement.\n\nThe woman pulled out the tubes in her body. She struggled to get out of bed, but ended up rolling directly onto the floor.\n\nShe was much younger than the others on the beds, looking to be only in her thirties or forties, but her body was clearly severely swollen. Her calves were unimaginably thick, almost swollen into a single block.\n\nShe couldn't stand up. Every day, even her food intake was quantitatively and qualitatively fixed, with no excess allowed. This was for the sake of fairness.\n\nThe fairness people pursued was most thoroughly implemented and carried out in this regard.\n\nShe was crawling.\n\nShe was crawling with all her might.\n\nShe crawled to the doorway. The door was ajar. She pushed it open with effort and continued to crawl out. She was like Sadako climbing out of the TV—white clothes, messy hair—but she was still alive.\n\nOf course, she wouldn't be for much longer. The candle of her life had already begun to flicker, soon to be extinguished.\n\nShe was very lucky. She crawled out of the narrow sickroom, into the hallway, and to the office door. Along the way, no one passed by, and no one discovered her.\n\nShe placed her hand on the office door. She wanted to ask the doctors inside to let her make a phone call.\n\nThere was an electronic clock in her room that displayed the date and time.\n\nToday was her son's fifth birthday.\n\nShe had to remind her husband to celebrate their son's birthday.\n\nThinking of her son, a faint smile appeared on her lips. Her son was her deepest bond. After carrying him for ten months, what half-decent mother wouldn't love her own child?\n\nShe had this incurable disease. Her family was not well-off to begin with, and her husband was a gambler with no job. The family had relied on her working outside to support them, and now she had contracted an illness that modern medicine could do nothing about.\n\nShe couldn't bear to spend their already meager savings on her own treatment. Her son needed to go to kindergarten, to go to school. He needed money, now and in the future.\n\nHer husband knelt before her and asked her to come here.\n\nShe knew what this place was. She knew what the two cameras in her room were for.\n\nShe agreed. She consented.\n\nDying at home was still dying, and dying here was still dying. She knew she had become a betting chip, but at least by being this chip, the platform would give her family a large sum of money.\n\nThe family needed money. Her child, as he grew up, would also need money.\n\nHer husband knelt before her and promised that he would turn over a new leaf, be a good person, a good father, and raise their son well.\n\nShe knew she was about to die.\n\nShe had been staring at the clock.\n\nShe wanted to hold on.\n\nTo hold on long enough to remind her husband to celebrate their son's birthday. She had to hold on until this day.\n\nThis was the reason she lay in her sickbed, unable to receive any treatment, not even painkillers, enduring the agony of her illness every day, yet still clinging to that last breath, not dying.\n\nShe pushed the door.\n\nIt wouldn't budge.\n\nShe was already exhausted.\n\nThere was no strength left in her body.\n\nAnd from within the office came the sounds of an argument.\n\nThe voices of the two people arguing were very familiar. One was the head doctor who checked on her three times a day—morning, noon, and night—and the other was her husband.\n\nShe smiled.\n\nHer husband was actually here.\n\nThen she could tell him about their son's birthday in person.\n\nShe could also ask her husband to pass on a few words to their son. As a mother, she would be in heaven, always accompanying her child as he grew up.\n\n\"Why isn't she dead yet? Why isn't she dead!\" her husband roared.\n\n\"How should I know? Your own wife isn't dying, and you're blaming us?\" That was the doctor's voice.\n\n\"But I bet two hundred thousand that she would die last week. I thought she wouldn't make it past last week.\"\n\n\"Your wife's vitality is astounding. It could be considered a medical miracle. She's been off medication for so long, any ordinary person would have given up long ago.\"\n\n\"It was you! You told me she would die last week! That's why I dared to bet two hundred thousand. Two hundred thousand!\"\n\n\"Let go of me! Let me go! Are you out of your mind? I'm not the King of Hell. I can't control who lives and who dies.\"\n\n\"If you can't control it, why did you give me that tip? And take a kickback from me? You did this to ruin me! Do you know? That two hundred thousand was the money my wife traded her life for!\"\n\n\"If you keep this up, I'm calling security.\"\n\n\"Help me out. I'll bet another hundred thousand. Just make her die this week, okay? Give her a secret injection, make her die this week. That way I can break even, and even make a profit!\"\n\n\"Bet another hundred thousand? Where did you get another hundred thousand?\"\n\n\"I sold my son! For a hundred thousand yuan! Once I win this bet and make my money back, I'll buy my son back. Doctor, please help me. Just secretly get rid of her. Otherwise, my wife will be gone, and my son will be gone too!\"\n\n\"Heh, you're really one of a kind. Sorry, we have rules here, and surveillance cameras. I won't do something like that.\"\n\n\"Then what do I do? What do I do? Oh, right, Doctor, let me see her. Let me see her just once. Which room is she in? I'll go see her. I'll make her die, this week. She'll understand! If she doesn't die, I can't get our son back, and all the family's money will be gone. She likes me a lot, and she loves her son very much. As long as you let me see her, she'll definitely be willing to die for our son. Doctor, I'm begging you. Doctor, I'm begging you, Doctor.\"\n\n\"This is against the rules. We're not some shady back-alley operation. We're very professional. And because we're professional, we have the most clients betting with us.\"\n\n\"Here, take this, take this. When you do your rounds, pass on a message for me. Then you can place a bet too. Trust me, she'll die. She'll be willing.\"\n\nThe two men's voices continued.\n\nBut the woman outside the door…\n\nwas no longer breathing.\n\nHer eyes, however,\n\nwere wide open.\n\nOn the closed door,\n\nthere remained a series of scratches—marks scraped by her fingernails.\n\n………………\n\nOutside the hospital, Zhou Ze and the old Daoist stood there.\n\n\"Lao Dao, do you have any more of that talisman paper?\"\n\n\"Nope. Ancestral heirlooms, all gone now. Used the last two slapping that hair in the bookstore.\"\n\nThe old Daoist said with great sincerity, \"If I still had any, Boss, I'd definitely give them to you.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\nThe old Daoist let out a long sigh, then subconsciously reached down to touch his crotch.\n\nThe next moment,\n\nhis crotch suddenly became scalding hot.\n\nIt was so hot that the old Daoist leaped into the air, hastily reaching into his pants to pull out a fiery red talisman paper.\n\n\"Ooh ooh ooh… sss sss sss… so hot, so hot.\"\n\nWhile patting his crotch, the old Daoist saw Zhou Ze looking at him and immediately said:\n\n\"Hahahaha, Boss, isn't it amazing? I actually forgot I had one more in my pants. The very last one, really the last one.\"\n\n\"I wasn't going to ask you for it,\" said Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\n\"I was going to remind you that a very powerful ghost, returning on her seventh day, will be here soon. Her resentment might be quite heavy. If your talisman paper was still hidden in your crotch, it might get very painful.\"\n\nThe old Daoist's face immediately twisted into a pained knot.\n\n\"Boss, why didn't you say so sooner?\"\n\n\"You said you were out, so I believed you.\"\n\n\"...\" said the old Daoist.\n\nContinuously rubbing his crotch to dispel the burning sensation, the old Daoist looked at the hospital ahead. The light inside seemed to have dimmed considerably. Even though the old Daoist had little in the way of Daoist arts, he could still feel that something had happened in the hospital.\n\n\"Lao Dao, what's your take on it?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nThe old Daoist froze for a moment.\n\n*What do you mean, what's my take on it?*\n\n*Are you the ghost or am I the ghost?*\n\n*Are you the Emissary of Hell or am I?*\n\n*The place is haunted, and you're asking me for my take?*\n\n*What kind of pointless question is that!*\n\nBut the old Daoist immediately put on a serious and solemn expression and replied:\n\n\"Boss, there must be something strange afoot here!\"\n\n\"Heh.\"\n\nThe old Daoist felt a bit baffled.\n\nAfter a while, seeing that Zhou Ze had no intention of walking in, he said, \"Boss, this group of scumbags, they're definitely scumbags. They're not worth helping.\"\n\nThe old Daoist was worried that Zhou Ze would walk right in to capture the ghost.\n\nHe knew Zhou Ze's personality. He was a stickler for the rules, completely different from his previous boss.\n\n\"We tried to go in, but the security guard inside kicked us out,\" said Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Hmm?\"\n\n\"This vengeful ghost's seventh-day return carries immense resentment, so it's very unusual. Moreover, in this place, people are constantly dying while staring at the clock. Layers upon layers of resentment have been continuously stacking up, and it all landed on this one ghost. That's why her seventh-day return is so spectacular. She even possesses the ability to harm ordinary people.\"\n\n\"That fierce?\" The old Daoist smacked his lips. Why did he feel… a little excited?\n\nIt would be for the best if those scumbags and turtle-grandsons were dealt with. Serves them right!\n\n\"Actually, she wouldn't have become this exaggerated all at once,\" Zhou Ze added.\n\n\"Then what happened?\" The old Daoist looked around. \"Is there some other mysterious figure around here pushing things along?\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\nThe old Daoist's eyes widened instantly, and he said in a low voice, \"Can we find them, Boss?\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head.\n\n\"Then what do we do? What if that person has ulterior motives?\" The old Daoist was a little anxious.\n\n\"That person probably severed the bond between the large clock and the female ghost. It's equivalent to opening the cage that was holding her. This is a vicious ghost unleashed. If that security guard hadn't stopped me, I could have prevented this from happening. Sigh.\"\n\n\"Don't...\" The old Daoist started to say, then gave an awkward smile. \"Boss, how about... I go in with you right now?\"\n\nThe boss wanted to catch ghosts to boost his performance record; the old Daoist could only choose to follow.\n\n\"Let's not go. The security guard is too fierce, and too beefy. The two of us, one old man and one disabled person, we can't beat him.\"\n\n\"I can...\" The old Daoist was about to volunteer. That security guard looked tough, but Lao Dao was confident he could handle him. Besides, who knows what the ghost inside had done to him by now.\n\nBut a scene suddenly flashed through the old Daoist's mind.\n\nThe boss had just said someone severed the bond between the female ghost and the large clock, letting the vicious ghost out of its cage.\n\nThe old Daoist remembered that while he was bickering and quarreling with the security guard,\n\nthe boss, standing behind him in front of the large clock, seemed to have flicked the clock with his fingernail.\n\nThat's right.\n\nHe remembered it clearly!\n\n\"Boss, I can't beat him. I'm old, no good anymore.\"\n\nThe old Daoist feigned dejection, even giving Zhou Ze a wink.\n\nZhou Ze remained noncommittal.\n\nHe raised a hand to his mouth,\n\nto his fingernails,\n\nand gently,\n\nblew on them…",

    "content": "\"Aaaah!!!\"\n\n\"Aaaaaaah!!!!!\"\n\n\"Aaaaaaah!!!!!\"\n\nScreams echoed incessantly from within the small hospital. The old Taoist stood at the entrance, watching numerous people in white coats run out as if something was chasing them.\n\nBut they were only running in circles in the small courtyard, constantly falling and getting back up, seemingly unable to see the door at all. No one actually made it out.\n\n\"Is this... a ghost wall?\"¹ the old Taoist asked, looking at Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze ignored him and continued to watch.\n\nHe saw a woman, relentlessly chasing people and asking:\n\n\"Is it time for me to die yet?\"\n\n\"What time is it?\"\n\n\"Am I supposed to die now?\"\n\nShe was frantic,\n\nshe was anxious,\n\nshe was lost,\n\nas if, if she didn't die at the appointed time, her son couldn't be bought back,\n\nif she didn't die at the scheduled time, her family would be shattered,\n\nif she didn't die at the scheduled time, she would have committed a grave mistake!\n\nThe more Zhou Ze watched, the more his brow furrowed.\n\nThe old Taoist couldn't see what was happening inside, so he was completely baffled. But watching a group of living people scream and run around, constantly tripping, was quite amusing—like watching monkeys in a circus. Moreover, a few of the female nurses were wearing skirts, and as they ran and fell, their clothes tore, revealing tantalizing sights:\n\nLace,\n\nfrills,\n\nand even Peppa Pig!\n\nThe old Taoist, on the principle of claiming a little interest back on behalf of the victims, stared so hard his eyeballs were about to pop out, looking exactly where he wasn't supposed to look.\n\nFinally, Zhou Ze couldn't watch anymore. He truly couldn't stand it.\n\n\"Truly... a pig teammate.\"²\n\nHearing this, the old Taoist froze for a moment. He instantly felt deeply wronged, his old, wrinkled face puckering up like a tender chrysanthemum.\n\nBoss, you don't have to be so harsh, do you?\n\nI was just looking...\n\nYou don't look, you're not interested, you can't get h... uh... but I'm still normal!\n\nZhou Ze reached out to the old Taoist for a lighter, just in time to see the old man's pitiable, wronged expression. As if understanding something, he smiled and said:\n\n\"I wasn't talking about you.\"\n\n\"Then who were you talking about?\" The old Taoist was genuinely confused.\n\n\"Her.\"\n\nWith that, Zhou Ze pushed open the door and walked in, leaning on his cane.\n\nThe old Taoist followed him in. He'd go wherever the Boss went. After all, no matter how awesome the Boss was, he still needed a sidekick to loot bodies and shout \"6666.\"³\n\nThe old Taoist had always been very clear about his role.\n\nHowever, the moment he followed the Boss inside, the old Taoist felt a chill run through his entire body. It was like someone gently sliding their cold hands down your back while you're fast asleep, giving you a fingertip tour.\n\nThe shock of it...\n\ndirectly scared the old Taoist's limp sack down there into shrinking into a large walnut.\n\nImmediately after, a female nurse suddenly ran up to the old Taoist and fell right in front of him. The old Taoist hurriedly bent down to help her up.\n\n\"Are you alright? Are you alright?\"\n\nAs he helped her up, his hands instinctively tried to cop a feel.\n\nMm, this was also delivering justice on behalf of heaven!\n\nHowever, to the old Taoist's surprise, the soft, yielding feeling he'd anticipated never came. Instead, with the force he exerted, his hand plunged directly into the nurse's chest.\n\n\"*Hiss...*\"\n\nThe old Taoist instantly sucked in a cold breath in terror and began to back away, but the female nurse clung to him like a maggot on a bone.\n\n\"Holy crap, Boss, help! Help me!\"\n\nThe female nurse in his arms abruptly raised her head.\n\nHer face began to grow coarse and swollen, pockmarked with craters. Plump maggots and crawling insects squirmed within, visiting each other's holes, weaving in and out.\n\nShe grinned, revealing a mouth full of yellow teeth. A large, fleshy tumor poked out from her mouth. The tumor was a yellowish-green, looking as if it might burst and splatter at any moment.\n\n\"What time is it? Is it time for me to die yet?\" the female nurse asked the old Taoist.\n\nThe old Taoist was so scared he kept fumbling at his crotch, only then realizing he'd thrown away the paper talisman that had been making his crotch feel hot earlier.\n\nThis action successfully caught the female nurse's attention. Her hand shot out and grabbed the old Taoist's crotch.\n\n\"Ooooooohhhhh!!!!!\"\n\nThe old Taoist felt his junk, which had already shrunk from a gluten stick to a caterpillar, instantly shrivel another huge degree.\n\nThat walnut was about to freeze into a marble.\n\nSo cold.\n\nThe female nurse's hand was so cold.\n\nSo cold the old Taoist absolutely couldn't bear it.\n\nThe sensation was like stripping naked on a Himalayan peak at sunrise to pole dance.\n\nThrilling and fatal!\n\nThe old Taoist hurriedly raised both hands. No one was holding a gun to him, but someone was holding *his* gun.\n\nSo, surrendering was an instinctive reaction.\n\nBoss!\n\nWhere the hell did you go?\n\nYour loyal old Taoist is about to lose his family line!\n\n\"Enough!\"\n\nZhou Ze's voice rang out.\n\nThe old Taoist felt that Zhou Ze's voice at that moment was more beautiful than any female celebrity's on TV. It was a pity he couldn't see where the Boss was standing, or he would have rushed over and planted a big kiss on him!\n\n\"*Dong... Dong...*\"\n\nThe bell tolled the signal to return home.\n\nAll the surrounding scenery vanished. The terrifying cold at the old Taoist's crotch also began to fade, leaving only a sore, numb aftereffect. He was so frightened he was on the verge of collapse and dropped straight to his knees.\n\nHe lifted his head and saw Zhou Ze standing next to a large clock up ahead.\n\nIn Zhou Ze's hand was a clock hand he had just snapped off.\n\n\"*Zzzzt... zzzzzzzzt...*\"\n\nA fine, grating friction sound came from the concrete floor, like the noise of a broken electrical wire, but it was piercing and made one's scalp tingle.\n\nThe old Taoist looked around. Lying all around him were several doctors and nurses, including that thuggish-looking security guard. They lay motionless on the ground—not dead, but fainted from fright.\n\n\"Tell me... what time is it... Is it time for me to die yet?\"\n\nFrom behind the large clock, a woman in white crawled out. With a blank expression, she first stared at the old Taoist, making him shudder again. Then, he casually extended a finger and pointed at Zhou Ze on the other side.\n\nThere.\n\nBig sister,\n\nthe main boss is over there. You go fight the main boss first; I'm just a small fry.\n\nThe ghost was quite accommodating, turning her head to look at Zhou Ze on the other side.\n\nThen, she began to crawl towards Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze looked at her, very disappointed.\n\nTruly disappointed.\n\nIn his past life, Zhou Ze had been a doctor. He had always abided by his professional ethics. Although he didn't harbor grand dreams of \"saving all of humanity\" or a spirit of selfless dedication, in his work, he had always upheld the principle of \"people first.\"\n\nThis small hospital was a microcosm of this street, a microcosm of this black market gambling chain. It made Zhou Ze feel oppressed and very uncomfortable.\n\nIt was the kind of discomfort where if you didn't do something about it, you felt you wouldn't be able to sleep well that night.\n\nAnd these doctors and nurses now passed out on the ground—if one were to guess, they likely graduated from proper medical schools or nursing colleges. They had their own professional skills and were by no means frauds filling a quota.\n\nBut this group of people had violated their ethics, violated the fundamental duties of a doctor. They had learned the skills to treat illnesses and save lives, yet they stood beside dying patients merely to record a series of cold data.\n\nThen,\n\nthey would watch coldly as the patient died, never intervening, because providing treatment and medication would affect the fairness of the gamble.\n\nThere's a saying popular within medical circles: Persuade someone to study medicine, and may you be struck by lightning.\n\nThe work of most doctors is far from the leisurely and comfortable job society generally imagines it to be. The vast majority of medical staff face great dangers every day, from exposure to infection on the operating table, to heavy workloads, and even... violent disputes with patients' families.⁴\n\nBut once you've put on these pure white clothes, you must be worthy of your identity.\n\nThat's right,\n\nZhou Ze wanted them to die.\n\nWhether out of impulse or a sense of indignation, just a moment ago, Zhou Ze had truly wished that all this scum of the profession would go to hell!\n\nTo toy with human life, to find entertainment in it—this was a blasphemy against life itself. And Zhou Ze, as someone who had died once before, understood the value of cherishing life even more.\n\nSince you treat human lives as tools for cockfighting and dogfighting, then I can stop seeing you as human.\n\nThe old Taoist could beat that thuggish-looking security guard. And though Zhou Ze leaned on a cane, with one swipe of his fingernail, even an ox would be brought to its knees.\n\nBut Zhou Ze had simply backed out naturally, claiming \"can't afford to offend, can't afford to offend.\"\n\nThere were some things he couldn't conveniently act on himself, so he wanted to watch the fire from the other side of the river, to be a bystander on the wall.\n\nHe was indulging it, he was being passive.\n\nHis goal,\n\nwas to kill with a borrowed knife.\n\nYou were bound to become a vengeful ghost anyway. You can no longer enter the cycle of reincarnation. Even if you went to hell, you could only endure the endless karmic flames until your soul was scattered.\n\nSo,\n\nwhy not give you a chance\n\nto clean up this garbage heap?\n\nYou'd get your satisfaction,\n\nand I'd get mine.\n\nAnd it would let some of the smog in this sky dissipate.\n\nBut this woman before him...\n\nwas like a complete idiot!\n\nZhou Ze had given her the opportunity, even secretly given her a push. She was much more powerful than an ordinary vengeful ghost and had the ability to get revenge.\n\nBut her so-called revenge was just to scare people until they fainted?\n\nWhen they wake up, they'll be good as new?\n\n\"*Zzzzt... zzzzt... zzzzt...*\"\n\nThe ghost continued to crawl towards Zhou Ze, then looked at him pitifully and asked:\n\n\"What time is it? Is it time for me to die yet?\n\nI'm begging you,\n\ntell me, tell me...\"\n\nZhou Ze slowly bent down, looked at the ghost's cratered face, and asked:\n\n\"Don't you hate?\"\n\nYes, don't you hate?\n\n\"What time is it?\" the ghost continued to ask.\n\nZhou Ze pointed again at the unconscious nurses and doctors below and asked: \"You don't want revenge?\"\n\nThey put you on a cold bed and watched you die. You don't want to get revenge on them? You don't want to get revenge on those gamblers and bettors, on the bookies counting their money gleefully behind the scenes, on the husband who personally pushed you into the abyss of despair?\n\n\"Just tell me what time it is! I'm calculating whether I should be dead yet. Only if I'm dead can we get the money. Only then can my husband get the money, the family have money, and my son be bought back.\n\nHurry up and tell me, tell me, what time is it, what time is it!\n\nI have to die at the scheduled time. My family needs money. My son needs money to grow up, he needs money for school, he'll need money to get married later.\n\nWhat time is it?!\n\nHurry and tell me, tell me!!!!\"\n\nThe ghost seemed enraged by Zhou Ze's repeated refusal to answer her. She became incomparably furious, so angry she wanted to strangle Zhou Ze!\n\nZhou Ze was stunned for a moment.\n\nThis ghost...\n\nshe held no murderous intent for those doctors and nurses,\n\nbut she held murderous intent for *him*?\n\nFor a moment, Zhou Ze really felt like laughing. And then he did.\n\n\"Heh heh heh...\"\n\nAs he laughed, Zhou Ze slowly stood up.\n\nThe ghost instinctively lunged at Zhou Ze.\n\n\"What are you laughing at? Answer me! What time is it!\"\n\nZhou Ze reached out, his fingernail plunging directly into the center of the ghost's brow. The ghost let out a blood-curdling shriek. Zhou Ze's nail felt like a soldering iron, inflicting horrific pain upon her.\n\n\"Boss?\" The old Taoist walked over.\n\nZhou Ze closed his eyes. He thought of the old woman who had come to the bookstore that night, who had wailed with unwillingness after discovering she had already died ahead of schedule. He thought of the old man he'd seen earlier, who was being watched over by his son as he lay in bed, waiting for the right time to die.\n\nHuman life is precious, but the prerequisite is that one must know how to cherish and respect it.\n\nYour life is your own. If you don't cherish it yourself, you can't blame others for looking down on it!\n\nZhou Ze shook his head,\n\nand said:\n\n\"Old Taoist, I think I did something wrong. It seems I've been a bit of a meddler.\"\n\n\"Hm?\" The old Taoist still didn't understand.\n\nZhou Ze opened his eyes, glanced at the unconscious doctors and nurses on the ground, and said:\n\n\"I've discovered that I don't hate this bunch as much as I did before.\"\n\n\"Uh, why? They're a bunch of animals,\" said the old Taoist.\n\nZhou Ze looked at the ghost writhing and struggling under his hand,\n\nand said:\n\nYes.\n\nThey are undoubtedly animals.\n\nBut a pitiful person must also have their hateful aspects.\n\n***\n\n**Footnotes:**\n\n¹ **Ghost wall (鬼打牆, guǐ dǎ qiáng):** Literally \"ghost-built wall,\" a supernatural phenomenon in Chinese folklore where a person walks in circles, unable to find their way out of a place, as if trapped by invisible walls.\n\n² **Pig teammate (豬隊友, zhū duìyǒu):** A common slang term, especially popular in gaming, for a useless or incompetent teammate who hinders their own side.\n\n³ **Looting bodies and shouting '6666':** Gaming slang. \"Looting bodies\" refers to **添包 (tiān bāo)**, the act of taking gear from a defeated opponent's inventory in games like PUBG. **\"6666\"** is numeric slang for **溜溜溜 (liù liù liù)**, which sounds like words for \"smooth\" or \"skilled,\" used to praise impressive play.\n\n⁴ **Violent disputes with patients' families (醫鬧, yī nào):** A term for disputes, often escalating to violence or organized harassment, between patients or their families and medical staff/hospitals, a significant and widely reported social issue in China.",

    "content": "Under Zhou Ze's nails, the female ghost's spiritual form was so battered that it began to turn transparent and ethereal.\n\nShe was in pain, she was suffering, she was pitiful. But as for Zhou Ze, while he could have tried to use her as a borrowed knife to kill, he could never let her leave the hospital, much less allow her to escape his sight and control.\n\nNow, she had failed to serve as the knife, so all he could do was send her where she belonged.\n\nThe Gate of Hell opened.\n\nZhou Ze grabbed the female ghost's shoulder with one hand and tossed her straight in. Having been grievously wounded by his nails, she had neither the room nor the power to resist.\n\nHe clapped his hands and took out his credential booklet; the progress had risen to twenty-five percent.\n\nThe yield from this female ghost was quite high. It wasn't just because Zhou Ze had taken advantage of the situation; it was because this ghost was a freakish creature born from the coalesced resentment of the many who had died on this street.\n\nIt was just a shame she lacked the brutality of the powerful specter she was supposed to be. A classic case of her style not matching her status.\n\nLeaning on his cane, Zhou Ze started to walk out. He didn't want to stay here any longer, unwilling to linger in a place that made even a Hell Emissary like him feel uncomfortable and depressed.\n\nThe Old Daoist followed him. When they reached the end of the street, the Old Daoist subconsciously glanced back. Inside, there were several other small hospitals and clinics like it, and of course, many more illicit operations hidden in the corners.\n\nThis was the mortal realm, yet it was more like one of Hell's incinerators.\n\nIn the unseen sky, it was as if chimneys rose one after another, smoke drifting from them. And the people lying in bed, painfully waiting to die, were like cart after cart of coal cinders being fed into the furnaces.\n\n\"Boss, back to the bookstore?\" the Old Daoist asked.\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"Boss, it's not worth getting angry over something like that. It's better to just let it go. That female ghost was actually quite pitiful. At the very least, she was a good mother.\"\n\n\"That's precisely what I find so tragic.\"\n\n\"Boss, you said that behind every pitiful person, there is a hateful quality. I don't agree. I think what she did was right. She was going to die anyway, so she might as well sell herself before she died to leave some income for her family. It's just human nature. Although a human life can't be bought or sold, when it really comes down to it, using your last bit of residual value is actually understandable.\n\n\"Besides, what she did didn't hurt anyone else. It was a matter of mutual consent, really.\"\n\n\"Old Daoist, have you ever been arrested by the police?\" Zhou Ze suddenly asked.\n\n\"Er, a few times, that was because...\"\n\n\"Ever been caught in an anti-vice raid?\"\n\n\"Uh, no, not that. I was lucky. To be honest, sometimes it was nerve-wracking. After all, at my age, even though my intention was to care for those fallen women—my heart was in the right place—I was still afraid of being misunderstood by outsiders.\n\n\"You know, in this world, when you want to do things, especially good things, you're always easily subjected to criticism.\"\n\n\"Then do you think anti-vice raids are right or wrong?\"\n\n\"Well...\" The Old Daoist didn't know how to answer.\n\n\"By your logic, the prostitutes are willing, they need money. And you have your needs, and you pay. Both parties get what they want. On what grounds do the police stick their noses in other people's business?\"\n\nThe Old Daoist didn't know how to refute that.\n\n\"Even in the United States, which prides itself on being free and open, prostitution is illegal in every state except for Nevada, which neighbors Los Angeles.\n\n\"The law is, in fact, a society's final moral baseline. And your so-called 'caring for the fallen,'\n\n\"It may seem like both parties getting what they want by mutual consent, but if it were legalized or brought into the open, do you know how many prostitution rings it would spawn? Many women would even be forced into prostitution. Even in an environment where it's illegal, there are already many cases of forced prostitution.\n\n\"India is a country that advocates for the legality of individual prostitution. And you know what India's rape rate is like.\"\n\n\"Those are two different things...\" the Old Daoist tried to explain.\n\n\"Two different things?\"\n\nZhou Ze smiled.\n\nHe pointed a finger at the street behind them and continued:\n\n\"This is just the tip of the iceberg that we can see. You know, the flame of sin might start as just a tiny flicker. A moth is willing to fly into it; the fire is willing to burn it. The moth made its own choice.\n\n\"But when the fire grows larger and larger, it's no longer content with just incinerating the moths that fly to it willingly. It will start burning nearby houses, burning nearby forests, and eventually, it will brew a great disaster.\n\n\"In the end, aren't those moths that first fed the flame and helped it grow also among the chief culprits?\n\n\"When this industry matures and continues to expand, who can guarantee that bloodier and more stimulating forms of gambling won't appear? And what's more, when the supply of willing moths runs out, won't those who are addicted to this game, those platforms that are used to reaping huge profits from it, resort to forcing and coercing people to find new chips to continue the game?\n\n\"Half a year from now,\n\n\"A year from now,\n\n\"Three years from now,\n\n\"This ever-growing and maturing black market industry snatches an innocent person, creates some similar conditions, and holds another death gamble.\n\n\"Would that person have the right to curse those damn fools who, at the very beginning, willingly joined this game as chips for money?\"\n\nThe Old Daoist smacked his lips. He felt that what the boss said seemed to make a lot of sense, but he still felt something was off. He braced himself and retorted:\n\n\"Boss, I think the real culprits are the organizers, the house.\"\n\n\"When the avalanche comes, no snowflake is innocent.\"\n\n...\n\nIt was already dark when they returned to the bookstore. Because he wasn't in a good mood, Zhou Ze had walked back, which took quite a while.\n\nThe bookstore door was open. Tang Shi was sitting behind the bar, and a man and a woman were sitting in the shop, reading.\n\n\"Where's Bai Yingying?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"She went upstairs to play games. I'm watching the store for her for a bit. She's been watching it all day,\" Tang Shi said nonchalantly.\n\nZhou Ze was speechless. It seemed he would have to limit that gaming-addicted girl's screen time. How dare she leave the store in Tang Shi's hands? Wasn't she afraid that if something really happened, the bookstore would turn into a river of blood?\n\n\"You guys were out for quite a while. By the way, where's the Old Daoist?\" Tang Shi found it strange that the Old Daoist hadn't returned to the bookstore with Zhou Ze.\n\n\"He went to the police station to file a report,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\n\"Want something to drink? A cocktail?\"\n\n\"You know how to make them?\"\n\nTang Shi didn't answer, simply starting to mix the drink herself. Her movements were swift and practiced. Soon, a cocktail was placed in front of Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Give it a try.\"\n\nZhou Ze picked up the glass, took a sip, and then nodded.\n\n\"Very good.\"\n\n\"Thanks.\" Tang Shi sat back down in her chair, holding a book titled *The Origin of Hell*.\n\n\"Is this book from the store?\" Zhou Ze didn't recognize it, and there was no publisher listed.\n\n\"It's his book. A fantasy novel from his middle-school-syndrome phase. You can read it for fun to pass the time.\"\n\nZhou Ze carried his drink up the stairs. Just as he pushed open the bedroom door, he saw Bai Yingying at the computer desk, wearing headphones and speaking excitedly, as if arguing with her teammates.\n\nIt seemed the other side didn't know she was a girl at first, only realizing when she turned on her mic during the argument. They seemed to have said something else.\n\n\"Heh heh, you want me to play with you?\"\n\nNot knowing Zhou Ze was standing behind her, Bai Yingying lowered her voice and said in a cutesy, coquettish tone:\n\n\"Hey little bro, ever slept with a corpse? The kind that whimpers 'ying ying ying'~\n\n\"Go sleep with your moms, you morons! This lady is old enough to be your great-great-grandmother!\"\n\nThen, Bai Yingying took off her headphones, tossed them contemptuously onto the desk, leaned back slightly in her chair, propped a long, slender leg up, and casually took a pack of women's cigarettes from her pocket. She expertly tapped the filter on the desk, put a cigarette in her mouth, and with a friction of her fingertips, a spark appeared and lit it.\n\n\"That's a nice way to light a cigarette,\" Zhou Ze commented. \"Can you teach me?\"\n\n\"Go ask your mom to teach you, this lady doesn't have time—\"\n\nBai Yingying's words trailed off. She suddenly took a deep breath, quickly stubbed out the cigarette in her hand, stood up, and bowed her head toward Zhou Ze, greeting him in a soft, gentle voice:\n\n\"Boss, you're back.\"\n\nZhou Ze sat down in the chair Bai Yingying had just been in. It was still warm. He took a cigarette from the pack and lit it. Women's cigarettes. He took a drag and frowned slightly; this brand was a bit too light for him.\n\n\"Been tough holding it in?\"\n\nZhou Ze turned to look at the female corpse.\n\nHe didn't know when it started, but he had grown somewhat accustomed to having the docile Bai Yingying by his side, whimpering \"ying ying ying.\"\n\nHe seemed to have forgotten the terror and intimidation she had brought upon him and Xu Qinglang when she first woke up in the bookstore. Zhou Ze was also a bit dazed, wondering which was the real her.\n\n\"No, that's not it, Boss. Please don't misunderstand. In your presence, Yingying will truly only be demure and gentle. Boss, you should actually be aware of this yourself.\n\n\"You're also a type of vampire, and what's more, your bloodline is much higher than mine.\"\n\nZhou Ze narrowed his eyes and said:\n\n\"But in my last life, I was just a doctor, just an ordinary person. I've always wondered about something. I've already died once and changed bodies. If it were merely a matter of bloodline, that should have been ruled out. Otherwise, there's only one explanation left: Xu Le himself was a vampire. But that doesn't make sense either.\"\n\n\"Boss, my Madam once told me that some vampires, they...\"\n\nJust then, Zhou Ze's phone rang. He picked it up, signaling for Bai Yingying to pause and wait.\n\nIt was the Old Daoist. They had walked back together, but Zhou Ze had given him some spirit money and told him to find a place to burn it before going to the police station to report the crime.\n\n\"Hello, did you report it?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Boss, I... I didn't dare...\" the Old Daoist said, his voice trembling.\n\n\"You didn't burn the spirit money? You only participated in the gambling, and you're turning yourself in and providing a tip. With the spirit money, you wouldn't even be detained. At most, you'd just have to give a statement.\"\n\n\"No... that's not it, Boss... I'm at the police station, and a lot of reporters have shown up. They're saying that half an hour ago, someone reported that all the nurses, doctors, and patients in a hospital were killed. It seems... it seems like it was the hospital we were just at.\n\n\"Boss, I can't turn myself in for this! Burning more spirit money won't help! If I turn myself in, the police will definitely hold me as the prime suspect.\"\n\n\"They're all dead?\"\n\nZhou Ze frowned slightly. That couldn't be right. When he left, the doctors and nurses were just unconscious on the floor, unharmed. They probably would have woken up on their own after a while.\n\n\"It's definitely that hospital,\" the Old Daoist said in a hushed voice. \"I just asked a reporter, and he told me.\"\n\n\"How is that possible? We haven't been gone long.\"\n\n\"Boss...\" the Old Daoist asked nervously, \"didn't you also think it was strange before? Why that female ghost didn't kill anyone or get her revenge?\"\n\n\"What are you trying to say?\"\n\n\"This humble Daoist was thinking, could it be that there were two ghosts there at the time, but one of them was hiding?\"",

    "content": "Because the incident was so sudden and involved so many deceased—more than a dozen bodies in all—several of them were transferred to the Tongcheng Affiliated Hospital to help expedite the autopsy and examination process.\n\nTongcheng was a peaceful city, so the sudden appearance of such a severe homicide case instantly drew widespread attention. News of the event had already blown up on WeChat Moments and Weibo, causing panic and unease among many citizens.\n\nThis, to a certain extent, put pressure on the investigating police.\n\nThe force was fully committed, hoping to uncover the truth of the matter as soon as possible, and a special task force was immediately established. Of course, none of this had anything to do with Zhou Ze.\n\nRight now, he only needed to confirm one thing: were those doctors and nurses killed by a person, or by… a ghost?\n\nIn truth, Zhou Ze felt no unease about their deaths, nor would he burden himself with any misplaced responsibility or guilt. If that female ghost had been more effective, she would have already become the blade in Zhou Ze's \"borrowed knife\" stratagem.¹ Those scumbags who used human lives as gambling tools—their deaths would only make the world a cleaner place.\n\nBut what Zhou Ze couldn't tolerate was the possibility that there really was another ghost lurking in the shadows, one he had failed to detect. For it to emerge and start killing the moment he left—that would be a dereliction of his duty.\n\n*To hunt swallows all day, only to have his eye pecked out by one.*² That feeling was not pleasant at all.\n\nCasually swiping a white lab coat and putting it on, Zhou Ze walked into the morgue. Two bodies were currently being autopsied, while three others were waiting here. As a former doctor who had worked here for ten years, Zhou Ze was naturally very familiar with the Affiliated Hospital.\n\nBesides, since his rebirth, he had actually been to this morgue once before. That was when he’d run into the issue with the children squabbling over their inheritance while their old mother's body lay unclaimed.\n\nThe old Daoist also rushed over from the police station to meet Zhou Ze at the Affiliated Hospital. He had cozied up to some reporters and obtained some basic information, which he hurried to report to Zhou Ze.\n\nHowever, to the old man's disappointment, Zhou Ze wasn't interested in this news. Unlike his previous boss, he had little interest in criminal investigation.\n\nThe temperature in the morgue was naturally not high; a bone-chilling cold permeated everything inside and out.\n\n\"Boss, why were the bodies transported to a hospital for autopsy?\" The old Daoist couldn't understand this at all.\n\n\"Forensic pathologists are in short supply, even in developed countries, and it's the same here. For a case with only one or two deaths, this wouldn't be necessary. But this time there are more than a dozen dead, so the Tongcheng Police Department's forensic team is definitely shorthanded. They have no choice but to rely on the assistance of civilian facilities.\"\n\nZhou Ze checked the identification numbers, glanced at the chart on the back of the door, and then pulled out one of the refrigerated drawers. Inside lay the body of an old woman with graying hair.\n\nThe old Daoist's eyes widened as he looked at the corpse. \"This must be the work of a ghost! The poor nurse was sucked into a shriveled husk!\"\n\nZhou Ze tapped his finger on the metal slab. \"This is the body of one of the patients from the hospital's basement.\"\n\n\"Oh, I see.\"\n\nThe old Daoist scratched his head, a bit embarrassed.\n\n\"Then how did she die?\" the old Daoist asked again.\n\n\"The deceased was already suffering from cancer. All medical treatment for the patients being used as gambling tools in the basement had been terminated long ago. They could have died at any time.\n\n\"From a quick look, this body has no obvious external injuries, and I didn't sense any residual baleful energy on her.\"\n\n\"So is her cause of death strange and hard to find?\" the old Daoist asked, stroking his chin pretentiously as if lost in deep thought. \"Now this is interesting. A mysterious cause of death... there's definitely something strange going on here.\"\n\n\"Died of illness.\"\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\n\"I said, she likely died of her illness.\"\n\n\"This...\"\n\nIf it had been anyone else standing before him, the old Daoist would have probably started cussing them out.\n\n*She died of her illness, and you spent all that time analyzing her, making me act all invested?*\n\n*Isn't this embarrassing for me!*\n\nZhou Ze paid no mind to the old Daoist's thoughts and pulled out the second body. It was a male corpse, a young one.\n\n\"This body looks a bit familiar... oh, oh crap, it's the security guard's body.\" The old Daoist recognized the corpse; after all, he'd had 'physical contact' with this guard.\n\nZhou Ze lifted the corpse's chin. There was a dark red wound there.\n\nThe incision was deep and very smooth.\n\n\"Did he get his throat slit?\" the old Daoist guessed.\n\nZhou Ze nodded. The cause of death was excessive blood loss from having his throat slit by a sharp object.\n\nZhou Ze then opened the refrigerated drawer containing the third body. It was a female corpse.\n\n\"I recognize this one too. She was a nurse at the hospital. She was wearing Peppa Pig underwear, so this humble Daoist took a few extra glances.\"\n\nZhou Ze checked the female corpse's chin and found no wound there. But moving down her neck, he saw a very deep gash below her left breast. The wound wasn't as long as the one on the male corpse's neck, but its depth was likely more terrifying.\n\nExcluding other possible factors, and based purely on his experience from his past life, Zhou Ze determined that the fatal injuries on these two were the wounds he had just found.\n\n\"She was stabbed with a dagger, right?\"\n\nThe old Daoist was a man who had roamed the *jianghu*³ and had even spent some time as a \"barefoot doctor\" in the countryside. Although it was mostly just con artistry, he had seen a thing or two.\n\n\"It should be a sharp object similar to a dagger,\" Zhou Ze nodded.\n\nGhosts don't use knives to kill. So for now, it looked like this was done by a human.\n\nSince it was the work of a human, it had nothing to do with Zhou Ze. Matters of the mortal world should be left to the police; he was only responsible for containing ghosts.\n\nBut this matter still left Zhou Ze feeling very uncomfortable. It was true he'd wanted to kill these doctors and nurses before, but in the end, he hadn't. Yet he could easily picture the scene in his mind:\n\nAfter he and the old Daoist had left, a person, holding a dagger or some small knife, came to the hospital while these nurses and doctors were likely still unconscious.\n\nHe approached them one by one, slitting their throats or stabbing their abdomens with the dagger, letting them die painfully from blood loss in their unconscious state.\n\nThe people the ghost didn't kill, a human helped to kill instead.\n\n*Whether I kill them or not is my business. For you to come and deliver the killing blow while they were unconscious after I left...* Zhou Ze felt as if he'd been taken advantage of and manipulated.\n\n\"Let's go. It's nothing,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nSince it wasn't a ghost causing trouble, Zhou Ze planned to withdraw.\n\n\"Then... do I still need to turn myself in?\"\n\n\"With an incident this big, some things are impossible to hide. Even if you don't turn yourself in, this whole illegal operation will be thoroughly exposed during the investigation.\"\n\n\"That's good.\"\n\nThe old Daoist had been genuinely worried that Zhou Ze would still insist he turn himself in as some kind of tainted witness.\n\nIt was late at night by the time they left the hospital. There were quite a few late-night food stalls open outside. The old Daoist suggested they get something to eat, since he hadn't eaten anything since noon.\n\nZhou Ze nodded in agreement. He also felt his steps were a bit unsteady. Xu Qinglang had gone back to his hometown, and his appetite had been noticeably poor these past few days.\n\nBut because they didn't have any plum juice, the old Daoist ate with great relish while Zhou Ze struggled. With every bite of food, he had to force it down, fighting back nausea with every painful swallow.\n\nMoreover, the food at the late-night stalls was quite heavy and oily, which made it even more difficult for Zhou Ze to eat.\n\nAs he was eating, the old Daoist wiped his mouth, got up, and went ahead. He came back with two still-warm steamed buns in his hand.\n\n\"Boss, you should eat something plain. There's a 24-hour pastry shop right up ahead. I got you two steamed buns.\"\n\nZhou Ze put down his chopsticks and took the buns. He had to eat something, at least to maintain the energy this body needed to function. He couldn't let his body collapse from neglect.\n\nHolding the steamed bun, Zhou Ze shook his head with a sense of helplessness. \"The bun isn't fresh.\"\n\n\"Uh...\" the old Daoist said, a bit resigned. \"It's already late, after all. If you want fresh ones, you'll have to wait until they first open in the morning.\"\n\nZhou Ze poked the bun with his fingernail. The outside was soft, but the inside was a bit hard.\n\nJust as he was about to tear off a piece to put in his mouth, Zhou Ze suddenly froze.\n\nHe whipped the bun around, staring at the spot his fingernail had just pierced.\n\nDropping the bun, Zhou Ze immediately stood up and dashed across the road, running back towards the hospital.\n\n\"Boss!\"\n\nThe old Daoist shouted. Seeing that Zhou Ze didn't respond, he had no choice but to throw two hundred yuan on the table, yell \"Keep the change!\" at the stall owner, and run after his boss.\n\nThe two returned to the hospital. Zhou Ze once again headed straight for the morgue. Just then, a doctor in a white coat happened to walk out of the morgue door. Fortunately, his back was to Zhou Ze as he headed in the other direction and went upstairs.\n\nAfter the doctor left, Zhou Ze and the old Daoist opened the morgue door and went back inside.\n\nZhou Ze personally pulled open one of the refrigerated drawers. The female corpse lay inside.\n\n\"Boss, what on earth is going on?\" the old Daoist asked, panting.\n\n\"It wasn't a dagger,\" Zhou Ze said in a low voice.\n\n\"If not a dagger, then a small knife. You ran all the way back just for that?\" The old Daoist sighed.\n\nZhou Ze didn't speak.\n\nInstead, he silently let the nail of his index finger grow out.\n\nThen,\n\nZhou Ze gently placed the pitch-black nail at the spot below the female corpse's left breast.\n\nFollowing the wound that had been left there,\n\nhe plunged it in.\n\nA perfect fit!\n\nIt wasn't a dagger that killed her.\n\nIt wasn't some kind of knife, either.\n\nIt wasn't even any kind of sharp tool.\n\nIt was a fingernail.\n\nA FINGERNAIL!\n\nThe old Daoist's mouth dropped open. He was so stunned he didn't know what to say, and could only stammer:\n\n\"Zom... zom...\"\n\n\"I knew this wound felt familiar the moment I first saw it.\" Zhou Ze turned his head to look at the old Daoist and said, \"Pull out the drawer with the male corpse. Let's verify it again.\"\n\nThe old Daoist immediately nodded and pulled open the drawer where the male corpse was supposed to be.\n\nThen, the old Daoist froze.\n\nHe said:\n\n\"Boss, this is bad! Something's happened!\"\n\n\"What is it?\" Zhou Ze withdrew his fingernail and turned to look toward the old Daoist.\n\n\"The body... the body's gone!\"\n\nThe old Daoist stepped aside, showing Zhou Ze that the drawer he had pulled out was completely empty.\n\nThen,\n\nan even more terrifying scene unfolded. The old Daoist raised a trembling hand and pointed at Zhou Ze.\n\nBecause he saw,\n\nbehind Zhou Ze,\n\nthe female corpse that had been lying on the refrigerated shelf,\n\nwas slowly sitting up.\n\nThe female corpse turned her head,\n\na smile on her face,\n\nand looked at him...\n\n***\n\n**Footnotes:**\n\n1.  **借刀殺人 (jiè dāo shā rén):** A Chinese idiom literally meaning \"to kill with a borrowed knife.\" It refers to a strategy of causing harm to an enemy by using a third party, thus avoiding blame or direct involvement.

    "content": "The female corpse suddenly sat up. A dead silence fell.\n\nIt was very much like a classic scene from a horror film. The protagonist and some sidekick are investigating something when a terrifying scene suddenly unfolds, sending the whole affair spiraling into an unknowable, mysterious abyss.\n\n\"Boss...\"\n\nLao Dao could be considered worldly and experienced, but this was the first time he'd seen something so bizarre. After all, in many of his past cases, the \"human\" element had always ended up being the dominant factor. Ghosts, more often than not, seemed somewhat constrained.\n\nBut this, right here...\n\nDamn it, this was a real reanimated corpse!\n\n\"What's wrong?\" Zhou Ze asked. He didn't turn back, but instead looked at Lao Dao.\n\n\"You... you...\"\n\nThe female corpse stared at Zhou Ze before her. She wasn't actually smiling, but in this atmosphere and under the current lighting, from Lao Dao's perspective, the corpse was like a venomous snake, preparing to strike and devour its prey.\n\nThis gave Lao Dao the illusion that the female corpse was smiling, as if everything was under her control.\n\n\"Spit it out, hey,\" Zhou Ze said, sounding a little impatient as Lao Dao continued to stammer.\n\nAnd at that moment, the female corpse opened her mouth and lunged for Zhou Ze's neck.\n\n\"Boss, behind you...\"\n\n*Smack!*\n\nZhou Ze suddenly shot out a hand and, like a snake catcher grabbing a snake by its weak spot,¹ clamped down on the female corpse's neck, his fingernails instantly piercing her flesh.\n\nThe female corpse began to writhe and struggle. She looked to be in great pain.\n\n\"So what is it? Say it,\" Zhou Ze urged.\n\nSeeing this, Lao Dao's heart, which had just leaped into his throat, suddenly fell heavily back into place.\n\n\"It's nothing now,\" Lao Dao answered wearily. He felt he had wasted his expressions and emotions.\n\n\"Oh.\"\n\nZhou Ze grunted in acknowledgment, then slammed the female corpse onto the ground.\n\n*Crack!*\n\nWith a crisp sound, the female corpse's skin began to fissure. Black pus slowly seeped out from within, like a water balloon from a child's prank hitting the ground and bursting.\n\nOnce the liquid inside seeped out, only the tattered skin of the balloon remained.\n\nIt was the same with the female corpse. After the black pus splattered out, her bones and innards seemed to have completely vanished, leaving only the outermost layer of skin floating up and down in the ooze.\n\nHer face, soaking in the liquid, wrinkled and shifted continuously, like a person constantly changing expressions.\n\nZhou Ze looked at his fingernails. There were several nicks on them. When he had pierced the corpse's body just now, he had clearly felt a strong corrosive property that had caused some damage to his nails.\n\nSuch a terrifying and bizarre scene had been resolved so nonchalantly by Zhou Ze. Lao Dao had the ridiculous feeling that they had all gotten the wrong script, even feeling as if such a great atmosphere and buildup had gone to waste.\n\nHe immediately rubbed his face hard, forcing himself to wake up, and then said:\n\n\"Boss, I just thought of something. When we came in just now, wasn't there a doctor in a white coat walking out?\n\n\"Was he a real doctor?\"\n\n\"Aaaaaaaaaaah!!!!!!\"\n\nUpstairs, a piercing scream rang out.\n\n...\n\nIn a hospital room, a girl sat on a nearby bed, unable to keep from dozing off. Her mother, who had just had surgery, lay on the bed with an IV drip, the anesthesia yet to wear off.\n\nThe girl drifted off for a moment, then jolted awake. She was exhausted, but she couldn't sleep soundly. She needed to take care of her mother—at the very least, watch to see when the IV drip was finished so she could call a nurse to change the bag.\n\nShe looked up and saw that the current bag was almost empty. Standing up, the girl gave a small yawn and pressed the call button by the bed to notify a nurse to come and change the IV bag.\n\nShe pressed the button, but after waiting a while, no nurse appeared. The girl grew anxious and walked to the door, pushing it open. She planned to check the nurse's station at the other end of the hall; perhaps the nurse on duty had fallen asleep.\n\nPushing the door open, she had just stepped out when she saw a male doctor in a white lab coat standing across the hallway. He wore a white surgical mask, his side turned to her.\n\n\"Doctor, excuse me, we need a new IV bag here,\" the girl called out to him.\n\nThe doctor ignored her, remaining motionless.\n\n\"Doctor? Doctor? We need a new IV bag here.\"\n\nThe girl called out again.\n\nThe doctor's body trembled slightly, as if he had been daydreaming and was just startled awake. Then he half-turned and began walking in her direction.\n\nThe girl let out a sigh of relief. Her mother had just one last bag to go, and then she could finally get some proper sleep.\n\nBut gradually, the girl sensed that something was wrong. It felt like something, somewhere, was off.\n\nAt first, she thought it was just her exhaustion causing anxiety, making everything seem unsettling. But slowly, the girl realized that wasn't the reason. The problem was with the doctor walking toward her.\n\nHe... was barefoot!\n\nYes, a doctor, walking barefoot in a hospital?\n\nWorking barefoot?\n\nWas that even possible?\n\nThe girl immediately took two steps back, shut the hospital room door, and locked it from the inside. It was a subconscious reaction.\n\nIn fact, everyone has a sixth sense. When our ancestors lived primitive lives,² they were constantly on guard against attacks from wild beasts and naturally possessed an instinct for seeking fortune and avoiding harm.\n\nOf course, with the development of human society, humans have stood at the top of the food chain for a very, very long time, and this instinct has slowly atrophied. But some people are inherently more sensitive, their perception of danger more acute than that of ordinary people.\n\nThrough the transparent glass pane on the door, the girl saw the male doctor still walking toward her. His posture was also strange.\n\nAfter taking a step, his foot would follow with a twist, causing his whole body to twist with it, like the exaggerated, comical walk from a Charlie Chaplin silent film.\n\nBut in the dead of night, in a hospital, in a deserted ward hallway, this way of walking didn't bring comedy, but a great, bone-chilling terror!\n\nThe doctor continued toward her, his swaying motions growing wider. The girl could even hear a \"creak, creak\" sound.\n\nThe girl wondered if she was having a nightmare.\n\nWhy would a scene like this be happening in a hospital?\n\nShe looked down, closed her eyes, and forced herself to be calm. *If this is a dream, please let me wake up.*\n\nThen, she opened her eyes and found she was still standing behind the door. This didn't seem to be a dream.\n\nMustering her courage, the girl once again peered out through the glass pane on the door, only to find that the doctor was gone. Completely vanished.\n\nThe girl was bewildered. What on earth was happening?\n\nDid she see things?\n\nOr was she already hallucinating?\n\nShe didn't dare open the door. Even if her eyes had been playing tricks on her, she had no intention of opening it to check right now. She was, after all, a young woman, and with her mother ill, she had become even more cautious.\n\nOutside, it really seemed like no one was there.\n\nThe girl pressed her face against the door to get a wider view through the glass.\n\nSuddenly,\n\nThe girl felt the light in front of her become blocked.\n\nThe face of a male doctor, wearing a surgical mask,\n\nsoundlessly appeared on the other side of the glass pane.\n\nThe distance between his face and hers,\n\nwas separated only by the thickness of the glass, less than a centimeter!\n\nThe girl was completely terrified.\n\nShe forgot to scream, forgot everything. She just stood there, dumbfounded, staring at the person, at the face, outside the window!\n\nThe mask was squirming, as if the mouth beneath it was speaking, but what came out was not human language, but the sound she had heard before:\n\n\"Squelch, squelch.\"\n\nIt sounded like someone walking through a muddy puddle in rain boots on a rainy day.\n\nAnd the male doctor's eyes were grotesquely large, five or six times the size of a normal person's. His eyeballs were as big as eggs, as if they had been soaked until swollen, practically bursting from their sockets.\n\nAt the same time, the eyeballs were constantly wobbling, swaying back and forth like a puppet's eyes that could flip up and down, as if they might fall out at any moment.\n\nThe girl clapped a hand over her mouth, her body trembling from immense fear.\n\n*Click, clack...*\n\nIt was the sound of the doorknob turning.\n\nThat doctor was opening the door!\n\nThe girl immediately threw her body forward, pressing against the door.\n\nShe had just locked it, so he couldn't get it open from the outside. But precisely because it wouldn't open, the doctor outside started ramming the door.\n\n*Bang! Bang! Bang!...*\n\nThe girl gritted her teeth and held the door, tears filling her eyes. She was so scared, so panicked. She didn't know why something like this was happening in a hospital.\n\n\"Squelch, squelch, squelch...\"\n\nAlong with the sound of the door being battered, that \"squelch, squelch\" noise grew louder and clearer.\n\n*Thump!*\n\nA sound came from outside the door.\n\nThe girl didn't know what had happened, but she suddenly realized the person outside was no longer ramming the door. She leaned against it, panting heavily.\n\nIt was too terrifying.\n\nIt was truly too terrifying.\n\n*If this is a nightmare, please let me wake up soon.*\n\nBut soon, the girl noticed that her feet felt wet, as if a pool of liquid had seeped in from underneath her.\n\nThe girl looked down at the floor.\n\nSomething white seemed to be oozing through the crack under the door, carried by the pus on the ground.\n\nIt was a human skin!\n\nAt the top was a face, twisted like a braid.\n\nIts two huge eyeballs flowed like two freshly cracked egg yolks mixed with their whites.\n\n*Splat!*\n\nOne of the eyeballs burst, and a foul, yellow liquid splashed onto the girl's face.\n\nThe other eyeball continued to spin,\n\nas if the doctor were lying on the floor, winking with one eye and staring with the other, a look of twisted amusement on his face,\n\nwatching her.\n\n\"Aaaaaaaaaaah!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\"\n\nThe girl broke down.\n\nThe scream,\n\nechoed throughout the entire inpatient building.\n\n***\n¹Literally \"grabbing the seven-inch spot,\" a term from snake catching referring to the vulnerable point on a snake's body just below its head.\n²The original text uses the idiom 茹毛飲血 (rú máo yǐn xuè), literally \"to eat the hair and drink the blood,\" to describe a primitive, uncivilized existence.",

    "content": "Zhou Ze and Lao Dao followed the screams and found the right floor. Because of Zhou Ze's leg injury, a crowd had already gathered by the time they arrived, packed several layers deep. Many family members staying with patients in nearby rooms had come out to see what the commotion was about.\n\nEven some patients in hospital gowns, holding their own IV drips with one hand while leaning against the wall with the other, had come over to get in on the gossip, profoundly embodying the spirit of \"as long as there's life, there's drama to watch.\"\n\nA few nurses were nearby comforting a girl, while someone else was on the phone calling hospital security, who were expected to arrive shortly.\n\nBecause Zhou Ze was also wearing a white coat, he and Lao Dao easily squeezed through the crowd to the front.\n\nOn the floor was a puddle of yellowish-brown pus, with something that looked like an egg yolk floating in it. An uninformed person might have thought someone had peeled an egg and dropped it in, but Zhou Ze knew that this thing was actually a human eyeball.\n\n\"Boss, this guy's water broke too,\" Lao Dao whispered in Zhou Ze's ear.\n\nZhou Ze frowned slightly. The more critical the moment, the more Lao Dao liked to act like a fool. This was probably a self-preservation mechanism for him in tense situations, an instinctive way to relax.\n\nThen, Zhou Ze extended his index finger and stirred it in the pus below.\n\nSeeing this, Lao Dao also squatted down, extended his own finger, and stirred it. To be honest, the stuff was incredibly disgusting, but since his boss was doing it, he could only follow suit.\n\nIt had to be said, Lao Dao was a man with great ambition. Whether following his previous boss or his current one, he possessed a powerful desire to learn and imitate.\n\nImmediately after, Lao Dao witnessed a sight that made him want to vomit up his late-night snack. Zhou Ze actually put his own middle finger in his mouth and sucked on it, then lowered his head in deep thought, as if analyzing its components.\n\nAt the same time, he even smacked his lips.\n\n*He's going that hard?*\n\n*What does it taste like?*\n\nLao Dao hesitated.\n\nA great battle raged in his mind, but in the end, he also brought the finger that had just stirred the pus to his own mouth and tasted it. The flavor was overwhelming. The acrid, spicy sensation exploded in his mouth, burning his throat more than high-proof liquor.\n\nThere was even a smell of aged seafood, a smell most boys and some girls would know.\n\nLao Dao's face was about to turn green, but seeing his boss continuing to ponder with a perfectly calm expression, a sense of reverence for Zhou Ze, as if looking up at a great mountain, inexplicably rose in his heart.\n\n*He can handle that taste. He's not human!*\n\nZhou Ze turned his head and saw Lao Dao's miserable expression, as if he'd just been... violated. Looking at the liquid still remaining on Lao Dao's fingertip, he asked, somewhat surprised, \"What are you doing?\"\n\nLao Dao patted his chest lightly and said heroically, \"Shennong tasted a hundred herbs.¹ If you can do it, Boss, then so can this humble Taoist.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded and smiled.\n\nLao Dao felt an overwhelming sense of being favored, as if at that moment he had finally earned his boss's approval, like when Patriarch Bodhi tapped the Monkey King on the head three times.²\n\n\"I stirred it with my index finger. The one I put in my mouth was my middle finger.\"\n\nZhou Ze showed his fingers to Lao Dao and continued, \"I got some chives stuck in my teeth during my late-night snack. I was just digging it out. Who in their right mind would taste this stuff? Are you a masochist?\"\n\n\"...\" said Lao Dao.\n\nBefore Lao Dao could say anything else, his stomach began to spasm. He pushed through the crowd and ran straight for the restroom to vomit.\n\nZhou Ze silently rubbed his chin. The frightened girl was still sitting in the hospital room, with a few nurses comforting her. Zhou Ze didn't go over to ask about her condition; after all, he had experienced a similar scene in the morgue earlier.\n\nIt was just that some things were a mere drizzle, a minor scene for him, but for ordinary people, they were utterly shocking.\n\nA dead body suddenly sitting up.\n\nA fatal wound from fingernails so sharp they could be used as weapons.\n\nThe corpse ultimately dissolving into a pool of pus.\n\nEverything pointed to the fact that the killer was no ordinary person, but a demon hiding in the darkness. In fact, since becoming a Hell Official, Zhou Ze had never encountered an opponent with such mysterious and varied methods.\n\nThat thing clearly couldn't be treated as an ordinary vengeful spirit.\n\nStanding up, Zhou Ze walked to the other end of the corridor, took out his phone, and dialed Tang Shi's number.\n\n\"Hello,\" Tang Shi's voice was as cold as ever.\n\n\"Do me a favor. It seems like a... a wild *jiangshi*³ has appeared here.\"\n\n\"You can go find the plant.\"\n\nThe implication was that she was busy and couldn't be bothered.\n\n\"Then help me call Bai Yingying. Tell her to come to the hospital.\"\n\n\"No problem with that.\"\n\nHanging up, Zhou Ze once again wondered if keeping Tang Shi around was a mistake. This woman was even more of a vase than an actual vase.⁴\n\nHis Yingying was still the best.\n\nBoth were women, neither were living, yet the difference could be so vast.\n\nHaving thrown up all the acid in his stomach, Lao Dao walked out of the restroom and came to Zhou Ze's side, asking with some complaint, \"Why did that thing have to make such a scene when it killed someone?\"\n\n\"He did it on purpose,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Everyone he kills turns into a *jiangshi*? Hey, that's just like those old Hong Kong *jiangshi* movies from the 80s and 90s. People bitten by a *jiangshi* also become one.\"\n\nAs he spoke, Lao Dao looked at Zhou Ze's eyes, a hint of eagerness in his own.\n\n\"What are you looking at?\"\n\n\"Uh, Boss, I have a small request. Can all *jiangshi* become like Bai Yingying?\"\n\n\"Get to the point. Don't beat around the bush.\"\n\n\"Uh, ahem... What this humble Taoist means is, look, Boss, I'm getting on in years. Who knows when I'll kick the bucket and depart for the Western Paradise.\"⁵\n\n\"You're a Taoist, not a monk.\"\n\n\"Er, right, kick the bucket and ascend to immortality, then. But I'm worried that if I'm gone, who will take care of you?\"\n\n\"...\" said Zhou Ze.\n\n\"So, Boss, when that day comes, can you give me a little bite?\"\n\n\"I'd find it disgusting.\"\n\n\"...\" said Lao Dao.\n\n*Can't we even be friends anymore?!*\n\n\"It's not as dramatic as you think. Getting bitten by a *jiangshi* won't turn you into one. If you don't believe me, you can have Bai Yingying bite you on the neck when you get back. Besides being infected by corpse poison and hastening your 'kicking the bucket,' I guarantee there will be no other effects. As for becoming a *jiangshi*, you'd have better luck picking an inauspicious tomb, burying yourself in it, and maybe in a hundred years or so, you'll be able to hop out. But the you after that will have nothing to do with the you now. It'll be a new life.\"\n\n\"So the movies were all lying?\"\n\n\"What do you think?\"\n\nLao Dao was a bit dejected. He had thought he'd found a way to extend his life, but it turned out to be a dead end. Still not entirely convinced, he said, \"Then what's the deal with these two people?\"\n\n\"And what was the result?\" Zhou Ze asked. \"They split right open, their bones and organs all dissolved into pus.\"\n\n\"Why is that?\"\n\n\"Because they were used as nutrients, absorbed by someone. They didn't become *jiangshi*. Taking a step back, would you want to become that kind of *jiangshi*?\"\n\n\"Will he continue to kill?\" Lao Dao asked with some concern.\n\n\"If he's not full,\" Zhou Ze pursed his lips. \"Of course, even if he is full, it doesn't mean he won't get hungry again.\"\n\nZhou Ze suddenly seemed to think of something else and said to Lao Dao, \"Find a way to help me check what happened to the other bodies, whether a similar situation occurred...\"\n\nHis phone rang. Zhou Ze picked it up and saw the caller ID showed \"Wang Ke.\"\n\nSince the \"meat-eating\" incident, Zhou Ze hadn't contacted Wang Ke, and Wang Ke had promised not to contact him proactively.\n\n\"Hello,\" Zhou Ze answered the call anyway.\n\n\"I'm sorry to have to break my promise, but I think you'll be interested in this,\" Wang Ke's voice came from the other end of the phone.\n\n\"Speak.\"\n\n\"Have you heard about the mass death incident at that small hospital?\"\n\nZhou Ze turned his head, looked at the puddle of pus behind him, and said, \"Just heard.\"\n\n\"I'm a part-time consultant for the police, usually helping with psychological profiling and such. This case is very serious, and I was invited to help. Based on the known information, I'm supposed to sketch out some of the killer's psychological and physical traits. Heh, for that, I drew a sketch. Do you want to see it?\"\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\n*Ding-dong...*\n\nThe notification sound of a WeChat message.\n\nZhou Ze minimized the call and opened WeChat.\n\nIt was a rough, impromptu sketch, but the person in it made Zhou Ze's pupils shrink.\n\n\"What kind of joke is this?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Heh heh, I don't believe it's you, but the person I drew based on the known conditions and clues really looks a lot like you. So, I'm not asking you for a favor this time. I'm just asking, are you interested?\"\n\n\"Interested in what?\"\n\n\"I can get all the information from the police investigation here.\" Wang Ke rubbed the bridge of his nose on the other end, sounding a bit tired. \"Although I really don't want to admit it, and it feels a bit helpless, I'm increasingly feeling that the killer in this case might not be human.\"\n\n\"Are you at the police station?\"\n\n\"No, I'm at home. You can come to my place. The case files and the latest information will all be sent to me here.\" Wang Ke paused, then added, \"Also, I'm making meat soup for a late-night snack. You can come have some.\"\n\nZhou Ze directly ignored the last sentence and said, \"I'll be there.\"\n\nHe was about to hang up, but Wang Ke's voice came again: \"Don't hang up just yet.\"\n\n\"Something else?\"\n\n\"Yeah. I've never had the chance to say this to anyone before. It's not a nice thing to say to others, almost like a curse. But this time, I finally have the opportunity. This is the first time I've ever said this to someone:\n\nHappy Qingming Festival.\"⁶\n\n---\n**Footnotes:**\n\n1.  **Shennong tasted a hundred herbs:** A reference to Shennong, a mythological Chinese ruler and deity credited with inventing agriculture and traditional medicine.

    "content": "As Zhou Ze and the old Daoist walked out of the hospital, Bai Yingying happened to arrive in a taxi. She was wearing blue jeans and a white sweatshirt, looking very youthful and vibrant.\n\nAlthough she had slumbered for two hundred years, her age remained frozen at sixteen.\n\n\"Boss,\" Bai Yingying called out to Zhou Ze from across the street.\n\n\"See, the wild ones are always the ones to stir up trouble.\" The old Daoist sniffed, watching Bai Yingying cross the road toward them. \"The house-raised ones know their place,\" he lamented.\n\nIt was now quite clear that the culprit was very likely a jiangshi,¹ and as it happened, there was a house-raised jiangshi right there in the bookstore: Bai Yingying.\n\nThe old Daoist had seen with his own eyes how Bai Yingying was responsible for cleaning and greeting customers. After finishing her work, she even had to accompany the boss to sleep. Truly the most dedicated employee of the new era, the new century.\n\n\"Boss, is it serious?\" Bai Yingying asked as she walked over. She knew that if things hadn't gotten difficult to a certain degree, the boss wouldn't have specifically called for her.\n\nZhou Ze glanced at the old Daoist. \"You fill her in.\" Then, Zhou Ze raised his hand to hail a taxi, and they all got in.\n\nThe car drove to a villa district. After the three got out, they walked directly to the villa where Wang Ke lived.\n\nHe rang the doorbell. Soon, Wang Ke opened the door and made a gesture for Zhou Ze and the others to enter.\n\n\"The soup is almost ready. Let's all have some. Can't let work ruin your health.\"\n\n\"Sir, this humble Daoist couldn't agree more.\"\n\nThe old Daoist was overjoyed. He had only eaten half of his late-night snack before having to pay the bill and rush back to the hospital with Zhou Ze. His stomach wasn't quite full yet.\n\nEveryone sat down in the living room. Wang Ke came over with a tray carrying four bowls of meat soup. He placed one in front of Zhou Ze, the old Daoist, and Bai Yingying, and held one himself.\n\nThe meat soup was rich and pure, sprinkled with chopped scallions and a drop or two of sesame oil. Each bowl contained two or three chunks of meat. The old Daoist didn't stand on ceremony; he picked up his bowl and started eating at once, thoroughly enjoying himself.\n\nWatching the old Daoist holding his bowl and gulping down the soup, Zhou Ze sat to the side, shaking his head slightly. For some reason, waves of nausea rose within him. Even though he hadn't touched the soup in front of him, the feeling of revulsion was incredibly strong.\n\nBai Yingying didn't eat either, leaving her soup untouched.\n\n\"Ha, that hit the spot!\"\n\nThe old Daoist wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. Seeing that Zhou Ze hadn't touched his chopsticks, he said with some surprise:\n\n\"Boss, have a little. It'll warm you up.\"\n\n\"I'm not hungry. You have it,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Oh, I couldn't possibly,\" the old Daoist said, making a show of refusing.\n\n\"Go ahead, don't let it go to waste.\"\n\nAs he spoke, Zhou Ze also pushed the bowl that had been in front of Bai Yingying over to the old Daoist.\n\n\"Haha, well then, it would be rude to refuse. Mr. Wang's cooking is really something else.\"\n\nThe old Daoist began to feast with gusto once more.\n\nZhou Ze felt he couldn't watch any longer. He stood up and looked at Wang Ke. \"Let's talk about the case.\"\n\nWang Ke nodded, put down his bowl and chopsticks, and rose, motioning for Zhou Ze to follow him into the study.\n\nOn the desk in the study, many documents were laid out.\n\n\"Here, these are the photos that just came in. The autopsied bodies are fine, nothing happened to them. But a few bodies that they didn't get to autopsy in time underwent an abnormal change. The corpses dissolved into purulent fluid, and they also exhibited some reflex reactions that are impossible for the dead.\n\n\"For example, one suddenly sat up on the stretcher, and someone heard the sound of footsteps coming from inside. As soon as I got this information, I immediately thought of you.\"\n\nWang Ke placed a stack of photos in front of Zhou Ze.\n\nAs Zhou Ze flipped through the photos, he asked:\n\n\"Any other clues?\"\n\nZhou Ze was already aware of what was in the photos; he had just experienced it firsthand.\n\n\"The police investigated the identities of all the deceased. There weren't really any big surprises. The victims were basically all people connected to that hospital. Because of that, the police's theory is that this is a revenge killing. The killer committed such a maniacal act for the purpose of retaliation.\n\n\"Right now, the police are focusing their attention on suspects who had medical disputes with the hospital. But this whole thing is really quite unexpected. That hospital… it couldn't stand up to scrutiny, and with such a severe and vicious incident, some things just couldn't be hidden anymore.\n\n\"Gambling, using human lives as a game of chance. It's truly astonishing.\"\n\nWang Ke reached up to adjust his glasses while starting to twirl the pen in his hand.\n\n\"What else?\" Zhou Ze continued to ask.\n\nSo far, the intelligence Wang Ke had was all stuff he already knew.\n\n\"That's it. To lock down the killer's identity, they first have to uproot this entire underground black market industry. Then, from among those who lost money gambling, they'll start by investigating the local or provincial gamblers. In addition, the families of the people who were used as gambling tools are also primary suspects.\n\n\"This means the number of current suspects is enormous, and the difficulty and time required for the investigation will be immense. I'm still waiting for more specific information.\"\n\nZhou Ze was growing impatient. He stood up, preparing to leave. The information Wang Ke had provided was of no value to him.\n\n\"Don't go, stay a little longer.\"\n\nWang Ke urged him to stay.\n\n\"Have some more soup.\"\n\n\"Then there's really nothing more to talk about,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n*If you mention the soup again, I'll have to leave even if I don't want to.*\n\n\"Actually, there is one more thing. Something the police haven't discovered, but I have.\"\n\nWang Ke leaned back in his chair and looked at Zhou Ze, his gaze hidden behind his lenses, appearing somewhat profound. \"But I'm afraid you'll misunderstand me.\"\n\n\"You don't have to say it.\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't press him. To be honest, he could get involved in this matter, or he could choose not to. He was just a ghost emissary, not some Celestial Master from Mount Longhu; he didn't have much of a calling to save the world.\n\nA wild jiangshi, by rights, was not under Zhou Ze's jurisdiction, unless that jiangshi got bored and decided to attack the Midnight Bookstore.\n\nOtherwise, he could just stay in his bookstore, eat when he should eat, sleep when he should sleep.\n\nBesides, even if that jiangshi really did lose its mind and take the initiative to come to the bookstore, with himself, Bai Yingying, and Miss Tang, it would probably be the jiangshi who had the bad luck in the end.\n\n\"I'd better tell you.\"\n\nWang Ke took another photograph from his drawer, turned it around, and placed it in front of Zhou Ze.\n\nThe background of the photo was the sign of a hospital—the very hospital where the incident occurred. Zhou Ze could even see the familiar large clock in the background of the picture.\n\n\"There are seventeen people in total in this photo. Among them are four security guards, four nurses, three doctors, and two administrative managers. In the very front, there are four people.\n\n\"The two in the middle are the hospital's financial backer and a person in charge of that gambling platform, respectively. The one on the far left is a reputable, retired old doctor from Tongcheng.\n\n\"In the hospital death incident, the four guards, four nurses, three doctors, and two administrators all died that day.\n\n\"However, of the four people in the front row, two of them died one after another last week.\n\n\"For example, the hospital's investor was in a car accident a week ago. This old doctor was found dead at home three days ago.\n\n\"I just got news that the owner of the gambling platform died tonight while trying to flee…\"\n\nWang Ke sighed as he spoke.\n\nZhou Ze reached out, placed his hand on the photograph, and gently pushed aside Wang Ke's index finger, which was pressing down on it.\n\n\"I'm very curious. This fourth person, is he still alive?\"\n\nWang Ke slowly moved his finger away. The face of the fourth person, previously covered by his finger, was revealed.\n\nIt was a very familiar face.\n\nIt was Wang Ke's face!\n\nZhou Ze lifted his head and looked at Wang Ke.\n\nWang Ke spread his hands. \"Calm down, let me explain.\"\n\n\"This is quite a surprise,\" Zhou Ze said, lighting a cigarette.\n\n\"Don't jump to conclusions. This really has nothing to do with me. The owner was my university roommate. He said he was opening a clinic and invited me to attend the ribbon-cutting. I couldn't just refuse him. In fact, my role was the same as that old doctor's; we were both just there to make an appearance.\n\n\"As for what kind of racket they were running, like gambling with human lives, I genuinely had no idea. After the opening, I never went to that hospital again, nor did I get any benefit from it. I have no connection to this matter whatsoever.\"\n\nWang Ke looked at Zhou Ze.\n\n\"In fact, it's hard for you to imagine just how profitable this black market industry is. Even skimming a thin layer of grease off the top would be a huge sum of money.\n\n\"If I were really involved, would I still be worrying about money for the development of my psychology research firm?\n\n\"During Mr. Zheng's daughter's case last time, you saw how anxious I was, like an ant on a hot pan. I'm short on money. If I were involved in this, would I have needed to run around for Mr. Zheng, groveling like that?\"\n\nWang Ke had a good point.\n\nIt was impossible for him to have foreseen the current events and started acting in front of Zhou Ze in the past.\n\n\"So, you calling me here, asking me to consult on this case and showing me evidence, that was all just a front?\" Zhou Ze blew out a ring of smoke, then flicked the ash, watching it fall onto the study's carpet. He said slowly:\n\n\"Your real goal was that you're afraid of dying and you want me to protect you?\"\n\n\"Don't make your big brother sound so pathetic,\" Wang Ke said, taking off his gold-rimmed glasses and rubbing the bridge of his nose. \"The psychological profile I did, the final sketch I drew, it really looked like you.\n\n\"I called you here to confess, actually. Because I thought you might have been the one who killed those people. Your identity… well, I'm aware of it too.\n\n\"If it was you, calling you over would save a lot of trouble, wouldn't it?\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. \"I don't have that kind of time.\"\n\n\"If it's not you, then I'll probably be dead tonight or tomorrow,\" Wang Ke said, shaking his head with a sense of helplessness.\n\n\"I'll stay until tomorrow. You'd better pray the killer comes for you tonight.\"\n\nThe implication was clear:\n\n*I won't wait any longer than that.*\n\nZhou Ze had no intention of becoming Wang Ke's personal bodyguard.\n\n\"Where are your wife and daughter?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"I had them go upstairs to rest early. I don't want to disturb her. Fortunately, the killer seems to only be killing the people in the photo for now, and hasn't shown any intention of wiping out entire families.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded at his words.\n\nWalking out of the study, Zhou Ze saw that the old Daoist had eaten all three bowls of meat soup from the coffee table. He was now leaning back on the sofa, contentedly rubbing his belly.\n\n\"Was it good?\" Wang Ke asked the old Daoist.\n\n\"Delicious. This skill is amazing. And the meat is so fragrant,\" the old Daoist praised.\n\n\"Hehe, my wife bought this fresh pork from a farmer's house today.\"\n\n\"How thoughtful of her,\" the old Daoist said, licking his lips.\n\n\"There's more in the pot. I'll go heat it up again in a bit.\"\n\n\"That sounds wonderful.\" The old Daoist clearly hadn't had enough. Once his food digested a little, he could eat more.\n\nJust then, a woman's voice came from upstairs:\n\n\"Honey, do we have guests?\"\n\n\"Yes, you go on and rest.\"\n\n\"Okay, dear. You finish up and get some rest too. I'll clean up the kitchen tomorrow.\"\n\nThe woman, standing at the turn of the staircase, finished speaking, then turned and walked back into the bedroom.\n\nShe lay down on the bed. It was a large red bed, which looked quite festive, but also, admittedly, a bit tacky.\n\nNowadays, very few families used bedsheets of this bright red color, even in the countryside.\n\nAnd,\n\nat the edge of the bedsheet,\n\nwere droplets of dark red,\n\ndripping down,\n\npooling into a puddle beneath the bed.\n\nDrip,\n\ndrip,\n\ndrip…\n\n***\n\n**Footnotes:**\n\n1.  **Jiangshi:** A type of reanimated corpse in Chinese folklore, sometimes translated as \"hopping vampire\" or \"zombie.\" They are typically depicted as stiff and move by hopping.",

    "content": "Wang Ke's life was boring and tedious. He was a workaholic, constantly striving for his own future, doing whatever it took to climb his way up.\n\nThose who grew up fearing poverty often develop a greater fixation on money as adults. They crave the sense of security that comes from accumulating wealth.\n\nFurthermore, it's difficult for people from normal families to understand the psychology of a child from an orphanage. What they lacked wasn't as simple as just \"the security of money.\"\n\nThe Zhou Ze of the past had been the same. But having been reborn, Zhou Ze had grown much more indolent and had learned to let things go.\n\nThere was no obsession that \"dying once\" couldn't solve.\n\nIf that didn't work,\n\nthen die a few more times.\n\nYou'd eventually learn to let go.\n\nWang Ke suggested a game of cards. Zhou Ze was noncommittal, Bai Yingying was disdainful, and while the old Daoist was willing to play along, you can't really play cards with just two people, so they had to drop the idea.\n\nIn the end, Wang Ke simply took out his patients' case files and began to study them, throwing himself right into his work. You couldn't tell at all how terrified he truly was.\n\nZhou Ze watched this \"older brother\" he had grown up with in the orphanage and felt as if he were looking at his former self.\n\nEven on the brink of death, they wanted to possess more, to pursue more. They all enjoyed the thrill that came from work—that satisfaction of accumulation, like a squirrel stuffing nuts into its tree hollow.\n\nIt didn't matter if there was a tomorrow; they had to work.\n\nLight began to appear outside the window. A whole night had passed, just like that. It felt slow, but also a bit fast. The zombie hadn't come. No one had knocked on the door, no one had broken a window. The night had been peaceful.\n\nZhou Ze deliberately waited a while longer, not intending to get up until morning was well underway.\n\n\"That's it for today. I'm heading back.\"\n\nWang Ke didn't shamelessly beg Zhou Ze to stay and continue protecting him. He kept his head down, continuing to look at his case files. Only when Zhou Ze announced his departure did he look up, stretch wearily, and smile.\n\n\"Have some breakfast before you go.\"\n\nThe old Daoist was eager to nod, but he had to look to Zhou Ze for a cue. In any case, the old Daoist was more than satisfied with the Wang family's food. It was fine and exquisite, focused on indulging the palate rather than simply filling the stomach.\n\n\"No, don't trouble yourself.\"\n\nZhou Ze maintained a respectful distance from anything related to \"food\" in the Wang household.\n\nHearing this, the old Daoist was a little disappointed. He'd actually had quite a feast yesterday, and despite eating so many strange things, he hadn't even gotten an upset stomach.\n\n\"Are the guests leaving?\"\n\nJust then, Wang Ke's wife came down the stairs.\n\nShe was wearing a black nightgown and had put on a white housecoat on account of the guests, but one could still make out her fine figure.\n\nThe allure of a young wife, her charm overflowing.\n\nBai Yingying stood behind Zhou Ze and gently tugged his arm. Zhou Ze followed her gaze and saw a string of red marks on the calf of Wang Ke's wife's left leg.\n\nIt looked like blood, winding its way down from the depths of a dense forest along the path of a stream, leaving behind the turbulent marks of time.\n\n\"Darling, I can't believe I knocked over my bottle of red nail polish while I was sleeping last night and didn't even notice. When I woke up this morning and saw that red puddle on the floor, I was so scared I nearly fainted.\n\nI saw a horror movie a while back, you know? I thought you had eaten me in my sleep like the male lead in the movie.\"\n\nWang Ke's wife walked up to him and reached out to stroke his chin. Her husband hadn't slept all night, and she felt a pang of heartache.\n\n\"You're too skinny. You wouldn't be enough to fill me up,\" Wang Ke joked in reply. \"Go make some breakfast.\"\n\n\"There's no need, sister-in-law.\"\n\nZhou Ze refused again.\n\n\"We'll be leaving now. If anything comes up, you can find me at my bookstore. Oh, right, my store has moved to South Avenue now, not too far from here.\"\n\nWhat Zhou Ze meant was, if they truly sensed something was wrong, they could come to his bookstore for refuge.\n\nThis was the most he could do. He couldn't stay by Wang Ke's side 24/7 to protect him. Besides, today was the Qingming Festival,¹ precisely when his bookstore's \"business was good.\"\n\nMany new customers would flock to the bookstore because of the Qingming Festival. It was a big business opportunity, like a peak season, and Zhou Ze wasn't willing to miss it.\n\nDeclining the Wang couple's attempts to make them stay, Zhou Ze and the other two walked out of the Wang family's villa.\n\nJust as they stepped out, Zhou Ze stopped and glanced back at the balcony.\n\nWang Ke's daughter should still be sleeping. It was the Qingming Festival holiday, so she didn't have school.\n\nThe little loli probably hadn't returned yet. Or perhaps, she couldn't return at all. In fact, if the little loli had come back, Wang Ke's worries would likely be superfluous. If that zombie really wanted to come to the Wang house for revenge, it would most likely be a one-way trip.\n\n\"Boss, that... was it really red nail polish?\" Bai Yingying asked from behind Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Could also be her period, and she made up an excuse to avoid embarrassment.\"\n\n\"...\" Bai Yingying was silent.\n\nA thought suddenly occurred to Zhou Ze. He looked at Bai Yingying and said, \"Yours should have stopped, right?\"\n\n\"...\" Bai Yingying was silent.\n\nHow was she supposed to answer that? Besides, how could a zombie get *that*!\n\nThe three of them reached the entrance of the residential complex. Since it was morning, the area was quite lively, and many street stalls were already open.\n\nNo matter what vicious incidents had happened recently, people's lives had to go on.\n\nAn able-bodied, middle-aged man was kneeling on the ground, holding a bowl in his hand and begging. He looked rather pitiful, dressed in dirty clothes, and kept making \"ah, ah, ah\" sounds as if he were mute.\n\nWhen the old Daoist passed by, the beggar reached out and grabbed his trouser leg, motioning for him to spare some change. After all, the old Daoist was dressed as a man of the cloth and probably looked easier to swindle money from.\n\nBegging is a profession that requires extensive experience, including knowing how to differentiate and target one's customer base.\n\nWho would have thought that the old Daoist would simply flick his sleeve, knocking the beggar's hand away, and spit in his direction, cursing:\n\n\"You have hands and feet, and you're younger than this poor Daoist! You've completely shamed your ancestors!\"\n\nGiven the old Daoist's age and identity, there was nothing wrong with him saying such things.\n\nAt his age, he still had to do live streams and serve ghosts. He was normally quite frugal, but Zhou Ze had heard from Bai Yingying that the old Daoist was sponsoring several poor students in a mountainous region.\n\nHearing this, the beggar seemed to fly into a rage out of humiliation. He stood up straight, only to let out a blood-curdling scream and fall to the ground, flailing his limbs and yelling, \"Ahhhh!\"\n\nThe implication was that the old Daoist had hit him; the subtext was that he was trying to extort him.\n\nSeeing this, the old Daoist was so angry he almost laughed, wishing he could actually go over and land a few punches on the scoundrel.\n\nOf course, a crowd of onlookers began to gather, all in the mood for some drama. No one spoke up for the beggar or intervened.\n\nThese days, people's sympathy had long been worn thin by one scamming beggar after another. It's human nature to sympathize with the weak, but these days, those who appear to be \"the weak\" often turn out to be the opposite; their lives might even be better than those sympathizing with them.\n\nZhou Ze, however, frowned slightly. He didn't want to waste any time on this. He gave Bai Yingying a look.\n\nBai Yingying understood and moved closer to the crowd.\n\nThe beggar felt a bone-chilling cold rise up from beneath him and immediately jumped to his feet, shouting:\n\n\"I'm freezing to death, I'm freezing to death!\"\n\nHe could speak. The crowd immediately burst into laughter. Though they didn't know what was going on, they all found it amusing.\n\nThe beggar scurried away in disgrace.\n\nThe old Daoist sniffed, sighed, and said, \"Some people deserve to be poor.\"\n\nZhou Ze just smiled, not mentioning that he'd seen the iPhone X in the beggar's pocket.\n\nThe three of them had a simple breakfast at the complex entrance. Bai Yingying had thoughtfully brought plum juice, and this time Zhou Ze ate a bit more. He hadn't touched a bite of the midnight snack last night and really needed to eat to replenish his energy.\n\nAfter eating, Bai Yingying prepared to call a taxi back to the bookstore.\n\nJust then, an old man with a full head of white hair and a hunched back walked past them. He was carrying a bag in his left hand and a plastic bag in his right, looking as if he had just come back from grocery shopping.\n\nWhat caught one's attention was that the old man's left hand, which held the bag, only had two fingers. This was a genuinely disabled person.\n\nSeeing this, the old Daoist took the initiative to walk up and ask if he needed help.\n\nThe old man shook his head, indicating he didn't.\n\nThe old Daoist said, \"Old brother, it's no trouble. You live in this complex, right? I can help you carry that back.\"\n\nBut the old man persisted, smiling and shaking his head to indicate that he was fine. His own business, he could handle it himself. He didn't need help, even though his two fingers were clearly struggling to hold the items.\n\nThe old man walked on, presumably living in the same complex as Wang Ke.\n\nThe old Daoist let out a long breath. \"People really are different, aren't they? An able-bodied man, not even that old, kneeling on the ground wanting a handout, begging for free food.\n\nBut this disabled old brother, a full generation older than me, still maintains his own dignity and pride.\n\nTruly a moment to savor.² That's some satisfying chicken soup for the soul this early in the morning. I feel like today is going to be another day full of vitality and positive energy.\"\n\nThe old Daoist was muttering to himself in a state of self-satisfaction, a common condition for anyone who has just drunk a bowl of \"chicken soup,\" as if their soul has been purified in an instant.\n\n\"He dropped something,\" Zhou Ze said, pointing it out.\n\n\"What? Did he drop his wallet? I'll hurry and return it to him. At his age, it's easy to be forgetful, his memory probably isn't good. Life isn't easy for him.\"\n\nAs the old Daoist spoke, he looked over at Zhou Ze, then froze, a look of horror spreading across his face.\n\nIn Zhou Ze's hand was the knuckle of a middle finger. The end was still stained with blood, and a faint wisp of warmth even seemed to rise from it. It was horrifyingly fresh.\n\n\"You're right. When people get old, their memory isn't so good.\n\nWhen a finger falls off,\n\nthey don't even notice.\"\n\n***\n\n¹ **Qingming Festival:** Also known as Tomb-Sweeping Day, a traditional Chinese festival for honoring ancestors. In the story's context, it's a time when spirits are more active, leading to \"good business\" for Zhou Ze's supernatural bookstore.\n² **A moment to savor:** The original is an old literary phrase, 當浮一大白 (dāng fú yī dà bái), which literally means \"one should drink a large cup of wine (to celebrate).\" It's used here to express deep satisfaction with a profound observation.",

    "content": "\"Knock knock knock... Knock knock knock...\"\n\nFrom outside came the sound of knocking. Wang Ke, still sitting on the living room sofa, looked up, straightened his clothes, and walked to the entryway. He glanced at the monitor; the camera outside had captured a stooped-over old man.\n\nThe old man's head was bowed, his face unclear.\n\nWang Ke had no intention of opening the door.\n\nBut with a \"click,\"\n\nThe door was opened.\n\nWang Ke took a step back as the old man appeared in the doorway.\n\nA gust of sinister wind blew in from the doorway, and the surrounding temperature slowly began to drop.\n\nWith a \"splat,\"\n\nThe plastic bag in the old man's hand fell, spilling out some pickled vegetables, along with some green onions, ginger, garlic, and the like.\n\n\"We'll cook a meal later.\"\n\nThe old man's voice was thick and sticky—not the sweet kind of a young girl's voice, but more like a throat full of phlegm.\n\nWang Ke took a deep breath. At that moment, he was calm enough to even take off his glasses, wipe them, and put them back on before saying:\n\n\"I know the odds of convincing you are slim, but I have to try. I really have nothing to do with that hospital.\"\n\n\"Oh.\"\n\nThe old man grunted in reply and then raised his head. His skin began to wrinkle, going from merely having some age spots to completely turning into dry, shriveled elm bark.\n\nIt was coarse and cracked. His eye sockets sank, and within their hollow depths, a green flame seemed to flicker.\n\n\"Who cares.\"\n\nThe old man took a step forward, closing the distance between himself and Wang Ke.\n\n\"No one else cares about the worthless lives of people like us, so why should I care about anyone else's life?\"\n\nWatching the old man close in on him step by step, Wang Ke sighed. \"I consider myself a good person, and... I sympathize with your plight.\n\nThough I don't know what exactly you've been through...\"\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nBefore Wang Ke could finish his useless chatter, he was thrown to the floor. The force in the old man's hands was immense, so much so that Wang Ke, a grown man, was like a little chick in his grasp.\n\nIt was a heavy fall. Wang Ke's left arm was broken outright, and he had no idea how many ribs he'd fractured.\n\n\"Sorry, I'm not a cop. When I do things, I don't care about evidence.\"\n\nThe old man crouched down beside Wang Ke.\n\n\"In short, everyone in that photo, everyone connected to that hospital, has to die.\"\n\nWith that, the old man reached out and patted Wang Ke's face. Several of his fingers were missing, and green pus continuously oozed from the stumps, a truly disgusting sight.\n\nWang Ke let out a long breath, enduring the intense pain. He seemed to be resigning himself to his fate.\n\nJust then, the old man looked up toward the top of the stairs. Wang Ke's wife was standing there, staring blankly at the scene below. She had changed out of her pajamas and was now in workout clothes, looking as if she had been about to go for a morning run.\n\n\"Go back to bed like a good girl. I don't kill women.\"\n\nThe old man gave a malevolent grin, stood up, and grabbed Wang Ke's ankles. He walked ahead, dragging Wang Ke behind him, and the two of them entered the kitchen.\n\nWang Ke's wife came down the stairs. She stood at the kitchen doorway.\n\nThe old man looked at the woman in the doorway with some surprise. He seemed prepared for a confrontation. He had expected her to call the police, but she didn't.\n\nHe had thought she might grab something and fight him to the death to save her husband, but she didn't do that either.\n\nIn fact, the old man would have understood if she had screamed, cried, begged, or run away, but the woman's next reaction was dumbfounding.\n\nThe woman paused at the kitchen door for a moment, then turned, brought in the pickled vegetables and other ingredients the old man had brought, proactively took various seasonings from a small kitchen cabinet, and began to help the old man rinse the pots and bowls.\n\nLying on the floor, Wang Ke saw this and wiped his face with his hand, saying with some resignation:\n\n\"Honey, you're having a relapse.\"\n\nThe woman's behavior left the old man baffled. Since he couldn't figure it out, he decided not to dwell on it. The old man lifted Wang Ke, forced his neck into the kitchen sink, turned on the faucet, and began to wash him with cold water.\n\nAt the side, the woman picked up a knife—not to attack the old man, but to start helping him chop garlic and green onions. Her speed was swift, showcasing her culinary skill. At the same time, she also turned on the gas valve, poured oil into the wok, and lit the stove.\n\nIt was already quite clear what the old man had brought all these side ingredients for, and the woman was acting as if she were his sous chef.\n\nThe kitchen was a scene of harmony. Everyone had their own role, all working diligently to prepare a delicious dish.\n\nWang Ke didn't resist either. He knew it was futile.\n\nThe old man reached out, grabbed Wang Ke's hair, and lifted his head. Then, he ran his fingernails over the skin of Wang Ke's face.\n\nLike a customer at a market, deciding which cut of meat to buy.\n\n\"Stir-fry first, then make soup with the bones. It'll be delicious.\"\n\nWang Ke's wife said to the old man from the side. She spoke with great earnestness, indicating she had given it careful thought. At the same time, she swallowed. She was a little hungry.\n\nThe old man seemed to have gotten used to the victim's eccentric wife. He actually pondered her suggestion for a moment before finally agreeing with her.\n\nThe old man prepared to cut the flesh with his fingernails, but Wang Ke's wife proactively handed him the kitchen knife, gesturing for him to use it.\n\nShe pointed at the old man's fingernails and said, \"Dirty. Unsanitary.\"\n\nAn experienced housewife knows that the freshness of the ingredients often determines the quality of a dish. One must treat the ingredients with exacting care, allowing no external factors to affect their texture. This is being responsible to oneself, and also to one's family.\n\nAnd the old man, who had already become a Corpse Ghoul, had \"eaten\" more than ten people from the hospital to replenish himself, so he could be considered a gourmet in this field.\n\nHe was well aware that a person's gender, age, work environment, and physique often determined the flavor of the final dish. The old man had taken a liking to Wang Ke: lots of lean meat, middle-aged and not too greasy, with a fully developed skeleton. Very suitable for consumption.\n\nThis was a gift from nature, and the old man knew the secret of how to cook this particular dish. This was the last person he planned to kill, so he intended to treat himself in a more ceremonious fashion.\n\nHe believed that this method could soothe the anger and sorrow he had experienced before his death. Such is the magical power of food.\n\nThe green flames in the old man's eyes flickered. He took the knife. With several fingers missing, his grip was a bit unsteady, but he still managed to curl his remaining digits around the handle.\n\nWang Ke was struggling, so the old man could only strike the back of his head with the spine of the knife. Wang Ke passed out immediately, the same principle as stunning a fish before killing it.\n\nAnd then,\n\nThe old man's blade fell!\n\n\"Clang!\"\n\nWith a sharp sound,\n\nthe knife in the old man's hand flew from his grasp. A long tongue had shot out from nowhere, lashing his wrist like a whip and snatching the knife away.\n\nWang Ke's wife turned her head and looked behind her.\n\nThe old man also looked toward the kitchen doorway, where a little loli was standing.\n\nThe little loli's mouth was open, half of her tongue still hanging out. The kitchen knife lay at her feet. A sharp light glinted in her eyes, giving her a formidable air, but one of her hands was actually gripping the doorframe to support herself. Clearly, she was at the end of her rope, already on the verge of collapse.\n\nWang Ke's wife looked at the little loli, waved gently, and said:\n\n\"Rui Rui, you're awake. Come, go brush your teeth and wash your face. We'll have soup soon.\n\nIt's made from Daddy's meat, you know. It's delicious. The bowl is full of rich, fatherly love.\"\n\nThe little loli gave the woman a complicated glance. The woman was still beside herself with excitement.\n\nThe old man tilted his head slightly, staring at the little loli.\n\n\"Order in the Underworld, passage to the Yellow Springs!\"\n\nThe little loli forced herself to rally.\n\n\"The mortal realm is not a place for a stray ghoul like you to run wild! You're just a Corpse Ghoul, you don't have the right to transcend the rules!\"\n\nHer tongue shot out again, striking the old man in the chest.\n\nWith a sharp \"crack,\"\n\nThe old man's chest caved in. He was sent flying backward, slamming into the tiled wall. A crater appeared where he hit, with cracks spreading out across a large area.\n\nBut the old man, a gaping hole in his chest, slowly climbed back to his feet.\n\nHis fingernails were long and black, and pus began to drip from the corners of his mouth, but he still stood up again and continued to stare at the little loli:\n\n\"There really is... a Yellow Springs?\"\n\nThe old man seemed bewildered.\n\nHe seemed to be thinking of his own family.\n\nEveryone has a connection to the Yellow Springs, because as everyone grows up, they inevitably experience the departure of their closest loved ones.\n\nThe Yellow Springs, in the eyes of the Chinese people, is a place where one entrusts their grief for the departed.\n\nThe little loli's tongue extended once more, but it was obvious that this time it was much weaker than before.\n\nThe old man reached out with both hands and grabbed the tongue. Though his body shuddered from the impact, he wasn't sent flying again. Then, his fingernails began to frantically slice at the long tongue.\n\n\"Pfft!\"\n\nThe tongue snapped.\n\nThe little loli collapsed to her knees, her body convulsing. The light in her eyes flickered, at times clear, at times hazy.\n\nShe had barely managed to escape from Rongcheng,\n\nonly to have some half-formed Corpse Ghoul attack her home at a time like this!\n\nAny other time, if a creature like this dared to offend her, she would have utterly obliterated its body and soul!\n\n\"You're... a Ghost Messenger? There's really an Underworld, really a Netherworld?\"\n\nThe old man's appearance was terrifying, with a large hole in his chest and pus covering his body. He first muttered to himself, then began to roar like a madman:\n\n\"If there's an Underworld, if there's a Netherworld, then why haven't the people who deserve to go to hell gone to hell!\n\nWhy can those villains, those sinners, continue to harm people in the mortal realm!\n\nI... I... I'll eat all of you! I'll chop up you bunch of useless, do-nothing freeloaders,\n\nand throw you all in a pot to boil!\"\n\nAs he spoke, the old man lifted the unconscious Wang Ke again. With a \"clang,\" he swept aside the pot on the stove, where the blue flames of the gas burner still danced.\n\nThe old man grinned malevolently, making a move to thrust Wang Ke's head into the flames.\n\nThe little loli struggled to lift her head,\n\nand snapped:\n\n\"How long are you going to stand by and watch? I understand if you didn't want me to come back alive, but are you really going to stand by and do nothing while your childhood friend dies?\"\n\n\"I really didn't expect you to be back already.\"\n\nFrom the entryway, Zhou Ze's figure emerged. He walked over to the little loli, looking at her kneeling on the ground with her butt in the air.\n\nHe felt a strange sense of base pleasure, the kind felt by a low-level extra who wouldn't survive half an episode.\n\nTo put it simply, it was the gloating of a petty person who has gotten their way!\n\n*So you have a day like this, too.*\n\n\"Here, let Uncle give you a pat.\"\n\nSaying this, Zhou Ze reached out and ruffled the little loli's hair.\n\n*Heh heh,*\n\n*so you really do have a day like this.*\n\nThe little loli bit her lip, her eyes filled with shame and anger. She forced out two words:\n\n\"Save him.\"\n\n\"You really see him as your dad?\"\n\nZhou Ze was a little surprised.\n\nZhou Ze knew she was injured. She could have stayed upstairs, but she still appeared. It seemed his childhood friend wasn't completely useless after all, to be able to make a Ghost Messenger willing to risk her own life to save him.\n\nLooking back at himself,\n\nhe was practically a textbook villain right now.\n\nEven he felt he was being a bit of a scumbag.\n\nTesting whether the little loli had returned was just something he'd thought of on the spur of the moment, but if Zhou Ze had stepped in earlier, Wang Ke would have at least been spared the physical suffering.\n\nZhou Ze was also in a bit of a daze. People... really do change, it seems.\n\nHis past self was so kind, so eager to help others, with a doctor's parental heart. ¹\n\nHis present self seemed much more selfish than before.\n\nOf course, Zhou Ze couldn't afford not to be cautious. The little loli's existence was a constant worry to him; he had to handle her with care.\n\nThe old man paused when he saw Zhou Ze walk in, but seeing that Zhou Ze was ignoring him and only talking to the little girl without even a glance his way, he didn't hesitate and continued to move Wang Ke's head toward the flames.\n\n\"Ying ying ying!\"\n\nA cry came from outside the kitchen window.\n\nImmediately after,\n\na slender white figure smashed through the windowpane and flew inside, knocking the old man to the ground. Wang Ke also rolled to the side, spared from being barbecued—at least, for now.\n\nThe old man quickly sprang back up and lunged at the white figure. For a moment, a series of dull thuds echoed through the kitchen, as if two people were swinging sledgehammers and furiously smashing things.\n\nWhat followed,\n\nwas a battle between the domesticated and the feral.\n\n***\n\n¹ A Chinese idiom, `医者父母心` (yīzhě fùmǔ xīn), meaning that a doctor should have the benevolent heart of a parent toward their patients.",

    "content": "For the longest time, Zhou Ze hadn't seen Bai Yingying in a fight. Bai Yingying’s daily work was actually just cleaning, acting as a sales clerk, eating chicken,¹ and sleeping with him.\n\nBut Zhou Ze had never forgotten the time when he and Xu Qinglang had first properly faced Bai Yingying after she had awakened.\n\nWhy was Bai Yingying so docile?\n\nBecause he had once stabbed her until she couldn't take it anymore.\n\nBut that didn't mean she had truly become a timid little quail. For instance, the last time Zhou Ze saw Bai Yingying playing games—her true nature was not that of a sweet, gentle girl.\n\nA zombie, after all, is a zombie. Certain fierce elements branded into her very bones would never be erased, just as Zhou Ze himself wasn't really conscious of what he would do after drinking to the point of blacking out.\n\nIf zombies were really all docile, obedient babies, Lady Bai wouldn't have specifically instructed Zhou Ze to burn her corpse with bamboo on the next Winter Clothes Festival when she went to Hell.\n\nThat old man, the little loli had called him a \"corpse ghoul.\" Zhou Ze didn't know what the term meant, but he could roughly guess that it was a notch below an authentic zombie.\n\nAt least Bai Yingying's fingers didn't suddenly snap off while she was carrying a plastic bag, nor was she constantly oozing disgusting acidic fluid from all over her body. If Bai Yingying were like that, Zhou Ze would rather go back to sleeping in a freezer than let her sleep with him.\n\nHe would even burn her without hesitation as a sacrifice to the heavens when the Winter Clothes Festival arrived.\n\nSo, this was, after all, a society that judges by appearances. Many people, after being hurt in the competition of looks, would unwillingly mutter a few words like \"what's inside is most important.\"\n\nBut in reality, even after you die, whether or not you have good looks is still a very important matter.\n\n\"BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!\"\n\nA series of rumbles came from the kitchen.\n\nThe floor was smashed to pieces.\n\nThe walls were dented.\n\nThe showdown between two corpses, each possessing immense strength, naturally wouldn't be a quiet affair. But it was clear that Bai Yingying had the complete upper hand, and even seemed to have energy to spare.\n\nBesides, the old man had already been severely wounded by the little loli earlier.\n\n\"BOOM!\"\n\nWith a loud crash, Bai Yingying slammed the old man directly onto the ground. For a moment, juices splattered everywhere.\n\nThe old man's body was already battered and broken, looking like the skeleton sailors often seen in *Pirates of the Caribbean*, with only a few scraps of flesh still perfunctorily adorning his frame.\n\n\"Clap clap clap clap clap!!!!\"\n\nThe old Daoist, who had been watching from the entryway, finally walked in, clapping and cheering for Bai Yingying, shouting, \"Yingying, you're the fattest!\"\n\n\"Shhh shhh shhh…………\"\n\nDragging the old man's body, Bai Yingying walked out of the kitchen. Several green streaks were left on the tiles where the old man had been dragged.\n\nBut he wasn't dead yet. He really wasn't.\n\nSetting aside everything else, his life force alone was terrifying enough.\n\nAnd Bai Yingying was like a cute little puppy.\n\nAt Zhou Ze's command,\n\nshe had charged out, pounced on the prey, and then dragged it back to present respectfully before Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze squatted down in front of the old man. He looked at the old man, and the old man looked back at him.\n\n\"You... you're a Ghost Messenger too...\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"A blind Ghost Messenger...\"\n\nThe old man spat at Zhou Ze. If not for the fact that his chin had no flesh left, a glob or two of thick phlegm would have undoubtedly come flying out.\n\n\"I've always been curious about something. That day at the hospital, were you also watching from the side?\"\n\n\"I was not,\" the old man replied. \"So... the people in the hospital... were knocked out... by you?\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't answer.\n\n\"Those people... were scum...\" the old man repeated.\n\n\"Mhm,\" Zhou Ze agreed.\n\n\"Scum deserves to be killed, to be eaten!\" the old man said stubbornly. \"Heaven didn't let me die completely... it was so I... so I could clean up... clean them up.\"\n\n\"What about him?\" Zhou Ze pointed to the unconscious Wang Ke.\n\nThe old man hesitated. After the sound thrashing from Bai Yingying, his anger had subsided a great deal.\n\nSo, when you're in a bad mood, you can go to a street-side arcade or a dance hall, flick a booger at that group of tattooed or thuggish-looking guys, and you'll immediately feel much better.\n\n\"I don't know...\" the old man answered.\n\nUnder those circumstances, for Wang Ke to have been able to explain himself so calmly, to continue his self-narration even when facing a threat to his life, was actually very telling.\n\nEither this guy had long since put life and death out of his mind and wasn't afraid to die, or he truly had a clear conscience. He could die, but you couldn't pin a pot of shit on his head.²\n\n\"But you were still going to kill him and cook his meat. You've gotten addicted to eating people, haven't you,\" Zhou Ze said with a smile.\n\nThe old man fell silent.\n\n\"You say Heaven didn't let you die, that for some unknown reason you became this thing that's neither human nor ghost, that 'Heaven is about to confer a great mission upon this man.'\n\n\"And I admit, those scumbags in the hospital, even I wanted them to report to Hell as soon as possible.\n\n\"But you eventually fell into a habit. You slowly stopped caring whether the people you killed were right or wrong, because you had become infatuated with the feeling.\n\n\"I once heard a story about a foreign prosecutor. In his early years, he arrested some corrupt officials and became famous. Later, to keep that feeling going, he used illegal means, even deliberately framing high officials, to build his own reputation. It's the same thing, really.\"\n\nZhou Ze reached out and patted the old man's face lightly, then, somewhat regretting his action, wiped his hand on the old Daoist's pant leg.\n\nThe old Daoist: \"...\"\n\n\"When you gaze long into an abyss, the abyss also gazes into you.\n\n\"It's just that you haven't realized it yourself.\"\n\nZhou Ze slowly stood up. \"Alright, that's enough talk. You must be tired of listening. It's time for you to be on your way.\"\n\n\"I refuse to accept this... The suffering... and persecution... that my family and I endured... why did no one... no one care... my family and I...\"\n\nZhou Ze made a gesture to cut him off and shook his head.\n\n\"I can guess that your story is very sad and tragic. You must have suffered horribly at the hands of that hospital. If you told your story, anyone who heard it would surely grieve.\n\n\"But being pitiful and having suffered is no excuse for your violence.\n\n\"Because in this world, there are plenty of pitiful people, and plenty of people who have endured suffering.\n\n\"The vast majority of them are overcoming their hardships and facing their new lives with a positive attitude.\n\n\"Even if some give up on themselves because of it, that's their own business. They don't go around hurting others; they just bear their sorrow alone.\n\n\"So, what makes you so special?\n\n\"It's not an excuse. It never will be.\"\n\nHearing this, the old man fell silent.\n\n\"That's why the show I hate most is the one where reporters interview murderers. In the show, they're always repenting, always complaining about how tragic their past lives were, how pitiful they were.\n\n\"The prison authorities and reporters even go so far as to contact the victims' families and ask them to forgive the criminals, so the criminals can be better reformed and turn over a new leaf.\n\n\"How wonderful?\n\n\"How touching?\n\n\"They even have to strip the victims' families of their right to 'hate.'\n\n\"But unfortunately, that show is still quite popular. After all, there really are a lot of people who enjoy taking a shit from the moral high ground.\"\n\nAfter muttering to himself for a bit, Zhou Ze looked at the old man again. \"I've said so much, so I'll have to charge extra. These days, the higher-end funeral homes also offer psychological counseling for the family. You can consider this an add-on service. After you get down there, send up some more paper money, you hear?\"\n\nThe old man slowly closed his eyes and sighed.\n\n\"You still have a soul, right? Or a consciousness cluster, something like that. You're not a proper zombie, after all. Now, float out of your body, and I'll send you to Hell.\"\n\nThe old man let his hanging hands fall, looking as if he had accepted his fate. Whether he had truly found peace, Zhou Ze didn't know, nor did he care.\n\nHowever,\n\nin the next moment,\n\nthe old man's body suddenly convulsed. His nearly severed neck actually lifted up, and baring his fangs, he lunged to bite Zhou Ze!\n\n\"Pfft!\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't move, but his fingernails pierced directly into the old man's body. The black qi coiling around his fingernails began to rampage wildly within the old man's body. This was a form of torture that surpassed any ordinary meaning of the word, completely eclipsing the physical blows Bai Yingying had dealt him earlier.\n\nBefore his mouth could even reach Zhou Ze, the old man let out a wail. He was in agony, extreme agony. He was also begging, begging Zhou Ze to pull out his fingernails.\n\nBut Zhou Ze didn't move, calmly watching the old man writhe in agony before him.\n\nClearly, all that nonsense Zhou Ze had spouted, all that psychological counseling and guidance, had been useless.\n\nThis was also proof enough that those shows exploring the pitiful and bright inner worlds of murderers were also a load of bird crap. Many people have impulses and hateful emotions, but normal people don't kill the innocent in the name of impulse and anger. Once you do that, you're not a person, you're an animal.\n\n\"Actually, I don't loathe you as much as you might think,\" Zhou Ze said coolly. \"But you can no longer control yourself. In the end, you are not the knight who slays the demon. In fact, you have degenerated into the demon waiting to be slain by the knight.\"\n\nUnder the pressure from Zhou Ze's fingernails, a black ball of light drifted out of the old man's body.\n\nZhou Ze opened the Gate of Hell.\n\nHe reached out, grabbed the ball of light, and tossed it inside.\n\nZhou Ze didn't disperse the old man's soul, but let him go to Hell, leaving him a sliver of a chance. This wasn't entirely because he couldn't bear to part with the performance points, but because back at the hospital entrance, he himself had entertained the thought of borrowing a knife to kill someone and watching from the sidelines.\n\nHowever, Zhou Ze still habitually reached out and took out his little notebook. Then, his eyes immediately widened!\n\nDamn!\n\nThe performance sheet showed: Fifty Percent!\n\nIn other words, this single case from the old man was worth the sum of all the ghost cases he had sent down before!\n\nZhou Ze felt a pang of regret. If he had known, he wouldn't have been in such a hurry to send him down. He should have first asked if he had any colleagues in the same line of work who might also be hiding in the city.\n\nBeside them, the little loli was still kneeling on the ground. Seeing Zhou Ze take out a small notebook, a look of utter horror appeared on her face.\n\nWhat shocked her wasn't just the credential itself, but what that notebook represented!\n\nShe suddenly remembered what the Faceless Woman had told her at the Underworld Store: in her opinion, the prey they were after was nowhere near as significant as that guy in Tongcheng!\n\nAt that moment, Wang Ke's wife suddenly walked over with a knife, fork, and plate. She crouched down next to the old man's ruined body, used the knife to cut off a piece of flesh, placed it on the plate, then speared the meat with the fork and prepared to put it in her mouth.\n\nThe old Daoist reacted quickly and stopped her. She was still struggling, shouting:\n\n\"Let me eat, let me eat, let me eat...\"\n\nZhou Ze walked over to the little loli's side. He looked at the kneeling girl, then looked at Wang Ke's wife, a hint of understanding in his eyes.\n\nHe opened his mouth and asked:\n\n\"Does your mother have some kind of illness?\"\n\n***\n\n¹ \"Eating chicken\" (吃鸡) is slang for playing battle royale games like *PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds* (PUBG), derived from the victory message \"Winner Winner Chicken Dinner!\"\n\n² \"Pin a pot of shit on his head\" (扣个屎盆子) is a coarse idiom meaning to falsely accuse or frame someone for something dirty or dishonorable.",

    "content": "The little loli tilted her head slightly. She had a feeling Zhou Ze was deliberately saying something so ambiguous. She didn’t answer; it was the kind of question where both \"yes\" and \"no\" were bad answers.\n\nMoreover, the little loli believed Zhou Ze could see that, too.\n\nYes, Zhou Ze had figured it out. All this time, he had thought Wang Ke might have some sort of special fetish. Now that he thought about it, it wasn't Wang Ke's problem, but his wife's.\n\nWang Ke was a psychologist, and he was personally treating his own wife's issues. He even had to deliberately play along with her particular fixation in their daily life at home.\n\nHe was acting, and the purpose of the performance was to make his wife happy.\n\nA successful man, he had to pretend to be very happy at home every day, endlessly eating meat and drinking meat broth, and even had to act like he was enjoying it immensely.\n\nHis wife bought meat every day and came back to watch her husband eat.\n\nFor anyone else, it would probably be a form of torture.\n\n\"Tie her up. You watch her, and make sure nothing happens to her,\" Zhou Ze said to Bai Yingying.\n\nBai Yingying nodded, walked straight over, and picked up Wang Ke's wife, carrying her into the study.\n\nThe old Taoist didn't need to be told. He picked up the unconscious Wang Ke, placed him on the sofa, and began checking his injuries.\n\nZhou Ze didn't immediately call for an ambulance to send Wang Ke to the hospital and his wife to a mental institution. Wang Ke should have the right to choose what to do about his wife; Zhou Ze saw no need to meddle in his life and make decisions on his behalf. On top of that, Zhou Ze couldn't be bothered with such a hassle.\n\nAlthough Wang Ke was unconscious and injured, his condition wasn't critical. He should wake up soon. When that time comes, he can decide for himself.\n\nBesides, at this moment, Zhou Ze had another matter to resolve.\n\nHe picked up the little loli.\n\nThe little loli struggled.\n\nIn the past, the little loli had also let Zhou Ze pick her up, but that was because she wanted to be \"on equal footing\" with Zhou Ze in terms of height. Back then, she had carried herself with poise, restraint, and an air of absolute oppression and control.\n\nBut now, the tables had turned. This time, when Zhou Ze picked her up, he was treating her purely like the little sister from next door.\n\n*I'll give you a rub,*\n\n*I'll give you a pinch,*\n\n*See if you'll still be so cheeky.*\n\nZhou Ze carried the little loli upstairs.\n\nThe old Taoist stood at the bottom of the stairs, watching Zhou Ze carry her up, his face a mask of conflict and struggle. He was debating whether or not to stop his boss from doing such a beastly thing.\n\n*How beastly,*\n\n*She's still just a child.*\n\nIf Zhou Ze knew what the old Taoist was thinking right now, he'd probably punch a few skylights into his body without the slightest hesitation.\n\nPlacing the little loli on the bed, Zhou Ze took a step back. He saw that she had already fallen asleep while he was carrying her upstairs. Now she lay on the bed, letting out cute little \"snores,\" like a delicate piece of porcelain.\n\nA moment later, she rubbed her eyes, looked at Zhou Ze with some surprise, and said in a soft, sweet voice:\n\n\"Uncle, why are you at my house? And in my room?\"\n\nSo cute, so adorable.\n\nBut Zhou Ze, like a brutish man with no appreciation for charm, simply lifted the little loli up again, dangling her in his hands while saying:\n\n\"I don't care if you're pretending. It's all the same to me. If this is an act, stop it now. If it's not, then get the main consciousness to wake up and take control again.\n\nI have some things, some scores, to settle with you properly.\n\nDon't overestimate my patience. I'm not some creepy uncle who asks little girls home to see his goldfish.\"\n\nZhou Ze swung her back and forth. At first, the little loli was crying and fussing, even starting to yell for \"Mommy and Daddy,\" but after a while, she fell silent. Her gaze became tranquil as she bit her delicate red lip and said in a deep voice:\n\n\"Put me down.\"\n\n\"Oh, still being cheeky, are we!\"\n\n*Smack!*\n\nA slap landed on an unknowable location. The little loli's eyes widened. She whipped her head around to look at Zhou Ze, wishing she could eat him alive!\n\n*You dare strike this exalted one's unspeakable place!*\n\n*And you still dare say you're not a creepy uncle?*\n\n\"Oh, sorry.\"\n\nZhou Ze let go, and the little loli fell onto the bed.\n\nBut the little loli was still glaring at him. Zhou Ze said somewhat sheepishly:\n\n\"My bad. I didn't notice you were back.\"\n\n\"Zhou Ze, do you think you can just do whatever you please now?\" the little loli berated.\n\n*Smack!*\n\nThe unknowable location was struck heavily again.\n\nThe little loli wore an expression of utter disbelief!\n\n*You just said it was a mistake, that it wasn't on purpose!*\n\nZhou Ze stroked the palm that had just slapped the unknowable location and said:\n\n\"This one wasn't on purpose either.\"\n\nAs he spoke, Zhou Ze also sat down on the edge of the bed.\n\nHe said:\n\n\"Don't act like a movie protagonist who talks tough when they're about to die. Because I'm not the villain from the movies; I have no desire to waste so much time talking nonsense with you.\"\n\n\"You'd dare to kill me?\" the little loli retorted.\n\n*Smack!*\n\n*Smack!*\n\n*Smack!*\n\nThree slaps to the unknowable location.\n\nThe little loli's body trembled three times,\n\nher pearly teeth nearly drawing blood from her red lips.\n\n\"A while ago, someone said the same thing to me, but in the end, she died. So don't threaten me with that, because it's useless. Even if you're hiding in this shell, I have ways to force you out.\"\n\n\"You were the one who killed her?\" The little loli knew who Zhou Ze had killed—no, to be precise, which ghost he had killed.\n\nHe had already killed one Ghost Emissary. Zhou Ze wouldn't mind killing another.\n\n\"What do you want to ask? Just say it.\"\n\nThe little loli turned over and sat up on the bed, hiding her unknowable location.\n\nZhou Ze took out his credentials, held them in his hand, and asked, \"How exactly does a Ghost Emissary take up their post? Do I count as being on the job now?\"\n\n\"You have the credentials, and you have my Key to the Gate of Hell. You are a Ghost Emissary.\"\n\n\"Is the management really that lax?\" Zhou Ze was a little surprised.\n\n\"Ghost Emissaries are merely the lowest rank in the Underworld. The mortal world is so vast; if even the lowest-ranking Ghost Emissaries had to be individually selected and appointed by the higher-ups of the Underworld, then the higher-ups would never get anything else done.\n\nEven the Ghost Captains above the Emissaries don't require certification, only the acquisition of the corresponding qualifications. But after that, the Inspectors must be personally certified by the Underworld.\"\n\n\"Oh, so that's how it is. The work environment is surprisingly lenient. Doesn't that mean whoever kills one of you can take over the Ghost Emissary identity?\"\n\n\"The Underworld has its order, the Yellow Springs can—\"\n\n*Smack!*\n\nZhou Ze flipped the little loli back over. Another strike to the unknowable location!\n\n\"Why!\" The little loli endured a terrible sense of humiliation.\n\n\"Speak properly. Stop chanting slogans,\" Zhou Ze reminded her.\n\n\"The Underworld has its rules. Killing a Ghost Emissary is a great taboo!\" the little loli answered.\n\n\"That sounds like nonsense. I killed one, and that guy in Rongcheng definitely killed one too. It's one thing for him to be fine, but why hasn't anything happened to me either—\"\n\nAs he spoke, Zhou Ze raised his hand, preparing for another strike.\n\n*Hmm, feels pretty good.*\n\n\"That's because you didn't break any rules! Besides, the Ghost Emissary you killed already had problems. She was less a Ghost Emissary and more of a wandering, fierce ghost!\"\n\n\"Alright, let me summarize and see if I've got this right. You're saying Ghost Emissaries are the lowest-level small fry. If they die or get injured on the job, no one's responsible. Even if their identity is stolen, as long as the successor doesn't wreak havoc and even continues the original's work as a Ghost Emissary, the Underworld won't interfere?\"\n\nThe little loli nodded.\n\n\"Honestly, being this kind of civil servant is really pointless.\"\n\nZhou Ze pursed his lips. \"Isn't this just discouraging my work ethic? I'm still just a temp, but now I know that even if I become permanent, there's no guarantee. Suddenly, the future of this job seems so bleak.\"\n\nIn the mortal world, people fight tooth and nail to become civil servants precisely for that \"iron rice bowl.\"¹\n\nHere in the Underworld, it's not an iron rice bowl at all. It's a rice bowl that even has to be passed around.\n\n\"Being a Ghost Emissary is the best way for ghostly beings to enter the Underworld and seek an official status. Moreover, the credentials of a Ghost Emissary aren't that easy to obtain. Generally speaking, it's impossible for them to be inherited.\"\n\nThe little loli took another pointed look at the credentials in Zhou Ze's hand, pursed her lips, and continued:\n\n\"Throughout history, many gods of mountains and rivers, unable to walk the grand path of being officially deified by an orthodox dynasty but still wishing to advance, have voluntarily become Ghost Emissaries to follow the path of the Underworld and Hell. This is the reasoning.\"\n\n\"Fine. One more thing.\" Zhou Ze opened his palm. \"This mark—can you still take it back?\"\n\nThe little loli didn't make a sound.\n\n\"Answer me.\"\n\nZhou Ze's face slowly darkened.\n\nThe little loli nodded.\n\nZhou Ze took a deep breath, slowly clenched his fists, and continued to ask in a soft, gentle voice:\n\n\"How do you take it back?\"\n\n\"It's something I gave you. Naturally, I have my own way of taking it back.\"\n\n\"You're kind of dodging the question.\" Zhou Ze reached out and ruffled the little loli's hair. \"Come now, be a good girl and tell Uncle the specifics. This mark, this Key to the Gate of Hell as you call it, what method is needed to take it back?\"\n\nThe little loli looked at Zhou Ze, hesitating.\n\n\"Speak.\"\n\nZhou Ze's voice grew louder. At the same time, his fingernails grew long, their tips sliding lightly across the little loli's face.\n\nThe little loli said in a low voice:\n\n\"Kill you, and it comes back.\"\n\nAn expected answer,\n\nbut it made Zhou Ze's eyes darken completely.\n\nHe wasn't angry,\n\nnor was he furious,\n\nat least, he didn't show it. He just said faintly:\n\n\"Meaning, the pie you drew for me in the sky, the promises you made, and the future expectations you gave me... were all fake.\n\nYou just needed to handle business in Rongcheng, so you had me do your work for you to earn merit.\n\nAnd when you came back,\n\nyou were planning to kill me. In fact, I was also part of your calculated merit,\n\nwasn't I?\"\n\nThe little loli closed her eyes.\n\nThinking back, on that day, Zhou Ze had calmly watched Tang Shi and the old Taoist vent their anger over the situation in Rongcheng, even doing many things that ordinary people would only do in a fit of passion.\n\nAnd at that time, he could actually sit there calmly drinking coffee!\n\nIf he had known back then that if the one in Rongcheng lost, not only would his own interests suffer when the little loli returned, but he would also be completely GG—could he possibly have sipped his coffee so peacefully?!\n\nHe probably would have been even more frantic, maybe even buying ten thousand yuan's worth of fireworks to set off.\n\nSticking out his tongue, he licked his lips. Zhou Ze still looked at the little loli calmly, not flying into a rage, not becoming hysterical. He simply asked:\n\n\"Why haven't you returned to Hell? Is it because you're too badly injured to even go back? Or is it that, in your current state, you don't even dare to descend into Hell and pass through the Yellow Springs Road?\"\n\nThe little loli didn't answer. Silence was also a form of tacit agreement.\n\nZhou Ze picked up his credentials with his fingers, glanced at them, and said as if to himself, \"How much merit can you earn by sending a Ghost Emissary back to Hell?\"\n\n\"I'm a Ghost Emissary. Sending me to Hell earns no merit,\" the little loli replied.\n\n\"Oh, my apologies, I didn't make myself clear.\n\nWhat I meant was,\n\nif you destroy a Ghost Emissary's credentials, then torture her until she becomes a mindless, fierce ghost, and *then* send her back to Hell...\n\nwould there be merit in that?\"\n\n***\n\n¹An \"iron rice bowl\" (铁饭碗) is a Chinese idiom for a secure, lifelong job.",

    "content": "The atmosphere in the bedroom instantly grew cold. A murderous aura began to slowly fill the space.\n\nStrike while she's sick, take her life!\n\nBesides, the relationship between him and the little loli had been a life-or-death confrontation from the very beginning. And the one who had caused all this was the little loli herself.\n\nTo eliminate her and squeeze out her last bit of value—Zhou Ze felt no psychological burden whatsoever.\n\nThe little loli looked at Zhou Ze, then slowly spoke:\n\n\"Do you want... to become a Constable?\"\n\nA person on the verge of death will subconsciously grasp at any straw to gain a sliver of hope for survival, and the little loli before him was no different.\n\nShe knew Zhou Ze wanted to kill her, and she knew he wanted to use her to gain one last bit of benefit and value. She was proactively offering it up.\n\nBesides, her original pride, her original courage, had long since been utterly crushed that night in the netherworld store in Rongcheng. It was true her physical injuries hadn't healed, but in reality, neither had her mental trauma.\n\nThat night, she had knelt huddled in a corner, watching helplessly as the colleagues who had come with her were annihilated one by one, like blooming fireworks. That scene had nearly overturned her entire worldview.\n\nUpon hearing the word \"Constable,\" Zhou Ze remained impassive, just sitting there quietly.\n\nHis unspoken message to the little loli was, \"Go on, start your performance.\"\n\nAnyway, it's not like listening would get him pregnant.\n\n\"Do you know the two basic requirements for becoming a Constable?\"\n\nZhou Ze still didn't answer. Instead, he slightly raised his hand, brought it to his nose, and took a sniff.\n\nThe meaning was clear: *Don't give me slogans, and don't bother with a long lead-up. Speak plainly, or I wouldn't mind re-experiencing that wonderful feeling in that unknowable place.*\n\n*You're about to be cold soon anyway, so I might as well do it while you're warm.*\n\nThe little loli took a deep breath. She wished she could tear Zhou Ze into a million pieces right now, but the tables had turned. It was already a miracle that she had survived her grave injuries in Rongcheng; now, she couldn't even handle a single Corpse Ghoul.\n\nShe was the fish on the chopping block, and he was the knife. It was as simple as that.\n\n\"There are two conditions to become a Constable. One is to meet the merit point requirement, and the other is to have three other Ghost Emissaries willing to become your subordinates, obeying your commands and acknowledging you as their Constable.\"\n\nZhou Ze still said nothing.\n\n\"They acknowledge you as their Constable by proactively offering their soul blood to be merged into your identity token, placing their lives and deaths under your control. Betrayal becomes impossible.\n\nOnce these two conditions are met, you can advance to the rank of Constable. From there, you can work your way towards the position of Inspector.\"\n\n\"Acknowledge as Constable?\" Zhou Ze laughed. \"If it were that simple, wouldn't you Ghost Emissaries be at each other's throats all the time?\"\n\nJust like that slogan the little loli was always chanting, \"Order in the Netherworld, passage across the Yellow Springs\"—if a Ghost Emissary could become a Constable simply by forcing others into submission through life-and-death threats, wouldn't the entire circle of Ghost Emissaries become a chaotic free-for-all for cultivating a *gu*?¹\n\nBut from what Zhou Ze had seen, the Ghost Emissary circle was actually quite peaceful. Otherwise, the little loli wouldn't have been able to summon so many of them to go to Rongcheng with her.\n\n\"First, between a Constable and a Ghost Emissary, there is only a difference in status, not in power. Only upon reaching the rank of Inspector does one receive an official certificate of appointment from the Netherworld, and only then does one truly possess a status that transcends that of Ghost Emissaries and Constables.\n\nSecond, as soon as the Constable one serves is promoted to Inspector, the previous contract is automatically voided, and they can regain their freedom.\n\nThird, you are coercing me right now. Although you are also a Ghost Emissary, your act of coercing a colleague has surely been noticed by the Netherworld. If you kill another Ghost Emissary who has gone rogue, it's considered solving a problem for the Netherworld, and there will be no consequences.\n\nBut killing me will definitely be recorded as a demerit by the Netherworld. You might not think it's a big deal now, but in the future, when you're up for promotion, you will certainly run into trouble. Furthermore, if you continue to act so recklessly, the Netherworld will issue a warrant for your arrest, just like for that person in Rongcheng.\n\nFor these reasons, while the relationship of fealty between Ghost Emissaries does involve coercion and exchanges of benefits, there are rarely cases of coercion through life-or-death struggles. Because it's just not worth it.\n\nThe reason for wanting to become a Constable is to qualify for becoming an Inspector, to escape the status of a mere runner and gain an official post. In the Netherworld, you can have your own memorial tablet—even a tablet on the lowest tier is still a tablet. Therefore, not many lunatics would be willing to use such simple and crude methods to coerce other Ghost Emissaries just to become a Constable.\"\n\nZhou Ze stuck out his pinky and cleaned his ear. \"So, you're saying if I kill you, there will be trouble for me later?\"\n\n\"Definitely.\"\n\n\"So even if I become a Constable, because of what happened today, it'll be very difficult to become one of those 'Inspectors'?\"\n\n\"That is correct.\"\n\n\"Then why shouldn't I just kill you directly?\"\n\n\"You can use your merits, your actions, to erase the negative impact of you coercing me today. It's not like you'll have zero chance of advancing further. I can... help you.\n\nBecause for every day you fail to get promoted, I must remain under your command, my life and death in your hands.\"\n\nZhou Ze slowly stood up, pulled open the curtains, opened the glass doors, and walked out onto the balcony. He spoke:\n\n\"The first time I came here, when I walked out the door, you were standing right here watching me, weren't you?\"\n\nThe little loli didn't know what Zhou Ze meant.\n\nZhou Ze's fingertips drummed lightly on the railing. He was hesitating, and he was thinking.\n\nIn truth, Zhou Ze was a very conflicted person. He was a small person and had never denied it. He was in his previous life, and he was in this one, too.\n\nThe conflict of a small person lies in this: on one hand, they yearn for freedom, yet on the other, they long to realize their ambitions. On one hand, they want to stand tall and admire the scenery, yet on the other, they think of kneeling to beg for progress.\n\nIf he were an ambitious tyrant, he would have accepted the little loli's proposal without hesitation, thinking, *Who cares if you wanted to kill me before? I only care about immediate benefits and progress.*\n\nIf he were a free spirit, like that person from Rongcheng, he wouldn't care. He'd only care about his own carefree existence, and even if he were ostracized, he wouldn't give a damn. *It's either you kill me, or I kill all of you.*\n\nAnd Zhou Ze was right in between the two.\n\n\"How about this? Let's flip a coin.\"\n\nZhou Ze thought of a solution and took a one-yuan coin from his pocket.\n\n\"Heads, I kill you. Tails, I take you.\"\n\nThe little loli's eyes widened. She thought Zhou Ze was joking, that he was deliberately humiliating her. To actually entrust her life to something like a coin toss!\n\n*Are you a fucking idiot!*\n\nThe little loli roared with fury in her heart! Her ten slender fingers gripped the bedsheet tightly. She hated that she was injured; otherwise, she would definitely rip out this person's soul and burn it a hundred times in the fires of hell!\n\n\"Flipping!\"\n\nZhou Ze tossed the coin.\n\nThe coin spun over and over in the air.\n\nThe little loli's eyes were fixed on the coin until the moment it landed.\n\nZhou Ze bent down and looked at the coin at his feet.\n\nIt was the \"Tails\" side.\n\nThe little loli let out a long sigh of relief. Although the process was completely absurd, she would, in the end, get to live. Even if it meant being controlled by another, at least she would survive.\n\nMoreover, the little loli had seen Zhou Ze's ghost token. She knew perfectly well which shadow stood behind that token. Even though that shadow had dissipated for who knows how many years, that Mount Tai had once been a titan who suppressed Hell!\n\nShe was willing to take the gamble; the future wasn't completely dark. Because Zhou Ze didn't seem like someone without fortune. He was supposed to be her pre-arranged merit points and substitute, but she returned from Rongcheng to find that everything had changed. He had gained an identity and seized control of the situation.\n\nEven the appearance of the Corpse Ghoul today had become an opportunity for him to force her out into the open, making it impossible for her to hide any longer.\n\nZhou Ze picked up the coin and clicked his tongue, as if somewhat dissatisfied.\n\n\"How about... we flip again?\"\n\nThe little loli's eyes immediately turned red. Her tongue shot out and coiled around her. She was going crazy, ready to risk it all!\n\n\"Don't get excited, don't get excited! I know you've got a long tongue and good... skills.\n\nCalm down, calm down. No more flipping, no more flipping.\"\n\nZhou Ze walked over to the little loli, tilted his head slightly, and took out his credential booklet.\n\nThe little loli retracted her tongue. Then, she tapped her forehead with one hand. Immediately, a bead of black light floated out from it and merged into Zhou Ze's booklet.\n\nZhou Ze licked his lips. Mysteriously, it felt as if a new thread had appeared in his mind—a thread connected to the little loli's very existence.\n\nA life he could now sever with a single thought.\n\nThe little loli got off the bed and slowly knelt before Zhou Ze. It was a single-knee kneel, one hand resting on her knee, her head raised as she performed the formal greeting of a subordinate to a superior.\n\n\"Lin Ke, paying respects to the Constable!\"\n\nLin Ke must be her Ghost Emissary name; the name of this body seemed to be Wang Rui.\n\nAt this moment, filled with rage and indignation, the little loli's kneeling body trembled slightly. But she could only accept her fate!\n\nZhou Ze looked down at the little loli beneath him.\n\nSlowly, he tilted his head back.\n\nThe once arrogant, short-tempered, and cold little loli was now submitting at his feet.\n\nThis reversal, like a world of ice and fire,\n\nwas indeed immensely satisfying.\n\nJust then, the Old Taoist came up the stairs. Wang Ke was awake, and he had come to inform the boss.\n\nHe had just reached the top of the stairs and gently pushed open the bedroom door.\n\nAnd his eyes immediately bulged!\n\nHe saw the little loli kneeling in front of Zhou Ze.\n\nBecause his view was obstructed, with Zhou Ze standing between him and the little loli, from the Old Taoist's perspective...\n\nThe little loli was kneeling before the boss, her body trembling slightly,\n\nwhile the boss had his head tilted back, hands on his hips, looking utterly ecstatic.\n\n\"Hnngh...\"\n\nThe Old Taoist sucked in a sharp breath.\n\nHe didn't dare make a single sound.\n\nHe immediately and silently tiptoed backward, quickly descending the stairs while muttering under his breath:\n\n\"Damn my life, what an absolute beast...\n\nThree years minimum, three years minimum...²\n\nThe boss is such a beast.\"\n\n---\n**Footnotes:**\n¹ *Gu* (蠱) is a venom-based poison associated with cultures of southern China.

    "content": "Wang Ke was awake. He was badly injured. When Zhou Ze came downstairs, he was still only able to lie on the sofa, his face a little pale, partly from fright, and partly from his injuries.\n\n\"Do you need my help?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nWang Ke shook his head, then said, \"As long as you help me…\"\n\n\"Oh, then I'll be going.\"\n\nThe moment Zhou Ze saw Wang Ke shake his head, he turned and walked towards the entryway, as if he hadn't heard Wang Ke's \"subtle\" plea at all.\n\nWang Ke: \"...\"\n\nStepping out the door, Bai Yingying and the old Daoist followed.\n\nTruthfully, for Zhou Ze, the matter here was already resolved. The little loli would help handle the rest. Judging by the fact that she was willing to risk exposing herself to save Wang Ke, it was clear she still cared a great deal for him as her father.\n\nThis couldn't help but make Zhou Ze feel something. Of course, he wasn't moved by this touching father-daughter scene.\n\nRather, it was about the underworld emissary who had possessed his sister-in-law last time. He seemed to have been influenced by the host, adopting her way of thinking, even going so far as to kill to fulfill the host's sister's unrequited love.\n\nAnd the little loli seemed to be the same, willing to risk so much to save her father. Zhou Ze didn't think Wang Ke's charisma was great enough to warrant such devotion.\n\nSo, did this mean that underworld emissaries or high-level ghosts could inhabit a person's body, but would inevitably be influenced by it in the process?\n\nThen, had he been influenced too?\n\nIt seemed so, for a while. For instance, that obsession that had plagued him for so long:\n\n*She's not going to sleep with me anyway, right?*\n\nRight, that must have been Xu Le's influence. The normal him wouldn't have a mind full of such lewd, impulsive thoughts.\n\nBut it seemed the influence on him wasn't as strong as it was on the two underworld emissaries in the little loli and his sister-in-law. There must have been some other factors and differences at play.\n\nPerhaps because they needed to travel to and from Hell conveniently, the soul of the human host was actually still present. This would allow the body to continue living after their souls departed, making it convenient for future use. But with two souls in one body for a long time, some influence was inevitable.\n\nWhereas for Zhou Ze himself, the owner of this body was dead. The same was true for Tang Shi.¹ With no original owner’s soul getting in the way, the influence was naturally much smaller.\n\nEach had its pros and cons, I suppose.\n\nFor instance, Zhou Ze could never learn the little loli's \"pew pew pew\" technique.\n\nHe hailed a cab and returned to the bookstore. Zhou Ze yawned; he was a bit tired. To his surprise, there was still a customer in the bookstore.\n\nHe checked the time. It was already past two in the morning.\n\nIf it were the kind of customer who could pay him in nether currency, Zhou Ze wouldn't have been surprised. But this was a living person.\n\nA girl in a white dress was sitting there, reading a book and playing on her phone.\n\nShe looked to be about twenty-five or twenty-six, with pleasant, regular features. Her reading habit was a little different from most people's; she moved her lips as she read the text, as if sounding out the words, a habit you usually only see in elementary school students learning a new lesson.\n\nBai Yingying went to take a shower. After a big fight with that disgusting old man, she wasn't injured, but she was dirty. Having been with Zhou Ze for a long time, she had naturally picked up some of his habits.\n\nKeep in mind, she was a *jiangshi*² who had lain underground for two hundred years. Zhou Ze didn't believe Lady Bai had been digging up her corpse every few days for a bath and a spa treatment.\n\nThe old Daoist had gone out to buy a late-night snack. With Xu Qinglang away from the shop, their meal situation was a bit concerning; Xu Qinglang was usually in charge of their three meals a day.\n\nThinking of this, Zhou Ze felt a pang of melancholy.\n\nIf Xu Qinglang didn't come back soon...\n\n...he was about to run out of that juice.\n\nNot in a hurry to go upstairs, Zhou Ze poured two glasses of water and walked over to the girl. He placed one glass in front of her and sat down on the sofa opposite her.\n\nThough it was a bit disappointing she wasn't a ghost, a customer was a customer, and he had to be hospitable.\n\n\"Thank you.\"\n\nThe girl looked up at Zhou Ze, then lowered her head back to the magazine in her hands, slowly mouthing the words.\n\nAt first, Zhou Ze thought it was just her reading habit, but he slowly realized something was off. She wasn't just mouthing the words; she was reciting them with emotion and feeling.\n\nSensing Zhou Ze's gaze, the girl looked up again, then smiled.\n\n\"Are you the owner of this shop?\" the girl asked.\n\nZhou Ze nodded and took a sip of water.\n\n*Poise. Gotta maintain my poise.*\n\n\"How's business at this bookstore?\" the girl asked again.\n\nZhou Ze frowned. He hated when people asked this question, because anyone who asked it could already see that business with living customers wasn't good.\n\nBut he couldn't very well explain to them that he was in the business of serving the dead, so he could only silently endure their looks, the kind reserved for an idiot with more money than sense.\n\n\"It's okay.\"\n\n\"Oh, I think your shop is very nice. It's got a great atmosphere for reading and having a drink at night,\" the girl said.\n\n\"Mm.\"\n\nHaving just subdued the little loli, Zhou Ze was in a decent mood and was willing to chat with a customer. He asked, \"Are you a radio host?\"\n\nThe girl shook her head.\n\n\"An audiobook narrator, then?\"\n\nThe girl smiled and nodded. \"Boss, you're very smart.\"\n\nIt had nothing to do with being smart. These days, there were only so many professions related to voice work.\n\n\"What do you narrate?\"\n\n\"Novels.\" The girl took out her phone and asked, \"Boss, do you usually listen to audiobooks?\"\n\nZhou Ze remembered that on Xu Le's computer, there were quite a few audiobooks stored, like the audio version of the *Story of Bai Jie* series.\n\n\"Occasionally,\" Zhou Ze said evasively.\n\n\"This is my stage name, 'Hua Ye.' I'm a contracted narrator for *Lǎnrén Tīng Shū*.³ Boss, you can try listening to the books I've recorded,\" the girl introduced herself.\n\n\"What kind of novels do you usually record?\"\n\n\"I like to record horror novels. In the audiobook market, horror, romance, and another genre used to be the three big ones.\"\n\n\"Another genre?\" Zhou Ze seized on the key point.\n\n\"They don't let us record them anymore. You know, the more explicit kind of novels. We used to be able to, and a lot of people liked listening to them, but the regulations are stricter now, so it's not allowed. In fact, when we took professional training classes, we used to have lessons specifically on the techniques for recording those kinds of books.\"\n\n\"There were special classes for that?\"\n\n\"Yes. The teacher would hold a class, and a group of us contracted narrators would attend together. Dozens of men and women sitting together, following the teacher's rhythm, all moaning 'ah, ah, ah, ah' together—moaning with emotion and artistry. And the teacher would be on the platform, constantly shouting at us: 'More feeling! More intense! Loosen up!'\"\n\nZhou Ze's mouth fell slightly open. That was certainly eye-opening.\n\nJust imagine the atmosphere. It was truly something to yearn for, a more elegant version of a wine pool and meat forest.⁴\n\nOf course, it was art. After all, that sort of thing, and matters related to it, weren't really all that dirty. None of us were born because our mothers bathed in sunlight, after all.\n\n\"During one class, the teacher called out one of the girls for not being loose enough. The girl replied aggrievedly, 'Teacher, I'm already loose. How much looser can I get?'\"\n\nAfter telling the story, the girl herself laughed. Clearly, she was a talkative person. Of course, talking was also her profession.\n\n\"What brings you here?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nEspecially so late at night.\n\n\"A fan asked me to meet him here,\" the girl replied. \"He's been following my work for a long time, ever since I was a newcomer just starting out six years ago. He commented and left messages for me every day, supporting and encouraging me for so long. I never expected that he and I both live in Tongcheng. But he said he's moving back to his hometown, which is very far from Tongcheng. So he wanted to meet me in person. I agreed.\"\n\n\"He must have tipped you a lot, right?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nThe girl shook her head. \"Not much. But the people who are willing to stick with you when you're a complete unknown are the ones most worth cherishing and protecting.\"\n\n\"He asked you to meet at *this* bookstore, and said he was going far away.\"\n\nA bold guess formed in Zhou Ze's mind.\n\nTo the living, his bookstore was just a deserted storefront. But to another kind of person, it held a different, extraordinary significance.\n\n\"Tell me, are all the people who listen to your books... living people?\"\n\n\"Of course! I never inflate my clicks or recommendation votes. All the popularity and data are real. There are no zombie fans or Taobao-package promotions involved.\"\n\nEvidently, the girl had misunderstood Zhou Ze's meaning.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. She hadn't answered his question.\n\nThe girl, however, thought Zhou Ze was just skeptical and continued:\n\n\"Boss, the audiobook market really isn't that big, but with over a billion people in the country, even if the percentage of people who like audiobooks is small, it's still an incredible number when applied to such a huge population. You have to know, sight limits a person's imagination, but hearing, on the other hand, endlessly stimulates it.\"\n\n\"That's a pretty deep thing to say.\"\n\nZhou Ze stood up. Bai Yingying had finished her shower, and he was getting ready to take one himself.\n\nJust then, Zhou Ze saw a man in a white shirt walk in through the bookstore's entrance. He glanced around, first spotting Zhou Ze, to whom he gave a shy, timid smile. Then he saw the girl next to Zhou Ze and walked over.\n\nThe girl, however, seemed not to see him at all, completely unaware of his approach.\n\n\"I really love your work, and I love your voice. I have to go now, I have to leave. Please keep up the great work. You're not the little rookie narrator you used to be; you're already very popular. Even without my company and support, you'll only get more and more famous! Keep it up!\"\n\nThe boy gave the girl an encouraging gesture.\n\nHowever,\n\nthe girl heard nothing.\n\nInstead, she glanced at the time and muttered something about how her enthusiastic fan seemed to have stood her up.\n\nZhou Ze didn't rush to send the boy to Hell. He lingered for a moment, casually picking up a book from the shelf.\n\nThe emergence of the internet was truly a magical platform.\n\nThrough a screen, not only can you not tell if the person acting cute and coy with you is a man or a woman...\n\nOn forums, in comment sections, in book reviews...\n\nthe ones replying to your comments,\n\ngiving you likes,\n\ncursing you out,\n\nencouraging and supporting you...\n\n...might not just be living people.\n\nThey might also be...\n\n***\n\n**Footnotes:**\n\n1.  **Tang Shi:** Another character in the story who, like Zhou Ze, is a ghost inhabiting a deceased person's body.\n2.  ***Jiangshi*:** A type of reanimated corpse in Chinese folklore, sometimes translated as a \"hopping vampire\" or \"zombie.\"\n3.  ***Lǎnrén Tīng Shū* (懒人听书):** A real and popular Chinese audiobook app. The name literally translates to \"Lazy Person Listens to Books.\"\n4.  **Wine pool and meat forest (酒池肉林):** An idiom describing a scene of extreme extravagance and debauchery, originating from tales of the corrupt final ruler of the Shang Dynasty.",

    "content": "Companionship is the most enduring confession of love, and this particular companionship was the kind where they could never even meet. In the end, the streamer left. She hadn't managed to meet the person who had asked her here, and she would probably go back and reply to that account, asking why he had stood her up.\n\nBut what she probably didn't know was that the person had already permanently departed from the world of the living.\n\nThe boy had asked Zhou Ze to send him on his way. Zhou Ze didn't ask what lingering attachment had kept him in the mortal realm for so long, and the boy didn't answer. This time, sending a departed soul to the underworld was relaxed and simple.\n\nIt could even be described as \"peaceful.\"\n\nThere was no resistance, no struggle, no dissatisfaction. There was only a kind of calm composure.\n\nAfter finishing this piece of business, Zhou Ze went to take a shower and headed upstairs to rest. Since moving to the new shop, \"business\" had actually improved quite a bit. Looking at the constantly accumulating piles of spirit money truly gave a \"ghost\" a great sense of satisfaction.\n\nWhen he awoke, it was already noon. He went downstairs and saw the Old Daoist sitting behind the bar, teasing the little monkey.\n\n\"Morning, boss,\" the Old Daoist greeted him.\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\nHe sat down on the sofa by the window. Another day of lazing around and basking in the sun was about to begin. This kind of life was truly pleasant, especially watching the ceaseless flow of people outside on South Avenue.\n\nThe whole world bustles for profit and gain. Watching others scramble for their livelihoods and dreams while he himself could steal half a day of idle leisure created a contrast that bred a sense of superiority, and superiority led to better enjoyment.\n\n\"Boss, what would you like to drink?\"\n\nOnly when Zhou Ze woke up could Bai Yingying wake up. If she strayed too far away, Zhou Ze's sleep would be interrupted.\n\n\"Tea, I guess.\"\n\nBai Yingying quickly brewed the tea and brought it over. At the same time, she placed an ashtray in front of Zhou Ze, then lit his cigarette for him before leaving.\n\nSometimes, Zhou Ze himself was a little perplexed as to whether Bai Yingying knew about Madam Bai's instructions, which would explain why she doted on him so meticulously. But from the looks of it, she really did seem to be a bit of a naive sweetheart, holding her Madam Bai in deep reverence and adoration.\n\nSome questions were best not dug into. That would spoil the fun. Zhou Ze was willing to continue playing dumb.\n\nDrinking his tea,\n\nSmoking his cigarette,\n\nThere weren't many ghosts during the day anyway. He would only get truly busy after nightfall.\n\nIn truth, Zhou Ze still preferred sitting in the bookstore and waiting for customers to come to him, like Jiang Taigong fishing—waiting for the willing to take the bait.¹ It wasn't that he thought it was particularly classy, but rather that he found it less tiring.\n\nHe didn't like running around outside; it was too much of a hassle.\n\nHe picked up today's newspaper and glanced through it. The gambling-with-lives case was already developing and undergoing trial. The police had acted swiftly, and one by one, the behind-the-scenes investors and others involved were being detained and arrested. What awaited them was the judgment of justice.\n\nJust then, the door to the bookstore behind Zhou Ze was pushed open. The person who walked in made the Old Daoist's eyes light up, and a fierce glint immediately appeared in them!\n\nIt wasn't the Old Daoist's fault for reacting so suddenly, because the person who entered was a monk. He had ordination scars on his head, which also looked like it was afflicted with scabies—a scabby-headed monk. Quite interesting.\n\nThe monk wasn't tall, only about 1.6 meters, and was a bit chubby. He lacked the air of an enlightened master, a far cry from the ethereal, immortal-like pose the Old Daoist across from him was striking.\n\nSince ancient times, Buddhists and Daoists have never seen eye to eye. During the ancient dynasties, when Daoism flourished, they would suppress Buddhism; when Buddhism prospered, they would suppress Daoism. After all, they had to compete for followers and resources. If you had more, I would naturally have less.\n\nFrom the Old Daoist's perspective, the bookstore was his turf, and this scabby-headed monk looked like he was here to challenge the establishment.\n\nBut unexpectedly, the scabby-headed monk didn't even look at the Old Daoist. He merely smiled at the \"air of opposition\" the Old Daoist was emitting, then walked directly over to Zhou Ze and sat down opposite him.\n\n\"A cup of tea,\" the scabby-headed monk said.\n\nThe Old Daoist, his face grim, brought over a cup of tea and added a reminder, \"The minimum charge here is one hundred, and we don't do fortune-telling or feng shui.\"\n\nThe scabby-headed monk raised his head slightly, looked at the Old Daoist, and smiled faintly.\n\n\"We are not the same.\"\n\nWe are not the same.\n\nA very profound statement. It both belittled the Old Daoist and elevated himself.\n\nThe meaning was: You're a charlatan who freeloads for a living; I have real knowledge and skills. We are not the same.\n\nZhou Ze exhaled a puff of smoke, blowing it right in the other man's face.\n\nIt wasn't that Zhou Ze wanted to stand up for the Old Daoist—after all, a visitor is a guest—but the moment the man entered the bookstore, Zhou Ze had felt a faint sense of alarm.\n\nThe scabby-headed monk wasn't annoyed. He simply put his palms together and chanted, \"Amitabha.\"\n\nIn that instant, Zhou Ze suddenly felt an uncomfortable sensation all over his body, as if countless ants were crawling on his skin.\n\nImmediately, the fingers of the hand holding the cigarette began to slowly grow long, black nails.\n\n\"Patron, please calm your anger. This humble monk has come to drink tea and read. I have no ill intentions.\"\n\nThe scabby-headed monk released his hands, picked up the teacup, and took a sip. At once, Zhou Ze's feeling of discomfort subsided.\n\n\"Go on, get back to your work,\" Zhou Ze said to the Old Daoist.\n\nThe Old Daoist had no choice but to retreat.\n\n\"Patron, it is rather interesting to have a shop opened in the middle of a bustling city—finding tranquility amidst the clamor.\"\n\nZhou Ze said nothing.\n\n\"This humble monk is currently traveling the land. I happened to arrive in Tongcheng today, only to find that two old friends of mine were nowhere to be seen. I was truly curious, and after some investigation, I learned that a figure such as yourself, Patron, has appeared in Tongcheng.\"\n\n\"Who are these two friends of yours?\"\n\n\"One is a woman in the prime of her life. The other, an old man who served at the Confucian Temple.\"\n\nZhou Ze mulled it over. The former must be referring to that problematic female ghost agent, and the latter must be the old dwarf from the Confucian Temple.\n\n\"Are you here to avenge them?\"\n\n\"Not at all. The rise and fall of karmic ties all have their predestined number. Joy and sorrow, union and separation, are all subject to the will of Heaven. Nothing can, or should, be forced. This humble monk has come today merely to see you, Patron, to sit and converse with you, and to form a good karmic bond.\"\n\n\"It seems that those who form good karmic bonds with you don't meet with very good ends.\"\n\nHearing this, the scabby-headed monk gave a helpless smile.\n\nThen, Zhou Ze fell silent, and the scabby-headed monk also said nothing. The atmosphere instantly became awkward.\n\nOnly when the tea had grown cold did the scabby-headed monk finally speak.\n\n\"This humble monk has come to share some thoughts with the Emissary, to explain some concepts. Everywhere I go, I always seek out the local Emissary to have a discussion.\"\n\n\"You talk, I'll listen. When you're done, you still have to pay.\"\n\n\"The Buddha said that all living beings are equal. The 'living beings' here do not only refer to the living, but also include the dead. They were born here, they grew up here; they are, in fact, no different from the living.\n\nIn the eyes of this humble monk, they are also people, also members of the multitude of beings.\n\nThose who seek good are the foundation of all beings and should be cherished.\n\nThose who fall to evil are a calamity to all beings and should be punished.\n\nFor ghosts and demons who harm people, there is naturally the wrathful aspect of the Vajra protectors. But for ordinary departed souls who linger in the mortal world due to attachments or various other reasons, this humble monk believes they have this right, and this freedom.\n\nHowever, since the fall of the Lord of Mount Tai, the affairs of the Underworld have been managed by a system of merits and performance. All ghostly beings who linger in the mortal world must be escorted to the underworld.\n\nThis humble monk has never been able to agree with this practice.\n\nThus, I have come to persuade you, honored Emissary. Ghosts have their good and evil sides, their pros and cons. One cannot apply a one-size-fits-all approach to everything, for that is lazy governance, negligent governance.\"\n\nZhou Ze felt a little like laughing.\n\nSeeing Zhou Ze's reaction, the scabby-headed monk sighed. A practitioner of the Way must row against the current, to do what he knows cannot be done.\n\nHe picked up the newspaper in front of Zhou Ze and flipped to the last page, which contained a news story from another province about a murder case.\n\n\"This humble monk has read this paper. When this incident occurred, I myself was not far from there.\n\nA man went missing, and his relatives filed a police report. The police suspected he might have been murdered, but they couldn't find the body and were at a loss.\n\nAt that time, a woman from the same village told the police that her deceased mother had come to her in a dream the previous night, telling her that someone was buried next to her grave, encroaching on her space.\n\nAt first, the police treated it as a joke, but when they sent someone to check beside the mother's grave, they discovered a patch of freshly turned earth. After digging, they found the missing man's body.\n\nLater, based on evidence left on the body, they found the real killer, a man from the same village surnamed Li.\n\nThe real killer was caught, and the victim could rest in peace.\n\nIn this case, the soul of that woman's mother did a good deed. Good and evil reside in the heart.\n\nAlthough she lingered in the area and did not descend to the underworld, she did not harm anyone and even helped people. A ghost like that, do you think the Underworld should take her in?\n\nShe probably just wanted to watch her children and grandchildren grow up and carry on the family line, nothing more.\"\n\nZhou Ze picked up his cold tea, took a sip, and shook his head.\n\nClearly, Zhou Ze did not agree with this argument.\n\n\"You still haven't managed to persuade me. Sorry to have made you come all this way for nothing. You can go to other cities, other territories, and find other ghost agents to chat with about your ideals and concepts. Maybe you'll find a kindred spirit, and then you can fight for ghost rights together.\"\n\nThe scabby-headed monk smiled helplessly. He had clearly seen this kind of reaction many times before. Frustrated, he picked up the newspaper again, looked at the story, and sighed once more.\n\nZhou Ze reached out and pressed the newspaper down.\n\nThe scabby-headed monk looked at Zhou Ze, puzzled.\n\n\"Monk, there's a saying: don't try to run before you've learned to walk. You say you've been fighting for the rights of ghosts, but you can't even see people clearly. What qualification do you have to speak for ghosts?\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\nZhou Ze tapped his finger on the news article and shook his head.\n\n\"You said you were in that place at the time. So, did you find that old mother's departed soul in that village?\"\n\nThe scabby-headed monk shook his head. \"This humble monk was not fortunate enough to see her. If I had been, I would certainly have treated her with courtesy. Though her body has perished, her good intentions remain.\"\n\nZhou Ze smiled. \"I've never been to that place, but I'd bet a drawer full of spirit money against you that this old mother's departed soul doesn't exist at all. After she died, her soul would have long since gone to the underworld.\"\n\n\"How is that possible... You are a ghost agent. Can it be that you don't believe there are ghosts in this world?\"\n\nThe scabby-headed monk found this absurd.\n\n\"The person who went missing and was murdered was from the same village.\n\nThe killer who murdered him and hid the body was also from the same village.\n\nAnd then the woman who came forward to give the police the clue via a dream is also from the same village. Isn't it obvious enough?\"\n\nZhou Ze lit another cigarette. \"The newspaper said the police didn't believe it at first, and that after excavating the grave and finding the body, they found it very strange. That's a reporter's trick, a way to write the news to make it more interesting and attract attention.\n\nBut in reality, I believe the local police knew what was what.\n\nThe woman came to report it. It's highly likely that she happened to pass by and saw the killer hiding the body.\"\n\n\"Then why didn't she tell the police directly?\" the scabby-headed monk asked.\n\n\"Because the killer is also from the same village. The killer probably has parents, children, and siblings. If she reported it directly, wouldn't the family resent her?\n\nSo, she fabricated a story about ghosts and gods—the whole 'mother came to me in a dream'—to vaguely reveal the clue in a way that would prevent her from being resented.\n\nIt's just like in some remote areas with human trafficking cases. Do you really think the neighbors don't know that this family bought a person?\n\nOr do you think everyone in the entire village is a bad person, that no one has a conscience, that not a single person has a shred of goodness in their heart?\n\nIt's just that everyone feels that reporting it would alienate a neighbor they see day in and day out. Even if they sympathize with the poor trafficked woman, they can only pretend they haven't seen anything.\"\n\nThe scabby-headed monk froze for a moment, then asked in a daze, \"What is this?\"\n\n\"Human nature.\"\n\n---\n¹ A reference to the legendary sage Jiang Ziya, who famously fished with a straight hook, believing that only those who were destined to be 'caught' by him would come willingly. It signifies patience and passivity.",

    "content": "The bald monk had come suddenly, and he left just as suddenly. Of course, under the old Daoist's menacing glare, he paid his bill.\n\n\"Is there something wrong with that guy, Boss?\" the old Daoist asked irritably. \"This humble Daoist was standing nearby and overheard some of it. He actually tried to persuade you not to catch ghosts. If you don’t catch ghosts, Boss, where will you get your performance quota and nether currency?\"\n\nAfter speaking, the old Daoist waved a hand, turning off the shop lights. Even though it was daytime, the shop's brightness dropped considerably. Then, as if showing off a treasure, he yelled:\n\n\"Monkey!\"\n\nThe little monkey immediately jumped over, holding two plastic fans dusted with silver glitter. When waved, they really did create a brilliant effect.\n\nThe old Daoist and the monkey stood in a line. The monkey and the old Daoist stomped their feet in unison, shouting at the same time:\n\n\"Our slogan is!\"\n\n\"Work! Work! Work!\" (Squeak squeak squeak squeak)\n\n\"Our spirit is!\"\n\n\"Struggle! Struggle! Struggle!\" (Squeak squeak squeak squeak)\n\n\"Our goal is!\"\n\n\"Nether currency! Nether currency! Nether currency!\" (Squeak squeak squeak squeak)\n\n\"Alright, dismiss!\"\n\nThe monkey immediately retreated, jumping back onto the bar counter.\n\nZhou Ze stood to the side, not knowing whether to laugh or cry.\n\n\"Nether currency is justice, nether currency is everything. Boss, you absolutely cannot let him fool you.\"\n\nThe old Daoist had a scar on his chest. He claimed that he once dodged a knife aimed at his heart by relying on nether currency, which was why he had such a deep obsession with it.\n\nZhou Ze waved his hand, indicating he understood.\n\n\"Huh, it's you?\"\n\nThe bookstore door was pushed open, and a young man walked in.\n\nZhou Ze recognized this young man. He was an intern doctor at the People's Hospital. When Zhou Ze had been at the hospital pretending to be a doctor and treating patients, the intern had been there several times. You could say Zhou Ze had helped him out of a few jams.\n\n\"What are you doing here?\"\n\nThe young intern doctor was very curious about Zhou Ze. Being naturally naive, he still hadn't figured out the relationship between Zhou Ze and Doctor Lin and still thought Zhou Ze was a real doctor.\n\nOf course, it was also because Zhou Ze's diagnostic methods were truly superb, which made it genuinely hard for the young intern to tell the difference.\n\n\"There's no future in being a doctor, so I went into business,\" Zhou Ze replied perfunctorily.\n\n\"You opened this bookstore?\"\n\n\"You could say that.\"\n\nJust then, Tang Shi appeared at the top of the stairs, looking at Zhou Ze.\n\n\"You sit down first, I'll be right there.\"\n\nThe young doctor sat down nearby. The old Daoist eagerly served him tea. As long as you accepted the tea, there was a one-hundred-yuan minimum charge.\n\nZhou Ze walked over to Tang Shi. \"What's up?\"\n\n\"Are you free tomorrow?\" Tang Shi asked.\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Then what were you planning to do tomorrow?\"\n\n\"Haven't thought about it yet.\"\n\nTang Shi nodded, indicating she understood. \"Then let's have dinner together tomorrow night.\"\n\nAs soon as the words were out, both Tang Shi and Zhou Ze frowned simultaneously.\n\nFor ordinary people, \"let's have dinner together tomorrow\" was a normal social phrase, but for these two, it was no less than a form of torture.\n\nIn their ears, \"let's have dinner together tomorrow night\" could be translated as \"let's get electrocuted together tomorrow night.\"\n\n\"Let's have tea instead,\" Tang Shi corrected herself.\n\n\"Are we having a guest?\"\n\n\"You could say that.\" Tang Shi glanced around. \"You can relax. I won't be fighting with you over the maid anymore.\"\n\nZhou Ze smiled and nodded.\n\nAfter chatting with Tang Shi, Zhou Ze turned and walked back to his original spot. The old Daoist and the young intern doctor were deep in an enthusiastic conversation, looking like they were forming a friendship that transcended age.\n\nOf course, with the old Daoist's life experience, he could become bosom buddies with people from all walks of life.\n\n\"What's going on?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Boss, he said the corpses in their hospital morgue are always turning up damaged or missing, but they can't find out who's doing it. I just gave him a little tip.\"\n\nSaying this, the old Daoist took a plastic bottle from his pocket. It was fluorescent powder.\n\n\"Let me tell you, it's got to be an insider at your hospital. You secretly sprinkle this on the bodies. If you catch the thief, you, the intern, might just get a permanent position.\"\n\n\"A permanent position at the Public Security Bureau?\" Zhou Ze glanced at the old Daoist. \"What kind of ideas are you putting in his head?\"\n\nJust then, the young intern took a phone call, likely urging him to return to the hospital. He hung up, smiled at the old Daoist, even shook his hand, then turned and left the bookstore.\n\n\"Boss, do people really steal corpses?\" the old Daoist asked, a bit curious. He knew Zhou Ze had been a doctor in his past life and would surely know some inside stories.\n\n\"They do,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\n\"What for? Steal corpses for organ transplants?\" the old Daoist immediately asked.\n\n\"Do you think organ transplants are that simple? The conditions for organ transplants are very strict. Stealing a body from a morgue for a transplant is basically impossible.\n\n\"Generally speaking, in the past, they might have been sent to medical schools or research institutes for dissection experiments. After all, human bodies aren't lab rats, so specimens are scarce.\n\n\"Then there are some superstitious people who steal bodies for ghost marriages. Others believe that drinking powder made from a ground-up human skull can cure illnesses. In short, there are all sorts of reasons, so corpse theft is actually quite a serious problem. It's gotten much better now that cremation is promoted in the country, though.\"\n\n\"Grind a skull into powder and drink it? Like it's pearl powder?\" The old Daoist made a motion as if he were about to vomit.\n\nZhou Ze sat back down in his spot by the window. A Nissan pulled up at the bookstore entrance. A person got out of the car, someone who had previously gone back to his hometown.\n\n\"You're back!\"\n\nThe old Daoist was thrilled to see Xu Qinglang's figure. He was sick of takeout and desperately missed the days when Xu Qinglang was in the shop.\n\nZhou Ze, on the other hand, was quite calm, but he still breathed a sigh of relief internally. His plum juice was almost gone.\n\nXu Qinglang didn't come in. Instead, he waved at Zhou Ze, then squatted down at the shop entrance.\n\nHe looked like he had a lot on his mind.\n\nZhou Ze walked out of the shop and stood beside him. After a moment's thought, he squatted down too.\n\n\"What's wrong?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nXu Qinglang didn't answer right away. He handed Zhou Ze a cigarette, then sighed and said:\n\n\"I went home for a blind date.\"\n\n\"That's a happy occasion,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Sigh.\"\n\n\"Didn't hit it off?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nXu Qinglang shook his head. \"We hit it off too fast.\"\n\n\"How fast? Slept together?\"\n\nXu Qinglang glanced at Zhou Ze but didn't deny it.\n\n\"That is fast,\" Zhou Ze remarked.\n\n\"I'm not like you. I'm still normal,\" Xu Qinglang reminded him.\n\n\"Then why the long face?\"\n\n\"The problem is, after it was over, she left a wad of cash on the bedside table and left.\"\n\n\"You got paid for sex?\" Zhou Ze was a little surprised.\n\nXu Qinglang was rather dejected. He said:\n\n\"The blind date was supposed to be at a coffee shop, but my date had something come up last minute and couldn't make it. I didn't get the message, so I mistook someone else for my date. So I sat down in front of her and we chatted, then I asked her to a movie, then I went shopping with her, and then, that evening, she invited me to a hotel to show me a script she had just finished. She's a screenwriter.\"\n\n\"I'm guessing it was a 'fluorescent' script, the kind you have to turn off the lights to read.\"\n\nXu Qinglang looked helpless, running a hand through his hair.\n\n\"She left three thousand yuan on the bedside table after she left. I thought she was my blind date, and I was a bit surprised, wondering if she was just very open and progressive, or if this was a case of love at first sight and she just couldn't help herself?\"\n\n\"Most cases of 'love at first sight' are actually just lust at first sight.\"\n\n\"Turns out that wasn't the case at all,\" Xu Qinglang said, conflicted.\n\n\"So she thought you were a gigolo?\"¹\n\n\"Can you shut up?\" Xu Qinglang looked at Zhou Ze with a resentful expression.\n\n\"You took the money, and you slept with the person. You didn't lose out on anything.\"\n\n\"That may be true, but I feel like my pride has taken a hit. I'm a man with over twenty properties, and a woman paid me for sex like a gigolo!\"\n\n\"You know, if you look at things from a different angle, you might feel better.\"\n\n\"For example?\"\n\n\"For example, you're the gigolo with the most properties.\"\n\n\"...\"\n\n\"Or, among people with a lot of properties, you're the one who most resembles a gigolo.\"\n\n\"...\"\n\n\"Sorry, I'm not very good at comforting people.\" Zhou Ze patted Xu Qinglang's shoulder and continued:\n\n\"Pull yourself together.\n\nThe bed is the most decadent place in the world. Why take a relationship that starts in bed so seriously?\n\nBy the way, did you go back to your hometown just for the blind date?\"\n\n\"Not entirely. The family's ancestral graves are being relocated for a demolition project, so I went back to move them. Oh, and something weird happened. I'll tell you about it in a few days. Right now, I just want to go up and rest.\"\n\nXu Qinglang stood up, pushed open the bookstore door, grabbed a bottle of red wine from the bar counter, and went upstairs to his room.\n\nThe afternoon passed rather leisurely. It wasn't until eight in the evening that Zhou Ze finally perked up. Usually, around this time, the real customers would start to arrive.\n\nXu Qinglang was probably drowning his sorrows in wine and didn't come downstairs, so dinner was takeout again.\n\nThe old Daoist and the little monkey sat on one stool, the pair of them nibbling on peanuts and sipping wine. The old Daoist had even trained the little monkey to hold its liquor.\n\nThe bookstore door was pushed open, the curtain making a crisp sound.\n\nThe person who came in was the intern doctor.\n\nThe old Daoist was a bit drunk. He waved, beckoning the intern doctor to come have a drink with him.\n\nThere was nothing to be done about it. In the entire bookstore, he couldn't find anyone else to drink with him, so he had to drink with the monkey. Now that a real person had arrived, he was naturally delighted.\n\n\"I just got off work. I completely forgot I didn't pay when I was here today. Oh, and I still have to give you the money for the fluorescent powder.\" The intern was still as wooden and honest as ever.\n\n\"Don't be like that! It's just a hundred yuan for tea, and adding the fluorescent powder only brings it to one-fifty.\"\n\nThe old Daoist said, pretending to be magnanimous.\n\nThe other man handed over the money, which the old Daoist accepted with a show of annoyance. Then he patted the intern's shoulder and said:\n\n\"If you really want to thank me, take me out to a restaurant. We brothers can have a good drink and a chat.\"\n\nAfter saying this, the old Daoist glanced guiltily at Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze nodded, granting him leave.\n\nThe intern didn't refuse either. He wasn't a local, and due to his personality, he didn't have any close friends here. At that moment, he and the old Daoist walked out of the bookstore with their arms slung over each other's shoulders, off to find a pub.\n\nIt was already dark, but the streetlights were reasonably bright.\n\nThe old Daoist and the intern walked for a stretch. Just as they were about to reach the pub up ahead, the old Daoist turned into a small, dark alley beside them, unbuckled his pants, and said:\n\n\"Sorry, man, gotta take a leak first.\"\n\nThe intern didn't act like a stranger, standing side-by-side with the old Daoist and unbuckling his belt as well.\n\n\"Heh, you're a good kid, down-to-earth. I like you!\"\n\n\"Haha, it's pretty exciting, urinating in public,\" the intern said, clearly having been corrupted by the old Daoist.\n\n\"What's the big deal? It's just human nature. By the way, did you sprinkle that fluorescent powder I gave you this afternoon on the bodies?\" the old Daoist asked.\n\n\"I did, but another body went missing today. The hospital even called the police, but they still haven't found any clues.\"\n\n\"It didn't work?\" the old Daoist said, sounding a bit apologetic.\n\n\"Nope, it didn't work,\" the intern doctor confirmed with a nod.\n\n\"Well, forget it then. Let's go Dutch on the drinks tonight.\"\n\n\"It's fine, it's on me,\" the intern said.\n\n\"Alright, you've got style, kid. I've got a good feeling about you!\"\n\nWith that, the old Daoist, without even washing his hands, clapped the other man on the shoulder in encouragement!\n\n\"You're older, it's only right.\"\n\nThe intern doctor smiled.\n\nThe old Daoist suddenly froze.\n\nHe hadn't noticed before, because there were lights in the bookstore, and streetlights on the road.\n\nBut here, in this dark alley,\n\nthe old Daoist suddenly saw that when the intern smiled,\n\non his teeth,\n\nwas a faint layer,\n\nof fluorescent light.\n***\n**Footnotes:**\n1.

    "content": "The hand he had just used to pee with,\n\nwas trembling slightly.\n\nThe old Taoist now deeply regretted skipping work to go out drinking. Wouldn't staying put in the bookstore and wholeheartedly serving ghosts be a fine and noble calling!\n\nWhy the hell did he have to drink!\n\nThe old Taoist was no ordinary person. Although he couldn't compare to Xu Qinglang—he himself possessed no real Daoist skills and was just a charlatan who lived by his wits—he had at least served two generations of \"ghosts.\" He had a keen eye for things and had witnessed all sorts of bizarre and grotesque events.\n\nThe faint fluorescent glow on the intern's teeth was like a devil's smile in the dead of night, utterly unnerving. The faucet, from which he had just relieved himself, seemed to have been turned on again; if one wasn't careful, it might start to drip.\n\nThe old Taoist had previously told him to sprinkle the fluorescent powder on the corpse, and the intern had replied that he had done as instructed.\n\nAnd now, the fluorescent powder had appeared on his teeth. The association was enough to make one shudder.\n\nThe old Taoist wasn't stupid enough to ask: *Yo, you've got some interesting tastes, eh? Using toothpaste with fluorescent powder?*\n\n\"What's wrong?\"\n\nThe intern, noticing the old Taoist staring at him, asked with a puzzled look.\n\nThe old Taoist suddenly clutched his stomach and said apologetically, \"Sorry, my stomach suddenly hurts. I must have eaten something bad recently.\"\n\n\"Let me take you to the hospital. It's not far from here anyway,\" the intern said, helping to support the old Taoist. \"Why are you shaking?\"\n\n\"Holy crap, my liver hurts, it's cirrhosis, it's cirrhosis! I have to go back and take my medicine, or I'll have a stroke and a brain hemorrhage! My heart condition is flaring up too!\"\n\nThe old Taoist spewed a torrent of nonsense. In short, it all boiled down to one thing: *I'm getting out of here!*\n\nEven if he had to invent other terminal illnesses for himself, he had to leave. This world was too dangerous; the book house was much safer. The old Taoist suddenly felt that Zhou Ze's lazy sunbathing posture was so reassuring, and even Miss Tang's cold, icy words were such a great comfort!\n\n\"Let me take you back,\" the intern offered.\n\n\"No, no, you're tired too, you should get some rest. You have to work tomorrow, don't you? You can't be careless with that, you have to save lives and heal the sick.\"\n\nWithout waiting for the intern's reply, the old Taoist wrenched himself free from the other's grip and ran towards the bookstore.\n\nUnder the streetlights, the old Taoist kept looking back as he ran, terrified that the intern might suddenly chase after him. But the man just stood in the dark little alley where they had taken a piss, not moving.\n\nAnd that faint fluorescent glow flickered there, as if the man were standing there, smiling as he watched him run.\n\nHe ran all the way to the book house in one breath. The old Taoist pushed open the door and collapsed to the floor, gasping for air. He had run back with all the strength he could muster, his body drenched in sweat—half from the heat, half from fright.\n\nZhou Ze was behind the counter, tidying up a cabinet. Seeing the old Taoist return in such a state, he smiled.\n\n\"What's wrong?\"\n\n\"Boss, do you know what I just saw? That guy, that guy's teeth were glowing!\"\n\nThe old Taoist recounted the incident, gesticulating wildly, making it sound as if he had barely escaped from the clutches of a demon after a fierce battle of spells that made mountains crumble, rivers flow backward, and the sun and moon change color!\n\nIt was truly, horrifying to this degree!\n\nBut Zhou Ze remained calm, continuing with his task as if nothing had happened.\n\nAfter finishing his story, the old Taoist grabbed a glass of water from the table and gulped it down, trying to calm his frantic heart. He asked, \"Boss, how can you be so unfazed?\"\n\n\"Perhaps he was just playing a prank on you.\"\n\n\"A prank?\" The old Taoist's face was a mask of misery. \"But what if it wasn't?\"\n\n\"Then maybe he has a bit of a corpse-eating fetish. It's no big deal. You can report it to the police. I think there's a law against desecration of a corpse. He could face charges.\"\n\n\"And then?\" the old Taoist pressed.\n\n\"Then what?\"\n\n\"Aren't you going to do anything, Boss?\" the old Taoist asked, astonished.\n\n\"Do I need to do anything?\" Zhou Ze retorted.\n\n\"...\" The old Taoist was speechless.\n\n\"You made it back safely, didn't you? No harm done. Besides, if he really was the one eating the corpse, would he deliberately sprinkle fluorescent powder on it first?\n\n\"Is he an idiot?\"\n\n\"Boss, believe it or not, I don't think that was a joke,\" the old Taoist said very seriously. \"For the peace and stability of society, I don't think we should just stand by and do nothing. If he really is a necrophage, it's one thing if he's secretly eating corpses at the hospital now. But what if one day he can't get any more corpses and still has the craving? Who can guarantee he won't do something more extreme in the future?\"\n\nHearing this, Zhou Ze nodded, as if finding the old Taoist's words quite reasonable. Then he reached out and patted the little monkey beside him on the head.\n\n\"Then you can take Brother Monkey here and go slay some demons. Restore peace and order to the mortal realm.\"\n\nThe little monkey, though it didn't understand, seemed greatly encouraged and vigorously waved the plastic toy hammer in its hand.\n\n\"Squeak squeak squeak!\"\n\nThe old Taoist's face fell. He slumped into a nearby chair, clearly still shaken.\n\nAfter a while, the old Taoist looked up at Zhou Ze and saw that he was preparing some snacks and a small bottle of liquor. He asked curiously, \"Boss, are you preparing a midnight snack?\"\n\n\"Offerings.\"\n\n\"Offerings? The Qingming Festival¹ is already over. Are you going to visit a grave?\"\n\n\"Mhm.\"\n\n\"For who?\"\n\n\"For me.\"\n\n\"This...\"\n\n\"Today is my birthday,\" Zhou Ze explained.\n\nThe old Taoist was slightly stunned. There was a profound sense of dissonance in having a \"living, breathing person\" in front of him say he was making offerings to himself, and for his own posthumous birthday at that.\n\nZhou Ze packed everything into a shoulder bag and walked out from behind the counter.\n\n\"Boss, how about I go with you?\" the old Taoist offered eagerly. \"You don't have a driver's license.\"\n\nZhou Ze hesitated for a moment, then nodded.\n\nIf he drove himself and ran into a police checkpoint, not having a license would indeed be troublesome.\n\nThe old Taoist drove Xu Qinglang's Nissan, taking Zhou Ze to the cemetery.\n\nThe cemetery gates were already closed, but the railings weren't very high. A quick climb and they were in.\n\nThe old Taoist understood why Zhou Ze wanted to come at night. Only at night, when all was quiet and deserted, could one truly experience that kind of feeling.\n\nInside the cemetery, rows of tombstones stood in neat order. For so many people, life's final chapter was written here.\n\nLate at night, there were even faint murmurs in the cemetery, as if someone was talking.\n\nAt first, the old Taoist thought he was hearing things, but after listening carefully for a moment, he realized there was indeed a sound. He immediately reached down and touched his crotch.\n\n\"Boss, there's a demonic aura!\"\n\nZhou Ze ignored him and pointed to a small stand up ahead. On it was a box with a speaker, its surface covered in solar panels.\n\nThe sound was coming from inside it.\n\nThe old Taoist was baffled. He walked over curiously and saw there were even instructions. It listed what programs would be played at what times of day—morning news, emotional talk shows, international news, local news, and so on.\n\n\"Damn, they've gotten this user-friendly?\"\n\nThe old Taoist had only ever heard of people leaving QR codes on their tombstones and already thought that was quite progressive. He never imagined someone would put one of these things next to their grave to relieve the boredom.\n\nZhou Ze found his own tombstone. On it was his photograph and a brief account of his life.\n\nThe Qingming Festival had just passed, so there were still wreaths, small toys, and letters in front of the tombstone—from his colleagues, and from the children at the orphanage.\n\nZhou Ze sat down in front of his tombstone and opened the letters one by one. They were all messages from the children, expressing how much they missed him.\n\nThey all began with \"Brother Zhou\" or \"Dear Brother Zhou.\" Some of the children's letters used a lot of pinyin to substitute for characters they didn't know yet.\n\nZhou Ze leaned against his own gravestone, reading quietly. He didn't cry, nor did his eyes redden.\n\nAfter reading for a while, Zhou Ze laid out the liquor and food he had brought. Then he reached out and began to slowly eat and drink.\n\nHe usually found eating agonizing, and this time was no exception. But eating while reading the children's letters seemed to have the effect of sour plum juice.\n\nAlthough it was still difficult to swallow, although it was still nauseating, this time he actually managed to force it down without throwing up.\n\nThe old Taoist squatted nearby, watching his boss eat his own offerings. He didn't say anything. He understood.\n\nHe was dead, yet he was also still alive.\n\nThe offerings were meant for him, for him to enjoy himself.\n\nThe night breeze was cool, rustling through the surroundings.\n\nThis, perhaps, was a moment of true peace and quiet.\n\nAfter finishing the letters, Zhou Ze stretched and looked at his tombstone.\n\nHe still remembered that day, being pushed into the crematorium, the great fire engulfing him.\n\nErasing,\n\nthe traces of his past life.\n\nBeneath the tombstone lay his ashes.\n\n\"Boss, how about I secretly dig them out for you? As a souvenir?\" the old Taoist suggested from the side.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. Let the past be the past. He no longer had such a deep attachment. Perhaps he did before, but he was slowly learning to let go.\n\nBut then, inadvertently, Zhou Ze noticed a very fine crack where the tombstone was sealed. He immediately shone his phone's flashlight down on it.\n\nSeeing this, the old Taoist also got down on his stomach to look. Then he said, \"This tombstone has been opened recently!\"\n\nInstinctively, Zhou Ze had a bad feeling. He hadn't planned on taking his ashes, but that didn't mean he was willing to see anything happen to them.\n\nIn the end, they were his.\n\nThe nails on his ten fingers instantly grew long. Zhou Ze inserted his nails directly into the crack and began to pry. This saved him the trouble of a shovel.\n\nSoon, the seal below was dug open, revealing a black urn inside.\n\nHe took out the urn. It had weight, which meant there was something inside.\n\nZhou Ze used his nails to pick the lock, then opened the urn.\n\nInside the box,\n\nthere was something,\n\nbut it wasn't ashes.\n\nIt was a handful of small, translucent, crystal-like pellets.\n\n\"Holy crap, Boss, you were cremated into śarīra²!\"\n\nZhou Ze reached in, grabbed one of the small pellets, and gently squeezed. It crumbled. At the same time, with a voice thick with suppressed, terrifying fury, he said grimly:\n\n\"Have you ever seen śarīra made of plastic?\"\n\n---\n¹ **Qingming Festival:** Also known as Tomb-Sweeping Day, a traditional Chinese festival for honoring ancestors.\n² **Śarīra:** A Buddhist term for pearl or crystal-like relics found among the cremated ashes of spiritual masters.",

    "content": "Furious?\n\nHe had to be furious!\n\n\"Boss, we... we should call the police,\" the Old Daoist suggested from the side.\n\nThen, he saw Zhou Ze looking at him with the kind of gaze one uses on a mentally challenged child.\n\nEr...\n\nDid I say something wrong?\n\nBut aren't you the one who's always saying to call the police when something happens and be a good, law-abiding citizen? I've been following your teachings and spirit all along.\n\n\"Old Daoist,\" Zhou Ze said slowly.\n\n\"Yeah.\"\n\n\"If your money was stolen, would you be angry?\"\n\n\"Of course, I'd be angry.\"\n\n\"Then if your ashes were stolen, would you be angry?\"\n\n\"Er...\"\n\n*Who the hell is a freak like you? Your original body is already ashes, and you can still debate whether or not to be angry about it.*\n\n\"I'm going to find that bastard.\"\n\nA black light began to swirl in Zhou Ze's eyes, and his ten fingernails glowed with an eerie luminescence.\n\n\"And then, I'm going to tear him limb from limb!\"\n\n*Of all the things to steal, you steal my ashes. For that, I'll have you buried together with my ashes.*\n\n\"The cemetery office is over there. Go pull up the security footage.\"\n\nZhou Ze directed the Old Daoist. The Old Daoist quickly nodded. *Fine, you're the boss. Whatever you say goes. I'll stop trying to second-guess my superior.*\n\nThe cemetery office's lock was broken right off by Zhou Ze. The two of them walked in. The Old Daoist sat down at the surveillance room computer and started retrieving old recordings, locking onto the camera that had a view of Zhou Ze's tombstone.\n\n\"Nighttime, during the Qingming Festival.\"\n\nZhou Ze gave a specific time frame.\n\nBecause the marks from moving the tombstone hadn't completely faded, it definitely happened just a few days ago. Otherwise, if another ten days or half a month had passed, Zhou Ze never would have spotted this clue.\n\nHe might have gone on for years, coming to pay respects to himself, never knowing that he wasn't mourning his own ashes or his own past, but a box of plastic balls.\n\nAnd he'd be here every holiday, pouring out his grief to a box of plastic balls.\n\n\"Boss, if you ask me, since the guy stole something, he probably would have taken care of the surveillance footage and deleted it. That's how it always happens on TV.\n\n\"Us checking the surveillance footage now is exactly the kind of filler plot I hate watching in TV dramas.\n\n\"Completely useless, just padding out the runtime.\"\n\nZhou Ze's hand rested on the Old Daoist's shoulder, his fingernails swaying gently. The icy, grim aura seemed to pierce right into the Old Daoist's body.\n\nThe Old Daoist flinched, immediately sat up straight, and didn't dare to utter another peep, focusing seriously on replaying the footage.\n\n\"Stop!\" Zhou Ze yelled.\n\nThe Old Daoist immediately hit pause.\n\n\"Rewind a little.\"\n\nThe Old Daoist started rewinding. Sure enough, a figure in red clothes appeared on the screen. The surveillance footage was poor quality, and it was nighttime, so the person's figure was very blurry; one could only make out the color of their clothes.\n\n*He actually found him?*\n\nThe Old Daoist was a little surprised.\n\nThe footage played slowly.\n\nThe person in red bent down and used two scalpel-like tools to pry open the tombstone. The action was clean and efficient, no slower than when Zhou Ze had used his fingernails.\n\nThen, the person took out the urn, pulled out a glass container, and poured the ashes into it. Afterward, it looked like they sprinkled something into the urn—no doubt the string of plastic balls.\n\nThe man put the glass bottle inside his clothes, then turned his head and looked toward the camera's position.\n\nFrom the security camera's angle, it was as if the person was staring right at him and anyone else watching the video.\n\nHe deliberately brought his face close to the camera.\n\nThis face...\n\nZhou Ze found it strangely familiar. It was the face of an East Asian man, with very fair skin.\n\nHe began to search for information about this person in his chaotic memories. Unfortunately, because he had entered that state during his showdown with the Blue-robed Madam on the rooftop, his memory of that time was severely fragmented, and for the moment, he couldn't recall who it was.\n\n\"Amen!\"\n\nAfter saying this word, the person turned and left, leaving behind a meaningful smile.\n\nIt wasn't until the person said his final \"Amen\" that Zhou Ze's pupils suddenly shrank.\n\nThe memory reeled backward, finally landing in that villa surrounded by rapeseed flowers, by that dining table, where the priest had been standing quietly.\n\nIt's him!\n\nHe stole my ashes!\n\n\"Boss, you know this person?\" the Old Daoist asked, finding Zhou Ze's reaction strange.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nIt was past one in the morning when the two left the cemetery. Zhou Ze took out his phone and first called Xu Qinglang, but Xu Qinglang was probably drunk and didn't pick up.\n\nZhou Ze could only call Tang Shi.\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"Wake up Xu Qinglang for me. Use any means necessary.\"\n\n\"Alright.\"\n\nAbout half a minute later, a blood-curdling scream came from the other end of the line.\n\nThen, Xu Qinglang answered the phone, his voice full of resentment as he cursed:\n\n\"Are you fucking nuts, telling her to wake me up!\"\n\n\"The phone number of the lady who rents our shop. Give it to me.\"\n\n\"Tsk, I'll find it.\"\n\nXu Qinglang heard the suppressed fury in Zhou Ze's voice and didn't complain further. He immediately started looking for the number and then read it out.\n\nZhou Ze dialed the number, but a recorded message played: \"The number you have dialed is switched off. Please try again later.\"\n\nZhou Ze took a deep breath. Although Tongcheng was just a small city with a population of only a few million, trying to find a single person in it without any connections was still a monumental task.\n\nAnd now, Zhou Ze's anger desperately needed an outlet, but he had no way of finding any specific information about that priest.\n\nWhen they returned to the bookstore that night, Tang Shi was sitting inside, reading a magazine, while Xu Qinglang was at the bar, his face somewhat bruised.\n\n\"Did you get in touch?\" Xu Qinglang asked while dabbing his face with an egg.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head.\n\n\"Hiss...\"\n\nXu Qinglang felt the pain in his face intensify. *So I got beaten up for nothing?*\n\nZhou Ze walked over to Tang Shi and asked, \"Is there any way to quickly find someone in this area?\"\n\nTang Shi put down her magazine and retorted, \"Why don't you scratch the ground with your fingernails and see if you can summon a local land god.\"\n\n\"I'm being serious.\"\n\n\"I have no way either. Did you lose something?\" Tang Shi asked.\n\nZhou Ze didn't answer. Losing his ashes wasn't exactly something to be proud of; saying it out loud would be as embarrassing as admitting his underwear had been stolen.\n\nIt seemed there was no way. The lady's phone was off, and Zhou Ze believed that even if he did get through, the chances of finding the priest's address or information through her were slim.\n\nThe man had clearly investigated him. He could afford to leave the security footage untouched, most likely because he was confident in his hiding place, believing that even if Zhou Ze discovered what had happened, he wouldn't be able to find him.\n\nSuddenly, Zhou Ze thought of something. He took out his phone and dialed a number he hadn't saved with a name.\n\n\"Hello, who are you?\"\n\nA cute, loli-like voice came from the other end of the line.\n\n\"Get your sister on the phone,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Who are you? I don't have a si—... Constable, I was just sleeping.\"\n\nThe loli voice suddenly changed into the tone of a mature woman.\n\n\"Help me find someone. A priest from Japan. He's been active in Tongcheng recently.\"\n\n\"Alright.\"\n\nThen, all he heard from the other end was a:\n\n*Biu.*\n\nThe call was disconnected.\n\nZhou Ze felt a sense of unreality.\n\nHe hadn't expected his new subordinate...\n\nOh, no,\n\nhis new little sister,\n\nto be so efficient. After he gave her an order, she just said \"Alright\" and went right to it.\n\n\"Hey, let me ask you something,\" Tang Shi said suddenly.\n\nZhou Ze looked at Tang Shi.\n\n\"Has your conscience been bothering you lately?\" Tang Shi asked, pointing to her heart.\n\nZhou Ze didn't quite understand what she meant, then shook his head.\n\n\"Heh...\" Tang Shi chuckled. \"Looks like you're slowly getting used to it.\"\n\n\"Used to what?\"\n\n\"Used to living without a conscience, of course.\"\n\nTang Shi stood up, apparently ready to go upstairs, and added as a reminder, \"Tomorrow night, tea together. Don't forget.\"\n\n\"I'm not in the mood.\"\n\nTang Shi remained noncommittal and continued up the stairs.\n\n...\n\nIn a studio rental apartment, a priest sat on the sofa. On the coffee table in front of him were some pictures and documents. He was sitting there, lost in thought and muttering to himself.\n\nJust then, the door opened.\n\nThe intern doctor walked in. He saw the priest on his sofa and jumped in fright, shouting:\n\n\"Who are you? What are you doing in my house!\"\n\nAt the same time, the intern reached for his phone, ready to call the police. He thought a burglar had broken in.\n\nThe priest, however, appeared in front of him in the blink of an eye, one hand grabbing his wrist, the other clamping around his neck.\n\nThe phone fell to the floor.\n\nAnd his neck was lifted up by the priest.\n\nThe intern felt an intense sense of suffocation.\n\nThe priest remained motionless, maintaining this posture until the intern's eyes slowly began to lose focus. A hint of ruthlessness appeared on his own face.\n\n\"I clearly fed you something extracted from his ashes, so how did you only turn into this... thing with a corpse-eating fetish? What the hell am I supposed to do with a thing like this?\"\n\nThe priest kicked the intern's butt. The intern tumbled to the ground, then immediately scrambled up, drool dripping from the corner of his mouth.\n\n\"*Smack.*\"\n\nA raw pig's trotter was tossed onto the floor by the priest.\n\nThe intern rushed over, snatched up the trotter, and began gnawing on it, the blood from the trotter staining the corners of his mouth. But his eyes flashed with dissatisfaction; clearly, pig trotters and pork were not enough to satisfy him.\n\nThe priest shook his head, looking somewhat helpless as he sat back down on the sofa.\n\n\"It seems his transformation into a zombie wasn't due to his body. It must be his soul at work. Because that body once hosted his soul, it underwent some changes, causing an ordinary person who ingests part of it to undergo a slight mutation. But this mutation is insignificant.\n\n\"Forget a *jiangshi*,¹ he can't even pass for a modern zombie. He just developed a cute little hobby—eating corpses.\"\n\nThe priest rubbed his hands together.\n\n\"So, if it's not the body, is it a matter of his soul itself?\n\n\"His body from his previous life... wasn't the original model either?\n\n\"His 'resurrection in a borrowed body' appeared on the surface to be the arrangement of the female ghost messenger,\n\n\"But in reality, is there something hidden even deeper?\"\n\nThe priest picked up his coffee and took a sip.\n\nOn the coffee table in front of him,\n\nlay photos of Zhou Ze from his past life, photos of Xu Le, and photos of the sister-in-law.\n\nThere was even a photo of the old man who had stabbed Zhou Ze with his fingernails at the hospital that day.\n\nThe priest pulled out a scalpel and shredded the photos of the old man and the sister-in-law. Then, he let out a long breath.\n\n\"Time to start the investigation all over again.\"\n\n---\n¹ *Jiangshi*: A type of reanimated corpse in Chinese legends, sometimes compared to a \"hopping vampire\" or zombie.",

    "content": "Regardless of your mood, good or bad, there is one thing that neither shifts nor changes according to human will, and that is time.\n\nA day passed, and evening arrived once more. Zhou Ze sat on the sofa, fiddling with a fountain pen. There was still no news from the little loli.\n\nZhou Ze didn't think she was just going through the motions. After all, her life and death rested on a single thought of his. If she dared to slack off on the very first task he gave her, to just pretend to go \"biu\" and then sneak back to continue sleeping and recuperating, then all he could do was declare her the winner.\n\nIn truth, how important were the ashes from his past life? Not that important. If the ashes were in his own hands and someone suggested scattering them in the sea or a great river, Zhou Ze might very well have done so.\n\nLet bygones be bygones, let the past return to dust. Zhou Ze was not like the protagonist of some melodrama, who valued some object from the past more than his own life.\n\nBut the problem was this: it was his own thing, something deeply connected to him. He could throw it away himself, but for someone to dare and steal it—that was not okay.\n\nThis was no longer a question of material loss, but a most direct offense.\n\nThat priest, that Japanese priest—Zhou Ze wished he could find him this very next second and personally pierce him with his own fingernails.\n\nHe wanted ashes, didn't he?\n\nThen after killing him, he would turn him into ashes too, and mix in some dog shit for good measure.\n\nThe little loli was definitely still searching. And Zhou Ze knew that as a seasoned old Ghost Envoy, her roots in Tongcheng were certainly much deeper than his own.\n\nSo, as reluctant as he was, the only thing Zhou Ze could do now was eat when he should eat, sleep when he should sleep, and wait while preserving his energy.\n\nThe old Taoist could see that Zhou Ze had been in a bad mood all day.\n\nMost people never get to experience the fury of having their own ashes stolen.\n\nBut the boss did.\n\nAt that moment, the old Taoist brought over a cup of coffee. Feeling he ought to say something to alleviate the boss's oppressive mood, he immediately said:\n\n\"Boss, we'll definitely find that Japanese guy soon. In Chinese movies and novels, the Japanese are your standard high-risk creatures, with a very short lifespan.\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't look at the old Taoist, merely lifting the coffee to take a sip.\n\nHe was unwilling to chat much with the old Taoist when he was in a bad mood, because he was afraid that at any moment, he might get the urge to stab the old Taoist to death. Perhaps his previous boss had also had such an urge?\n\nJust then, Tang Shi came down from upstairs. She was wearing a black dress today.\n\nShe was a cold and glamorous woman, one who always pursued high standards and refinement in her dress. It seemed to be a kind of compulsion for her; Zhou Ze remembered that right after she woke up, she had made the old Taoist buy her new clothes to change into.\n\n\"Let's go get tea.\"\n\nTang Shi said icily.\n\n\"I think I'll pass.\" Zhou Ze really wasn't in the mood.\n\nTang Shi looked at Zhou Ze.\n\nShe stood there without moving.\n\nShe didn't know how to act cute, nor how to beg. She always maintained that icy demeanor, and because of it, when she stared at you, you would feel extremely uncomfortable, very ill at ease.\n\nZhou Ze was a soft-hearted person, a kind person.\n\nHe couldn't stand seeing others feel wronged or unhappy; he always tried to put himself in their shoes.\n\nOf course, the fountain pen he had been toying with had just slipped from his control and was now trembling slightly, poised to pierce his chest at any moment.\n\nWell then.\n\nHe stood up.\n\n\"Alright, let's go get some tea,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nTang Shi retracted her gaze and pushed open the shop door to walk outside.\n\n\"Boss, it's a bit chilly tonight. Bring an extra layer,\" the old Taoist offered solicitously from the side.\n\nZhou Ze waved his hand, indicating he didn't need one.\n\nThen,\n\nZhou Ze also pushed open the door,\n\nand then,\n\nthere was no \"and then.\"\n\nBecause Tang Shi was just standing by the utility pole at the entrance, motionless. She didn't look like she had called a cab and was waiting for it. Zhou Ze could only stand beside her, unsure of what she meant to do.\n\nHalf an hour later,\n\nTang Shi was still standing there, motionless, her expression unchanged. Zhou Ze began to squat down and took out a cigarette.\n\nAn hour later,\n\nTang Shi was still motionless. Zhou Ze was now sitting right on the curb, a field of cigarette butts already at his feet.\n\nLooking at the bookstore door less than two meters away from him,\n\nZhou Ze really wanted to take a hammer and crack this girl's skull open, just to ask what on earth was going on in her head.\n\nIf you're going to wait for so long less than two meters from the door, why can't you just wait inside the bookstore?\n\nInside the shop, the old Taoist, Bai Yingying, and even Xu Qinglang would pass by the door from time to time, see the boss still sitting outside, and then look again to see he was, indeed, still sitting outside.\n\nZhou Ze lifted his head slightly, then lowered it again.\n\nHe suddenly had the illusion that life was very hard.\n\nFinally, a white Roewe sedan drove over and stopped in front of the bookstore.\n\nAre they here?\n\nThe person for tea?\n\nBecause Zhou Ze saw Tang Shi move, walking forward.\n\nZhou Ze also stood up. Watching the car door open, he wondered if he should organize his staff—the ones who had been watching his pathetic spectacle—to all wear bikinis, hold pom-poms, strike a pose, and shout a few times:\n\n\"Welcome, welcome! A warm welcome...\"\n\nBut it seemed that aside from Yingying, who would be worth a look, the other two... no, wait, aside from the old Taoist, the other two would actually look quite good, quite easy on the eyes.\n\nBut what happened next stunned Zhou Ze. There was only one person in the car, the driver. But when the driver got out, he gave off a vibe of extreme debauchery.\n\nThe heavy dark circles under his eyes, coupled with his亢奮¹ state, made it easy to assume this guy was driving while high.\n\n\"Hahahahaha...\"\n\nThe moment the driver got out of the car, he clutched his stomach and laughed.\n\nHe laughed like a pig snorting.\n\nZhou Ze walked closer to him, lowered his head, and looked at him.\n\n\"Hahahahaha... where is this place?\" the driver asked, still laughing.\n\n\"Tongcheng,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\nThe man had a thick Sichuan accent.\n\nProbably a friend from Sichuan.\n\n\"Hahahahaha... Where's Tongcheng? Never heard of it.\"\n\n\"It's in Jiangsu,\" Zhou Ze reminded him.\n\n\"Hahahahaha... I fucking drove out to buy a condom, how did I end up driving nonstop all the way to Jiangsu?\"\n\nYou're asking me? Who am I supposed to ask?\n\nZhou Ze felt there might be something wrong with this driver's head.\n\nAlright then,\n\nZhou Ze had previously guessed that the person Tang Shi wanted to have tea with might be *that person*.\n\nBut if *that person* looked like this,\n\nZhou Ze wanted to join in with the \"hahahaha\" too.\n\n\"Hahahahaha, I'm so tired, I'm so sleepy,\" the driver continued his哈哈哈.\n\n\"Hahahaha, can you fucking stop laughing?\"\n\n\"Hahahaha, I can't! I don't know why I'm so happy!\" said the driver.\n\n\"Hahahaha, is there something wrong with your brain?\" said Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Hahahaha, yeah, yeah! I drove over two thousand kilometers nonstop from Rongcheng to this Tongcheng place. I think there really is something wrong with my brain.\"\n\n\"Hahahaha, what are you even here for?\"\n\n\"Hahahaha, there's someone in my trunk! I think he's my own father or mother, so I joyfully brought him here!\"\n\n\"Hahahaha... huh?\"\n\nZhou Ze stopped laughing and looked toward the trunk.\n\nThen he saw Tang Shi raise her hand.\n\nThe whole car shook,\n\ncreaking and groaning.\n\nWithout the unlock button being pressed, the trunk popped right open.\n\nAlthough the white Roewe had become rather grimy after its two-thousand-kilometer journey, Tang Shi's attitude of not even waiting for the lock and just violently opening the trunk was still a bit much.\n\nIn the trunk lay a person.\n\nOh, no.\n\nTo be precise,\n\nit was a person and a cat.\n\nThe person's eyes were wrapped in bandages, which were stained with a bit of fresh blood. Next to the person lay a motionless cat.\n\nBoth the person and the cat looked as if they were dead. Only the slight rise and fall of their chests told onlookers that they were still breathing.\n\nTang Shi personally bent down and picked up the white cat, then looked toward the shop.\n\n\"Old Taoist.\"\n\n\"Coming! What's up?\"\n\nThe old Taoist came running over. He glanced at the trunk and was immediately shocked. He rushed over and lifted the bandage-eyed person out from inside.\n\n\"Boss, how did you end up like this? You're so pitiful, so pitiful!\"\n\nStanding to the side, Zhou Ze knew the old Taoist wasn't crying for him,\n\nbut hearing such wails while standing right there still felt a little uncomfortable.\n\nThe person and the cat were carried into the bookstore by Tang Shi and the old Taoist, while the driver was still leaning against the car door, continuing his \"hahahahaha...\"\n\nZhou Ze was beginning to understand. This driver's luck was terrible; he had been hypnotized.\n\nHe went out to buy a condom, probably had a girl waiting for him in a hotel room, and ended up driving straight from Rongcheng to Tongcheng in one go.\n\nBut how do you break hypnosis?\n\nFortunately, once the person from the trunk was carried inside, the driver seemed to return to normal. He collapsed directly onto the ground and fell fast asleep, snoring.\n\nIn the end, Xu Qinglang took the driver to a nearby hotel and got him a room. Whether the hotel manager would misunderstand anything, Zhou Ze had no idea.\n\nHe went straight up to the second floor and into Tang Shi's bedroom. The man was lying there, motionless.\n\nTo be honest, Zhou Ze was quite grateful to him. If he hadn't gone on that killing spree in Rongcheng, his relationship with the little loli wouldn't have become so harmonious.\n\nHe might have been facing the little loli's hunt right now, or he might have already been killed.\n\n\"Can he wake up?\"\n\nZhou Ze asked.\n\nTang Shi didn't answer, personally using a wet towel to wipe the man's face.\n\nGently, tenderly.\n\n*How come I never got this kind of treatment when I was injured?*\n\n*We're both resurrected in borrowed bodies. My Xu Le is way more handsome than this guy, okay?*\n\n\"I don't mean anything else by this, I just want to ask, if he stays here, will he attract the attention of Ghost Envoys from other places? Will another group come to besiege him?\n\nDon't misunderstand, I'm not trying to kick him out. I'm just asking so we can make some preparations.\n\nAfter all, you two don't have Ghost Envoy Certificates. Your identities can't be legitimized for now.\"\n\nTang Shi looked at Zhou Ze and said, \"Ghost Envoy Certificates?\"\n\n*Are you pretending you don't know, or do you really not know?*\n\nZhou Ze took out his own Ghost Envoy Certificate and waved it in front of Tang Shi.\n\n\"This thing. With this, you can legitimize your identity. As long as you don't do anything too over-the-top afterward, you can live peacefully for a long time. It's just that this thing is pretty hard to get; you have to rely on luck.\"\n\nJust then,\n\nthe body of the man lying unconscious on the bed twitched slightly.\n\nFrom the pocket of his hoodie,\n\nit looked like something had spilled out,\n\nfalling from the bed to the floor,\n\nscattering all over the ground.\n\nIt was a floor full of,\n\nGhost Envoy Certificates.\n\n***\n**Footnotes:**\n1.  **亢奮 (kàngfèn):** This word means \"excited\" or \"stimulated,\" but often carries a connotation of being unnaturally or feverishly so, as if from drugs or extreme mental states.",

    "content": "Xu Qinglang sat on a sofa, smoking a cigarette. In front of him was a glass of beer with ice.\n\nZhou Ze walked over, reached for the beer, and drained it in one gulp.\n\n\"What's wrong with you?\" Xu Qinglang knew that Zhou Ze didn't normally drink.\n\n\"It's like that time you bragged to that Corgi girl about owning over twenty properties.\"\n\n\"...\" said Xu Qinglang.\n\nAfter a period of silence, Xu Qinglang poured another glass for Zhou Ze. The two men sat quietly.\n\n\"Let me tell you something. I was going to yesterday, but I wasn't in the mood.\"\n\n\"I'm not in the mood now either.\"\n\n\"So what if your ashes were stolen? It's like a pervert collected your old toenail clippings. What's there to be so worked up about?\"\n\n\"Easy for you to say.\"\n\n\"I'm actually quite envious of you. I think if I could one day be sipping beer and feeling sad about my own ashes being stolen, I'd laugh out loud in my bed.\"\n\nXu Qinglang wore a dead-serious expression.\n\n*He's right.*\n\nIf your ancestral graves were dug up or your parents' ashes were stolen by an enemy, you'd definitely be furious, anxious!\n\nBut it seemed no one had ever been in a position to be anxious about their *own* ashes being stolen.\n\n\"So should I post on Weibo to show off in a low-key, luxurious, and sophisticated way?\" Zhou Ze retorted.\n\n\"Heh, just kidding. By the way, have you found the thief yet?\"\n\n\"The little loli is still looking.\"\n\nRight now, Zhou Ze could only wait for news.\n\nJust then, Zhou Ze and Xu Qinglang both looked toward the stairwell. Lao Dao was walking down, carrying a man on his back.\n\n\"What's going on?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nTang Shi, who was following behind, ignored Zhou Ze. A taxi was parked outside. Tang Shi and the man got into it, looking like they were about to leave.\n\nThey were leaving as soon as they'd arrived, and the man was still unconscious.\n\nThe most crucial thing was that he had even \"twitched\" while unconscious,\n\nscattering Underworld Emissary IDs all over the floor.\n\nZhou Ze hadn't even had a chance to chat with him after he woke up, and now they were preparing to depart.\n\nOf course, Zhou Ze didn't ask them to stay. They all knew none of them were the type for polite, restrained pleasantries.\n\nStay if you want,\n\nleave if you want.\n\nThere was no need for the pretense of playing hard to get.\n\nThe taxi drove off, but to Zhou Ze's surprise, Lao Dao came back inside. He hadn't left.\n\nZhou Ze had assumed Lao Dao would go with them.\n\nLao Dao walked back into the store as if nothing had happened.\n\n\"Hey,\" Zhou Ze called out.\n\nLao Dao turned to look at Zhou Ze, smiled憨厚地, and said:\n\n\"Boss, Miss Tang has left with Mr. Liang. Miss Tang had already arranged for a new place to live. They're heading to Shanghai. She said now that they have their credentials, it's not convenient to trouble you any longer.\"\n\n\"Why didn't you go with them?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"I am your loyal Lao Dao!\"\n\nLao Dao declared with righteous conviction.\n\n\"Tell me the truth.\"\n\n\"I can't leave you. I can't let you go.\"\n\n\"The truth.\"\n\nZhou Ze glanced at his fingernails.\n\n\"With Mr. Liang in his current state, there's no way the Netherworld Store can open anytime soon. I'd have nothing to do if I went with them, so I can only continue helping you out here.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded and walked over to his counter. Business had been good lately, and he'd sent many ghosts on their way, so a lot of spirit money had accumulated.\n\nTaking out half of it, Zhou Ze offered it to Lao Dao.\n\n\"Give this to them. They're new here; they must be short on cash.\"\n\nZhou Ze was worried that if Tang Shi was short on money, she might just go rob a bank. That woman was capable of anything.\n\nSpirit money could be used as a consumable, or like a bank card. In any case, after burning it, someone would drop real money at your doorstep.\n\nUnexpectedly, Lao Dao shook his head and said:\n\n\"Boss, Mr. Liang is very rich. He has several villas in Shanghai alone, properties all over the country, and many boxes of 'little goldfish'¹ hidden away.\"\n\n\"...\" said Zhou Ze.\n\nHis heart,\n\nached so much he couldn't breathe...\n\nZhou Ze felt he had suffered two critical hits within an hour,\n\nand both were dealt so casually.\n\nPutting the money back, Zhou Ze silently sat down.\n\nAt that moment, a girl happened to run in through the door. She was dressed in rags, so much so that one could describe her as barely clothed.\n\nHonestly, speaking of which,\n\nin this day and age, under the brilliant leadership of the Party Central Committee, the living standards of the people across the nation are constantly improving. The material and spiritual lives of the people are constantly being enriched and fulfilled.\n\nA new era, new policies.\n\nWith the help of targeted poverty alleviation measures, even impoverished households can receive great assistance. It could be said that the era of a moderately prosperous society for all is not far off.\n\nEven if there were some beggars in the cities, seeing one so miserable as to be barely clothed had become a truly rare sight in recent years.\n\nLao Dao was still wiping a table, seemingly not having noticed the little girl come in.\n\nBut the little monkey leaped directly onto Lao Dao's head, its two paws grabbing his skull and forcing him to look in the little girl's direction.\n\n\"A ghost has arrived?\"\n\nMuttering to himself, Lao Dao took out some ox-eye tears from his pocket and wiped them on his eyes.\n\nIt couldn't be helped; in this bookstore, he was the only one who couldn't see ghosts directly.\n\nAfter seeing the grimy little girl, Lao Dao very consciously looked toward Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Boss, a customer's here. Time to receive her!\"\n\nThat old voice hollered,\n\nlike a dream of returning to the Welcome Spring Pavilion of ancient times.\n\n*Girls,*\n\n*Come out and receive the customers!*\n\n*Coming,*\n\n*Madam.*\n\nXu Qinglang stood up to prepare cold dishes and drinks, while Zhou Ze gestured for the girl to follow him.\n\nThe girl was a bit dazed and fearful. She looked at Zhou Ze, then at Lao Dao, but followed her instincts and walked with Zhou Ze into a private room.\n\nZhou Ze sat down and gestured for her to do the same.\n\nThe girl sat. Xu Qinglang brought over a few small cold dishes and a steamed bun.\n\nWhen he was about to pour wine, Zhou Ze signaled that it wasn't necessary.\n\nAlthough she was a ghost, she was still a child.\n\nBesides, it was clear from the little girl's demeanor that she wasn't some kind of Tianshan Tonglao.²\n\nThe girl began to wolf down the food,\n\nobviously \"starved.\"\n\nAnd this kind of hunger was more like she had been \"starving\" in life.\n\nZhou Ze sat there silently, watching the girl eat.\n\nAfter the girl finished eating, a satisfied smile appeared on her face. She said:\n\n\"I'm so full. It feels so good to be full.\"\n\nThe girl's words carried a thick Tongcheng dialect.\n\nMost children these days probably couldn't even speak in dialect if you asked them to; they almost all spoke standard Mandarin.\n\n\"Now that you're full, it's time to be on your way.\"\n\nZhou Ze prepared to open the Hell's Gate.\n\nThe little girl looked at Zhou Ze with some fear, but she didn't cry or make a fuss, just waited quietly.\n\n\"Wait a second.\" Xu Qinglang, who had been watching the girl eat, suddenly spoke up. \"Want to eat some meat?\"\n\nThe little girl paused, then her eyes lit up as she nodded repeatedly.\n\n\"Then wait.\"\n\nThis was said to the little girl, and also to Zhou Ze.\n\nAlright then, Old Xu wanted to be the good guy, the great philanthropist. Zhou Ze had no reason to stop him, so he continued to sit there.\n\nA quarter of an hour later, Xu Qinglang brought out a plate of braised pork belly. The little girl began to eat again.\n\nIn reality, ghosts consume the offering, the incense, when they eat. The girl seemed to be devouring the food like a whirlwind, but to a normal person's eyes, the dishes on the table hadn't been touched at all.\n\n\"Is the meat good?\" Xu Qinglang asked.\n\n\"It's good, so good,\" the little girl said.\n\n\"Are you overflowing with maternal love today?\"\n\nZhou Ze asked, a little curious.\n\nXu Qinglang shook his head, a faint sorrow gathered between his brows. Since returning yesterday, he had maintained this air of Daiyu mourning the autumn.³\n\nA man,\n\nhaving lost his virtue,\n\ncould be this resentful, as if life had lost all meaning.\n\nZhou Ze felt he should be grateful there wasn't a well in the bookstore, or Consort Xu might very well have chosen to let his fragrance vanish and jade perish.⁴\n\nThe little girl finished eating,\n\nthen patted her belly,\n\nand looked at Zhou Ze.\n\nShe was very well-behaved this time. Once full, she became obedient. A very sensible child.\n\nShe knew it was time for her to be on her way.\n\nZhou Ze stood up. As he opened the Hell's Gate, he asked:\n\n\"Go on in.\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't ask for her story. Perhaps from hearing too many stories in the past, Zhou Ze had become less fond of hearing them.\n\nMost of the dead have their own sad stories.\n\nThe little girl blinked, looked at Zhou Ze, and asked:\n\n\"Do you get to eat your fill before going in?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"Then I'll go get everyone. The villagers are all starving. I want everyone to be able to eat their fill.\"\n\nThe hand Zhou Ze was using to open the Hell's Gate trembled.\n\n*There's an \"everyone\" to call?*\n\n*This means there's a huge wave of business to be had, right?*\n\nSubconsciously, Zhou Ze closed the Hell's Gate he had just opened.\n\nBoss Zhou was in the initial stage of his career struggle and urgently needed results to prove himself. Naturally, he understood the principle of using a long line to catch a big fish.\n\n\"Where is your home?\"\n\nZhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Sanxiang Village,\" the little girl replied.\n\n\"Where is Sanxiang Village? Which district? Rugao, Menhai, or Chongchuan, Gangzha?\"\n\nAlthough Zhou Ze had been reincarnated, he was a Tongcheng native in his past life, yet he couldn't recall a place called Sanxiang Village in Tongcheng.\n\nZhou Ze looked at Xu Qinglang. Xu Qinglang shook his head, indicating he didn't know either.\n\n\"I don't know.\" The girl didn't know where Sanxiang Village was. She had never even heard of the district names Zhou Ze mentioned.\n\n\"Then...\"\n\nZhou Ze was a bit stuck. He could only continue asking:\n\n\"Can you go back the way you came?\"\n\nThe girl shook her head blankly. \"I don't know how I walked out of the village. Then I just walked and walked, and ended up here.\"\n\n*She can't even go back the way she came?*\n\nZhou Ze even began to suspect the girl might have come from the neighboring city, a ghost who had crossed the border, so to speak. But on second thought, that wasn't right. The girl spoke with a Tongcheng dialect; it was unlikely she was from somewhere else.\n\nJust as Zhou Ze was feeling very conflicted, Xu Qinglang, who was beside him, took out his phone and did a search.\n\n\"Find anything?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nXu Qinglang shook his head. \"Can't find any information on this administrative village.\"\n\n\"Nothing on the internet either?\" Zhou Ze was a bit surprised.\n\n\"Hey, wait a minute. Here's a post that mentions 'Sanxiang Village'.\"\n\nXu Qinglang gestured for Zhou Ze to wait, then clicked on the post.\n\n\"The title of this post is:\n\n'Asking anyone with a big dick,\n\nis there a place in Tongcheng called Sanxiang Village?'\"\n\n\"What about the replies below?\" Zhou Ze pressed.\n\n\"Nope.\n\nDon't know.\n\nNever heard of it.\n\nNo.\n\nNever heard of it.\n\n^ +1...\"\n\nXu Qinglang kept scrolling, then paused. He looked down for a moment before raising his head to look at Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Did you find something?\"\n\n\"There's a reply here: 'When I was little, my grandmother told me she was from Sanxiang Village. But when she was ten, she went with her own grandmother back to their old home in Xingdong Town.\n\nWhen she went back a few days later, she found that the village... was gone.'\"\n\n\"Gone?\" Zhou Ze was stunned.\n\n*Gone?*\n\n*What does that mean?*\n\n\"Someone asked for more details below,\" Xu Qinglang said. \"Let me find that person's reply... Found it. He replied to the person who asked, saying:\n\n'That year was 1938. You can figure out for yourselves why the village was gone.'\"\n\n***\n\n**Footnotes:**\n1.  **Little goldfish (小金魚):** Slang for small gold bars.\n2.  **Tianshan Tonglao (天山童姥):** A character from a famous wuxia novel who is ancient and powerful but has the appearance of a young girl.

    "content": "1938?\n\nZhou Ze looked at the little girl, then at Xu Qinglang, and said:\n\n\"The Japs entered Tongcheng in '38, right?\"\n\nXu Qinglang thought for a moment. \"It seems they invaded Tongcheng in March of '38.\"\n\nIf that was the case, then the so-called Sanxiang Village was likely a tragedy of that era. The village was probably razed to the ground when the Japanese invaders entered Tongcheng, with almost no one, including this little girl, spared. The grandmother of the person who made the forum post had been lucky to have escaped.\n\nTo this day, it was impossible to find any other information about Sanxiang Village, not even in official records.\n\nThis wasn't official negligence. In that era, similar tragedies were innumerable. With years of continuous turmoil, many of those who died tragically were simply forgotten.\n\n\"So you're saying an entire village that died during the War of Resistance never entered the cycle of reincarnation?\"\n\nZhou Ze frowned.\n\nIt had been eighty years, more than a sixty-year cycle. The souls of this entire village were still lingering in their original place?\n\n\"I'm not sure, but looking at this little girl, that seems to be the case. How about this, I'll go to the city library and check the local gazetteers to see where Sanxiang Village was specifically located, or I'll consult some relevant people.\"\n\nXu Qinglang stood up, grabbed his car keys, and left directly.\n\nHe was very proactive about this matter. His proactiveness was different from Zhou Ze's; Zhou Ze was also motivated by his performance metrics, whereas Xu Qinglang simply wanted to do something from the bottom of his heart.\n\nWhen it came down to it, these were his own people, his kinsfolk.\n\nZhou Ze sat down in a nearby chair and pointed a finger at the old Taoist. \"Watch her.\"\n\nThe old Taoist nodded and, along with the little monkey, watched the little girl.\n\nThe little girl was a bit bewildered, not knowing what had happened. She just stood there instinctively, not daring to move much.\n\nThe little monkey reached out as if wanting to touch the girl's soul, but the old Taoist slapped his hand down and scolded him:\n\n\"What are you touching? She's older than I am, you know.\"\n\nIf the little girl hadn't died, she would be in her nineties by now.\n\nBut she remained so innocent and pure, completely retaining the mindset she had before death. This was what intrigued Zhou Ze the most. He guessed that something might have gone wrong with that village, causing all the souls within to be unable to leave, trapped there together, oblivious to the passage of time, to the changing of seasons.\n\nHowever, the specific circumstances could only be verified after Xu Qinglang found some definitive information.\n\nZhou Ze took out his phone and browsed casually. He rarely used things like WeChat or QQ, as they were filled with Xu Le's old social network. It couldn't be helped; after all, his own old accounts were unrecoverable and difficult to appeal for.\n\nScrolling through his Moments, Zhou Ze was surprised to see that Bai Yingying had actually shared an article titled \"A Discussion on the Bedroom Skills of Men in the Army!\"\n\nZhou Ze froze for a moment.\n\nThis female corpse seemed to be straying further and further down the path of a delusional teenager.\n\nIt looked like he needed to find some time to have a serious talk with her. It was better not to even touch, let alone share, this kind of stuff. It was taboo.\n\nAt that moment, Bai Yingying had finished her work and was upstairs in her room playing PUBG; she wasn't downstairs.\n\nSo Zhou Ze got up and walked up the stairs, clicking on the shared link as he went.\n\n*Right.*\n\n*To educate a delusional teenager, one must address the specific problem. Know yourself, know your enemy, and you will never be defeated.*\n\nAfter clicking on it,\n\nHe was greeted by a pile of green and white pictures.\n\nAnd then,\n\nIt turned out to be a quilt-folding competition at some factory. The top three prize winners were all foremen who had previously served in the army.\n\nDamn clickbait artists.\n\nZhou Ze put his phone down and pushed open the bedroom door.\n\n\"Seaweed, seaweed, swaying with the waves;\nSeaweed, seaweed, seaweed, seaweed, dancing in the spray!\"\n\nBai Yingying was lying on the bed with her bare, lily-white feet dangling and swinging back and forth. She was holding her phone, scrolling through videos, and snorting with laughter as she watched.\n\nShe didn't even notice Zhou Ze approach.\n\nThen, Zhou Ze sat down on the edge of her bed.\n\n\"Hahahaha...\"\n\nLaughing, Bai Yingying rolled over, and her whole body ended up draped across Zhou Ze's lap.\n\nImmediately,\n\nHer long eyelashes trembled, her alluring red lips parted and closed slightly, and her delicate skin flushed a faint red.\n\nThe atmosphere,\n\nat that moment, became enchanting.\n\nHowever, living up to his reputation as a destroyer of tender moments, Zhou Ze said directly:\n\n\"I've told you many times, you're not allowed on the bed until you've washed your feet and showered after getting up.\"\n\nWith that, Zhou Ze looked at those long, slender feet that were bare and sparked the imagination, and frowned.\n\n\"Dirty.\"\n\nBai Yingying immediately got off the bed, put on her slippers, clasped her hands below her waist, and bowed her head toward Zhou Ze, assuming the posture of someone ready to be scolded.\n\nShe was well-practiced at this pose.\n\n\"Wash the bedsheet,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Yes, Boss.\"\n\nBai Yingying gathered the bedsheet and went downstairs. Zhou Ze sat down at the computer, opened a web browser, and began searching for information about Sanxiang Village again.\n\nXu Qinglang had searched on his phone before, so he might have missed something.\n\nUnfortunately,\n\nregarding that village, at least online, there was no other information apart from that one discussion thread.\n\nZhou Ze also clicked on the post Xu Qinglang had read from earlier. The post was on the Tongcheng local forum, dated 2009.\n\nHe first reread the two replies from the person whose grandmother was from Sanxiang Village but found nothing new. Then, Zhou Ze chose to go back to the original post. There were actually two knowledgeable people in this thread.\n\nOne, of course, was the person who replied, but he had already said everything he had to say. The other was the original poster who asked the question.\n\nSince Sanxiang Village had been forgotten by people, not even existing in records and only living on in stories his grandmother told, why did this original poster suddenly bring up this place name and ask about it?\n\nZhou Ze clicked on the poster's profile picture and found that they hadn't posted anything after 2009. Zhou Ze copied the poster's ID.\n\nThe ID was \"Woxin Changdan Sanqian Yuejia Ke Tun Wu 19800201\"¹\n\nThe first part was very familiar, and Zhou Ze analyzed that the string of numbers at the end was likely the person's date of birth.\n\nThen, Zhou Ze searched for this ID again and actually found another post. This post was in the Penglai Ghost Stories section of the Tianya Forum.\n\nThe poster was still \"Woxin Changdan Sanqian Yuejia Ke Tun Wu 19800201,\" and the posting time was also 2009.\n\nThis thread wasn't very popular and didn't have many replies.\n\nOf course, the ID numbers at the end were also the same, which meant that the person who had posted on the Tongcheng local forum asking about Sanxiang Village was the same person who posted this story on the Tianya Forum.\n\nZhou Ze read on. It was a story.\n\nThe poster began with:\n\n\"This is something I personally experienced. Although it's very strange, although it's very absurd, I believe it wasn't a dream, nor was I hallucinating. This is my true story.\"\n\nA very clichéd opening for a ghost story.\n\nIt was a popular trope in ghost stories from ten years ago, to first emphasize its truthfulness in a \"the lady doth protest too much\" manner.\n\nZhou Ze continued reading:\n\n\"In March of this year, I was driving home from the Guanyinshan Town Power Supply Office. Yes, I work at the power supply office, but my home is next to Xingdong Airport.\n\nOn my way home, I passed through Xingren Town and came down from the elevated highway there because I had to pick up the clothes I had dropped off for dry cleaning that morning on my way to work.\n\nThat dry cleaner is on the main street of Xingren Town, right across from Xingren Elementary School.\n\nIt was nine o'clock at night when I drove over. There were far fewer people on the street, but when I stopped the car in front of the dry cleaner's, opened the door, and got out, my foot twisted, and I fell right over.\n\nAt first, I just thought I was having a really unlucky day, but that was actually just the beginning. Because after I fell to the ground, I suddenly found that the street and the tall buildings around me were gone. Under me wasn't a road but a muddy field ridge, and across from me wasn't a dry cleaner's, but rows of mud-brick houses.\n\nI was stunned. I looked back at my car and saw that it had turned into a haystack.\n\nI was truly terrified at that moment. I didn't know what on earth had happened. I sat on the ground for a quarter of an hour, convinced it was all a dream, hoping I would wake up soon.\n\nBut I didn't wake up. Then I saw an old man in front of me leading a little girl, walking towards me. The old man was carrying a hoe on his shoulder, and the little girl was playing with a sugar figurine in her hand.\n\nThey got closer and closer to me. They were talking, and they were speaking the Tongcheng dialect.\n\nI immediately asked them, where is this place?\n\nThey looked at me with curiosity, and the old man answered that this was 'Sanxiang Village.'\n\nWhere is Sanxiang Village?\n\nI had never heard of it.\n\nThen I immediately stood up and asked them how I could get out of here.\n\nThe old man probably thought I was a lunatic, that there was something wrong with my head, and he hurriedly pulled his granddaughter away.\n\nI had no choice but to walk into the village alone. At that time, I even thought I might have been drugged and trafficked to some remote mountain forest, but then I found that absurd. I'm a grown man, what would they traffic me for?\n\nI can't even have babies.\n\nEvery household's door was closed, with a few houses having lights on and shadows of people inside. I didn't dare to knock on any doors, just walked cautiously past each house.\n\nI heard people in many houses chatting and talking. They were all crying out that they were hungry.\n\nWives cried to their husbands that they were hungry.\n\nChildren cried to their parents that they were hungry.\n\nElderly parents cried to their sons and daughters-in-law that they were hungry.\n\nThe people in this village were all very hungry.\n\nAt night, in their houses, they just kept talking about 'so hungry, so hungry.'\n\nThe more I walked, the more panicked my heart became.\n\nI had a feeling that since they were so hungry, would they all rush out later and just boil and eat me?\n\nI started running.\n\nRunning as fast as I could.\n\nI instinctively sensed danger.\n\nI had to run out of here before they came out to catch me. No matter where I ran, in short, I had to get as far away from this damn village as possible.\n\nI don't know how long I ran.\n\nIn the end,\n\nI just forgot...\n\nThen when I woke up the next day,\n\nI found myself sitting in the driver's seat of my car, having slept through the night.\n\nBut it absolutely was not a dream. A dream couldn't possibly be that real!\n\nAnd my pants cuffs were covered in mud.\n\nAnd in my collar and hair, there were still a few bits of straw.\n\nSanxiang Village,\n\nthat place definitely exists,\n\nit definitely exists!\"\n\nThe poster also attached photos from that time, showing the mud on his clothes and the straw bits.\n\nBut the replies below clearly didn't believe him, saying:\n\n\"This ghost story is too ridiculously made up.\"\n\n\"The production cost is also very low. Just get some clothes dirty, take a picture, and play 'tell a story from a picture'?\"\n\n\"Starts with one picture, the rest is pure fiction. OP, you're not even trying.\"\n\n\"OP, you had your phone on you at the time, right? How come you didn't record a video or take photos?\"\n\nZhou Ze continued to scroll down.\n\nFortunately, there weren't many replies, because this ghost story was neither novel nor particularly thrilling.\n\nBut further down, Zhou Ze saw a reply from the original poster:\n\n\"Just you wait. I will definitely find a way to go there again. This time, I'll come back with proof to show that I'm not making up a story.\"\n\nThe next reply was from 2010, a year later.\n\n\"It's been a year, where the hell is your story, OP? Still not done making it up? I've kept it in my favorites all this time.\"\n\nThen there was a reply from 2011:\n\n\"Two years have passed, did the OP ever go back or not?\"\n\nThe last reply was from 2012:\n\n\"Everyone disperse, the OP is toast.\"\n\nAs Zhou Ze read, he froze.\n\nA passage suddenly surfaced in his mind:\n\n\"Liu Ziji of Nanyang, a man of noble character, heard of this place and joyfully planned to go. He never succeeded, for he soon fell ill and died. Afterward, there were no others who sought that path.\"²\n\n***\n\n¹A Chinese idiom meaning \"to endure hardship to achieve a long-term goal,\" followed by what is likely a birthdate (February 1, 1980).\n\n²A quote from *The Peach Blossom Spring*, a famous work of prose by the poet Tao Yuanming (365–427), describing a fisherman's accidental discovery of a hidden, utopian village. Liu Ziji was a real historical figure who tried to find the village after hearing the story but died before he could.",

    "content": "Bai Yingying returned, holding the freshly washed bedsheets. The laundry was hung up to dry on the second floor. Of course, Bai Yingying was indeed fast at doing laundry, but she was by no means careless.\n\nShe knew that when it came to household hygiene, her boss had an almost severe obsessive-compulsive disorder.\n\nIn short,\n\nHe was incredibly hard to please.\n\nSometimes, Bai Yingying would grumble to herself:\n\nHer boss's being abandoned as an orphan in his past life wasn't without reason. It was probably because he wouldn't drink from a pacifier if it wasn't sterilized, wouldn't sleep on bedding if it wasn't perfectly clean, and wouldn't let his parents touch him if they hadn't washed their hands. Then, his parents, unable to stand it anymore, just threw him away.\n\nOf course, Bai Yingying only dared to mutter such complaints in her head; she would never, ever say them out loud.\n\nInstead, she had to assume an expression of enlightenment each time, then join her boss hand-in-hand on a joyful journey to the paradise of mysophobia, acting as if she had grasped its spirit and was enjoying every moment of it.\n\nToeing the line,¹\n\nThat's just how it was.\n\n*Heaven did not birth me, Bai Yingying,*\n*So the eternal path of the coward was like an endless night.*\n\nZhou Ze stood by the window, smoking. He had read the post, and it had actually provided a lot of information.\n\nXingren Town,\n\nThe dry-cleaning shop,\n\nThe location should be right there.\n\nIn fact, Zhou Ze could even discern information that wasn't in the post. Because he was an emissary of the underworld, and no longer the greenhorn he once was, he was slowly learning the ropes and becoming familiar with the business.\n\nGhosts come from people, and people will inevitably become ghosts, but the paths of humans and ghosts are separate. There is a line that divides them.\n\nThe world of the living and the world of the dead,\n\nThey coexist and are opposed to each other.\n\nWhat kind of person is most likely to see ghosts?\n\nThere are those who have had special encounters; that's one category.\n\nAnother major category is people who are about to die. When your mortal lifespan is about to run out, it's like when your phone balance is low, and 10086² keeps sending you text reminders.\n\nTime's up.\n\nYou've got to go.\n\nAt that point, although you are still a living person, you are about to become a dead one, and the aura of death around you has already begun to intensify.\n\nThis intensification doesn't simply mean you are sick or terminally ill; it could also mean you are about to meet with a disaster—perhaps a car accident, or you might choke to death while eating or drinking.\n\nIn short,\n\nYou're about to croak.\n\nAnd then you're very likely to see ghosts, as the auras between you and them begin to merge instead of repel.\n\nCombined with the fact that the original poster had been inactive since 2009, one could roughly guess that he was indeed a goner.\n\nBut his description of Sanxiang Village and the experiences he recorded, coupled with the words of the little girl downstairs, had already sketched out the entire affair.\n\nA village that was massacred the year the Japanese army invaded Tongcheng.\n\nEighty years later,\n\nThe people of that village—no, the ghosts of the entire village—were still trapped in a single area, unable to be reincarnated, unable to move on.\n\nThey hadn't become vengeful spirits either. If they had, especially after fermenting for eighty years, the original poster would have been game over the first time he went in; he wouldn't have made it out.\n\nMoreover, the little girl was still innocent and carefree, as if she had just died.\n\nWhat on earth was the reason for the emergence of such a harmonious village?\n\nAfter hanging up the bedsheets, Bai Yingying stealthily sat down at the computer. The net-addicted girl, while keeping an eye on Zhou Ze, wanted to sneak in a bit of gaming. As her eyes fixed on the screen, she naturally read through the short story and commented,\n\n\"Boss, isn't this just *Peach Blossom Spring*?\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\nYes,\n\nThis was a new version of *Peach Blossom Spring*.\n\nFor the longest time, people had taken for granted that Tao Yuanming's *Peach Blossom Spring* was a story about a utopia. In reality, however, this seemingly beautiful tale was filled with eerie and sinister undertones.\n\nIf you look at it from a different perspective, *Peach Blossom Spring* is a complete ghost story—a tale of a fisherman who stumbles into a village of ghosts, just like the original poster in the thread.\n\nHis ten fingers drummed lightly on the windowsill. This was a place he had to go.\n\nNot to mention the temptation of getting a promotion to a permanent position if he could send all the souls of that village to the underworld, the fact that they were his fellow countrymen was enough to make Zhou Ze want to try and help.\n\nEighty years ago, when the nation was in peril, they became pitiful souls under the blades of invaders. They had already suffered for eighty years; it was time for them to find release.\n\nZhou Ze took out his phone and dialed Xu Qinglang's number.\n\nThe call, however, couldn't connect, showing that he was out of the service area. This surprised Zhou Ze. Shouldn't Xu Qinglang be at the local library right now? Was the phone signal there that bad?\n\nAfter a while, Zhou Ze tried calling again, but the other end was still unreachable. Not wanting to wait, Zhou Ze told Bai Yingying to watch the store, while he and the Old Daoist took a taxi to Xingren Town.\n\nThe reason for bringing the Old Daoist was simple. First, the Old Daoist's ability to control souls was weak—aside from grabbing his own crotch, he had basically no restraining power over souls—and the little girl's soul needed to be watched by Bai Yingying.\n\nSecond, the little monkey got along well with the Old Daoist, and this time, he would need the beast's help to find the entry point to Sanxiang Village that the original poster had used.\n\nAt this thought,\n\nZhou Ze's gaze fell upon the little monkey. The little monkey, who had been lying on the Old Daoist's lap, suddenly lifted its head and bared its teeth at Zhou Ze.\n\nOh?\n\nCan you read my mind?\n\nOr,\n\nDid you just sense that I was cursing you?\n\nZhou Ze reached out, grabbed the little monkey's tail, and, avoiding the driver's line of sight, stared at it for a moment.\n\nIt seems to have grown a little,\n\nand gotten a bit heavier.\n\nHeh,\n\nIts nerve has gotten bigger, too.\n\nThe little monkey squirmed in discontent. It had never been particularly fond of Zhou Ze, which was why it mostly played with the Old Daoist in the bookstore. It harbored an innate fear and wariness of Zhou Ze.\n\nAfter all, the little monkey, in its previous life, had been stabbed to death by Zhou Ze's own fingernails.\n\nHe and the monkey, one person and one animal, were like two intertwined threads, their karmic relationship a tangled mess.\n\nWhen they arrived and got out of the car, Zhou Ze stretched his back lazily.\n\nXingren Town was a small town, close to the city, right next to the airport. The spot where Zhou Ze stood was just east of the main intersection, at another small crossroads.\n\nTo the north was Xingren Elementary School, to the south were apartment buildings, and the street between them was lined with small shops.\n\nThat dry-cleaning shop was still in business there.\n\nCalculating the position, Zhou Ze began to simulate in his mind the scene of the original poster parking his car here and tripping.\n\n\"Boss, it should be in the direction of the school, right?\" the Old Daoist spoke up at this moment.\n\n\"Oh?\" Zhou Ze was a little puzzled. He knew what the Old Daoist was capable of.\n\n\"Heh heh, I don't see anything special, but I have experience. Usually, places like schools or hospitals are built on top of old mass graves.\n\n\"Because the land is cheap. Especially for a place like a school, it doesn't need to be in a busy commercial district. Even if it's a bit remote, it doesn't matter.\n\n\"Besides, isn't school district housing all the rage now? Even many years ago, wherever a school was built, the popularity of the area would immediately rise. So, in urban planning, schools are often used as an important strategic point, placed in a more remote area to drive its development.\"\n\nThe Old Daoist spoke with conviction, and there was indeed some truth to what he said.\n\nZhou Ze looked at the little monkey and said, \"Can you see anything?\"\n\nThe little monkey scratched its head, jumped down from the Old Daoist, and began to search around.\n\nThen, it shook its head in confusion.\n\nZhou Ze's eyes narrowed slightly. He didn't think the little monkey was slacking off.\n\nPerhaps it was because the sky hadn't completely darkened yet. Some places were suppressed during the day, and their clues might only reveal themselves at night.\n\nJust like that, Zhou Ze and the Old Daoist went into a nearby fast-food restaurant, ordered some drinks and snacks, and sat there waiting.\n\nThe elementary school began to let out, and a lot of cars gathered in the area. After the school dismissal ended, the sky slowly darkened, and the hustle and bustle of the neighborhood gradually faded.\n\nThe time was about right. For something like this, there was no need to wait until the dead of night.\n\nLeading the little monkey out again, this time it seemed to instantly catch onto something. It began spinning in circles on the spot, and the Old Daoist followed behind it, also spinning in circles.\n\nZhou Ze stood to the side, watching.\n\nFinally, the little monkey let out a series of \"Squeak, squeak, squeak\" sounds, then dashed directly into the road.\n\nAt that exact moment, a small car happened to be driving by. Its speed wasn't actually fast, but the little monkey was essentially throwing itself under its wheels!\n\n\"Screech!\"\n\nThe car slammed on its brakes. The driver cursed, \"Where'd that damn dog come from!\"\n\nThe driver got out to check. He had just seen a ball of yellow fur rush in front of his car, but after getting out, he saw no trace of blood. He cursed a few more times, got back in his car, and drove away.\n\nThe Old Daoist was a bit slow on the uptake. When the little monkey dashed out, he didn't even have time to shout.\n\nBut now, he understood.\n\nThe monkey hadn't been hit by the car.\n\nTo be precise,\n\nThe monkey went in.\n\n\"Boss, what do we do?\"\n\nthe Old Daoist asked.\n\nZhou Ze stood in the same spot, followed the path where the monkey had been spinning, took a few turns, and then sprinted in that direction. In an instant, Zhou Ze felt his fingernails tremble slightly, as if they had caught something, and he seized the opportunity to grab at it.\n\n\"Buzz!\"\n\nImmediately, the surrounding environment began to distort.\n\nThe tall buildings,\n\nthe roads,\n\nthe cars,\n\nall vanished.\n\nThis was a muddy field ridge. Not far away stood rows of houses built from earth and straw.\n\nThe golden monkey squatted in front of Zhou Ze, looking at him.\n\nZhou Ze looked around.\n\nHe knew,\n\nHe was in, too.\n\nAs for the Old Daoist,\n\nHe probably couldn't get in, unless perhaps he was on his last breath, then he might stumble in by chance.\n\nIn the distance, a pair approached—a grandfather leading a little girl by the hand.\n\nThe little girl looked a bit like the one in his bookstore.

    "content": "The way things were developing seemed to be slowly veering in an uncontrollable direction. At the very least, Zhou Ze hadn't been mentally prepared for this at the start.\n\nThe state the little girl had shown when she walked into his bookstore left Zhou Ze completely blindsided. The people in this village…\n\nOh, no.\n\nThe ghosts in this village, had actually become like this.\n\nHe had clearly come to deliver them, to save them.\n\nBut now, they were clearly treating him as food.\n\nThe old grandpa was hale and hearty, his steps as swift as the wind. When he swung his hoe, it even had a hint of Cheng Yaojin's Three Axe Strikes.¹\n\nAnd the little girl, her pigtails flying back, her face ferocious, her speed swift, let out a series of piercing shrieks.\n\nThis was the sign of a fierce ghost; an ordinary departed soul couldn't achieve such a state.\n\nRight now,\n\nThe old one pounced on Zhou Ze,\n\nwhile the young one pounced on the monkey.\n\nThe monkey first waved its plastic toy hammer, but seeing the menacing fierce ghost, it immediately scrambled behind Zhou Ze.\n\nTo be a coward,\n\nwas a belief,\n\nand had practically become the prevailing trend in the bookstore.\n\nEven the animals had been infected.\n\nOne must remember that the monkey had previously treated Zhou Ze with an air of dismissive disdain, but at this moment, it quickly decided to let bygones be bygones.\n\nAlthough things had taken a turn and it seemed he had the wrong script, Zhou Ze wasn't so terrified by two fierce ghosts that he was at a loss.\n\nImmediately, he took a step forward. His fingernails grew out, and wisps of black mist appeared around him.\n\nBy now, after having twice entered that state of a gravely injured zombie, Zhou Ze's use of his fingernails and their associated power was becoming more and more proficient.\n\nIt looked a lot better than back when he fought like a shrew, just scratching and clawing.\n\n\"Smack!\"\n\n\"Smack!\"\n\nWhen the black mist struck the old grandpa and the little girl, their movements seemed to slow down as if someone had hit a slow-motion button, while Zhou Ze drifted effortlessly between them.\n\nHis robes fluttered,\n\nhe strolled at a leisurely pace,\n\nhis two hands,\n\nslowly descended toward the tops of their heads,\n\nlike an immortal gracing a crown,\n\neverything under his control.\n\nAt this moment, the only regret was probably that the Old Daoist hadn't come in. Otherwise, the thoughtful Old Daoist would have definitely helped him film this segment for future appreciation.\n\nAnd then he would silently smoke a cigarette, feigning nonchalance.\n\nThe subtext being: *Standard procedure, sit down.*\n\nHowever, just as Zhou Ze's fingernails were about to pierce the grandpa's and granddaughter's heads and declare an end to it all, their bodies suddenly twisted and then dissipated completely.\n\nTheir speed,\n\nwas faster than even the little loli's \"biu\"!\n\nZhou Ze's hands were still hovering in mid-air.\n\nHe had already struck his pose,\n\nbut his co-stars had suddenly slacked off.\n\nIt was slightly awkward.\n\nLowering his hands and turning around, Zhou Ze was stunned to see the figures of the grandfather and granddaughter reappear on the small path in the distance.\n\nThe grandpa carried his hoe and held his granddaughter's hand.\n\nThe old and the young looked as if they had just returned from the fields,\n\nfilled with a sense of happiness and contentment,\n\njust like the line from *The Peach Blossom Spring*²: \"With their gray hair and children's tufts, all living in joyful contentment.\"\n\nThe little monkey was also dumbfounded. Clearly, its little monkey brain, no matter how much it was nourished, couldn't comprehend what was happening.\n\nThe old man and the little girl approached again. The old grandpa looked at Zhou Ze and asked with some curiosity:\n\n\"Young man, where are you from?\"\n\n\"I don't know either,\" Zhou Ze shrugged.\n\nDamn it.\n\nThis time, he really didn't know.\n\n\"Are you lost?\" the old grandpa asked kindly.\n\n\"I suppose so,\" Zhou Ze sighed.\n\n\"This is Sanxiang Village. It's not far from the city. If you follow this road south, you'll reach the city,\" the old grandpa kindly gave directions.\n\nThe little girl played with the sugar figurine in her hand. She was a bit thin, but still innocent and lovely.\n\nThe image of this grandfather and granddaughter was the polar opposite of the man-eating one from just a moment ago.\n\n\"Okay, got it,\" Zhou Ze nodded.\n\nThe pair walked into the village, talking and laughing.\n\nZhou Ze looked up at the sky. He hadn't noticed it before, but he did now. The edge of the moon in the sky seemed to be tinged with a faint, bloody light.\n\nNine years ago, when the original forum poster first came here, the first scene he experienced must have been the same as the second one Zhou Ze experienced. Otherwise, he wouldn't have been able to get out after his first visit, and he couldn't have made that post.\n\nBut he had said in the post that when he walked through the village at night, every household was talking about how hungry they were and how much they wanted to eat. This meant that nine years ago, this village's \"hunger\" had already started to become a problem.\n\nAnd now, when he arrived nine years later, the problem had further fermented and worsened.\n\nFrom now on, if any more \"fishermen\"² stumbled in here by accident, they would likely not see a simple and honest Peach Blossom Spring, but would instead be reduced to food for the many departed souls of this village.\n\nThis place,\n\nhad gradually degenerated into a land of great malevolence.\n\nZhou Ze strode toward the village. He needed to walk around and take a look; at the very least, he had to investigate what else had happened in this village against the backdrop of being massacred by the Japanese devils.\n\nBack then, when the nation was in peril, the number of souls who died unjustly was immeasurable. Why was it that this village, and this village alone, was preserved in such a bizarre manner?\n\nWhen things are this abnormal, there must be a demon at play.\n\nThe houses in the village were made of mud and straw. A few better-off families had some tiles on their roofs. This was the common standard of housing in the countryside eighty years ago.\n\nZhou Ze remembered seeing similar houses in the Tongcheng countryside when he was a child, but those were ancestral homes that were no longer inhabited.\n\nEvery household had its own wicker fence courtyard, all of them neat—so neat it was excessive. Normally, a yard could be used to grow some scallions, ginger, garlic, or other small vegetables, but the yards here were all barren and flat, without a single blade of grass.\n\nAn old woman sat on a small stool by a doorway, making cloth shoes with a needle and thread. She was very focused, very engrossed, but from a distance, Zhou Ze could see that the old woman was drooling as she worked.\n\nOn the ground,\n\na large puddle had already formed.\n\nThe scene was incredibly bizarre.\n\nThe old woman was completely unaware, continuing her work as she pleased, immersed in her own world, even though her saliva had already soaked the shoes in her hands.\n\nFortunately, she didn't look up when Zhou Ze and the little monkey walked past. But Zhou Ze didn't dare to treat her as a complete nobody. With the precedent set by the old grandpa and the little girl, Zhou Ze knew that the people in this village could be overwhelmed by hunger at any moment and turn directly into fierce ghosts.\n\nUp ahead was a well. A woman in her thirties or forties was drawing water. The woman had a good figure. Though a bit rustic, in that era, she would have been considered a standard beauty in the countryside.\n\nA tall stature, a heavy chest, and a full, rounded behind, exuding a most primal and impulsive aura.\n\nBut when the woman turned around carrying the bucket, Zhou Ze saw that her mouth was stuffed full of a black mass, which she was chewing with great effort.\n\nIt was her hair.\n\nShe was tearing out and eating her own hair while drawing water. She was hungry, terribly hungry.\n\nThe old woman making shoes looked up at the woman drawing water and shouted:\n\n\"Damn widow, your husband is dead and you're still dressing so gaudily. That mouth of yours down there must be thirsty, huh?\"\n\nThe woman, called a widow, was not to be outdone and yelled back, \"Old hag Cui, I'm not like you. That mouth of yours down there probably can't even spit anymore.\"\n\n\"Pah! You indecent hussy, all you think about is men!\"\n\n\"I do think about them. I think about them every day. I wish all the men in the village would come to my bed tonight, so I can eat them one by one.\n\nFried,\n\nsteamed,\n\ncold-tossed,\n\ntsk, tsk,\n\nthat taste... I can't take it, I can't take it anymore. I really want a man.\"\n\nAs the widow spoke, she chewed her hair even more forcefully.\n\nThe old woman seemed to be moved by her words, and her drool flowed even more freely, a look of yearning on her face.\n\nZhou Ze walked between them. For some reason, the two women seemed to not see him at all. But after Zhou Ze and the little monkey had walked some distance away, the old woman and the widow slowly raised their heads, looking together in the direction Zhou Ze had gone.\n\nA crimson light flickered in both their eyes.\n\nThe few houses up ahead looked a bit grander. They had tiled roofs and stone piers by the doors, which indicated a well-off family.\n\nZhou Ze walked into the courtyard. There was no one in the yard, but the smell of meat wafted from the kitchen. Zhou Ze walked over and pushed open the window shutter.\n\nInside was a rural earthen stove.\n\nA young man was feeding firewood into the stove from behind. The fire was burning fiercely.\n\nBut there was nothing in the pot, just a large cauldron of water boiling relentlessly.\n\n\"Wifey, the water's boiling, hurry up and come here!\"\n\nThe man shouted to the other side, sounding somewhat impatient.\n\nHe was like a newlywed husband, urging his wife to hurry up and take a bath every night.\n\n\"Coming, coming, look at you, you lecher!\n\nNever seen you work so hard at anything else, but you're so damn keen on this.\"\n\nThe man ran out from behind the stove and hugged the woman, shouting:\n\n\"Quick, quick, quick, I can't hold it in anymore, I can't hold it in.\"\n\n\"You just wait.\"\n\nThe woman took off her clothes,\n\nseemingly oblivious to the person standing and watching from the window.\n\nAfter she undressed, her smooth, white back was revealed. But the woman's right arm was already crimson, like the pig's head meat sold at cooked food stalls.\n\nThe woman climbed directly onto the stovetop, then sat down in the scalding water. While ladling hot water over herself with a basin, she cursed at her husband:\n\n\"Keep adding firewood, or it won't cook through, and it won't taste good! Look at you, you useless thing, put some more muscle into it! I'm not feeling it yet!\"\n\n\"You got it!\"\n\nThe husband immediately went to add more firewood.\n\nAnd the woman sitting in the pot, while boiling herself,\n\ntook a bite of her own right arm, which had already been cooked and marinated beforehand.\n\nSquinting her eyes,\n\nshe said with a look of pure enjoyment:\n\n\"Mmm, so delicious.\"\n\n***\n\n**Footnotes:**\n\n1.  **Cheng Yaojin's Three Axe Strikes:** Cheng Yaojin was a famous general from the Tang Dynasty, known in folklore for a fighting style that consisted of only three simple, powerful axe strikes.

    "content": "The placid rhythm of life,\n\n  A serene Republican-era village atmosphere,\n\n  The down-to-earth din of curses and shouts,\n\n  Notes bearing the fragrance of the soil.\n\n  This was its silhouette, the silhouette of this Sanxiang Village. But if you were to take a few steps and run around to the front, its face would scare you to death.\n\n  Every detail here was like a fissure, with fresh blood gushing out drop by drop, then drowning and suffocating people.\n\n  A terrifying dark cloud perpetually hung over the village, like a stage play where every character seemed to wear a mask laden with meaning.\n\n  The moon was clearly what hung in the sky;\n\n  But the light on the ground was a ghastly, uneven white, as if an incompetent lighting technician had set the angles wrong, making everything chaotic.\n\n  Some were sleeping,\n\n  Some were cooking,\n\n  Some were drawing water,\n\n  Some were cursing,\n\n  Some were laughing,\n\n  And some were crying.\n\n  Zhou Ze walked for a long time, covering nearly the entire village.\n\n  It was certain now that this place was completely different from when the original poster had last visited.\n\n  If nine years ago, when the OP first arrived, the place was merely playing hard to get, then now, it was truly like a massive tiger that had already opened its mouth, its eyes glaring right at you.\n\n  It could eat you whenever it wanted,\n\n  And that feeling of waiting, of knowing you could be eaten at any moment, was the most agonizing and torturous thing of all.\n\n  If the OP from nine years ago had seen today's scene, he probably wouldn't have had the courage to talk about coming back to find evidence and take pictures.\n\n  After walking a full circle, Zhou Ze arrived outside an ancestral hall.\n\n  This ancestral hall was, relatively speaking, the most impressive building in all of Sanxiang Village.\n\n  It wasn't large,\n\n  But it had a plaque hanging outside and carved beams and painted rafters inside. Though small, almost cramped, it exuded a sense of exquisiteness and solemnity.\n\n  A blind old man in a long gown sat at the entrance of the hall, holding a staff that he tapped incessantly on the ground, his lips trembling slightly.\n\n  Zhou Ze stopped in front of him, because this old man, in Zhou Ze's view, was the most normal person in the entire village.\n\n  At least, the old man wasn't drooling or dripping saliva.\n\n  But upon getting closer,\n\n  Zhou Ze could still hear the old man muttering to himself in a low voice:\n\n  \"Hungry, so hungry, really hungry. I want to eat steamed buns, I want to eat steamed buns.\"\n\n  The little monkey shot forward and grabbed the blind old man's goatee.\n\n  The blind old man looked up. He was blind, with no sunglasses, and where his eyes should have been was a stretch of murky white. But at this moment, he must have sensed someone—a stranger—in front of him.\n\n  He licked his lips, then swallowed.\n\n  He said:\n\n  \"Go, you should go. The others... are about to lose control.\"\n\n  The blind old man's words were filled with weariness and helplessness.\n\n  He was warning Zhou Ze.\n\n  This place,\n\n  Was a place of trouble. The people here were very hungry.\n\n  A horde of hungry ghosts, about to be unleashed!\n\n  If you don't leave now, you won't be able to.\n\n  Zhou Ze still didn't move. To be honest, he wasn't particularly afraid of the vengeful ghosts here. Even if their numbers were a bit much for him to handle, there's a big difference between not being able to win and not being able to escape.\n\n  Zhou Ze was confident that, no matter what, he could still manage to get away.\n\n  \"What exactly happened here?\"\n\n  Zhou Ze asked.\n\n  He wanted an answer. How did the people of this village end up like this?\n\n  Actually,\n\n  The darkness and blood moon above the village already explained a lot. The village was a place of great malevolence, a phenomenon often seen on ancient battlefields.\n\n  \"Don't ask, don't ask, just go. Everyone is very hungry, so hungry. If you don't go, you'll be eaten.\"\n\n  _The blind old man kept repeating the same few sentences over and over.\n\n  \"Hungry? You starved to death?\"\n\n  That's impossible.\n\n  How could an entire village starve to death? If there was no food, wouldn't they have fled as famine refugees?\n\n  Besides, the grandmother from Sanxiang Village who had replied online said that the village was massacred the day the Japanese invaders broke into Tongcheng. What did that have to do with hunger?\n\n  \"Go, get out of here!\"\n\n  The blind old man grew furious,\n\n  Jabbing his staff at the ground repeatedly.\n\n  \"Go! Go!\"\n\n  Zhou Ze still didn't move, which made the blind old man very anxious. Of course, while growing anxious, he also began sniffing the air nonstop. Clearly, he was getting tempted!\n\n  \"If you don't go, if you don't go you'll be eaten.\"\n\n  The blind old man's voice grew lower and lower.\n\n  He himself was about to lose control.\n\n  Zhou Ze still didn't move. He couldn't leave without figuring out what was going on here.\n\n  The affairs of the living were for the police to handle, but the affairs of the dead were his responsibility.\n\n  This village, once describable as a \"modern-day\" Peach Blossom Spring,¹ had now, after nine years, begun to devolve into a nest of vengeful ghosts.\n\n  That little girl was probably lucky; she had come to his bookstore without being tainted or too greatly affected.\n\n  But at the same time, the little girl's appearance at the bookstore also proved that the ghosts in Sanxiang Village, the situation here, was already starting to change.\n\n  Not only could people get in,\n\n  But ghosts,\n\n  Could now get out!\n\n  Once so many vengeful ghosts were unleashed all at once, how much impact and destruction would they cause?\n\n  If Zhou Ze hadn't known, it would be one thing; he could deal with it when it happened. But he was already here.\n\n  The little loli had once said that the Underworld has a set of scales.\n\n  Zhou Ze believed that if he were to wash his hands of this and leave, his actions would be judged by the Underworld as far worse than coercing the little loli into becoming his subordinate.\n\n  In the eyes of the Underworld,\n\n  Ghost Emissaries and Constables were the lowest-ranking public servants. You could have internal conflicts, you could vie for favor, you could bicker, but you had to get the job done. And the work of maintaining stability was of the utmost importance.\n\n  Keeping the situation under control, ensuring ghosts didn't affect the mortal realm, was the most basic red line. Everything else was not a problem.\n\n  Therefore, Zhou Ze couldn't leave, even though he could smell that the oppressive feeling in the air was growing thicker and thicker.\n\n  But the most critical issue now was that if he didn't know the village's secret and the reason for its formation, Zhou Ze had no way of resolving it.\n\n  Just like the old man and the little girl he'd encountered upon first entering, after being \"killed\" by Zhou Ze, they had instantly reverted to their previous state.\n\n  In this place, Zhou Ze couldn't kill them at all, let alone capture them to boost his performance metrics.\n\n  \"Go!\"\n\n  The blind old man shot to his feet, thrusting his staff toward Zhou Ze.\n\n  Zhou Ze reached out and grabbed the staff, his two fingernails digging directly into the wood.\n\n  \"Ahhhhhhhh!!!!!\"\n\n  The blind old man let out a low roar, then opened his mouth and lunged to bite Zhou Ze.\n\n  Zhou Ze took a step back and, with a turn of his body, entered the ancestral hall. The blind old man, thrown off balance, tumbled down the steps of the hall.\n\n  But then, the blind old man landed on the ground, propped up on all fours, his stomach heaving.\n\n  *Thump!*\n\n  The blind old man leaped over again.\n\n  Zhou Ze spread his hands, and a black mist swirled out, trapping the blind old man. But Zhou Ze didn't use his nails to kill him. Instead, he reached out and patted him on the face,\n\n  asking:\n\n  \"Tell me, what the hell happened to this village!\"\n\n  \"Ahhhhhhhh!!!!\"\n\n  However, the blind old man seemed to have completely lost his mind, struggling ceaselessly, trying to break free of Zhou Ze's restraints to bite him.\n\n  There was no other way. Zhou Ze could only kick out, sending the man flying again.\n\n  Just like before, the blind old man bounced back up after landing. Black juice, containing fragments of tree bark and grass roots, continuously trickled from the corners of his mouth.\n\n  Evidently, for a very long time, he had been so hungry that he had resorted to eating such things to survive.\n\n  And just then,\n\n  At some unknown point, villagers had slowly begun to gather outside the ancestral hall, one after another. With numb expressions, they staggered over.\n\n  There was the old man carrying a hoe,\n\n  The little girl holding a sugar figurine,\n\n  The widow eating her own hair,\n\n  The old woman holding a cloth shoe,\n\n  The young couple eating their own flesh,\n\n  There were many, many people.\n\n  One by one, they gathered at the entrance of the ancestral hall.\n\n  Their gazes were fixed dead on Zhou Ze. They were hungry. They were very, very hungry.\n\n  The little monkey shivered in fear and leaped onto the hall's altar table, trembling.\n\n  So many vengeful ghosts,\n\n  It was terrifying.\n\n  The malevolent aura they emitted was enough to suffocate a person. With them just standing there, it seemed like a dark cloud was being drawn together in the sky.\n\n  Zhou Ze gritted his teeth and asked:\n\n  \"I know you're all very hungry, but I'm really hoping someone with a clear enough mind to speak can step forward and tell me what's wrong with all of you.\n\n  \"I'm here to help you, to free you from your suffering. Even if you've become like this, it doesn't mean there's absolutely no chance for you to be reincarnated!\"\n\n  Zhou Ze spoke with great sincerity and earnestness.\n\n  And,\n\n  A place that hadn't hurt for a long time began to ache.\n\n  Zhou Ze subconsciously clutched his chest.\n\n  He had almost forgotten it existed.\n\n  It hadn't hurt in a long time.\n\n  Before Tang Shi left, she had told him it was because he had gotten used to living heartlessly. So now, was he growing a conscience again?\n\n  Yes,\n\n  He was growing a conscience.\n\n  Because Zhou Ze couldn't bear to completely extinguish the last hope of this entire village. Eighty years ago, their fate had been tragic enough, just like the three hundred thousand souls of Nanjing.\n\n  So, as long as there was a sliver of a chance, Zhou Ze still hoped they could have another opportunity to enter the cycle of reincarnation.\n\n  It was for this reason that Zhou Ze, clinging to a sliver of hope, tried to find another lucid person in this village to get some clues.\n\n  Now, he was surrounded by the entire village, having lost the advantage of being able to advance or retreat at will.\n\n  He could still fight his way out, but he'd probably have to enter that state again amidst the tearing and biting of vengeful ghosts,\n\n  And then be paralyzed and gravely injured for a long time afterward.\n\n  It wasn't worth it.\n\n  It was also foolish.\n\n  A stupid act and choice.\n\n  And so his conscience hurt again.\n\n  \"Roar!\"\n\n  \"Hungry!\"\n\n  \"Eat him!\"\n\n  \"Eat!\"\n\n  No one responded seriously to Zhou Ze's words.\n\n  They swarmed forward all at once, rushing him.\n\n  The nails on Zhou Ze's ten fingers danced, sending one vengeful ghost after another flying. But they were like an endless horde; even if dispersed, they would soon reappear in some corner of the village and rejoin the fray.\n\n  Zhou Ze was essentially facing an undead army that could continuously resurrect!\n\n  *Bang!*\n\n  *Bang!*\n\n  The ancestral hall continuously withstood the impacts.\n\n  The floor tiles began to crack.\n\n  Finally, after Zhou Ze slammed a vengeful ghost heavily onto the ground,\n\n  A section of floor tiles beneath his feet completely shattered.\n\n  But under the tiles,\n\n  A large patch of glistening white rice appeared.\n\n  Zhou Ze froze.\n\n  All the vengeful ghosts present also froze.\n\n  The rice was definitely an illusion.\n\n  The village had been leveled long ago, and a school had even been built on top of it.\n\n  But the scene here was real.\n\n  This meant that,\n\n  Back when everyone in the village was starving,\n\n  Beneath this village's ancestral hall,\n\n  There had indeed been this much grain hidden away!\n\n  Zhou Ze crouched down, grabbed a handful of rice, and held it out toward the vengeful ghosts before him.\n\n  He said:\n\n  \"Eat. After you've eaten, you won't be hungry anymore. And then... you can be on your way.\"²\n\n  However,\n\n  The vengeful ghosts of the entire village inside the hall didn't move. They seemed to have no reaction to the rice.\n\n  Their gazes merely lingered on the rice for a moment,\n\n  Then, in unison, they fell back upon Zhou Ze.\n\n  They wouldn't eat the rice,\n\n  But they were still hungry,\n\n  Therefore,\n\n  They could only eat Zhou Ze!\n\n  Zhou Ze truly felt so angry he wanted to laugh.\n\n  What the hell?\n\n  Am I that delicious?\n\n***\n\n**Footnotes:**\n\n1.  **Peach Blossom Spring:** An allusion to a famous Chinese fable about a hidden, idyllic utopia, isolated from the outside world.\n2.  **\"Be on your way\" (好上路):** A common phrase used when sending off the dead, wishing them a safe journey to the afterlife.",

    "content": "It was a chaotic scene, one that left even Zhou Ze at a loss. The villagers completely ignored the grain, swarming toward Zhou Ze once more.\n\nTime and again, Zhou Ze’s claws tore through the villagers before him, yet they would quickly reform and gather again. It was a slaughter with no end in sight, a classic case of ants biting an elephant to death.\n\nSomething had to be sustaining this place, making it function like a looping barrier, repeating itself endlessly. These vengeful spirits didn't seem as strong as true vengeful spirits, but their most perverse trait was their ability to re-form after being destroyed.\n\nThe little monkey clung to Zhou Ze’s shoulder, watching as he carved a path. It wanted to help but was utterly useless. In its former days, it could have cooperated with Zhou Ze—a demon and a ghost envoy—and they could have easily fought their way out. But now, all it could do was tremble in fear and pray that Zhou Ze didn't exhaust himself too quickly.\n\nIt knew that if Zhou Ze went down, it would surely go down with him.\n\nIt had been eaten by people in its last life. Was it going to be eaten by ghosts in this one?\n\nThat was a grand slam it definitely didn't want.\n\nThe villagers seemed determined to block Zhou Ze’s path out of the ancestral hall. They charged forward fearlessly, one after another, just to hold him back for a few seconds. And they were succeeding. Zhou Ze wasn't far from the ancestral hall's entrance; if he could just break through, finding a way to escape would be much simpler. But now, he was trapped in this narrow space, and it was agonizing.\n\n\"Screeeech!\"\n\nA villager grabbed the little monkey's tail. It let out a terrified shriek, feeling like it was about to be eaten.\n\nZhou Ze spun around instantly, his claws carrying a cloud of black mist that shredded the villager and snatched the little monkey back. But in doing so, he was once again a little farther from the doorway.\n\nThe villagers pressed their advantage, constantly pushing inward, rendering Zhou Ze’s repeated breakout attempts futile. Before he knew it, Zhou Ze had been forced back to the offering table at the deepest part of the hall, where the spirit tablets were displayed.\n\n\"Huff... huff... huff...\"\n\nGasping for breath, Zhou Ze was genuinely getting tired, but the villagers gave him no chance to relax.\n\n*Crash!*\n\nWith a sharp crack, Zhou Ze swept all the spirit tablets off the offering table. He hoped the villagers would rush to protect their ancestral tablets, giving him an opening.\n\nUnfortunately, the villagers showed no reaction to the tablets whatsoever. They remained indifferent as their ancestors' tablets clattered to the floor, and simply continued their charge toward Zhou Ze.\n\nFor the first time, Zhou Ze felt a little wronged.\n\nFirst of all, he had genuinely come to help. His conscience had been killing him!\n\nYou say you're hungry? I can see that. But the rice and grain are right in front of you, and you won't eat it. You'd rather eat me?\n\nThat's just unreasonable!\n\nAnd if you won't be reasonable, then don't blame me for not being reasonable either!\n\nA fire of rage ignited in Zhou Ze's heart. A person's kindness and compassion have their limits. Zhou Ze charged forward. This time, he didn't try to run for the exit but instead focused on killing every soul he could get his hands on. At the same time, as the frustration and anger built within him, his skin slowly began to take on a bronze hue.\n\nClearly, the assault of fatigue and fury was beginning to awaken Zhou Ze's other side.\n\n\"Boom!\"\n\nZhou Ze grabbed two souls and slammed them violently onto the ground.\n\n\"Boom!\"\n\nThe souls exploded, scattering to who-knows-where to reform and return, while another crater was smashed into the ground. White rice flew into the air, scattering everywhere.\n\nSuddenly, Zhou Ze stood up, a bit bewildered. The villagers, who moments ago had been screaming about hunger and rushing him like madmen, had all crouched down and begun picking up the rice grains from the floor, not even sparing the ones in the cracks.\n\nAnd then,\nThe former star of the stage, the center of the spotlight—Ze,\nwas suddenly and completely ignored.\n\nThe contrast was staggering.\n\nIt left Zhou Ze at a bit of a loss. All he could think was that there was something wrong with these villagers. To be this hungry, yet guard so much grain in the ancestral hall without touching it.\n\nWere they all misers, every one of them?\n\nFortunately, Zhou Ze knew this wasn't the time to get hung up on it. He immediately grabbed the little monkey and rushed out of the ancestral hall. This time, no one blocked him. After running back to the path between the fields, the bronze sheen that had just appeared on his skin began to slowly fade.\n\nZhou Ze let out a long sigh of relief. It was best not to enter that state if he could avoid it. The problem was that afterward, not only was his soul in agony, but the physical paralysis and the prolonged inconvenience it caused made Zhou Ze deeply resistant to it.\n\nHe grabbed the still-shaken monkey that was clinging to his shoulder and tossed it onto the ground.\n\n\"Find the way out.\"\n\nZhou Ze had no desire to linger until the villagers finished picking up the rice and came back to besiege him again.\n\nThe little monkey didn't disappoint. After running a short distance and circling a few times, it dove straight into a pile of thatch and disappeared.\n\nIt made Zhou Ze wonder if he was raising a monkey or a dog, because as the monkey had circled, it had kept its nose to the ground, sniffing continuously.\n\nZhou Ze also circled a few times, though he didn't go so far as to press his nose to the ground, before rushing into the thatch pile.\n\nHe felt his whole body lighten, and then found himself on a street. At this point, most of the shops on the street were closed; it was clearly very late.\n\nThe old Taoist was squatting to one side, petting the monkey that had come out first. Seeing Zhou Ze emerge, he immediately stood up and asked, \"Boss, are you all right?\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head.\n\nA Nissan was parked across the street. Xu Qinglang was sitting inside. When Zhou Ze appeared, he also got out of the car and asked, \"Is it resolved?\"\n\n\"Where were you? I called you but couldn't get through.\"\n\n\"The signal is probably bad in the library basement. Let's get in the car first. I found some other clues.\"\n\nOnce in the car, Zhou Ze briefly recounted what had happened inside.\n\nXu Qinglang nodded. \"I went to the city library first to check some records. I found a local log from the Republican era—well, not really the Republic, since this area was under Japanese occupation at the time.\n\n\"It was a record book kept by the local puppet government that was preserved. It recorded the massacre of Sanxiang Village. According to the log, it was because the local villagers were discovered hiding wounded members of the anti-Japanese resistance, which led to a retaliatory sweep by the devils.\"¹\n\n\"Get to the point,\" Zhou Ze reminded him.\n\n\"Then, I checked the book's borrowing record. It's a very obscure book that ordinary people would never notice, but in 2009, someone borrowed it. His name was Li Shi. I suspect this person is the same one who made the forum post.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\nDuring that period, there wouldn't have been many people paying attention to the matter of Sanxiang Village.\n\n\"I investigated this Li Shi and found out he died of a sudden heart attack at the end of 2009. But the trail didn't go cold, because when he had the heart attack, he was driving, and the car crashed into a tree.\n\n\"The place of death was on a road in a suburban forest. It was desolate there—desolate in 2009, and still desolate now. However, there is a nursing home there, similar to a home for the aged, but a bit more high-end, a public-private partnership.\"\n\n\"So, you think Li Shi was driving there before he died because he wanted to go to the nursing home?\"\n\n\"Correct. That's why I think there must be a clue hidden at the nursing home. And he discovered it. I even think this man may have entered Sanxiang Village a second time. Based on what you said, the villagers inside are starving to the point of cannibalism, but back in 2009, the problem probably wasn't that severe.\n\n\"Then, he obtained some information in the village. It's just that, the only people who can enter Sanxiang Village—aside from a special case like you—are people on the verge of death.\"\n\nAt this, Xu Qinglang subconsciously glanced at the old Taoist sitting in the back seat.\n\nThe old Taoist had been feeling quite dejected at first.\n\nThe monkey got in.\n\nThe boss got in.\n\nBut he couldn't get in no matter how hard he tried. He felt like a failure.\n\nThen, when Xu Qinglang arrived and told him that only people on the verge of death had a chance to get in, the old Taoist burst out laughing with delight, a pair of snot bubbles forming at his nostrils.\n\n\"Li Shi never had the chance to solve that problem. He died on the way,\" Zhou Ze said, watching Xu Qinglang drive as he talked. \"So, we're heading to the nursing home now?\"\n\nXu Qinglang nodded.\n\nHalf an hour later, the car pulled into the nursing home. Because it was the middle of the night, the facility had closed its gates, but Zhou Ze, Xu Qinglang, and the others simply scaled the wall and jumped over. They went into the administrative office and started looking through the nursing home's client files.\n\nExtraordinary times called for extraordinary measures. If the problem at Sanxiang Village wasn't resolved, and those vengeful spirits were truly unleashed, the consequences would be terrifying.\n\nZhou Ze, the old Taoist, and Xu Qinglang searched together. A search like this was basically looking for a needle in a haystack.\n\nBecause none of them knew…\n\nif the person the original forum poster was looking for nine years ago…\n\nwas even still alive.\n\nAfter all, many people who entered nursing homes were elderly or in very poor health. After nine years, there was no guarantee they would have held on.\n\nMoreover, they had no specific information to go on. They could only go by gut feeling.\n\nThis was no longer looking for a needle in a haystack; it was more like trying to catch a fish in the ocean with their bare hands.\n\nHowever, one patient's file made Zhou Ze's gaze freeze slightly. He gestured for Xu Qinglang and the old Taoist to come over, then pointed at the person in the photo.\n\n\"Chen Guangnong, born in 1919.\"\n\n\"Holy crap, Boss, this guy's 99, isn't he?\" the old Taoist exclaimed, then added with confusion, \"This... can't be that we're looking for the oldest person, right? I've got a few centenarians over here.\"\n\nTongcheng was known as a city of longevity, ranking among the top cities in the country for its number of centenarians.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. \"This one's different. I think I've heard of this person. He served as an official in Tongcheng for a while in his early years.\"\n\nZhou Ze opened a web browser and began to search. Baidu Baike immediately brought up a detailed biography of Chen Guangnong.\n\n\"He led an uprising?\" Xu Qinglang noted one detail. \"The record says that during the Huaihai Campaign of the Liberation War, he was a battalion commander who led his troops in an uprising. He also participated in the Korean War, then returned to his hometown of Tongcheng to serve as a local official for a time before retiring.\"\n\n\"I think it has to be him. The person Li Shi was looking for must be him,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nA legendary person ought to have a life story to match. This man's life was more than colorful enough.\n\nZhou Ze first found his patient room, but what made him, Xu Qinglang, and the old Taoist stare blankly was that Chen Guangnong had fallen into a long-term coma several years ago. He was in a vegetative state; now, it was simply a matter of his body not having died yet.\n\n\"Damn, now what?\" the old Taoist said, completely bewildered.\n\nZhou Ze opened the door to the patient room and walked in. Xu Qinglang signaled for the old Taoist and the monkey to keep watch outside, then followed him inside.\n\nThe atmosphere in the room was heavy. This old man, just one year shy of achieving a century-long life, had truly reached the stage where the oil has run out and the lamp is dry.\n\nHe lay there now, unconscious.\n\nYou could say he was alive, but it was no different from being dead.\n\nZhou Ze sat down on the chair by the bed and glanced at the data on the various instruments beside the old man. His condition was not optimistic.\n\n\"Is there any way to wake him?\" Xu Qinglang asked. He knew Zhou Ze used to be a doctor.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. If only that person from Rongcheng hadn't been taken away by Tang Shi, it would have been convenient to ask for his help. That guy was supposedly a psychiatrist with terrifying hypnosis skills, able to mesmerize even ghost envoys.\n\n\"It seems there's only one method left now,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"What method?\"\n\n\"Kill him now, then capture his soul and question it.\"\n\n\"...\" said Xu Qinglang.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head, indicating he was just joking. The man had lived to be ninety-nine, which was no easy feat. He couldn't just kill him to ask a few questions for an uncertain lead.\n\nBesides, looking at the man's state—his life full of ups and downs, brilliant and varied, and having lain here for so many years—he had probably come to terms with everything. If Zhou Ze killed him, his soul might go straight to Hell, and he wouldn't even get the chance to ask.\n\n\"There's a book in the drawer,\" Xu Qinglang said, opening it.\n\n\"What book?\"\n\n\"An autobiography. Probably published with help from his descendants or someone else. Self-published.\"\n\nXu Qinglang took out the book and flipped through it.\n\n\"Look at his early life,\" Zhou Ze reminded him.\n\n\"I know.\"\n\nSoon, Xu Qinglang found an entry. \"Before the War of Resistance, he was a company commander in the Tongcheng Peace Preservation Corps.\"\n\nThe Peace Preservation Corps was a local armed force, much like the ones depicted in anti-Japanese war dramas—basically no combat effectiveness.\n\n\"Did they put up any resistance when the devils invaded Tongcheng?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"I checked. The Japanese Iizuka Detachment, I think it was from the 101st Division. The details are a bit fuzzy, but I heard that Japanese divisions numbered over 100 weren't very effective. This division seems to have gotten beaten pretty badly in Jiangxi.\n\n\"However, at the time, Tongcheng had no regular Chinese army units. The resistance was entirely organized by local armed forces. They fought the devils, but no matter how rookie a rookie division was, it was still far stronger than a local militia like the Peace Preservation Corps. So Tongcheng fell pretty quickly.\"\n\n\"So you're saying he participated in the resistance against the Japanese in Tongcheng?\"\n\n\"He should have. He probably didn't become a traitor and surrender, otherwise he wouldn't have been made a battalion commander in the Nationalist army.\"\n\nZhou Ze frowned.\n\nBoth the sleeping old man covered in age spots before him and all the villagers of Sanxiang Village gave him a sense of powerlessness. He felt like he had a body full of strength but could only punch cotton.\n\nHe and Xu Qinglang had been standing here talking for so long, yet the old man just lay there with his eyes closed, showing no reaction. He had clearly lost all awareness of the outside world.\n\nBut Zhou Ze was unwilling to leave just like that. So, he bent down, leaned close to the old man's ear, and asked slowly, \"Old Sir, do you still remember... Sanxiang Village?\"\n\nSuddenly, a miracle occurred.\n\nThe old man's fingers began to tremble.\n\nThen his eyelids started to twitch uncontrollably.\n\nIt was as if he had heard, or had been stimulated. His lips parted slightly, and he seemed to make a very faint sound:\n\n\"Folk... s...\"\n\n\"What did he say?\" Xu Qinglang asked.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head; the sound was too faint.\n\nXu Qinglang pushed Zhou Ze aside and placed his own ear next to the old man's mouth, listening intently.\n\nAfter a moment, Xu Qinglang stood up straight, his expression solemn.\n\n\"What did he say?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"He said... he wants to kiss you?\"²\n\n---\n¹ *Devils* (鬼子, guǐzi) is a derogatory term for foreign invaders, particularly the Japanese during WWII.\n\n² **Translator's Note:** This is a pun in the original Chinese. The old man whispers \"鄉親們\" (*xiāngqīnmen*), which means \"Fellow villagers\" or \"Folks.\" Xu Qinglang deliberately mishears it as \"想親你\" (*xiǎng qīn nǐ*), which means \"Wants to kiss you.\" The sounds *xiāngqīn* and *xiǎng qīn* are nearly identical.",

    "content": "\"Boss, is this... okay?\"\n\nThe Old Taoist, sitting in the back, pointed with a trembling hand at the old man lying on his lap.\n\nThe old man was still in a semi-conscious state, but he was able to open his eyes now. He would just open them for a moment before closing them again, and his speech was intermittent.\n\nHe was awake.\n\nHe was truly awake.\n\nBut this kind of awakening,\n\nin the strictest sense, should be considered a final rally before death.\n\nHe was awake,\n\nwhich meant he would soon be gone.\n\nHe had been holding on, living on a single breath. Previously, Zhou Ze had thought it might be his tenacious life force, good medical care, or perhaps a blessing from the heavens. But thinking about it now, it was more likely that there was something he truly couldn't let go of, something that made him unwilling to close his eyes for the last time.\n\nXu Qinglang was driving. He was driving fast, yet also steadily. He had to be steady, because a sudden brake or a sharp turn might make the old man in the back breathe his last.\n\nSpiriting a patient out of a nursing home—and a patient who had been comatose and on the verge of death for a long time at that—was an insane thing to do. However, Zhou Ze had no regrets, nor did he feel the slightest psychological burden.\n\nAlthough the old man hadn't said it clearly, his attitude had already revealed it.\n\nThree Villages Village.\n\nIt had always been in the depths of his heart, never erased.\n\nIn truth, humans are forgetful creatures. We all subconsciously blur the things we don't want to see, erasing memories that cause us pain.\n\nMany people remain unmoved and indifferent as the elderly women who had been \"comfort women\" pass away one by one, not realizing that each of their departures is another layer of dust settling over that piece of history for us.\n\nSome things, in fact, must not be forgotten.\n\nUpon reaching the streets of Xingren Town, Xu Qinglang got out of the car. He and the Old Taoist then lifted the old man out.\n\n\"Old brother, hang in there just a little longer! We're almost there, we're almost there.\"\n\nThe Old Taoist cheered on his 99-year-old big brother.\n\nXu Qinglang felt the old man's hand on his shoulder give a slight squeeze.\n\nAnd the old man's half-open eyes turned to Zhou Ze. His eyes were very cloudy, as if covered by a layer of gauze. This body of his was long since exhausted. He was going to go rest; he needed to rest.\n\n\"The villagers are all there,\" Zhou Ze said very seriously. \"I don't know what they're waiting for, but since you woke up after hearing me say the words 'Three Villages Village,' it means I didn't find the wrong person. You're concerned about them too.\"\n\nAs he spoke,\n\nZhou Ze reached out and smoothed the old man's sparse hair, then helped button his patient gown.\n\nThe old man was experiencing his final rally.\n\nHis rights and wrongs, his merits and demerits, would be for later generations to judge.\n\nIt was difficult for people of the modern era to put themselves in the shoes of those from the chaotic past, and difficult to pass judgment.\n\nAt the very least, one thing could be proven: when the old man was a soldier in the Tongcheng Security Regiment, he didn't become a deserter, nor did he become a traitor. When a Japanese division first landed at the harbor near Tongcheng, there were no regular Chinese army troops in the city.\n\nBut relying solely on the local armed forces of the Security Regiment and the spontaneous resistance of the residents, they still managed to inflict considerable losses on the Japanese army. In fact, the local armed forces had planned to retake the Tongcheng city gate on more than one occasion. While the main forces and the center of gravity shifted southwest,\n\nin this isolated, Japanese-occupied area, there were still people resisting, and the sound of gunfire still rang out.\n\nThe old man was still looking at Zhou Ze. As he watched, he began to cough. His teeth were almost all gone, and his coughs sounded weak, but he was smiling.\n\nThen,\n\nhe arduously stretched out his hand, as if trying to reach Zhou Ze.\n\nThe Old Taoist watched from the side, his heart aching. *Old brother, just take it easy,* he thought. *Don't go and wear yourself out before we even get inside.*\n\nZhou Ze stood there without moving,\n\nallowing the old man's withered, skeletal hand to gently grasp the cloth of his shirt over his chest.\n\nThe old man's grip was feeble.\n\nThen, Zhou Ze felt two light taps on his chest.\n\nRight there,\n\nwas the location of the heart.\n\nAfter completing this action, the old man's entire body went limp, as if all his strength had been drained away. His breathing became erratic.\n\n\"Let's go in. Hurry.\"\n\nAfter speaking, Zhou Ze began walking in circles in that spot, then rushed toward the road and vanished completely.\n\nXu Qinglang took out a paper talisman and stuck it to his own forehead. In an instant, the space between his eyebrows began to darken. Then, following the same pattern, he also walked a few circles in that spot and rushed forward.\n\nThe Old Taoist followed last, also walking a few circles, and then charged forward.\n\nHeh,\n\nhe didn't get in.\n\nHeh heh heh.\n\nThe Old Taoist grinned so wide his whole face wrinkled up like a chrysanthemum, truly blooming with joy.\n\nThe little monkey, watching the Old Taoist's foolish display from the side, turned away slightly, as if to say it didn't know this old pickled thing.\n\nEntering Three Villages Village again, Zhou Ze looked up and saw that the moon in the sky had turned almost blood-red. It hadn't been like this when he came in half a day ago.\n\nIt seemed that his slaughter in the ancestral hall might have agitated something, imperceptibly making the situation here even more urgent.\n\nSo, if the old man on Xu Qinglang's back couldn't resolve the situation and break the deadlock, then Zhou Ze, as a Ghost Emissary, would probably have to call the Little Loli over to help guard the exit.\n\nWhether they could successfully defend the pass and prevent this horde of vengeful ghosts from spilling into the human world,\n\nit was hard to say.\n\nXu Qinglang entered, carrying the old man. As soon as he was inside, he felt the person on his back suddenly grow heavy. Xu Qinglang's eyes widened in disbelief.\n\n*No way,*\n\n*He died?*\n\n*Grandpa, don't scare me! You haven't even lived to be a hundred yet!*\n\nXu Qinglang anxiously tried to turn his head to check the old man's condition, but then he saw Zhou Ze looking calmly behind him.\n\n\"Put him down,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nXu Qinglang slowly lowered the old man's body to the ground. When he turned around, he saw a young man standing behind him.\n\nThe young man was wearing a black military uniform, with a rifle slung over his back and a cap on his head.\n\nIt was a very typical Security Regiment uniform, even patched in some places, looking rather worn. This attire was a common sight in the popular war dramas of recent years.\n\nHe had died.\n\nThis was his soul?\n\nThe old man,\n\noh, no,\n\nthe young man looked at Zhou Ze and Xu Qinglang, nodded slightly, closed his eyes, and took a deep breath, as if in reminiscence, or perhaps in mourning.\n\nTwo streams of tears trickled down from the corners of his eyes.\n\nHe was dead,\n\nbut the tears were not for his own death.\n\nIn fact, for him, death was more of a release. He had been lying in that bed for too long. Even before he had lost consciousness, he had held on for far, far too long.\n\nHe didn't know what he was holding on for. The comrades-in-arms who had walked with him through the years of fiery warfare had all departed, one by one. In the end, he was left all alone.\n\nHe was almost a hundred years old, but he wasn't living just for the sake of reaching a hundred. He still had people he worried about, promises he remembered, and...\n\na debt of gratitude he owed.\n\nWhat the old man didn't know was that nine years ago, when he was not yet comatose, a man named Li Shi had planned to drive to the nursing home to find him. He could have come here nine years earlier.\n\nBut that original forum poster, in the end, could not overcome his own fate. The very fact that he could enter Three Villages Village meant his own life was nearing its end.\n\nLi Shi, in the end, couldn't outrun his destiny.\n\nPerhaps, nine years ago, the villagers here hadn't been driven to such a state of madness. Perhaps there were still people... who could speak, who could communicate.\n\nThey had told Li Shi some things, and Li Shi had planned to go out and help them find the person they had been waiting for all along.\n\nJust then, Zhou Ze saw the old grandpa and the little girl walking over from the village entrance.\n\nThe walking posture of the old and the young was somewhat stiff. The little girl clutched her sugar figurine, constantly pulling at it. The old grandpa carried a hoe on his shoulder, his face ashen.\n\nA red light flickered at the corners of their eyes, and drool dripped incessantly from their mouths.\n\n*It's getting worse,*\n\n*here.*\n\nThe young man walked forward, following the ridge between the fields until he was on the road.\n\nHe wasn't afraid in the slightest, because there was no need for him to be.\n\nThe debt that had lingered in the bottom of his heart for nearly eighty years,\n\ntoday,\n\nwould be repaid.\n\nThe young man was already an old man of nearly a hundred, but at this moment, he still took off his cap, waved it vigorously, and shouted:\n\n\"Grandpa Xu, Ah Hua!\"\n\nJust like eighty years ago!\n\nThe old grandpa heard the voice and froze.\n\nThe little girl also stopped abruptly.\n\nThe old and the young,\n\ncame to a complete standstill.\n\nXu Qinglang stood next to Zhou Ze with his hands on his hips, asking worriedly, \"Is this going to be okay?\"\n\n\"We can only try,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nA moment later,\n\nthe crimson red in the old man's eyes began to fade. He shouted, \"Young man!¹ Little Chen, hey, you're back!\"\n\nThe expression on the little girl's face also transformed from vicious to innocent and carefree. She ran joyfully toward the young man. \"Uncle Chen, you're back!\"\n\nThe old and the young both ran to the young man's side, overjoyed.\n\nThe young man turned his head, glanced at Zhou Ze and Xu Qinglang standing in the distance, then turned back to the old man and little girl before him, nodded emphatically, and said:\n\n\"Yes, I'm back. I'm back!\"\n\n\"Where are the troops? Are the troops back? Just yesterday I heard the Jap devils are still killing people in the city. The bodies are hanging on the city walls.\"\n\n\"The troops... the troops are back too!\" the young man yelled with all his might. \"We're getting ready to fight the devils!\"\n\n\"Good!\" The old grandpa pumped his fist, then said, \"Come on. Before you left, you told us to help collect grain for the main forces when they came back to fight. Our village's grain is all collected and hidden under the ancestral hall. The devils came by a while ago, but they didn't find it.\"\n\n\"Then do you all still have food at home?\" the young man asked with concern.\n\n\"Heh, everyone did it willingly. We're getting by on wild greens. Going hungry for a bit won't kill anyone. We're hungry, of course, but it's nothing.\"\n\nThe old grandpa took the young man's hand and led him toward the village, while the young man picked up the little girl, who was overjoyed.\n\nHearing this exchange from a distance, Zhou Ze\n\nwas deeply moved.\n\nThe old grandpa said going hungry for a few days was nothing,\n\nbut they had been starving for eighty years.\n\nGoing hungry for a little while was indeed nothing for a person;\n\nbut the feeling of starvation lasting for eighty years was enough to be unbearable even for a ghost. It was a form of torture beyond imagination!\n\n\"Little Chen is back! The main forces are coming back to fight!\"\n\nThe old grandpa shouted as soon as they entered the village.\n\nThe entire Three Villages Village instantly erupted.\n\nAn old woman who had been sitting by her door, drooling while stitching a shoe sole, jolted and stood up, then shouted:\n\n\"Little Chen is back!\"\n\nA widow who was drawing water from a well while chewing on her own hair immediately spat the hair out of her mouth.\n\nHer face, now powdered and full of flirtatious promise,\n\nrevealed a charm all her own. She swayed her hips and called out:\n\n\"Little Chen, if you hadn't come back soon, this lady's breasts would have shrunk from hunger! If I can't find a man then, you'll have to take me in!\"\n\nInside a tiled-roof house, a man who was boiling water immediately threw down the firewood in his hand and rushed out of the house, pulling his wife along with him.\n\nThe villagers all gathered,\n\nsurrounding the young man as they walked toward the ancestral hall.\n\nThe blind old man sitting at the entrance of the ancestral hall stood up, trembling. He had heard the voices, heard the commotion. Little Chen, who had recovered from his injuries in the village, was back.\n\nHe had said the main forces would be back soon to fight.\n\nHe had said the little devils wouldn't be hopping around for much longer.\n\nHe had asked everyone to help prepare grain for when the main forces returned.\n\nThe blind old man threw away his cane and knelt on the floor of the ancestral hall. His hands fumbled around on the floor tiles. Then, he lifted a few tiles,\n\nreached his hand underneath, and as the crowd surged to the entrance of the ancestral hall,\n\nthe blind old man held up a handful of glistening white rice,\n\nand shouted:\n\n\"Little Chen, the grain!\n\nThe grain the villagers prepared for the main forces!\n\nWe've kept it hidden all this time!\n\nThe devils never found it!\n\nWe saved it for the main forces!\n\nYou all eat your fill, so you can fight the devils well!\"\n\nThe young man stood at the entrance of the ancestral hall, watching the grains of rice slip continuously through the blind old man's fingers.\n\nSlowly, he lifted his head.\n\nHe was crying.\n\nBack then, he had been full of confidence, telling the villagers while he was recovering from his wounds that the main forces would be back soon to fight.\n\nThe villagers had believed him.\n\nBut in reality,\n\nthe main forces only fought their way back nearly seven years later. The villagers didn't make it to see those seven years. In fact, less than a week after his wounds had healed and he had left to find the main forces, the news that this village had sheltered a wounded soldier was leaked.\n\nJapanese and collaborator troops rushed here and slaughtered everyone in the village, young and old, to make an example of them.\n\nThis was also the reason he didn't want to fight in the civil war and ended up defecting.\n\nSome people,\n\nwere still waiting for him.\n\nWaiting for him to come back.\n\nThe Japanese had been driven out. It was time for him to go back.\n\n\"Can an obsession... really be this deep?\" Xu Qinglang was shaken.\n\n\"There must have been an external factor influencing this.\"\n\nZhou Ze looked up and saw the blood moon in the sky slowly clearing. The baleful energy in the village was also gradually dissipating.\n\nAt the same time, a crystalline object fell from the sky, landing in a pile of thatch ahead.\n\nZhou Ze walked over and searched for a bit, finding a bronze ring in the thatch. The pattern on it was strange, and it felt heavy in his hand.\n\nHe hadn't finished what he was saying earlier.\n\nPicking up the ring, Zhou Ze continued:\n\n\"But external factors are just that—external. Some attachments are bone-deep; they can't be stopped by any outside object.\n\nOtherwise,\n\neighty years ago, our nation would have been vanquished long ago.\"\n\n***\n\n**Footnotes:**\n¹ The original text uses a dialectical term for \"young man.\"",

    "content": "On closer inspection, the ring had some cracks, giving it a flawed appearance that couldn't help but stir a strong sense of regret.\n\nZhou Ze didn't rush to slide the ring onto his own hand, instead placing it in his pocket.\n\nThis was no ordinary ring. The fact that Sanxiang Village had been sustained in this manner for eighty years had to be connected to it. Zhou Ze was afraid of what might happen if he rashly put it on his finger.\n\nBesides, now wasn't the time to study the ring. There was still one thing left to do—the most fundamental and most important thing.\n\nZhou Ze walked toward the ancestral hall. Looking at the celebrating crowd, his eyes met the young man's for a few seconds. The young man gave a slight nod.\n\nA silent understanding passed between them.\n\nThe young man had lived to be ninety-nine, experiencing war and all sorts of turmoil. A life like that was one in ten thousand, and the wisdom his life experiences brought him was difficult to imitate or surpass.\n\nMany things didn't need to be said; they both understood.\n\nZhou Ze crossed his hands and slowly pulled them apart.\n\nThe Gates of Hell were slowly opened.\n\nThis was the end,\n\nthe final destination for the dead,\n\nthe path all beings must tread!\n\n\"Fellow villagers, let's go!\"\n\nThe young man led the villagers toward Zhou Ze.\n\nEighty years of trials and tribulations,\n\nthey had eaten bitterness,\n\nand they had endured suffering.\n\nAt this moment, the young man felt it was time for him to close his eyes, to close them together with his fellow villagers.\n\nThe young man was very satisfied with this ending. It was the conclusion he had been waiting for, the one he had longed for.\n\nIn the past, the villagers had died because they were implicated by him. After he heard the news, he knelt for an entire night before the old locust tree at the entrance to his military unit.\n\nThen, for seven years, he threw himself into one bloody battle after another, hoping to give his life on the battlefield against the devils, to trade it for a clear conscience toward his fellow villagers!\n\nBut on the battlefield, the more you didn't fear death, the harder it was to die. He survived battle after battle and was even promoted.\n\nBy the time the devils surrendered, he had grown weary. He felt his mission was complete and that his life should end too. That was why he hated the civil war. In his eyes, the start of the civil war was a complete desecration of the villagers of Sanxiang and all the heroes who had died fighting in the war of resistance!\n\nThe devils had been driven out, World War II was over, yet on the lands of the East, in China, a massive chaotic war involving millions was still taking place.\n\nSo he staged an uprising.\n\nHe hoped this chaos could end sooner.\n\nFrom youth to old age, his life had passed through one turning point after another, but not until today, not until this very moment, did the young man feel that his life was complete.\n\nThe period that was missing a half was finally made whole.\n\nThe young man was the first to step into the Gates of Hell.\n\nThe villagers behind him followed, one after another.\n\nNo one resisted.\n\nNo one cried or made a fuss.\n\nEveryone had a smile on their face.\n\nAnd deep within those smiles was a sense of release.\n\nThey were tired. Everyone was tired.\n\nSome things were fake, but how could people living in that fakeness not notice at all?\n\nThis was a dream, a dream everyone had been upholding.\n\nAnd now, the dream was over, but the ending was a happy one.\n\nTherefore, there was naturally no resentment, nor would there be any complaints.\n\nThere was only an air of being unfettered and open-hearted.\n\nXu Qinglang stood to the side, silently counting heads.\n\nThe last one was the little girl holding the sugar figurine. The little girl looked at Zhou Ze and smiled, her eyes crinkling into cute little crescent moons, and then she skipped into the Gates of Hell.\n\nZhou Ze released his hands.\n\nThe Gates of Hell dissipated.\n\n\"Have a safe journey.\"\n\nZhou Ze said slowly.\n\nXu Qinglang bowed his head slightly and did a small bow.\n\n\"Have a safe journey.\"\n\nHonestly, maintaining the Gates of Hell was exhausting, especially for so long.\n\nBut Boss Zhou had never felt so damn good.\n\nOkay,\n\ntalking about performance metrics in front of the villagers was indeed inappropriate.\n\nEspecially in this atmosphere.\n\nOne should be crying.\n\nEveryone, cry for me! Harder!\n\nBut the thrill of his performance metrics steadily climbing kept stimulating Boss Zhou's nerves.\n\nHe tried.\n\nHe really tried.\n\nHe just couldn't cry.\n\nHe really, really couldn't cry.\n\nJust not laughing was already taking a great deal of effort.\n\nXu Qinglang watched from the side, somewhat speechless. \"If you want to laugh, just laugh,\" he said. \"You've already got issues. Bottling it up will only make them worse.\"\n\nZhou Ze turned his head to look at Xu Qinglang. \"Let's build a monument for them,\" he said. \"Something like a memorial.\"\n\n\"I have no problem with that. It's your call.\"\n\n\"But I don't have any money. I still owe you and my Yingying money.\"\n\n\"...\" went Xu Qinglang.\n\nSuddenly, Xu Qinglang had a bad feeling.\n\n*Nope.*\n\n*Absolutely not.*\n\n*Refuse!*\n\n\"As someone with over twenty properties, selling one to build a memorial should be the right thing to do, shouldn't it?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"...\" went Xu Qinglang.\n\n\"You have to think, without their contributions and sacrifices eighty years ago, you couldn't be living in such a peaceful and prosperous age, and housing prices wouldn't be so high, right?\"\n\n\"...\" went Xu Qinglang.\n\n\"So, you're willing, right?\"\n\n\"Why does it feel like you're trying to guilt-trip me?\" Xu Qinglang said, very displeased.\n\n\"Up to you. Really, hell money is something you can see, but some things, you can't see.\" Zhou Ze reached out and patted Xu Qinglang's shoulder.\n\n\"We'll talk about this after we get back.\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't continue the topic, instead subconsciously taking out his credentials booklet.\n\nSo many villagers…\n\nThe performance metrics should be enough, right?\n\nThis \"temporary\" tag of mine, it should be time to remove it, to become a permanent employee, right?\n\nHowever,\n\nwhen he opened the booklet to look,\n\nZhou Ze was stunned.\n\n**Performance: Ninety-nine percent.**\n\nThis was basically saying, *I'll just rub on the outside; I'm not going in!*¹\n\nIt kept its promise. It really didn't go in.\n\nGoing in would make you a beast,\n\nbut not going in... makes you worse than a beast!\n\n\"What's the number?\" Xu Qinglang leaned over to take a look. \"If you become a permanent employee, shouldn't you give us some hell money as a bonus?\"\n\nWhen Xu Qinglang saw the ninety-nine percent, he laughed shamelessly.\n\nHe laughed loudly.\n\nFreely.\n\nZhou Ze sighed, looked at the brilliantly laughing Lady Xu, and said:\n\n\"Old Xu, can I discuss something with you?\"\n\n\"Speak.\"\n\n\"If you can help, you will?\"\n\n\"Mm, if I can help, I will.\"\n\n\"You're a mystic cultivator, so the chances of you becoming a ghost after you die are much higher than for a normal person, right? How about this: you let me kill you, I'll collect your soul, and you can round me up to a whole number. How about it?\"\n\n\"...\" went Xu Qinglang.\n\nShaking his head, Zhou Ze smiled and said, \"Don't be nervous. It's fine. Isn't there still a little girl in the bookstore?\"\n\nGetting that girl sent off would complete things, truly complete them.\n\nThis time, there was no diving into haystacks. After the ring fell and was taken by Zhou Ze, and the villagers entered the Gates of Hell one by one, the environment here also began to slowly fade.\n\nIn the end,\n\nit reconnected and merged with reality.\n\nXu Qinglang and Zhou Ze were standing on the road, with the old Daoist and the monkey across from them.\n\nOnce in the car, Xu Qinglang was still driving, and Zhou Ze sat in the passenger seat, constantly fiddling with his credentials booklet.\n\nTo be honest, Zhou Ze now felt like he did back in elementary school when the teacher appointed him group leader.\n\nVery childish,\n\nbut also a little excited.\n\n\"Heh heh,\" Xu Qinglang chuckled twice. \"You're this happy now. When you get promoted to the point of opening your own court on Mount Tai, won't you just die from happiness?\"\n\n\"If that day really comes, after you die, I will help you.\"\n\n\"I guess you do have some conscience,\" Xu Qinglang said, greatly comforted.\n\n\"I'll help make sure you're reincarnated as a woman in your next life, to completely relieve you of your pain and discomfort.\"\n\n*SCREECH...*\n\nHe slammed on the brakes, jolting everyone in the car.\n\nXu Qinglang took a few deep breaths, suppressing the urge to strangle Zhou Ze.\n\nDamn it,\n\nhe was genuinely scared.\n\nBecause, theoretically speaking,\n\nit was possible for Zhou Ze to pull that off!\n\n\"What are the benefits of getting rid of the 'temporary' tag?\" Xu Qinglang asked.\n\nZhou Ze didn't answer.\n\n\"Is it a huge increase in power? An extra magic artifact? Or do they add some special effects for you?\" Xu Qinglang pressed.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. \"I asked the little loli. She said after becoming a permanent employee, every time I send someone to Hell, a verdict will automatically appear in the booklet.\"\n\n\"A verdict?\"\n\n\"Similar to the judgment poems in *Dream of the Red Chamber*.\"\n\n\"What's the use of that?\" Xu Qinglang asked, puzzled.\n\n\"To add some flair.\"\n\n\"Hmm?\"\n\n\"Basically, to make it more impressive.\"\n\nAfter saying that,\n\nZhou Ze lifted his head and looked out the window,\n\ngazing at the sky.\n\n...\n\nWhen the car pulled up to the bookstore, Zhou Ze got out first. Ninety-nine was just short of one, and that one was inside.\n\nFearing other accidents, Zhou Ze had taken precautions and hadn't sent the little girl to Hell first, instead leaving her for Bai Yingying to watch.\n\nSo, after pushing open the bookstore door, Zhou Ze called out directly:\n\n\"Yingying?\"\n\n\"Ying ying ying ying...\" came a sound from behind the counter.\n\n\"Hello?\" Zhou Ze called out again.\n\n\"Ying ying ying ying...\"\n\n\"What are you doing? Stop messing around. Bring the girl's spirit over.\"\n\n\"Ying ying ying ying...\"\n\nZhou Ze realized something was wrong. He immediately went around the counter and found Bai Yingying sitting there, her hands and feet bound by a black rope. There was also a rope gagging her mouth.\n\nShe could only make \"ying ying ying ying\" sounds.\n\nZhou Ze immediately went to help Bai Yingying untie the ropes, but the moment his fingers touched the black rope, a sharp pain shot through them. Bai Yingying's body trembled uncontrollably from the pain.\n\nTaking a deep breath, Zhou Ze let his fingernails grow out and used them to pick the ropes apart. The broken ropes instantly turned into ordinary straw ropes and scattered.\n\n\"What happened?\"\n\n\"Boss! Ying ying ying...\"\n\nBai Yingying threw herself into Zhou Ze's arms, hugging his neck and sobbing as if she had suffered the greatest injustice.\n\n\"What on earth happened?\" Zhou Ze asked again.\n\n\"That little girl... the little girl... I couldn't beat her. Yingying is useless. I've brought shame upon you, Boss.\"\n\nZhou Ze patted Bai Yingying's back, his expression turning solemn. He asked again:\n\n\"That little girl?\"\n\n\"Yes, she wanted to leave. I stopped her, and then she tied me up.\"\n\n\"Where is she now?\"\n\n\"Gone.\"\n\n\"Gone?\"\n\n\"Oh, she left a note. I think she wrote it on the counter.\"\n\nXu Qinglang had walked over by now and heard the whole story. He started rummaging on the counter, found a piece of paper with very firm handwriting, and read aloud:\n\n\"'When I was little, I was afraid of ghosts, thinking they were hideous and terrifying;\nnow that I'm grown, I'm afraid of people, even if they're impeccably dressed.'\nWell written,\" Xu Qinglang remarked.\n\n\"I wrote that,\" Zhou Ze said. As he spoke, Zhou Ze also walked over, pushed aside the paper and books on the counter, and continued searching.\n\n\"You wrote it? Then where's what she wrote? It must be even more profound, right?\" Xu Qinglang asked curiously.\n\nAnd then,\n\nXu Qinglang froze.\n\nAfter Zhou Ze pushed aside the clutter on the counter,\n\nthere, on the countertop, was a line of crooked, childish scrawl:\n\n\"Braised pork is really, really delicious!\"\n\n***\n¹ A Chinese internet slang phrase, often sexual, implying teasing without commitment or completion.",

    "content": "Another two days passed. Strangely, not a single ghost had come to the door in those two days. Every night, Boss Zhou sat in his bookstore,\n\nwaiting,\n\nand waiting,\n\nand waiting, gazing until his eyes were sore, but still, nothing came.\n\nIt got to the point where even Bai Yingying couldn't stand to watch anymore. It was rare for her lazy boss to throw himself so wholeheartedly into the fervor of his work, only to have no customers show up.\n\nAs for the little girl who had tied up Bai Yingying, she hadn't reappeared. Her identity had become a mystery.\n\nShe might have been an anomaly from that village.\n\nBut it was also possible she wasn't from the village at all.\n\nHer appearance might have just been to pull the strings and guide him to pay attention to the matter of Sanxiang Village, using his hand to take care of it.\n\nZhou Ze had speculated about her identity, even wondering if she held a rank higher than a ghost official.\n\nA Head Constable, perhaps?\n\nOr even... a Judge of Hell?\n\nIt was just that Zhong Kui's image was too deeply ingrained in people's minds; if a Judge of Hell was that little girl, Zhou Ze couldn't help but worry about Hell's aesthetic standards and general atmosphere.\n\nThe little loli being the way she was was one thing, but if a Judge was also a delicate little girl, then were the Ten Yama Kings of the underworld all big-dicked moe girls?¹\n\nOf course, that was just a joke. It was probably impossible.\n\nThe little loli was still tracking the priest's whereabouts. She had sent a message midway through saying she had almost found him, so Zhou Ze didn't ask her to go look for the other little girl. An entity that could flip a two-hundred-year-old female corpse like Bai Yingying and tie her up was not someone he needed to provoke, so long as she bore no ill will.\n\nBesides, she hadn't played any negative role in the whole affair.\n\nBut when would he find his next ghost?\n\nHe was just one short.\n\n\"Come back soon!\n\nI can wait no longer!\n\nCome back soon...\"\n\nThe bookstore's sound system started playing this song. Zhou Ze coughed and glanced at the monkey, who silently switched the track.\n\nThe old Daoist sat across from him. Since there weren't many customers, he was leisurely cracking melon seeds and watching TV. The international news had been quite eventful lately, with one power taking the stage right after another, leaving one breathless.\n\nZhou Ze stood up and poured himself a glass of water. As he passed the old Daoist, the old man suddenly spoke up.\n\n\"Boss, does Hell have a TV station?\"\n\n\"What do you think?\"\n\n\"They probably do, right?\" the old Daoist guessed.\n\n\"Heh.\" From a distance, Xu Qinglang, who was mixing a new cocktail, let out a chuckle.\n\n\"What are you laughing at? You've never died. If you haven't died, you don't have the right to speak,\" the old Daoist retorted stubbornly.\n\n\"Then tell us, if Hell has TV shows, what do they broadcast?\" Xu Qinglang teased him.\n\n\"Hmph hmph.\"\n\nThe old Daoist cleared his throat instinctively, then began:\n\n\"Now broadcasting the Underworld News Simulcast. Here are the main headlines:\n\nThe Eastern Underworld's representative, Yama King, met with the Lord of the Western Hell, Hades.\n\nThe two sides held friendly negotiations on the issue of ferrying the souls of the deceased from East and West.\n\nThe Underworld's Judge, Zhong Kui, inspected the registration of underworld land, cracking down firmly on the phenomenon of evil ghosts illegally occupying territory.\"\n\nListening to this, Zhou Ze shook his head and walked back to his seat.\n\nXu Qinglang, however, was stunned for a moment. He had to hand it to the old Daoist's glib tongue.\n\nJust then, it started to rain outside, and the downpour grew heavier and heavier.\n\nZhou Ze didn't think much of it at first, but his expression slowly grew solemn. Deep within the curtain of rain stood a woman in a qipao, holding a red paper umbrella.\n\nThe red umbrella shielded her head, but from the angle, she was clearly looking at him.\n\nOnly, this time, it wasn't just the old Daoist who sensed nothing; even Xu Qinglang felt not the slightest thing.\n\nThe qipao woman's feet didn't move,\n\nbut her whole body closed the distance to Zhou Ze in jerky segments.\n\nAfter a few moments, she was standing right outside the glass window next to where Zhou Ze was.\n\nA graceful figure, a beautiful face—the most exquisite vessel in the world. But inside, it was a nest of vipers and maggots.\n\nZhou Ze had seen this group of qipao-clad women, who sang as they strode down the Yellow Springs Road, more than once. But this time, one of them had appeared in the mortal world.\n\nZhou Ze walked out the bookstore door. The qipao woman turned and began to pull away again, her figure appearing hazy in the curtain of rain.\n\nAn ordinary person might have developed a sense of infatuation and longing for her. In the rain, this kind of woman could often make you forget fear and strangeness, and instead bow down at her feet with all your heart.\n\n\"Hey,\" Zhou Ze called out.\n\nBut she kept walking. Her arrival seemed to be solely to attract Zhou Ze's attention and lead him to another place. She was likely some kind of messenger.\n\nTo have a qipao woman, who could walk freely back and forth on the Yellow Springs Road, act as a messenger, the person behind her must be extraordinary.\n\nHowever, seeing that the qipao woman had already put some distance between them, Zhou Ze simply turned around and went back into the bookstore.\n\nWhat a joke.\n\nYou show up all cool, without saying a word.\n\nYou leave all cool, and I'm supposed to run after you shouting like the male lead in a melodrama?\n\nThis isn't Hell, it's the mortal world.\n\nWhat a bad habit.\n\nSomeone's really spoiled her.\n\nClosing the bookstore door, Zhou Ze stretched and sat back down in his spot, asking Bai Yingying to pour him a cup of coffee.\n\nWhat he didn't know was that the moment he turned and walked into the bookstore,\n\nthe ethereal qipao woman in the distance stepped into a puddle with a \"squelch.\"\n\nShe turned her head,\n\nrevealing her face, a carnival of writhing maggots.\n\nShe was in disbelief!\n\nHe...\n\nHe actually just went back inside?\n\nThen, she seemed to hesitate. Should she walk the path all over again?\n\nWith the same posture, the same air as before?\n\n*Splash.*\n\nA pair of black rain boots stepped into the puddle. A man with completely white hair reached out and flicked the raindrops from the brim of his hat. His pale hand came to rest on the qipao woman.\n\nThe qipao woman immediately began to wither, turning into a paper figure that was slowly soaked by the rain until it completely disintegrated in the puddle.\n\n\"Forget it. If he can't be invited, then I'll pay him a visit myself.\"\n\nThe man wore a coffee-colored coat in a distinctly British style, but his head of white hair made his overall aura seem rather out of place.\n\nAt his age, with that kind of hair,\n\nhe looked exactly like something out of the cringey Shamate² style popular a decade ago.\n\nBut the man continued on his own way, walking slowly until he finally reached the bookstore entrance and pushed open the door.\n\nHis eyes fell on the woman behind the bar mixing drinks.\n\nOh, no.\n\nOn closer inspection,\n\nthere was an Adam's apple.\n\nIt was a man?\n\nThe white-haired man couldn't help but stare at Xu Qinglang for an extra moment.\n\nInteresting.\n\nA man more beautiful than a woman was working as a bartender here.\n\nLooking further, Bai Yingying came into the white-haired man's line of sight. She walked over with the coffee, petite and charming.\n\nA jiangshi?³\n\nKept in the shop?\n\nThe man mused to himself. He had arrived, but no one in the shop could see him, including Zhou Ze, who was taking the coffee and preparing to read the newspaper.\n\nPeople have always held an innate fear of one thing:\n\nThat which they cannot see.\n\nAnd while Zhou Ze had been able to see the umbrella-wielding woman earlier, he couldn't see that, right at his shop's entrance, there now stood a person even he was blind to.\n\nA small monkey ran past the white-haired man with its toy hammer. Naturally sensitive, it didn't notice the slightest thing out of the ordinary, completely unaware that a person stood right beside it, looking down.\n\nBut in the white-haired man's eyes, this monkey emanated a dense, baleful aura.\n\nIt was born a spirit monkey but had cultivated the feel of a vengeful ghost. It was just that these things were all suppressed and not outwardly visible.\n\n\"Achoo!\"\n\nThe old Daoist let out a heavy sneeze.\n\nThe white-haired man looked at the old Daoist.\n\nThen,\n\nhis gaze fell directly on the old Daoist's crotch. There, a talisman glowed with a bright yellow light, its radiance enveloping the old Daoist's two \"walnuts\" below.\n\nThe white-haired man closed his eyes. He felt they had been sullied.\n\nThis shop,\n\nit was truly interesting.\n\nA minor ghost official had arranged his residence so elaborately, stuffing it with so many strange people and things.\n\nFinally, the white-haired man looked at Zhou Ze,\n\nand walked right up to him.\n\nZhou Ze frowned slightly. His hand suddenly trembled, and some coffee spilled onto his cuff.\n\nBai Yingying, quick of eye and deft of hand, hurried over to help wipe it off. At the same time, she helped him remove the stained jacket and went to fetch a clean one for him to change into.\n\nWhen the boss decided to be particular, he was *very* particular.\n\nBut thankfully, Comrade Yingying was already used to it.\n\nThe white-haired man sat down in front of Zhou Ze. The two were, in fact, sitting face-to-face.\n\n\"A temporary ghost official?\"\n\nThe white-haired man murmured to himself.\n\n\"In a small place like Tongcheng, the ghost officials are replaced surprisingly fast.\"\n\nZhou Ze looked around, a bit puzzled. He felt that something was off. Did that qipao woman who was showing off with her umbrella just leave like that?\n\nShe left,\n\nand there was no follow-up?\n\nWhat Zhou Ze didn't know was that the follow-up was sitting right in front of him.\n\nA writing brush appeared in the white-haired man's hand, and he caressed it gently between his fingertips.\n\n\"Ninety-nine percent. Just a little more and you'll be promoted to full status.\"\n\nThe white-haired man smiled.\n\n\"In that case, I'll do you a favor and help you with that last little bit, so you can be promoted.\n\nBut since this is official business,\n\nyou will kneel before me,\n\nand pay your respects to this seat of authority.\"\n\nZhou Ze suddenly felt a soreness in his knees, and the feeling was intensifying. It all came out of nowhere.\n\nThe white-haired man held his brush, sitting there calmly. Seeing that Zhou Ze only stood up to massage his legs, he was somewhat surprised. Why was Zhou Ze's reaction so slow?\n\nAn ordinary ghost official, upon being stimulated by a wisp of his leaked aura, should have immediately dropped to their knees in terror.\n\nAre you...\n\nany different from the others?\n\nThe white-haired man frowned slightly and said in a low voice:\n\n\"Kneel.\"\n\nZhou Ze's pupils contracted violently.\n\nHis body went rigid, as if a person lying in a warm bed had suddenly been thrown naked into a world of ice and snow.\n\n\"Boss, your ID, you forgot to take your ID out of your dirty clothes.\"\n\nBai Yingying walked over with Zhou Ze's ID card and handed it to him.\n\nThe ID was back in Zhou Ze's hand.\n\nAnd the white-haired man, who had been so nonchalant moments before, suddenly let his jaw drop.\n\nBehind Zhou Ze,\n\nhe saw a great mountain, and beneath the mountain, the faint silhouette of a monkey.\n\nA monkey moving a mountain, the Mountain-Moving Ape.\n\nIts body was immense,\n\nbearing only the weight of Mount Tai!\n\nWith a sharp *thud*,\n\nthe white-haired man, terrified, fell directly to his knees.\n\nIn utter disbelief, he stammered:\n\n\"Lord... Prefect?\"\n\nAs he spoke these words, the white-haired man's already invisible form completely disintegrated, vanishing into thin air.\n\n***\n\nIn a land of utter darkness,\n\na white-haired boy who had been dozing against an old scholar tree suddenly opened his eyes.\n\nHe felt as if he had just had a dream, and he was drenched in a cold sweat. A huge writing brush was strapped to the boy's back, looking somewhat out of place.\n\nThe boy looked utterly crestfallen.\n\nSuddenly,\n\nbelow him,\n\nbeneath the old scholar tree,\n\na pair of blood-red eyes, each as large as a house, appeared like two giant lanterns hanging in the sky.\n\nThe old scholar tree was growing on its body.\n\nIt had the horns of a deer, the head of a camel, the mouth of a donkey, the eyes of a turtle, the ears of an ox, the scales of a fish, the whiskers of a shrimp, the belly of a serpent, and the talons of an eagle—a true nine-unlike creature, even more exaggerated and bizarre than the so-called four-unlike.⁴\n\n\"Did I not... grant you... three months... of spirit travel...? You have woken... a little early...\"\n\nThe boy pursed his lips and put on an obsequious expression.\n\n\"I was thinking I'd wake up early to weed and catch fleas for you, old ancestor.\"\n\nThe boy,\n\nwas not telling the truth.\n\nThe giant beast below seemed very pleased with this answer and slowly lowered its head.\n\n\"You are thoughtful... It was not in vain that I... pleaded with the Bodhisattva... for your... Judge's commission...\"\n\n\"Of course, of course. Without you, old ancestor, I would still just be a wandering soul in the netherworld. How could I have been so fortunate as to be where I am today?\"\n\nThe boy began to pull weeds from around the scholar tree,\n\nwith great diligence,\n\nand meticulous care.\n\n***\n\n**Footnotes:**\n\n1.  **Moe girls:** A Japanese slang term for cute, often innocent-seeming female characters in anime and manga. \"Big-dicked moe girls\" is a literal, if crude, translation of the Chinese slang 大雕萌妹 (dà diāo méng mèi), a joke referencing the *futanari* genre.\n2.  **Shamate (殺馬特):** A transliteration of the English word \"smart,\" it refers to a gaudy, punk-inspired Chinese youth subculture from the 2000s, known for its extreme, spiky hairstyles.\n3.  **Jiangshi (殭屍):** A type of reanimated corpse in Chinese folklore, sometimes translated as \"hopping vampire\" or \"zombie.\"\n4.  **Nine-unlike creature (九不像):** An exaggerated version of the mythological \"four-unlike\" creature (四不像), also known as a milu deer or Père David's deer, which was said to have the features of four different animals.",

    "title": "Chapter 137 Door Interpretation",
    "content": "My name is Sun Qiu. I'm a third-year student at Pingchao Middle School.\n\nOur school is huge, with a lot of students, and most of them are boarders. So basically, after 9:30 PM, evening self-study ends and everyone heads back to the dorms to get ready for bed.\n\nGenerally, evening self-study ends at 9:30, and we're required to have lights out and be asleep by 10:00.\n\nOur dorm room is on the sixth floor, and there are eight of us in it. Honestly, the time between the end of evening study and lights out is just too short. During that window, we usually have to rush back to the dorm, then wash our clothes, socks, and ourselves. Basically, by the time we finish all that—or even before we can—a whistle will blow from the hallway outside. That's the dorm supervisor telling us to turn off the lights and go to bed.\n\nThe dorm supervisors are all very strict. They're all middle-aged men who look really fierce. And, to be honest, most of them have this strong tendency to lord it over you.\n\nThey see that we're students and scold us at the drop of a hat. They don't have much education themselves, but every single one of them loves to lecture people. Sometimes they'll deliberately find fault with students just to give them a talking-to.\n\nAnd it's hilarious when they do. It’s like a big-shot leader holding a meeting. First, they give you a dressing-down to get their kicks, treating students who are late back to the dorm or caught reading novels or using their phones as if they were criminals. After they've talked themselves tired and gotten their satisfaction, they expect us to \"grasp the spirit of their speech.\"\n\nAt the same time, they make the student stand in the office and write so-called \"self-criticism\" and \"thought reports,\" to deeply reflect on their own problems, complete with a required word count.\n\nReally, they just bully us middle schoolers because we're younger and more obedient. Over on the high school side, they don't dare to be so cocky.\n\nSo, we all hate them. After lights out, they wander around outside the dorm rooms. Our door has a small window in the middle of it, and they can see what's going on inside from there. They love to stand there and watch.\n\nIf they hear anyone talking after lights out, or see someone using a flashlight or a phone, they'll pounce like mad dogs, immediately whipping out their keys and bursting in. They confiscate your things, then drag you out of bed and take you into the hallway or their office for a scolding.\n\nSo, every night after lights out, my roommates and I don't dare to speak loudly, afraid they'll hear us outside. If a roommate uses their phone, they have to hide under the covers to do it.\n\nI like to read novels, and since my phone was confiscated just a little while ago, I would wrap myself up in my blanket and hide inside, using a flashlight to read.\n\nI used to be able to read like that all night. After all, school life is so boring. We only get two days off a month to go home and leave the campus. The rest of the time, we're stuck at school.\n\nMorning self-study starts at 6:30 AM and goes until evening self-study ends at 9:30 PM. Both our morning and evening self-study periods are used by the teachers for lessons, so there’s no question of it being voluntary.\n\nSo, for me, the only form of entertainment and fun is to use my sleeping time in the dorm to read novels.\n\nThat night, I started reading very early, wrapping my blanket tightly around myself.\n\nThe weather was actually getting quite hot, so it was easy to sweat under the blanket. It was stuffy and uncomfortable, but I couldn't be bothered. I just had to turn off the flashlight every so often, poke my head out for a few breaths of fresh air, then dive back into the stuffiness to read.\n\nAround two in the morning, all my roommates were asleep. I got out of bed to go to the toilet.\n\nOh, right.\n\nOur dorm has four bunk beds, which means it can house eight people. My bunk is a top one, near the window and balcony.\n\nThere's an en-suite bathroom in the room. It's tiny, just big enough for a toilet.\n\nI didn't dare bring my book into the bathroom to read, because if the bathroom light stays on for even a little too long, and a dorm supervisor notices, he might use his key to quickly unlock the door, burst in, and push open the bathroom door to inspect you. They're incredibly fast at opening doors with their keys—they've practiced!\n\nI had a roommate who was in the bathroom watching an MP4 player while \"practicing air defense\"¹ on his own.\n\nThe dorm supervisor suddenly burst in.\n\nThe man,\n\nthe \"loot,\"\n\nall caught.\n\nIt earned him several self-criticisms and a call to his parents. After that, my roommate never watched that stuff again, but he did get closer and closer to his male deskmate.\n\nSorry, I'm getting off-topic. That night, I was sitting on the toilet, thinking about the plot of my novel as I did my business, when I heard footsteps outside.\n\nMy heart immediately sank. I was relieved I hadn't brought the novel into the bathroom with me. Otherwise, I'd have been done for if that mad dog had targeted me.\n\nAfter I finished and walked out of the bathroom, I suddenly heard a faint, scratching sound from outside the door. I quietly lowered my head, and through the crack at the bottom of the door, I saw a pair of leather shoes.\n\nThere really was someone standing outside. He was watching me. He was waiting for me. I took a deep breath, preparing to go back to bed, but after a few steps, a question suddenly occurred to me.\n\nThe glass on our dorm door isn't actually that high up. I can stand there and see the situation inside through the glass, so why was it that when this dorm supervisor was standing there, I could only see his shoes and not his face?\n\nCould he be crouching down, deliberately waiting for me to slip up?\n\nThat sneaky?\n\nFuck.\n\nWhat a sly old bastard.²\n\n\"*Sassa sassa...*\"\n\nA rubbing sound came from the door. It was very faint and very soft. I heard it. It sounded like someone was rubbing a keychain against the wooden door.\n\nI wasn't holding a novel. I had nothing to be afraid of. After hearing the sound, I was no longer in a hurry to get back to bed. I walked right up to the door, put my face close to the glass, and planned to see what was going on outside, to see what the dorm supervisor was up to.\n\nBut when I pressed my face to the glass, I saw that it was empty outside. There was no one there, and no one crouching either.\n\nI pulled my head back and bent down to look at the crack under the door again. But there really was a pair of leather shoes there.\n\nWho left their leather shoes here?\n\nI opened the dorm door. Honestly, I wasn't really scared at that point, nor did I think too much about it. After opening the door, I saw there were no leather shoes outside at all.\n\nI froze for a moment, a bit baffled.\n\n\"What are you doing? Why did you open the door!\"\n\nA sharp reprimand came from a distance. I saw a dark figure walking over from the end of the hallway, pointing at me. I couldn't clearly see which dorm supervisor it was; the hallway light over there was faulty and not very bright. But I was still scared enough to immediately shut the dorm door and quickly climb onto my bunk.\n\nI didn't dare immediately wrap myself in the blanket and turn on my flashlight to read. I was afraid my earlier actions had attracted that supervisor's attention. He might start keeping a special eye on my dorm room. If he found even the slightest bit of light coming from my spot, I'd be finished.\n\nAnd I was worried he would use it as an excuse to barge into our room and scold me for poking my head out just now.\n\nI waited and waited. I waited for a long time.\n\nThis was a contest of patience.\n\nThis was a game of hunter and wolf.\n\nReally, that's not an exaggeration at all.\n\nI desperately wanted to keep reading, to immerse myself in the world of the novel, but I didn't dare. Because after I got into bed, I could faintly hear the sound of a pair of leather shoes echoing in the hallway outside, sometimes distant, sometimes near.\n\nI checked the time on my watch. It was already two-thirty in the morning.\n\nDamn it.\n\nThey're still out hunting for prey at this hour!\n\nThat sound of leather shoes bothered me for a long time. I so badly wanted to turn on my flashlight and read my novel, but I really didn't dare.\n\nFrom two-thirty to three, the sound of the leather shoes basically never stopped. It would appear every now and then. In my head, I must have cursed that dorm supervisor countless times.\n\nIf he didn't leave, I couldn't read. It was so frustrating.\n\nAt the time, I even wondered if he had just gotten a divorce and was in a bad mood, determined to find someone to scold tonight. That's why he was being so persistent at this hour.\n\nJust then, our dorm room door was opened.\n\nI jumped in fright and immediately shut my eyes, pretending I was asleep.\n\nMy novel and flashlight were already in my blanket, and I was just lying in bed not doing anything when he came in, so I wasn't scared.\n\nThe sound of leather shoes,\n\nslowly approaching;\n\n*Drip,*\n\n*drip,*\n\n*drip...*\n\nAccompanied by the sound of something dripping.\n\nAnd, I suddenly felt as if a wind was blowing over me. I was a little cold, and my body began to tremble uncontrollably.\n\nIt was probably because the dorm door was open and the balcony window wasn't shut, creating a draft.\n\nThe leather shoes walked over to my side and stopped for a moment. I kept my breathing steady and even. At that moment, I thought my acting skills were pretty good.\n\nThe leather shoes lingered by my bunk for a little while, then he silently walked away, and the door was closed.\n\nI didn't dare move.\n\nI continued to lie there.\n\nAbout two minutes later, the door opened again, and then I heard the sound of leather shoes again. The door closed again.\n\nSon of a bitch!\n\nThe first time he closed the door, he hadn't left! He was waiting for me to make a move!\n\nGood thing I was sharp!\n\nSon of a bitch!\n\nFinally, the sound of leather shoes from outside was gone.\n\nI let out a long sigh of relief.\n\nThen, I pulled the covers over my head, turned on the flashlight, and continued reading my novel.\n\nI read for about another half an hour. It was so good; I was at an exciting part.\n\n\"*Thump...*\"\n\nI heard a sound from the balcony.\n\nA little puzzled, I turned off the flashlight and poked my head out from the blanket. I wasn't afraid of sounds from the balcony; as long as it wasn't from the hallway, it was fine.\n\nI stuck my head out past the edge of the bed and looked toward the balcony. Actually, because of the moonlight, visibility on the balcony was pretty good. I thought maybe someone's clothes hanging out to dry had fallen down, but I saw no fallen clothes on the balcony floor.\n\nAnd then,\n\nmy mouth fell open in terror.\n\nI saw it.\n\nI saw a pair of leather shoes that had landed on the balcony!\n\nLeather shoes!\n\nHow could there possibly be leather shoes here?\n\nWe're on the sixth floor, the top floor. No one lives above us, so it's impossible for anything to be dropped down. And the room next door wouldn't be throwing things over at this hour, especially not a pair of leather shoes.\n\nAnd then,\n\nwhile I was still in shock,\n\na face,\n\nan upside-down face,\n\nslowly slid down from the wall above the balcony.\n\nMy body was practically frozen stiff. I could only instinctively watch as this adult man's face slowly slid down.\n\nHis eyes were narrowed,\n\nand his lips were stretched into an exaggerated smile.\n\nAnd then,\n\nhe opened his mouth,\n\nblew a puff of air toward my face,\n\nand said:\n\n\"Hey,\n\ncaught you, didn't I?\n\nReading a novel.\"\n\n***\n\n¹A slang term for masturbation.  \n²\"老硬幣\" (lǎo yìngbì), literally \"old coin,\" is slang for a cunning, patient person who lies in wait, similar to a \"camper\" in video games.",

    "content": "\"And then?\"\n\nZhou Ze asked while drinking his coffee.\n\nXu Qinglang was next to him, listening in on the story. Hmm, it was pretty interesting as a late-night tale.\n\nAs for any sense of tension or fear...\n\nForget Xu Qinglang, even the old Taoist next to them wasn't the least bit frightened.\n\nIn the old Taoist's words,\n\nwhat the hell was there to be scared of?\n\nI, your father, spend all day with a ghost and a *jiangshi*,\n\nhave I ever been scared?\n\nHave I ever chickened out?\n\nI wasn't scared, I didn't chicken out.\n\nI was just...\n\nfollowing my heart.[^1]\n\n\"What else?\" The boy paused for a moment, then smiled and said, \"And then I woke up with a start. Turns out it was all a dream, but it felt so real, hehe.\"\n\nAfter he finished, the boy yawned, then picked up the novel he had taken from the bookshelf earlier and started reading. He must have reached an interesting part, because he suddenly laughed out loud.\n\nWhat an innocent child,\n\nto think he had merely had a dream.\n\nThen why did you run to my bookstore in the middle of the night?\n\nWere you sleepwalking?\n\nXu Qinglang looked at Zhou Ze with some surprise, pointed at the boy, and then pointed at his own head.\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\nThe boy didn't know he was already dead.\n\nHe thought he was still alive, but he had already become a ghost and had long since begun to wander.\n\n\"Not going to take him in?\" Xu Qinglang asked. \"Aren't you just one short?\"\n\nXu Qinglang had just come downstairs to see Zhou Ze sitting opposite the boy, listening to his story. He didn't for a second think Zhou Ze was worried about some powerful ghost wreaking havoc at the school and was keeping the boy as a clue to go mete out justice for the heavens and save the world.\n\nHe knew that Boss Zhou had been practically dying with anticipation for that last one percent, so thirsty for it he could hardly stand it.\n\n\"Can't take him. His soul is incomplete.\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head, looking a bit helpless.\n\nXu Qinglang frowned and took a closer look at the boy, only then noticing some details. The boy's soul was incomplete—he was missing a few of his three *hun* and six *po*[^2]—which was why he was still so \"innocently naive\" as a ghost, unaware that he was already dead.\n\nEven with so many illogical things happening around him, even though he was in a bookstore in the middle of the night instead of at his school,\n\nhe didn't feel the slightest thing was wrong and still thought he was alive.\n\nTo put it simply, there was something wrong with his head now.\n\nA very high-level kind of...\n\nidiot.\n\nThe moment Zhou Ze had first seen him, he had opened the Gates of Hell.\n\nHow did you die?\n\nWhat grievances do you have?\n\nAre you hungry? Are you thirsty?\n\nHe hadn't asked any of that. He didn't have time to listen to his babbling and had planned to send him straight in to complete his own promotion. But the boy couldn't be sent in, which left Zhou Ze frustrated and speechless.\n\n\"So, what are you going to do?\" Xu Qinglang looked at Zhou Ze, reminding him, \"A ghost that can kill people, and you can just stand by indifferently?\"\n\nXu Qinglang was right. Zhou Ze really couldn't just stand by. While this wasn't some nonsense about \"with great power comes great responsibility\" like Spider-Man's foster father told him in a superhero movie, as the local Underworld Emissary, Zhou Ze did have a duty to ensure that no ghosts caused trouble in the vicinity. If they did, he had to resolve it as quickly as possible.\n\nThe Underworld Administration...\n\nsees all.\n\n\"Let's go,\" Zhou Ze nodded. \"Are you coming with me?\"\n\n\"Nope. I came down to get a face mask. I'm going back up for my beauty sleep soon.\"\n\nXu Qinglang lay languidly on the sofa, his soft, graceful figure capable of bending steel.\n\nZhou Ze was sometimes at a loss with Xu Qinglang. He was clearly perfectly normal in *that* department—enough that a woman he'd slept with as a \"duck\" had thought his skills were so good she left three thousand yuan on the nightstand—but the casual poses he struck sometimes outshone even a makeup-free Bai Yingying.\n\nBorn with seductive bones, truly.\n\nXu Qinglang was lucky to be born in the modern age. If he were in ancient times, he probably would have long since been snatched up and ravaged by the emperors and nobles with their common \"cut-sleeve\"[^3] predilections.\n\nAt that moment, the old Taoist immediately volunteered, eagerly taking the car keys from Zhou Ze's hand.\n\n\"Boss, Yingying is upstairs playing 'Winner Winner Chicken Dinner,' she's busy. This humble Taoist will accompany you. Exorcising demons and defending the righteous path is the duty of us orthodox practitioners.\"\n\nAnd so, with the old Taoist driving and Zhou Ze in the passenger seat, they set off for Pingchao Middle School.\n\nIt was actually a bit far, a half-hour drive.\n\nThe middle school was indeed huge. The school gate was a memorial archway inscribed with \"Pingchao Provincial Key Middle School,\" followed by a guardhouse. Even more exaggerated, behind that was a canal. The school was on the other side of the canal, and a bridge, belonging to the school, spanned it. On the other end of the bridge was yet another guardhouse.\n\nSo, for the students boarding here, skipping school was practically a fantasy. With two guardhouse checkpoints, they'd have to swim across the canal to reach the streets of the town outside.\n\nRelying on his silver tongue, the old Taoist bluffed the guard, saying his grandson had suffered a sudden heart attack inside and he needed to check on him. The guard didn't dare delay and immediately opened the gate. He wasn't too wary of people who clearly weren't students.\n\nThe car drove onto the campus. Zhou Ze and the old Taoist got out and walked to the residential area. It really was like an independent little town, with bathhouses, a supermarket, and several cafeterias.\n\nThe students were like chickens on an assembly line, cooped up in cages so tight they couldn't even turn around, drinking and eating on schedule before laying their eggs.\n\nBy the time they arrived, it was nearly midnight. The lights in the dormitory buildings were mostly out. Aside from the lit office of the dorm supervisor on the ground floor, the other floors were a sheet of blackness. Though they were filled with people, they gave off the eerie feeling of a ghostly domain.\n\n\"Boss, which building is haunted?\"\n\n\"He said he lives in Building B,\" Zhou Ze said, pointing to a building diagonally to their side. \"Should be this one.\"\n\n\"Which dorm room?\" the old Taoist asked.\n\n\"Sixth floor, I think. I don't know the specific room. We'll go up and just ask a random student where someone died recently.\"\n\n\"Good plan,\" the old Taoist said, offering a dose of insincere flattery.\n\nDamn it,\n\ncouldn't have asked before we left the shop.\n\nIn the dorm supervisor's office on the ground floor, several men were sitting around chatting loudly, letting out bursts of laughter from time to time as if they were telling dirty jokes.\n\nThey didn't even notice when Zhou Ze and the old Taoist walked into the hallway. The management here was certainly lax.\n\nOr perhaps...\n\nthis was a case of loose on the outside, tight on the inside?\n\nThey went up to the sixth floor. All the lights were out. The old Taoist picked a random dorm room and knocked on the door. The students inside must have thought it was the dorm supervisor, as the sounds of conversation instantly died down.\n\nThe old Taoist knocked a few more times.\n\nA student in slippers came and opened the door. He was stunned when he saw the old Taoist and Zhou Ze. Clearly, he realized these two were not the dorm supervisors.\n\n\"Police.\"\n\nThe old Taoist flashed his wallet. In the dark, it was enough to put on an act for a second before putting it away.\n\n\"Which room in here had someone die recently?\" the old Taoist asked.\n\nThe student was completely dumbfounded.\n\nWhat is going on?\n\nThe police knocking on a dorm room door at midnight asking where someone died?\n\n\"Someone died?\" the student asked, looking at the old Taoist in shock.\n\n\"That's right. I'm asking you where someone died.\"\n\n\"When did they die?\" the boy asked, bewildered.\n\n\"Don't play dumb!\" the old Taoist said, stepping forward to scold him. \"Did the school tell you to keep your mouths shut to cover it up? We're the police. Lying to us is useless. If something happens in the future, you'll be held responsible too.\"\n\nThe student was utterly terrified. He turned his head and asked his roommate on the bed behind him, \"Did someone die here?\"\n\nThe roommates started chattering among themselves, all of them completely bewildered.\n\nWhat surprised the old Taoist the most was that the students seemed genuinely baffled. It didn't look like an act; this was a high school, not some film academy.\n\n\"Sun Qiu. Which dorm is Sun Qiu in?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Sun Qiu? Oh, he's in the room across the hall.\"\n\nThe boy pointed to the door of the opposite dorm.\n\n\"Alright, that's all. Go back to sleep, and no more noise,\" the old Taoist ordered bossily.\n\nTurning around, the old Taoist went to knock on the door of the opposite dorm.\n\nSoon enough, a boy wearing glasses came and opened the door.\n\nThe old Taoist and Zhou Ze walked straight in, leaving the boy who opened the door looking dazed.\n\n\"I remember he said his bunk was the top one by the window. This is it, right?\"\n\nThe old Taoist pointed to the bunk, and to his surprise, someone was actually sleeping in it, covered with a blanket.\n\n\"What's going on? Someone's sleeping in a bed where a person just died?\" The old Taoist was taken aback.\n\n\"Who are you?\"\n\nA boy in the dorm asked.\n\n\"Is Sun Qiu in this dorm? How long has he been dead?\" the old Taoist asked.\n\n\"Sun Qiu?\" The boy paused for a moment, then called out, \"Sun Qiu, wake up. Someone's looking for you.\"\n\nWhat?\n\nThe old Taoist turned his head in shock.\n\nImmediately after,\n\nhe saw the boy on that bunk push aside the blanket, rub his eyes, and sit up. He looked at the old Taoist and Zhou Ze and asked:\n\n\"Who's looking for me?\"\n\nHe looked completely exhausted.\n\nIt wasn't a coincidence of having the same name.\n\nThat face...\n\nwas clearly the same face of the boy who had been telling a story in the bookstore an hour ago!\n\nThe old Taoist's eyes went wide.\n\nWhat was going on?\n\nWasn't he already dead?\n\nHis ghost had already floated out, so who was this person lying in the bed?\n\nAt that moment, Zhou Ze reached out and grabbed Sun Qiu's wrist. Sun Qiu frowned but didn't cry out, as if his reactions were sluggish.\n\nZhou Ze rolled up Sun Qiu's sleeve and shone his phone's flashlight on it.\n\nOn Sun Qiu's arm,\n\nwas a dense spread of livor mortis!\n\nThis was not a living person.\n\nThis was a corpse that had been dead for a long time!\n\nSeeing this, the old Taoist's jaw dropped in shock.\n\nZhou Ze calmly pulled Sun Qiu's sleeve back down. \"It's nothing. Go back to sleep, and don't make a fuss.\"\n\nWith that, Zhou Ze walked out of the dorm.\n\nThe old Taoist immediately followed him out, asking impatiently, \"Boss, what's going on? Is this guy dead or not?\"\n\n\"He's dead,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\n\"Then this...\" The old Taoist couldn't comprehend it.\n\n\"Because of inertia,\" Zhou Ze answered.\n\n\"Inertia?\"\n\n\"Yes, inertia. In this school, the students' daily lives are scheduled to death. What time they wake up, what time they go to class, what time they eat in the cafeteria, what time they return to their dorms, what time it's lights out—it's all fixed.\n\nSo, even though he's dead, the inertia from this long-term routine allows him to maintain a state of 'being alive.'\n\nBecause every day, for him, is basically cast from the same mold.\n\nIt's like a small ball rolling down a track; even after leaving the track, it will continue to roll forward due to its inertia. He's in the same state right now.\n\nDidn't you notice?\n\nHis reactions have already become very sluggish.\n\nBut his classmates and teachers around him, none of them have noticed...\n\nthat he's already dead.\"\n\n\"It's that bizarre?\"\n\n\"When I was a doctor, I encountered a few similar cases. The autopsy would show the body had been dead for days, but their colleagues or family would say they'd seen them going to work and living normally just the day before.\"\n\n\"How can that be?\" The old Taoist smacked his lips, unable to understand.\n\n\"A life that never changes, where the daily pattern of behavior is fixed, is like an automated machine.\n\nWhether the driver is alive, or dead...\n\nwhat's the difference?\"\n\n***\n\n[^1]: A pun. The character for \"coward\" (怂, sǒng) is composed of the characters for \"follow\" (从, cóng) and \"heart\" (心, xīn). The old Taoist is jokingly saying he's not a coward, he's just \"following his heart.\"\n[^2]: In Chinese folk religion and Taoism, the soul is composed of multiple parts: three ethereal souls (*hun*) and seven corporeal souls (*po*). The text incorrectly states six *po*.\n[^3]: The \"passion of the cut sleeve\" is a famous story from the Han dynasty about Emperor Ai cutting off the sleeve of his robe rather than wake his male lover, Dong Xian. The term became a euphemism for male homosexuality.",

    "content": "Death isn’t frightening. What’s truly frightening is being forgotten.\n\nSun Qiu was dead. He had been dead for a long time, but his classmates didn't know, his teachers didn't know, and even he himself didn't know. Driven by this inertia, he seemed to still be \"alive.\"\n\nHowever,\n\nThis kind of living was, in itself, a very sad and pitiful thing.\n\nImagine, your life, your existence, the trajectory of your every day—it remains completely unchanged whether your consciousness is present or not.\n\nIn that case, if you strip away the surface, how much meaning is truly left in your life, in your existence?\n\nZhou Ze remembered an incident from Hong Kong that was quite famous online, often compiled into lists of Hong Kong's top ten or eight paranormal events.\n\nThe story was about a restaurant deliveryman who, while standing outside an apartment, could hear the sound of mahjong being played inside. But when he knocked and the door was opened, he found that the four mahjong players inside had been dead for a very long time.\n\nThat was a classic example.\n\n\"Boss, he's already dead. What do we do now?\" the Old Taoist asked.\n\nIt was rare for a living person to see a ghost.\n\nBut for a dead person to see a ghost, that wasn't rare at all. It was as common as fellow countrymen meeting in a foreign land, eyes welling with tears.\n\nMoreover, Sun Qiu's death probably wasn't caused by a ghost. In the story he told, he was likely already dead, which was why he was able to witness some strange phenomena.\n\nZhou Ze frowned slightly. The trouble now was that he couldn't determine the time of Sun Qiu's death, which meant he couldn't determine whether Sun Qiu had died of natural or accidental causes, or if he had been killed by a ghost.\n\nAs for Sun Qiu's incomplete soul, there were many possible explanations for that; it didn't necessarily mean he was being controlled by a more powerful ghost.\n\n\"Let's go down and ask around. Ask those dorm supervisors.\"\n\nSince Sun Qiu was now a \"high-functioning simpleton\" and a lot of information was lost or disconnected, they could only find a breakthrough elsewhere.\n\nIn any case, what Zhou Ze needed was a ghost. If he couldn't capture Sun Qiu, then capturing the soul of that dorm supervisor would do just as well.\n\nIt had the feeling of the old saying, \"After three years in an army camp, even a sow looks as beautiful as Diaochan.\"¹\n\nThey went down the stairs and arrived at the dormitory management office on the first floor. Inside, two middle-aged men were still talking. The other supervisors from before had either gotten off work or had perhaps gone out to search for \"prey.\"\n\nThis time, Zhou Ze and the Old Taoist finally caught their attention.\n\n\"What are you two doing!\"\n\nOne of them, a man with a crew cut, pointed directly at Zhou Ze and demanded.\n\nZhou Ze took out a cigarette and stuck it between his lips. This time, he didn't let the Old Taoist do the talking, but spoke himself:\n\n\"I have a question for you. Has a dorm supervisor died here recently?\"\n\nThe moment Zhou Ze finished speaking, the expressions of the two supervisors changed instantly.\n\n\"Are you the police or something?\" the man with the crew cut asked.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head.\n\n\"A student's parent, then?\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head again.\n\n\"Then what are you asking so many questions for? This is a school. Unrelated personnel, please leave.\" The crew-cut man walked over to shove Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze reached out and grabbed the man's wrist. The nail on his little finger grew out and touched the man's skin.\n\n\"Hiss...\"\n\nThe crew-cut man dropped to his knees, his face contorted in obvious, unbearable pain.\n\nSeeing this, the other dorm supervisor didn't flinch and charged straight at them.\n\n\"This humble Taoist has come to protect the Master!\"\n\nThe Old Taoist took the initiative and rushed forward. After their shoulders collided, the Old Taoist executed a perfect shoulder throw, slamming the man to the ground. The supervisor nearly had the wind knocked out of him.\n\nThe Old Taoist actually knew some martial arts. In the bookstore, he might seem like the one with the least presence, but that was only when compared to a Ghost Emissary or a jiangshi. When compared to ordinary people, he had nothing to fear.\n\n\"Talk.\"\n\nZhou Ze dragged a chair over, sat down, and let the man kneel before him.\n\nThe crew-cut man's eyes were filled with sheer terror as he looked at Zhou Ze, but he didn't answer the question. Instead, he asked, \"Who the hell are you people? What are you trying to do... ahhh!\"\n\nZhou Ze's fingernail touched the man's skin again. At the same time, Zhou Ze pulled up the man's shirt and stuffed it into his mouth, muffling his screams.\n\n\"Go on, scream. Scream your lungs out, no one will hear you,\" the Old Taoist gloated from the side.\n\n\"I ask, you answer.\"\n\nBoss Zhou had been on edge for a long time over that final one percent of his performance quota. He really didn't want to waste any more time bullshitting with irrelevant people.\n\n\"Has a dorm supervisor died recently?\"\n\nTears and snot were streaming down the crew-cut man's face from the pain. This time, he was truly scared. He immediately nodded.\n\n\"Yes, there was one. Died in an accident last month. His name was Wang Baogang.\"\n\n\"How did he die?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"He jumped. Jumped from the building. He jumped from the dormitory roof, landed head-first, and died instantly.\"\n\n\"Oh. Did he have any particular habits? Like, did he enjoy wearing leather shoes?\"\n\nGenerally speaking, it was normal for an adult to wear leather shoes, especially in certain professional settings. But this was a school. The dorm supervisors, to put it nicely, were called teachers, but in reality, they were just able-bodied men hired by the school to serve as \"enforcers.\" They had nothing to do with being actual teachers.\n\nOf the two men in the room, one was wearing slippers, and the other was just wearing sneakers. It was actually quite strange for someone to formally wear leather shoes to do room checks in a dormitory.\n\n\"Yes, he liked wearing leather shoes, and suits too. We used to laugh at him for acting like he was a real 'people's teacher,' always showing up for his shift dressed to the nines.\"\n\n\"Where did he die?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Right in the flower bed in front of this building,\" the crew-cut man said, pointing. \"His room is on the first floor. He used to share a room with me. After his accident, I moved out and roomed with someone else.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded. \"Take me to his room.\"\n\nThey escorted the crew-cut man into a dorm room. It had the same layout as a student's room, but instead of bunk beds, there were large beds and electrical outlets.\n\n\"Did no one claim his things?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"No. He only has a sister, and she lives out of town. The school notified her when he died. She came, and the school paid compensation as a work-related injury. She didn't make a fuss. After the funeral arrangements were handled, she left. She didn't plan on taking any of his things.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded. There were still some clothes in the wardrobe. More importantly, under the nightstand, there were two pairs of leather shoes.\n\n\"These are the leather shoes he usually wore,\" the crew-cut man explained.\n\nZhou Ze crouched down in front of the shoes, picked one up, and ran a hand over the sole. There was some mud on it that hadn't completely dried.\n\nDormitories were damp, especially in the corridors.\n\nNormally, when a dorm supervisor did their rounds and inspected the rooms, the soles of their shoes would often get wet. But according to the crew-cut man, this Wang Baogang had already died last month. His shoes should have been sitting here all this time, so how could they possibly be wet?\n\n\"Why did Wang Baogang jump?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"I don't know about that,\" the crew-cut man said, shaking his head. \"He didn't seem upset about anything. Everything was normal that night. He grabbed his ring of keys and went to do his rounds.\"\n\nZhou Ze scanned his surroundings, searching.\n\nRegardless of whether Wang Baogang's soul had killed Sun Qiu, it proved one thing: Wang Baogang's soul was still wandering this dormitory building.\n\n\"You can go. You can call the police,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nThe crew-cut man froze for a moment, then backed out of the room. As for whether he would actually call the police, Zhou Ze wasn't really worried.\n\nAfter he left, only Zhou Ze remained in the room. The nails on his right hand all grew long, and a ball of black energy swirled in his palm. Then, Zhou Ze touched his fingertips to the floor tiles, and the black energy seeped into them.\n\nBefore long,\n\nStarting from the spot under the nightstand where the shoes were placed, black footprints, visible only to Zhou Ze, began to appear. The footprints led straight out of the room.\n\nZhou Ze opened the door and followed the footprints upstairs.\n\nHe went up the floors.\n\nThe footprints crisscrossed back and forth in the hallways.\n\nIn front of the students' doors, the prints were sometimes complex, sometimes faint, sometimes deep.\n\nThis meant that even in death, Wang Baogang was still carrying out his duties as a dorm supervisor.\n\nHe was still inspecting the dorms, still watching the students, still checking to see if they were asleep. Late at night, he would wander the hallways, standing in front of doors for a long, long time.\n\nHe was already dead.\n\nSo he had plenty of time.\n\nHe could devote himself even better to his work.\n\nThe students in their rooms had no idea that while they were playing cat and mouse with a living dorm supervisor, they were also facing the gaze of a ghost!\n\nSuddenly, Zhou Ze's eyes narrowed. He saw that outside a room at the very end of the corridor, the black footprints were the most dense.\n\nThis meant Wang Baogang had lingered here for a very, very long time. You could even see his conflict and hesitation in the footprints.\n\nZhou Ze walked to the door of that room. To his surprise, there was a white slip of paper on it that read \"Storage Room,\" meaning the room had been abandoned and no students lived there.\n\nZhou Ze reached for the door, but it was locked. He wedged his fingernails into the lock, applied a little pressure, and the lock popped open. He walked inside.\n\nThe beds in the room were bare, with mops, brooms, and other miscellaneous items piled underneath. Nothing seemed out of the ordinary.\n\nBut Zhou Ze knew that if Wang Baogang had hesitated here for so long, there must be something special about this place.\n\nZhou Ze sat down on a dust-covered bed frame, and the bed creaked.\n\nThe night,\n\nwas quiet.\n\nUnnaturally quiet.\n\nSlowly, Zhou Ze's vision began to blur. He shot to his feet, and the blurry feeling instantly vanished. As a Ghost Emissary, he couldn't fall asleep normally.\n\nSometimes, Zhou Ze felt this was a form of torture, but he later came to realize that being unable to sleep normally might also be a safeguard that protected Ghost Emissaries from being influenced by ghosts and specters.\n\n\"Gurgle... gurgle...\"\n\n\"Gurgle... gurgle...\"\n\nFrom below, the sound of a spring bubbling up emerged. The thick stench of blood filled the air.\n\nZhou Ze began to back away slowly. However, when he turned around, he found that the door he had come through had become a solid wall.\n\nAnd beneath the floor of this dormitory,\n\ncrimson blood began to spread.\n\nIn the distance, it was as if a sea of blood was roiling towards him. A great wave roared forth, instantly and utterly submerging the entire room.\n\n\"Gurgle... gurgle...\"\n\nZhou Ze was completely immersed in the blood. Everything around him was cast in a crimson glow, giving him the same feeling he'd had when he first walked the Yellow Springs and entered the pool.\n\nJust then, the sound of \"drip, drop, drip, drop\" came from outside the wall.\n\nIt was the sound of someone in leather shoes, slowly approaching.\n\nHe came closer and closer,\n\nthen stopped, just a single wall away from Zhou Ze.\n\nHe knocked on the wall.\n\nAnd said in a deep voice:\n\n\"Lights out. Turn off the lights!\"\n\n*Snap!*\n\nIt was as if a ball of black ink was frantically spreading through the sea of blood.\n\nThe once-crimson world instantly turned into a dark, oppressive gloom.\n\nJust like,\n\nthe lights,\n\nhad been turned out...\n\n***\n**Footnotes:**\n1.  **\"After three years in an army camp, even a sow looks as beautiful as Diaochan\"**: A coarse Chinese saying.

    "content": "It was pitch-black, so dark you couldn't see your hand in front of your face. The viscous, cloying sensation all around was so distinct that Zhou Ze found it difficult to tell whether this was an illusion or reality.\n\nThis was quite the high-class treatment, meaning that this ghost's depth and power had reached a certain realm. It was no common spirit of the sort that would wander into his bookstore on its own.\n\nZhou Ze remembered when Lady Bai had hosted him and Xu Qinglang. She had used a similar ability, making it hard to distinguish the virtual from the real. Xu Qinglang had even eaten many dishes made of flies and earthworms back then.\n\nWang Baogang probably wasn't the one behind this. He wasn't qualified. Having been dead for such a short time, it was impossible for him to have become so formidable. That meant the one who had killed Sun Qiu and left his soul incomplete was someone else entirely.\n\nZhou Ze slowly spread his arms. The swaying sensation around him gave him the illusion of walking in outer space, as if gravity had been completely sucked away.\n\nBut as Zhou Ze's fingernails extended, black smoke scattered wildly in all directions, and the thick, black blood surrounding him began to retreat rapidly, as if it had encountered its natural enemy.\n\nHaving come this far step by step, the Zhou Ze of today was no longer the greenhorn he once was.¹ Even in a situation like this, he still exuded a sense of composure and confidence.\n\n\"Clang!\"\n\nA crisp sound.\n\nA broom fell to the floor.\n\nThe bloody color vanished completely.\n\nThe dormitory room was empty.\n\nZhou Ze turned his head to look behind him. The dorm room door was open. Outside, a pair of black leather shoes sat quietly.\n\nAs if a person were standing right in front of him.\n\nA moment later,\n\nThe leather shoes moved on their own, beginning to walk—no, run—outward.\n\nZhou Ze rushed out, chasing the leather shoes down the stairs. The shoes ran faster and faster, but Zhou Ze's speed was not slow. In fact, Zhou Ze deliberately slowed his pace, waiting to see just where these shoes would lead him.\n\nHe was only one departed soul away from finalizing his promotion, but the problem was that this final one-percent quota had given him a colossally powerful entity. Zhou Ze even suspected that the one manipulating everything behind the scenes, while perhaps not equal to the Lady Bai of the past, wouldn't be far off.\n\nAfter all, the quality and resonance of the surging blood scene from just now was not much different from Lady Bai's banquet.\n\n\"Drip… drip… drip…\"\n\nThis was the sound the leather shoes made as they moved. Zhou Ze hadn't noticed it before, but now he did. Why did walking leather shoes make a \"drip drip\" sound?\n\nAs he walked, Zhou Ze suddenly discovered that after going in a circle—down one flight of stairs and up another—he had followed the shoes right back to the outside of the dorm room being used as a storeroom.\n\nThe shoes went inside, and Zhou Ze followed once more.\n\nOnly,\n\nThis time,\n\nThe room no longer looked like a storeroom, nor was it a roiling sea of blood. Everything had become quite ordinary. There were neat quilts on the beds, and washbasins and plastic cabinets under them. Over by the sink, toothbrushes and towels were tidily arranged.\n\nThis was a dorm room where students lived.\n\nZhou Ze looked at the changes around him, a smile touching his lips. He didn't know what his opponent's objective was, but it seemed they were intent on putting on such a grand performance inside this tiny snail shell of a dorm room.²\n\nZhou Ze waited for a while. This time, there was no sea of blood, no \"gurgle gurgle\" sounds. Everything seemed very peaceful, as if he had walked into an ordinary dorm room.\n\nBut anyone with half a brain could see that something was not right. Never mind why this room was empty after lights-out; why was there sunlight shining in through the window in the middle of the night?\n\n\"Scrape… scrape… scrape…\"\n\nA scraping sound came from the tiled floor—on the balcony.\n\nJust as Zhou Ze prepared to walk to the balcony to have a look, he stopped dead in his tracks, because the thing making the noise on the balcony had already crawled inside.\n\nYes,\n\nHe was crawling.\n\nIt was a boy.\n\nHis lower body was completely severed at the waist, leaving only his upper half. He used his hands to crawl continuously along the ground. His body was covered in blood and filth. In particular, the path he crawled along was left with a thick, scalp-numbing bloodstain.\n\nThe boy tilted his head, watching Zhou Ze as he crawled.\n\nHe seemed to be sizing Zhou Ze up, full of curiosity, but he didn't stop crawling toward him.\n\nZhou Ze slowly squatted down, meeting the boy's gaze.\n\n\"I…\"\n\nThe boy opened his mouth, but as he prepared to speak, fresh blood began to pour out of it, simply refusing to stop. He looked at Zhou Ze, his mouth opening and closing ceaselessly, yet unable to form any clear syllables.\n\nHe seemed to be getting anxious, but the more anxious he became, the more the sounds wouldn't come out. In the end, it even turned into a sound like a dog barking!\n\nHis half-body trembled. He was enraged.\n\nHe wanted to speak, he wanted to tell Zhou Ze something, but he couldn't!\n\nHe was utterly frenzied, his half-body rolling on the floor as he continuously pounded the tiled ground with his fists.\n\nZhou Ze reached out, dabbed his finger in the bloodstain on the floor, and then drew lightly on the tile.\n\nThe meaning was,\n\nIf you can't say it,\n\nYou can write it.\n\nThe boy paused, as if just realizing this was an option. He immediately nodded, dipped his own finger in his blood, and prepared to write on the floor.\n\nBut just as he wrote a single horizontal stroke,\n\n\"Crack!\"\n\nThe boy's index finger snapped right off.\n\nThe boy stared, stunned.\n\nZhou Ze's gaze also hardened.\n\nBut the boy was defiant. He used his ring finger to continue writing, but this time, before he could even finish a stroke, the ring finger broke off the moment it touched the tile.\n\nThe boy used his thumb; the thumb broke.\n\nThe boy used his little finger; the little finger broke.\n\nIn the end,\n\nThe boy was in despair. He raised his arm,\n\nSticking up his one and only middle finger,\n\nAnd roared ceaselessly.\n\nThis middle finger was his, but it was also a form of mockery directed at him from another existence.\n\nThe boy looked at Zhou Ze, then looked toward a cabinet on the side.\n\nIt was an iron cabinet, divided into eight compartments, meaning each of the eight people in the dorm could use one to store their things.\n\nThe boy's gaze was fixed deadly on the bottommost cabinet. Zhou Ze walked over and opened it.\n\n\"Creeaak… creeaak…\"\n\nA leg was revealed, and there was something else inside, like an article of clothing that had been folded neatly and placed there.\n\nBut in reality,\n\nIt was a person's,\n\nLower half!\n\nThe boy desperately crawled toward the cabinet, while the two legs inside kicked and squirmed restlessly, as if in response. But this entire lower half had been folded too neatly. In this narrow space, it couldn't move freely or walk out on its own. It could only kick and wriggle in frantic futility.\n\nIt was a bizarre scene, enough to make one's scalp tingle.\n\nJust as the boy was about to touch his own foot,\n\nSuddenly,\n\nAs if something from behind had caught hold of him, the boy was dragged back toward the balcony. He struggled nonstop, howling, roaring, his body tumbling over and over on the tiled floor.\n\nBut he was like a fish on a chopping block. All his struggles seemed so pale and powerless.\n\nZhou Ze stood up and started to chase after him, but just as he took a step, his perspective began to recede frantically.\n\nThe next moment,\n\nZhou Ze found himself standing at the dormitory door again.\n\nAnd the dormitory,\n\nHad returned to its original state once more.\n\nNo bloodstains, no boy, and certainly no exasperated roars.\n\nWhat on earth did this mean?\n\nZhou Ze found it hard to understand. This dorm room was like a movie theater he had walked into, one that showed late-night horror films. Every time he came in, it gave him a new experience.\n\n\"Drip… drip…\"\n\nThe familiar sound rang out again.\n\nHe turned his head.\n\nSure enough,\n\nThat pair of leather shoes had reappeared in the hallway behind the door.\n\nThis time, Zhou Ze finally understood why the shoe prints were so dense outside this room. It seemed to be repeating the same actions over and over.\n\nLeading a person away,\n\nThen bringing the person back,\n\nThen waiting here to lead the person away again,\n\nAnd then bringing them back.\n\nLike a waiter at an inn.\n\n*Welcome, sir.*\n\n*My, take care on your way out, sir.*\n\nThe leather shoes seemed to be waiting for Zhou Ze to turn and look at them before they began to leave.\n\nAgain, it was the \"drip drip\" sound. Zhou Ze walked over, but this time, he couldn't solve the puzzle in his mind. The first question was, why did this pair of leather shoes, when walking,\n\nmake a \"drip drip\" sound?\n\nShouldn't it be \"thump thump thump\"?\n\nOr a \"scrape scrape scrape\" sound?\n\nZhou Ze reached out a hand. Black mist began to release from his fingertips, directly enveloping the pair of black leather shoes.\n\nIt was like a net cast out, finally catching its fish.\n\nSlowly,\n\nThe owner of the shoes began to reveal his true form. He was still continuing to walk forward, still making that \"drip drip\" sound;\n\nWith his stubbornness,\n\nWith his persistence,\n\nHe continued to walk forward.\n\n\"Drip… drip…\"\n\nHis head,\n\nWas half-rotted,\n\nAnd upside down,\n\nHis half-crushed head struck the tiled floor again and again.\n\n\"Drip… drip…\"\n\nHe hopped continuously, and with every landing, his head collided with the ground.\n\nHis hands were thrust into the leather shoes, swinging back and forth.\n\nHe was actually walking on his head,\n\nBut he used his two hands to hold the shoes, making it look as if the shoes were the ones moving forward.\n\nShort-Haired had said that when Wang Baogang was alive, he loved to wear leather shoes and a suit whenever he did his rounds. He saw himself as a teacher, not some dorm manager or a thug.\n\nSo,\n\nEven after he died,\n\nHe would maintain his sense of decorum,\n\nEven if,\n\nIt meant wearing leather shoes on his hands to walk.\n\n\"Drip… drip…\"\n\nSun Qiu said he saw Wang Baogang's head slowly slide down the wall from the balcony.\n\nIncluding how, right now, Wang Baogang was using his head to tap his way forward,\n\nThere was a reason for that, too.\n\nBecause Short-Haired had also said that when Wang Baogang jumped from the building,\n\nIt was his head,\n\nThat hit the ground first.\n\n***\n**Footnotes:**\n¹ An idiom, *Wu Xia A Meng* (吳下阿蒙), referring to a person who was once uneducated but has since become learned and capable.\n² An idiom, *luó shī ké lǐ zuò dào chǎng* (螺獅殼裡做道場), literally \"performing a religious ritual inside a snail shell.\" It means to do something complex or grand within a very limited space.",

    "content": "\"Squeak...\"\n\nPushing open the half-closed dormitory door, the Old Daoist poked his head in:\n\n\"Boss?\"\n\nHowever, the room was empty. This was Wang Baogang's dorm. The Old Daoist had asked the flat-topped kid he'd met back at the dorm manager's office where Zhou Ze was, and the kid had told him Zhou Ze was here.\n\nBut where was he?\n\nThe Old Daoist scratched his head. The Boss wouldn't have just left without saying anything. Could he have gone upstairs?\n\nThe Old Daoist started up the stairs. In truth, this dormitory building housed a great many people. Six floors, with thirty to forty rooms on each floor, and eight students crammed into every room. Do the math—how many people must that be?\n\nBut at night, the damp, gloomy atmosphere and the nearly silent hallways still gave one a bone-chilling feeling. It had to be said, this was also a strange sort of disconnect.\n\nYou were clearly in a pile of people, yet you'd still be scared.\n\nAnd tonight, that feeling seemed even more intense.\n\nThe Old Daoist had just started up the stairs when he saw a student standing before him. The student was wearing a yellow sweater and holding something that looked like a drawing board, staring at him motionlessly.\n\n\"What are you looking at? Get back to bed!\"\n\nThe Old Daoist scolded, as if he'd been possessed by a dorm manager.\n\nThe student nodded, turned, and walked into the wall by the stairwell.\n\n\"Er...\"\n\nThe Old Daoist smacked his lips.\n\nDamn it.\n\nIs this a school or a domain of ghosts?\n\nThis dorm manager gig really isn't for humans. Are you managing students or playing some kind of ghost survival-horror game?\n\nHis hand...\n\n...reached into his crotch, fumbled around, and pulled out a yellow paper talisman. The Old Daoist held it to the tip of his nose and sniffed. The papery scent of the heirloom talisman gave him an immense sense of security.\n\nThe next moment, instead of rushing to do anything, the Old Daoist took out his phone, preparing to call his boss.\n\n*Boss, that ghost you were looking so hard for, I found it!*\n\nHowever, after dialing, the phone showed no signal.\n\n*Dammit, this is bad.*\n\nThe Old Daoist slowly backed away, then prepared to shout. At a time like this, he couldn't worry about waking the \"flowers of the motherland,\"¹ nor could he care about his own pride or anything like that. With Zhou Ze not around, the Old Daoist felt very insecure.\n\nBut just as the Old Daoist opened his mouth to yell, before any sound could come out, he felt as if something was stuck in his throat. He couldn't shout at all and nearly choked.\n\nNow, beads of sweat began to pop up densely on the Old Daoist's forehead. He knew the ghost had its sights on him.\n\nCrap.\n\nWhat's so great about bullying a Bronze-rank? If you've got the guts, go after a King-rank!²\n\nIn his mind, the Old Daoist cordially greeted the eighteen generations of female ancestors of this ghost that bullied the weak and feared the strong, then unhesitatingly turned to go back down the stairs.\n\nCan't afford to provoke, can't afford to provoke.\n\nBut I can afford to hide!\n\nWho would have known that as soon as the Old Daoist started down the stairs, the steps beneath his feet suddenly became distorted, uneven in height. The Old Daoist's foot slipped, and he fell straight down. Fortunately, he was agile; any other old man taking a fall like that could have started preparing for his funeral.\n\nBut even so, the Old Daoist was still left black and blue.\n\nWhen he struggled to his feet, he saw the boy in the yellow sweater holding the drawing board was still standing in front of him.\n\nHe was looking at him.\n\nAt the same time,\n\nthe fountain pen in his hand seemed to be drawing something on the board.\n\nEven a cornered rabbit will bite. The Old Daoist charged forward, raising the talisman in his hand. If it came down to it, the fish would die and the net would break!\n\nHowever, where before he couldn't go down the stairs, now he couldn't go up. The Old Daoist ran endlessly on the stairs, yet always remained about two meters away from the boy, unable to get any closer.\n\nThe Old Daoist decided to just take flight, leaping into the air and flinging the paper talisman.\n\nThe boy raised his head,\n\nhis eyes completely empty. He lifted his hand, and the fountain pen suddenly jabbed out, becoming a heavy, dark stroke of ink that instantly dyed the bright yellow talisman black.\n\nSeeing this, despair welled up in the Old Daoist's heart. His own heirloom talisman had been neutralized so effortlessly by this ghost.\n\nIt's over.\n\nIt's over!\n\nThe Old Daoist, who had leaped up, fell heavily back onto the stairs, his whole body tumbling down with a series of *thumps*.\n\nThe boy slowly walked down.\n\nThe Old Daoist struggled to raise his head, watching him get closer and closer.\n\nAnd just then, the most pleasant, most wonderful, and, for the Old Daoist at this moment, the most tear-jerking voice in the world sounded out,\n\n\"Oh, so you're here.\"\n\nBoss Zhou's voice arrived.\n\nThe Old Daoist's heart, which had been like dead ashes, was instantly filled with hope!\n\nThe boy turned to the side and saw Zhou Ze behind him. He frowned slightly, as if a little helpless, and also as if he had a headache.\n\nImmediately after, the boy started walking toward the wall, intending to hide himself again. He seemed to have little interest in fighting Zhou Ze, and he was well aware of how much of a handful this man, who had walked into the dormitory for the first time today, was.\n\nBut how could Zhou Ze let him get away so easily? His fingernails dug directly into the wall. Zhou Ze leaned back, then with a sudden exertion of his arms, yanked backward with all his might!\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nThe boy was dragged out and fell onto the stairs, dropping his drawing board and fountain pen on the ground.\n\n\"Humm!\"\n\nThe boy's previously empty eyes now showed a dark red glint. He was angry. He was furious. Before this, he felt he had given Zhou Ze a lot of face, but Zhou Ze was being a bit shameless after being shown respect.\n\n\"Sssshhh...\"\n\nA scene that astonished Zhou Ze appeared. Before his very eyes, the sound of paper tearing rang out. Immediately after, Zhou Ze saw the sleeve on his arm rip open, followed by his flesh splitting apart, with blood flowing out unceasingly.\n\nZhou Ze began to back away. After retreating a certain distance, the injury from a moment ago vanished, and even his previously wounded arm was restored to its original state.\n\nWhat on earth was going on?\n\nThe Old Daoist took advantage of the struggle between Zhou Ze and the ghost to scramble up and prepare to flee, but the boy seemed to have his eyes fixed only on him, appearing before him in an instant.\n\n\"%...¥¥##@@...!\"\n\n*Bullying an honest man!*\n\nThe Old Daoist cursed inwardly.\n\n\"Pffft...\"\n\nA fountain pen...\n\n...plunged directly into the Old Daoist's chest. The Old Daoist looked down in shock. He saw the wound on his chest expanding continuously. Crimson blood began to spread, dyeing his entire set of Daoist robes red at a dumbfounding speed!\n\n\"Thud...\"\n\nThe Old Daoist fell to his knees, clutching the wound with both hands, staring at the blood that continuously pooled on the floor.\n\nIt felt unreal, completely unreal. Although he knew there were risks in coming out with the Boss to catch ghosts, he had never expected to die here!\n\nHimself...\n\n...dead, just like that?\n\nDead in this dormitory building?\n\nZhou Ze was already rushing over. The boy glanced at Zhou Ze, seemingly not intending to attack again, or perhaps having some reservations, and once more slipped into a nearby wall.\n\nJust as Zhou Ze was about to give chase and drag the boy out again in the same manner,\n\nhe felt a pair of hands grab his pant leg.\n\nHe looked down.\n\nAnd saw,\n\nit was the Old Daoist.\n\nThe Old Daoist's blood-soaked hands were clutching Zhou Ze's pant leg,\n\nand he was wiping his snot and tears all over it.\n\nZhou Ze took a deep breath,\n\nfighting the urge to slap this old codger to death first!\n\nTo someone with mysophobia, the Old Daoist's current actions,\n\nwere like running around the streets with a manure basket on his back—\n\ncourting shit (death).³\n\n\"Boss, I'm not gonna make it, I'm not gonna make it! Don't chase him yet! Let me say my last words first, then you can chase him! I'm afraid I won't get another chance!\"\n\nAt this point, the Old Daoist couldn't care less whether Zhou Ze was going to catch the ghost. He knew he didn't have much time left. He was afraid that by the time Zhou Ze came back from catching the ghost, he'd already be cold. To not even have the chance to deliver his last will and testament would be a huge, huge loss.\n\n\"Boss, under the bed in my room at the bookstore, there's a small box. Inside is a case of heirloom paper talismans, and in a hidden compartment, there are three bank cards. The PIN is the last six digits of my phone number. It's not much money, just about a million or so...\"\n\n\"....\" Zhou Ze.\n\nThe Old Daoist suddenly trembled. He sensed a murderous intent, and it seemed to be coming from his boss.\n\nThe Old Daoist's heart immediately warmed.\n\n*Sigh.*\n\n*Don't be fooled by the Boss's usual ruthless and indifferent demeanor. Seeing his good gaybro, good brother, good friend, good partner, his soulmate, about to pass on,*\n\n*he's gotten angry too.*\n\n*He probably wishes he could kill that ghost right now to avenge me.*\n\n*Sigh.*\n\n*As distance tests a horse's strength, time reveals a person's heart.*\n\nThe Old Daoist sighed with emotion in his heart.\n\nWhat he didn't know was that when Zhou Ze heard him say \"it's not much money, just about a million or so,\"\n\na thought had crossed his mind: should he just go with the flow, kill this Old Daoist, and seize his assets?\n\nIf the Old Daoist knew the truth, he probably would have coughed up a mouthful of old blood from sheer anger and died on the spot.\n\n\"The paper talismans… just burn them in front of my grave. You can keep a couple for yourself.\n\nBoss, after I die, please help me donate the money to children in mountainous regions. You can keep a couple of the cards for yourself, but not too many, mind you.\n\nAlso, after I die, help me inform Mr. Liang in Shanghai, so he can come to my memorial service too. It was fate that brought us together, after all.\n\nOf course,\n\nBoss, if you and Mr. Liang really can't bear to part with me, you can storm into Hell together and rescue this humble Daoist's soul. I wouldn't mind!\n\nEven if I can't enter the cycle of reincarnation, this humble Daoist is willing to make the sacrifice and return to the world of the living to keep you company!\n\nThrough wind and rain, this humble Daoist will wait for you!\"\n\nZhou Ze really couldn't listen to any more of this.\n\n*Storm into Hell?*\n\n*For you?*\n\n\"Boss, this humble Daoist can't bear to leave you! Even though you have a really bad temper, are very selfish, and are a jinx,⁴ and can't make any money, I never had the heart to ask you for a salary.\"\n\n\"....\" Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Even though you're a lecher, always deadpan while having Yingying serve you in the bath. And I heard from Beauty Xu that you have… problems in that department. Can't get it hard...\"\n\n\"....\" Zhou Ze.\n\n*Why aren't you dead yet?*\n\n*How about I give you a hand?*\n\n*Just die already.*\n\n*Otherwise, I really won't be able to stop myself from killing you.*\n\nA mess of snot and tears, the Old Daoist continued, \"But you're actually not a bad person. Even though you have a lot of flaws, you still have your good points, like… er… like...\"\n\nThe Old Daoist reached up and scratched his head.\n\n*So hard.*\n\n*Like what?*\n\nJust then, the Old Daoist lost his balance and fell over, happening to roll out of the spot where he had been kneeling. In that instant, the Old Daoist discovered that all his injuries had vanished. He was completely fine!\n\n*I don't have to die?*\n\n\"Boss, I'm okay! I don't have to die!\" the Old Daoist exclaimed, ecstatic and forgetting himself.\n\nThen he saw Zhou Ze extend his fingernails toward him.\n\n\"What did you just say? I didn't hear you clearly. Say it again.\"\n\n***\n\n**Footnotes:**\n\n¹ \"Flowers of the motherland\" (祖國花朵) is a common, somewhat patriotic and poetic term for the nation's children and youth.\n\n² \"Bronze-rank\" (青銅) and \"King-rank\" (亡者) are terms from video games denoting low and high skill tiers, respectively.

Except for the lingering bruises on his face, but that was from when he fell on his own.\n\nZhou Ze reached down and picked up the fountain pen that had fallen on the floor.

In fact, he could have completely wiped the floor with me.\"\n\n\"Painted on?\"\n\n\"Yes, painted on. It's like a more advanced form of hypnosis, deceiving your senses of sight, hearing, smell, and so on, and making them change according to his design.\"\n\nZhou Ze looked at his own arm. A clear wound had appeared there earlier, but now there wasn't the slightest trace of it. Yet the realistic quality of the image was enough to make someone subconsciously believe it was all real, at least for a short time.\n\n\"Damn it, so he's one of us—just the tricks of a common swindler.\"\n\nIn that instant, the old Taoist's manly confidence returned.\n\nThe Great Leader said it himself: All reactionaries are paper tigers!\n\n\"Boss, let's go drag him out right now, shall we?\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head and pointed out the corridor window. \"The sky's about to brighten. He's already gone into hiding.\"\n\nIn truth, the appearance of ghosts doesn't have much to do with whether it's day or night. At least for the ghost itself, it makes no fundamental difference. Rather, the one it affects is the human.\n\nDuring the day, everything is out in the open. Even if something strange happens, an ordinary person can muster a bit of courage, or at least find some psychological comfort.\n\nBut at night, people are easily frightened by whatever happens, giving the ghost an opportunity to strike.\n\nOf course, that ghost was a bit special. He was skilled at painting, but even the best painting and image quality needs a supportive environment. The daytime wasn't his preferred background for painting because it would amplify the flaws in his work, whereas at night, his paintings could achieve a greater sense of realism.\n\n\"So, what's next... breakfast?\"\n\nZhou Ze walked to the other end of the hallway, and the old Taoist naturally followed. Then, the old Taoist watched as Zhou Ze entered a dorm room with a sign that read \"Storage Room.\"\n\nInside the room, aside from a pile of junk, there was also a pair of black leather shoes.\n\nZhou Ze sat down on a wooden plank, looking as if he were contemplating something.\n\n\"Boss?\"\n\nZhou Ze raised a hand, signaling for the old Taoist to be quiet.\n\nThe old Taoist nodded and sat down on the opposite bunk. He wasn't worried about his bruises. Having roamed far and wide for so many years, he'd suffered countless hardships and superficial injuries. This was child's play.\n\nAbout a quarter of an hour later, Zhou Ze bent down and started searching under the bed.\n\nThe old Taoist also bent down and began rummaging around with him. He didn't know what his boss was looking for, but it didn't matter. The right thing to do was to look!\n\nAfter all, most bosses don't look at your progress, but your attitude.\n\nThere was just some junk under the bed. After pulling it out, the space underneath was empty, which made sense since no one lived in this dorm room anymore.\n\nZhou Ze opened the wardrobe. All eight lockers were opened, but there was nothing inside except a thin layer of dust.\n\nThe old Taoist scratched his head and simply climbed onto the top bunk. On the wall by the top bunk were several posters, all of soccer stars like C-Ronaldo, Ramos, and the like.\n\nZhou Ze also went to the top bunk. He felt there had to be something here, otherwise Wang Baogang's ghost wouldn't have lingered in this place. Besides, he had seen other strange scenes in this very dorm.\n\nIf he wasn't mistaken, this dorm room was likely the key to this whole series of events.\n\n\"Boss, what's that painting hanging as a poster over on your side? It looks kind of weird,\" the old Taoist said, pointing toward Zhou Ze.\n\n\"A Picasso,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\nThen, as if he'd discovered something, Zhou Ze reached out and felt the poster.\n\nFrom the old Taoist's perspective, his boss was actually reaching out to touch the chest of the woman in the painting. The old Taoist immediately blurted out:\n\n\"Boss, go home and grope Yingying's. The woman in this painting is too ugly...\"\n\nThe old Taoist hadn't even finished speaking,\n\nwhen there was a *ssshhhlick* sound.\n\nZhou Ze ripped the painting straight off the wall. Several sheets of paper fell out from between the painting and the wall.\n\nZhou Ze had no time to deal with the old Taoist's nonsense. He directly picked up one of the sheets. It was a fountain pen drawing, the workmanship meticulous. It depicted a dorm room, but the room was filled with a strange liquid.\n\nIt could be taken as water, or it could be taken as... blood.\n\nThe next drawing showed a balcony, where a boy with only the upper half of his body was struggling to crawl inside. And from a locker in the dorm room, two legs were sticking out.\n\nNext was the third. In it, a man was standing upside down on the tiled floor, his head on the ground, with leather shoes on his hands.\n\nThree drawings, representing three scenes. And Zhou Ze had just witnessed all three of them.\n\nOne was the dorm room filled with blood, one was the boy with half a body, and the other was Wang Baogang walking upside down.\n\nBelow them were three more drawings, for a total of six.\n\nHe picked up another one. This drawing showed a skeleton holding a book, walking among students and teachers. If he wasn't mistaken, it was supposed to be a drawing of Sun Qiu.\n\nNext was the fifth. Upon seeing the scene in this drawing, Zhou Ze immediately turned to look at the old Taoist. The old Taoist had just climbed down from the opposite top bunk and was now climbing up to Zhou Ze's, apparently also very interested in what he had found.\n\n\"What's it a drawing of? I can't see clearly,\" the old Taoist asked.\n\nZhou Ze handed the drawing to him. The old Taoist grabbed the ladder with one hand and took the drawing with the other. He froze for a moment, then fell right off. Luckily, it wasn't a high fall, so he wasn't hurt, but he looked completely crestfallen.\n\nThe drawing fell to the floor. In it, an old man in a Taoist robe lay on the ground, his head separated from his body. Nearby, a black cat seemed to be gnawing on his corpse.\n\nZhou Ze turned over the last drawing.\n\nTo his surprise, the person in the final drawing wasn't him, but the man with the flat-top haircut. A sharp object was stuck in the flat-top's forehead, and he was standing ramrod straight. The two moles on the flat-top's face made it easy to match him to the figure in the drawing.\n\nAfter looking through all the drawings, Zhou Ze glanced at the crestfallen old Taoist below and suddenly felt a sense of disappointment.\n\nWhy was there a drawing of the old Taoist, but not one of him?\n\nHmm,\n\nIt felt like being the designated lead actor in a movie, only to have some background extra completely steal the show.\n\nThe old Taoist immediately scrambled back up, took the other drawings from Zhou Ze's hand, and looked through all of them. Then, he asked Zhou Ze, trembling:\n\n\"Boss, the drawings are fake, right? They're fake?\"\n\nZhou Ze got off the bed, went over to the sink to wash his hands, and said, \"The only ones I haven't seen are your drawing and the one of the flat-top. I've already seen the other four.\"\n\n\"How is that possible? This isn't some Mayan prophecy. This humble Taoist is still alive, and that flat-top dorm manager is still alive too.\"\n\n\"Are you trying to say that a few years ago, there was a middle school student in this dorm with good drawing skills who started admiring you ahead of time?\" Zhou Ze retorted.\n\n\"This is just the ghost's smoke and mirrors! A deliberate attempt to confuse us and disrupt our morale!\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't say anything more. He gestured for the old Taoist to collect all six drawings, then walked out onto the balcony.\n\nThe sky was brightening, the first light of dawn faintly visible. People always like to see the dawn as a symbol of hope, but sometimes, it's more like the oppressive calm before the darkness arrives.\n\nWith a pained expression, the old Taoist also walked to the edge of the balcony, took out his cigarettes, offered one to Zhou Ze, and lit one for himself. He sighed and said:\n\n\"Boss, these are all fake, right?\"\n\nThe old Taoist had already asked this question before.\n\n\"I don't know.\" Zhou Ze shook his head. Then, leaning against the edge of the balcony, he continued, \"Ever since we entered this dormitory, have you noticed how damp everything is here? And that there's a kind of dank, earthy smell?\"\n\n\"It's a dormitory, they're all like this,\" the old Taoist said, blowing a smoke ring.\n\nZhou Ze reached up and rubbed the bridge of his nose. Just then, a bell rang throughout the dormitory, signaling that it was time for the students to get up for morning self-study.\n\nSome of the more diligent students were already walking out of the ground floor exit as the bell rang. They were wearing red school uniforms.\n\nBut the students in the other buildings around them were wearing blue school uniforms.\n\n\"The uniform colors are different.\"\n\nZhou Ze pointed down below. He didn't want to let any detail slip by now. The reason was simple: since entering this dormitory, the string of events that had occurred one after another had left Zhou Ze feeling completely clueless.\n\n\"Probably because the middle school and high school students have different uniforms. This is a middle school dorm. Those two buildings outside seem to be for the high school. This school has both a middle school and a high school division.\"\n\nAs the old Taoist spoke, he took out that drawing again to have another look. The more he looked, the more unsettling it felt. He even started to wonder why the person in the drawing who died so miserably was him and not Zhou Ze.\n\nSince when did I have this much of a presence?\n\n\"Look, your flat-top is out.\"\n\nZhou Ze pointed downward. The flat-top dorm manager had walked outside the exit, holding a phone as if making a call.\n\n\"Didn't they call the police?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Guess not?\" the old Taoist said, puzzled.\n\nTo be honest, for Zhou Ze and the old Taoist, causing a little trouble wasn't a big deal; burning some paper money would usually take care of it. The key thing was, even if the flat-top and his fellow dorm managers didn't call the police, it was strange for them to act as if nothing had happened at all.\n\nBefore, they were so focused on catching the ghost that they'd overlooked this point. But now that things had quieted down, they began to sense that something was off.\n\nNo, to be precise, ever since they had stepped into this dormitory, very few things had felt right.\n\n\"See, he's still alive too.\"\n\nThe old Taoist pointed at the flat-top standing below.\n\nThat feeling,\n\nwas truly,\n\nhe's okay,\n\nso I'm okay.\n\n*CRACK!*\n\nA sound of shattering glass suddenly came from the rooftop. The old Taoist only felt a rush of wind slice past his face, and then he heard a commotion and screams from below.\n\nThe flat-top standing below had been hit by the glass.\n\nThat shard of glass,\n\nhad plunged directly into his forehead,\n\nsticking straight out.",

    "content": "The bookstore was quiet in the early morning. Of course, with its outrageous one-hundred-yuan minimum spending sign, the bookstore was destined to never be very lively.\n\nUpstairs in his bedroom, Xu Qinglang was fast asleep with a face mask on, getting his beauty sleep. After saying goodbye to the restaurant life and escaping the greasy fumes that eroded his skin, he had begun to appreciate and care for his complexion more and more.\n\nHeh, men.\n\nYou have to learn to treat yourself better, to love yourself a little more.\n\nBai Yingying sat alone at the first-floor bar, completely engrossed in a battle royale game on her phone.\n\nJust then, the bookstore door was pushed open. Bai Yingying looked up and saw a little loli in a red dress standing at the entrance. The little loli's outfit was truly festive, which made her look all the more endearingly cute.\n\nYawning, Bai Yingying went back to looking at her phone.\n\nThe little loli walked up to the bar. She was a bit too short to see over it, so she simply pushed open the small counter gate, walked inside, and stood behind Bai Yingying, watching her play her game.\n\nWhen the round ended, Bai Yingying stretched, glanced at the little loli, put down her phone, and asked:\n\n\"What do you want?\"\n\nThe little loli lifted her delicate chin, sizing up Bai Yingying. She shook her head and smiled faintly.\n\n\"Back in the day, even your Madam wouldn't have dared to speak to me in that tone.\"\n\n\"You said it yourself—that was back in the day.\" Bai Yingying shrugged. \"What's the difference between you and me now?\"\n\nWe're both dogs on a leash, tied to the same man.\n\nWhy should the pot call the kettle black?\n\nThe little loli sat down on a nearby chair, which gave her a special sense of satisfaction. She had always been sensitive about her height and disliked standing below, looking up at people taller than her.\n\n\"You think you can compare to me?\" the little loli retorted.\n\n\"Hah, well, I can go *ying ying ying*. What can you do? *Ying ying ying...*\"\n\nThe little loli frowned slightly. She didn't know how to respond to that.\n\nShe was a two-hundred-year-old jiangshi¹, for crying out loud, yet she could actually serve that man with a seamless \"ying ying ying.\"\n\n\"What are you doing here?\" Bai Yingying asked. \"Did your mom go out to 'get her hair done'² in the middle of the night again and dump you at the bookstore?\"\n\nThe little loli took an envelope from her pocket and tossed it onto the bar. \"The things he had me investigate are all in here. The location of that Japanese priest has been confirmed.\"\n\n\"Why didn't you just call him directly?\" Bai Yingying tilted her head. \"Oh, I get it. You thought delivering it in person would seem more sincere, that you could score some brownie points with him?\"\n\nA sense of crisis then appeared on Bai Yingying's face.\n\n\"Are you... trying to vie for his favor... with me?\"\n\n*Smack!*\n\nThe little loli slammed her palm on the bar.\n\nShe berated Bai Yingying, \"Don't you dare think I'm the same as you!\"\n\nBai Yingying pouted and muttered, \"Little brats are so concerned with saving face.\"\n\nThe little loli suppressed the urge to get physical with Bai Yingying and said, \"I couldn't reach his phone. I couldn't get in touch with him. I thought he was at the bookstore, but it turns out he's not here.\"\n\n\"He went out for something,\" Bai Yingying said.\n\n\"He's certainly a busy man.\"\n\n\"He's about to finish his probation,\" Bai Yingying said with a smile. It was clear she was genuinely happy for Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Why are you happy about him finishing his probation?\" The little loli couldn't stand Bai Yingying's \"ugly sycophancy\"—being enslaved and controlled, yet enjoying it.\n\nBecause she didn't want to become like this stupid jiangshi in front of her.\n\n\"Why shouldn't I be? He's my boss. The better he does, the more it reflects well on me, right? Besides, the sooner he finishes his probation and gets promoted, the sooner you can be free, can't you?\"\n\n\"How well he does has nothing to do with you. You should be thinking about how you're going to spend the next Cold Clothes Festival³!\"\n\nThe little loli really couldn't take Bai Yingying's naive and sweet act anymore.\n\nAny trace of that fake, beautiful, and pure facade…\n\n…had to be pierced with a silver needle.\n\nPoke, poke, poke!\n\nThe little loli and Madam Bai knew each other. Due to Madam Bai's special circumstances, the little loli had never acted against her. They both kept to themselves.\n\nYou cultivate your merits, I'll work on my performance points. We'll leave each other in peace.\n\nHowever, the little loli knew exactly what kind of person Madam Bai was. She could even guess Madam Bai's purpose in handing over her own corpse to Zhou Ze before descending to Hell upon the completion of her merits.\n\n\"How will I spend it? I've already designed it, of course.\"\n\nWith that, Bai Yingying opened her computer, clicked on a folder, and said:\n\n\"I spent a long time designing them. I even made several models.\"\n\nThe little loli looked at the computer screen and saw images of bamboo beds: bamboo beds in the style of mandarin ducks and butterflies, bamboo beds shaped like little boats, and even a princess bed, all adorned with various ornaments.\n\nThe little loli was stunned.\n\nShe…\n\n…she knew all along?\n\n\"These bamboo beds won't be cheap to make, but luckily I still have enough burial goods. I can sell a couple of things to have one built. Don't you think,\" Bai Yingying mused, \"it would be rather beautiful, being burned to death lying on one of these?\"\n\nThe little loli covered her face with her hand. She didn't know how to talk to this jiangshi anymore.\n\nThis wasn't just stupidity.\n\nHer brain must have a lump on it!\n\n\"You know that day is coming, and you're still here acting as his maid?\" was the only thing the little loli could ask.\n\n\"I quite like my life right now,\" Bai Yingying said, as if it were the most natural thing in the world. \"It's nice.\"\n\n\"You think you can move him this way?\" the little loli retorted.\n\nBai Yingying didn't answer.\n\n\"Last time, a mere Corpse Ghoul earned him a huge amount of performance points. Do you have any idea how many points a genuine, two-hundred-year-old jiangshi is worth?\"\n\nBai Yingying still said nothing.\n\n\"Forget it.\" The little loli didn't want to say any more. She glanced at the envelope she had just tossed on the bar and asked, \"Where did he go?\"\n\n\"I think he went to some school,\" Bai Yingying said. \"He's just one ghost short, so the boss is anxious.\"\n\n\"A school?\" The little loli turned slightly, thinking nothing of it. \"I'm leaving. Give him the envelope when he gets back.\"\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\nBai Yingying nodded to show she understood.\n\nThe little loli got off the chair and prepared to leave. But as she reached the door, she inadvertently glanced at a young man sitting in the corner of the bookstore, reading a book.\n\nThe young man was holding a book, completely engrossed, occasionally letting out a pig-like snort of laughter.\n\nThe little loli stopped in her tracks.\n\nWhen she came in…\n\n…why hadn't she sensed that there was another ghost in the bookstore?\n\nThis ghost…\n\n…she had seen it,\n\n…not sensed it.\n\nThe little loli raised her hand, pointed at the young man, and asked Bai Yingying, \"Who is he?\"\n\n\"A ghost. According to the boss, he's an 'advanced moron' who walked into the bookstore on his own. Because his soul is incomplete, he can't be sent to Hell, so we're keeping him for now. Once the boss solves his own business, he'll send him on his way.\"\n\n\"Incomplete soul?\"\n\nThe little loli walked toward the reading young man. The boy paid her no mind, completely immersed in the world of the novel.\n\n\"What's his name?\" the little loli asked.\n\n\"Sun Qiu. He's a middle school student.\"\n\nThe little loli reached out and took the book from his hands.\n\nSun Qiu was taken aback and said with some annoyance, \"What are you doing, little sister? Don't be naughty.\"\n\nHe reached out to take the book back.\n\nHowever,\n\nin the next moment,\n\nthe little loli's tongue suddenly shot out, lashing viciously at Sun Qiu's soul like a whip.\n\n*Whack!*\n\nSun Qiu was knocked to the ground, crying out in pain.\n\nTo a spiritual body, the little loli's tongue technique was absolutely terrifying.\n\nSeeing this, Bai Yingying immediately came out from behind the bar. \"Hey, what are you doing? That's the boss's reserved performance points!\"\n\n\"Performance points?\" The little loli sounded perplexed, almost amused. She pointed at Sun Qiu on the floor and said, \"Is everyone in this bookstore a fool?\n\nThis isn't a soul! This isn't a ghost!\"\n\nZhou Ze hadn't been in the Ghost Messenger circle for a short time, but of course, he couldn't compare to the little loli. She was a veteran Ghost Messenger and had naturally experienced much more.\n\n\"He's not a ghost?\" Bai Yingying was stunned. If he wasn't a ghost, what was he?\n\n\"So, the reason he can't be sent to Hell isn't because his soul is incomplete, but because he's not a ghost at all. Of course he can't be sent down through the Gates of Hell.\"\n\nThe little loli walked up to Sun Qiu, her tongue lashing him again and again as he screamed in agony.\n\n\"See? His soul is only weakening, but there are no signs of it dispersing. He's fundamentally a phantom energy construct, not a spiritual body.\"\n\nThe little loli spoke with absolute certainty.\n\n\"He's not a ghost, but he came to the bookstore on purpose…\" Bai Yingying immediately realized something, and her expression changed drastically.\n\nA creature that wasn't a ghost came to the bookstore and told a ghost story?\n\nAnd then the boss took the old Daoist priest to the school?\n\n\"Has anyone else come to Tongcheng recently?\" the little loli asked.\n\n\"The one from Rongcheng paid a visit.\"\n\nHearing this, an unconcealable look of terror flashed across the little loli's face, but she quickly suppressed it. \"Anyone else?\" she asked.\n\nBai Yingying thought for a moment. Then she suddenly remembered the little girl who said she was from Sanxiang Village, the one who had managed to knock her down and tie her up.\n\n\"I think there was one more. She was very strong, the kind who could take me down in an instant. Right, you still haven't said, how did this thing come to be?\"\n\nBai Yingying pointed at Sun Qiu and asked.\n\n\"When every Inspector advances to the rank of Judge, they are bestowed a Yin-Yang Brush by the Underworld, which can settle the universe and distinguish right from wrong. They also receive a Yin-Yang Book, which contains the forces of yin and yang within its pages.\n\nThis thing… was probably born from a Yin-Yang Book… a puppet.\"\n\nAfter saying this,\n\nthe little loli suddenly threw her head back and laughed loudly.\n\n\"Hahahahahaha…\"\n\nA little loli,\n\nwith her hands on her tiny waist,\n\nroaring with laughter.\n\nShe seemed to be trying to create a heroic, bold impression, but in reality, the gesture was as goofy as it gets—so chuunibyou⁴ and cute it was almost unbearable.\n\n\"So you're saying the boss is in danger?\" Bai Yingying said.\n\nThe little loli shrugged, then looked at Bai Yingying. \"Shouldn't we be happy? If someone schemes him to death, then you and I will both be free.\"\n\nThat was right.\n\nIf Zhou Ze was tricked and killed,\n\nthe little loli would be released from the pact made under duress that night and regain her freedom!\n\n\"Have you forgotten what kind of person the boss is?\" Bai Yingying suddenly asked.\n\n\"What?\" The little loli was confused.\n\n\"If the boss knows he can't escape and is really going to die… knowing his personality, he'd probably think dying alone is too lonely. In his final moments, he would crush your soul-blood and make you die with him.\"\n\n\"...\" said the little loli.\n\n---\n**Footnotes:**\n1.  **Jiangshi (殭屍):** A type of \"hopping vampire\" or zombie from Chinese folklore.

    "content": "With shards of glass sticking out of his head like a headdress, the guy with the buzz cut stood there as fresh blood began to slowly soak down.\n\nHe stood for a good few seconds, even swayed as he took several steps, and then, amidst the screams of the people around him, he collapsed.\n\nZhou Ze had read some memoirs from Japanese war criminals, in which soldiers had written that after a beheading, the headless corpse would still seem to twitch, and even the eyes on the head that had fallen to the ground could still move a few times.\n\nPerhaps death had come too suddenly, too cleanly. Not only had the person involved not had time to react, but even his body seemed unable to respond in time.\n\nBelow the dormitory building, chaos had erupted.\n\nZhou Ze placed both hands on the railing, let out a sigh, and then looked at Lao Dao.\n\nLao Dao was beside himself, his face pale with fright.\n\n\"Boss...\"\n\n\"Sigh. See? A perfectly fine person, and you just had to go and jinx him to death.\"¹\n\n\"...\" said Lao Dao.\n\nLao Dao felt wronged. He didn't want this either. He had sincerely wished that Buzz Cut would live to be a hundred, be fit as a fiddle, and be able to go at it eighteen times a night.\n\nBut he was dead.\n\nDead just like that, so abruptly.\n\nAnd so,\n\nOf the six drawings, only one remained.\n\nThere's a famous movie series called *Final Destination*. Lao Dao now felt like he had become one of its characters, being told in no uncertain terms, \"You're going to die,\" and even being told how you would die.\n\nHonestly, it would be better to be struck down suddenly, to die a clean, painless death.\n\nAt this moment, Lao Dao actually envied the guy with the buzz cut. He was gone in an unexpected accident, without even knowing it, while he now had to endure the torment of not knowing when he would die.\n\nIt was simply... a life worse than death.\n\nHe glanced at his boss, who was actually still smoking.\n\n\"Let's go down and take a look.\"\n\nAfter saying this, Zhou Ze was the first to leave the dorm room. Lao Dao, of course, didn't dare to leave Zhou Ze's side. He had already made up his mind: even if Zhou Ze went to the bathroom, he would stick to him like glue.\n\nAt the main entrance on the first floor of the dormitory, a group of students had gathered around Buzz Cut's body, with a few dorm supervisors maintaining order inside the circle.\n\nThe feeling was very strange because the proper response would have been to call for an ambulance and the police. In fact, they had, and they'd done everything they were supposed to. However, it seemed the major event of a person dying in broad daylight had only disturbed this one small corner of the school.\n\nThe students farther away went on their way to class or to the cafeteria for breakfast, as if they didn't care about this at all.\n\nZhou Ze flicked the ash from his cigarette and looked up at the dormitory building.\n\nLao Dao stood beside him, trembling. He would steal a glance at Buzz Cut's body and then immediately look away. The thought that he would soon follow in the man's footsteps was absolute torture.\n\nZhou Ze sat down on the steps like a bystander and continued to observe his surroundings.\n\n\"Boss, shouldn't we head back first?\" Lao Dao suggested.\n\nHe didn't want to stay here any longer. He wanted to go back to the bookstore; at least the bookstore gave him some sense of security.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. \"We can't leave.\"\n\nHe didn't say \"I'm not leaving,\" but \"We can't leave.\"\n\nLao Dao froze. He vaguely sensed that something was wrong.\n\nZhou Ze turned around and walked back into the dormitory, heading straight for the dorm supervisors' office to find a seat. He even used their tea leaves to brew himself a cup.\n\nLao Dao stood beside him like a timid quail.\n\nHe didn't know what Zhou Ze was planning, but it seemed his boss had grasped some information. Whether he was faking his composure or was genuinely calm, the sight at least gave Lao Dao a sliver of hope.\n\nThe students had all gone to class, and the dormitory building had become much quieter.\n\nThe dorm supervisors hadn't returned either. Not a single one came back to the office. Perhaps they were busy dealing with Buzz Cut's body.\n\nThe police never came.\n\nThe ambulance never came either.\n\nAfter sitting for about half an hour and drinking two cups of tea, Zhou Ze walked out of the office.\n\nIn the hallway, a row of thermoses stood outside each dorm room. The students would put their thermoses out before leaving for class in the morning, and a designated auntie would come by with a plastic hose to fill them with hot water.\n\nBecause the water passed through a plastic hose, it inevitably had a plastic taste. The students mostly used it for washing clothes or soaking their feet, not for drinking.\n\nJust then, an auntie holding a plastic hose was preparing to dispense water. She slowly approached from the other end of the hallway.\n\nZhou Ze stood there without moving. Lao Dao stood by his side. The auntie, however, seemed completely unable to see them and continued walking toward them.\n\n\"Lao Dao, don't you find it a bit strange? There are just too many weird things happening in this place,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Uh-huh.\"\n\n\"First, Sun Qiu died but continued to live on out of inertia, and no one noticed even when liver mortis appeared on his body. Then came one accident after another, one bizarre scene after another.\"\n\n\"Could it be that this dormitory building is a once-in-a-century place of extreme malignant energy, which is why it can spawn so many ghosts and strange entities?\"\n\n\"And why was there no activity before, only for it to erupt all of a sudden recently?\"\n\n\"Uhh... Boss, what are you getting at?\"\n\nZhou Ze fell silent for a moment, then, after some thought, said, \"I think we should go back.\"\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\nLao Dao was more than willing. Regardless of whether he would have an accident or not, if he had to choose between dying here and dying in the bookstore, he'd much rather choose the latter.\n\nThe two of them walked toward the dormitory entrance together. Outside, Buzz Cut's body had already been taken care of.\n\nZhou Ze stood on the steps at the entrance, not rushing down. Instead, he watched as Lao Dao walked out step by step.\n\nJust as Lao Dao was about to leave the dormitory grounds,\n\nZhou Ze looked up.\n\nHe saw,\n\nThe building was bending over,\n\nas if it were about to collapse.\n\nLao Dao, completely unaware, continued on his way.\n\n\"Lao Dao, don't move,\" Zhou Ze warned.\n\n\"What?\"\n\nLao Dao took another step forward and turned his head.\n\nIn that instant, a torrent of blood erupted from a window of one of the dorm rooms above, surging toward Lao Dao. It must have been the room where Zhou Ze had found the pen drawings. It should have been on the third floor, but now, because of the building's bizarre contortion, the window was aimed directly at Lao Dao.\n\nWhen the flood of blood rushed over, Lao Dao was completely engulfed.\n\n\"Fuck...\"\n\nThat was the last word Lao Dao managed to get out.\n\nHe was on the verge of a total breakdown.\n\nHe wouldn't care how many ghosts you threw at him; ghosts were something he'd seen before.\n\nBut a building that could bend over like it was pole dancing?\n\nWho had ever seen that?\n\nGoddammit to hell,\n\nYou can't play like this!\n\nZhou Ze turned and looked at the woman behind him, who was still pouring hot water into the thermos.\n\nExcept, this thermos of hers seemed like it could never be filled. She remained paused over that single thermos, and the sound of running water continued uninterrupted.\n\nAnyone with common sense knows that when you pour hot water into a thermos, the sound changes as the water level rises. But here, it remained constant.\n\n\"Hey, the thermos is leaking.\"\n\nZhou Ze pointed at the thermos to alert the woman.\n\nThe woman froze for a second, then turned her head to look at Zhou Ze. Her face was densely covered in a honeycomb of pits, as if it were covered in countless corns. Some of the pits were involuntarily contracting and expanding.\n\nIt was a disgusting sight.\n\nTruly disgusting.\n\nThe woman continued to grip the plastic hose, while outside, Lao Dao struggled ceaselessly in the flood of blood. Within the blood, several dark figures could be faintly seen slowly approaching him, and in their hands, they held gleaming cleavers.\n\nZhou Ze walked over, preparing to take the hose from the woman's hands.\n\nA grim smile appeared on the woman's face.\n\nThe hose twisted instantly, coiling around Zhou Ze. What had been an inanimate object now seemed to have become a living python!\n\nThe nails on Zhou Ze's ten fingers grew long.\n\nHe didn't fight back against the python, allowing it to bind him. Zhou Ze could even clearly hear the crisp sound of his own bones cracking.\n\nHonestly,\n\nit was almost pleasant to the ear.\n\nDown the hallway, the boy with only a lower half began crawling toward them again, writhing like a rabid dog and howling something.\n\nFrom the other side, Sun Qiu, covered in liver mortis, was also walking this way, his figure staggering and dazed.\n\nBuzz Cut appeared too, the glass shards still stuck in his head, blood streaming down.\n\nEven the leather shoes Zhou Ze had destroyed had reappeared from somewhere, making a constant *drip-drip* sound.\n\n\"So the jig is up? Because you know I've figured it out?\"\n\nZhou Ze muttered to himself.\n\nIn the distance,\n\nLao Dao had already sunk into the flood of blood, with only occasional bubbles rising from where his nose would be. It was clear he couldn't hold on much longer.\n\nThe dark figures seemed to be about to reach him. And within the blood, there was a small, delicate figure. It wasn't human; it looked like a cat, waiting for its dinner.\n\nZhou Ze's nails didn't sweep out at his surroundings.\n\nInstead, with a decisive and resolute motion, he plunged them directly into his own chest and gave them a twist.\n\n\"*Hiss...*\"\n\nThe pain was so clear. Zhou Ze's body even began to convulse because of it.\n\nBut at that very moment, the scene around him began to rapidly rewind. The woman retreated, Buzz Cut retreated, the half-bodied boy retreated, the leather shoes retreated, and even the bent dormitory building began to straighten out.\n\nEverything was returning to normal.\n\nIn the midst of this rapid rewind,\n\nZhou Ze thought he saw a girl standing deep in the hallway, looking at him. The girl's face looked somewhat familiar.\n\n*Snap!*\n\nA crisp sound rang out.\n\nIt was the sound of a book's pages being closed.\n\n\"*Gasp... Splutter... Cough, cough...*\"\n\nLao Dao was sprawled on the lawn, gasping for air and coughing violently. He clutched his own throat tightly with both hands, only slowly calming down after a while. Then, bewildered, he looked around.\n\nHe saw Zhou Ze standing nearby, holding a closed notebook.\n\nThe crisp sound from before was the sound of Zhou Ze closing the notebook.\n\nZhou Ze looked up, a phantom pain still seeming to linger in his chest.\n\n\"Boss... what's going on?\" Lao Dao thought he had been on the verge of death just now, but how did things suddenly turn around?\n\n\"Think carefully about how we got in here,\" Zhou Ze said slowly.\n\n\"We drove here. I tricked the security guard at the school gate and drove in. Then we got out of the car, walked to the residential area, found Building B, and then we snuck in, saw Sun Qiu, and even got into a fight with the dorm supervisor...\"\n\n\"Think again, more carefully,\" Zhou Ze prompted.\n\n\"More carefully?\" Lao Dao scratched his head, and then a look of shock spread across his face. \"I... I... We did drive in, that's right. But right after we got out of the car, we seemed to see a black cat. The black cat was staring at us from the lawn. I even said we should catch it and keep it as a pet.\"\n\n\"Then we walked over to the lawn and saw that the black cat was gone, but there was a notebook on the ground. Boss, you picked up the notebook. I even asked you what was written or drawn inside... and then... and then we...\"\n\nZhou Ze looked down at the somewhat worn-out notebook in his hand.\n\nHe didn't dare to open it to any page.\n\n\"Boss, what about that dormitory building?\" Lao Dao scanned his surroundings, realizing something was missing.\n\n\"Look at the other dorm buildings around here. See how they're labeled.\"\n\n\"Building 1, Building 2, Building 3...\" Lao Dao counted, then slowly stopped. The dormitories here were labeled with Arabic numerals. There was no system that used English letters!\n\n\"Boss... then Building B, where is Building B?\"\n\nZhou Ze pointed at the notebook in his hand.\n\n\"Building B,\"\n\n\"is in here,\"\n\n\"drawn.\"\n\n***\n\n¹A gamer slang term, \"奶死了\" (nǎi sǐ le), literally \"healed to death.\" It refers to when a healer's blessing or positive prediction has the opposite, fatal effect, as if they jinxed the person.",

    "content": "The sky was about to brighten, which meant that Zhou Ze and the old Taoist had actually been standing motionless on this lawn, holding that same pose for a very, very long time.\n\nLuckily, almost no one was walking around the dormitory building at this hour, so no one noticed the two of them standing there like a pair of fools.\n\nOtherwise, if some accident had occurred, they would have been completely helpless to do anything about it—much like how Iron-Crutch Li ended up possessing the body of a dead beggar because his own physical body met with an accident while his spirit was out roaming.\n\nThe old Taoist got into the car, took out the liniment for bruises, and rubbed his knees. By this point, he was a bit of a mess. The previous illusion and the current reality, two feelings of truth and falsehood he couldn't distinguish, were constantly assailing him. He didn't even know which part of him was truly sore and which part was phantom pain.\n\nIt was like the feeling of slight disorientation a person has when they've just gotten out of a swimming pool and aren't used to gravity yet.\n\nZhou Ze also got into the passenger seat. In front of him sat the notebook.\n\nThe notebook's cover was blue, very understated and very ordinary.\n\n\"Boss, what in the world was all that about? How could looking at a notebook turn into... that?\"\n\nThe old Taoist had been extremely curious about this. For some unknown reason, a segment of his and the Boss's memories after entering the school had been erased, and then they had directly entered Building B.\n\nBut in fact,\n\nBuilding B didn't exist.\n\nThe dorm supervisor inside didn't exist either. The boy with only a torso, Zhao Baogang who walked on his hands, the auntie adding hot water to the thermos flasks, and so on—none of them actually existed.\n\nBut that feeling, though non-existent, was so intensely real, creating an inertia that made one subconsciously \"seamlessly connect\" with it. It was truly terrifying.\n\n\"Have you heard of *The Mural*?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"The movie? I've seen it,\" the old Taoist replied.\n\n\"It's a story from *Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio*.\" Zhou Ze leaned his head to the side against the headrest. \"It's more or less the same thing. But in that story, a person enters the world of a mural, whereas this time, we entered the world inside this notebook. If I'm not mistaken, the notebook should be filled with pen-and-ink drawings. Everything we saw in that dormitory building was drawn in here.\"\n\n\"Is it really that exaggerated?\"\n\n\"There's only one question now. What the hell is that Sun Qiu?\"\n\nIf Zhou Ze still hadn't realized there was a problem with Sun Qiu by now, he'd really been wasting his time.\n\nFrom that guy entering the bookstore and telling his story, to him and the old Taoist entering Pingchao Middle School and being led by a black cat to find this notebook, the entire sequence of events was interlinked.\n\nSomeone was guiding and manipulating things from behind the scenes, seemingly just waiting for all this to come to fruition.\n\nIt was a very uncomfortable feeling. Normal people don't like being someone else's marionette.\n\nAnd the scene of the girl deep in the hallway that he saw when he \"closed\" the notebook reminded him of the little girl from Sanxiang Village. She was charmingly naive, she was very hungry, and she was very well-behaved.\n\nEven Bai Yingying had been taken down and tied up by her.\n\nPreviously, Zhou Ze had thought she might be some elusive master who did good deeds without seeking recognition, but who knew that she wasn't so innocent after all.\n\nZhou Ze could guess at the purpose of the six pen-and-ink drawings found in the dorm building, especially the one concerning the old Taoist.\n\nA drawing, like a movie, is fake. It doesn't exist in the strict sense of the word. The scenes and characters in a drawing can naturally be unrestrained.\n\nFor example, a dormitory building could bend, and the ghosts that appeared one after another could defy all logic and reason. But what's fake is fake, after all. How could it become real?\n\nBy having a living person die inside it. By having a real, living person die in a fake world. Using a single point to affect the whole, it could grant something originally fake the ability to influence reality.\n\nIt was like some investment scams. Their gimmicks and all their promotions are basically fake, but they can attract real investment and defraud people of vast sums of money. In the end, whether it was real or fake no longer matters; it has already succeeded in stirring up trouble in the real world.\n\nAnd because he himself was a \"dead man,\" not counted as a living person, the protagonist of that drawing became the old Taoist.\n\nZhou Ze reached up and rubbed the bridge of his nose. To be honest, this whole affair felt like it had no head or tail, and the feeling of being watched and schemed against was not pleasant.\n\n\"Meow!\"\n\nThe sound of a cat's meow came through. The old Taoist, who was rubbing liniment in the driver's seat, froze and quickly looked out the window. On a footbridge not far away, a black cat was crouched, its eyes like blue sapphires, staring in their direction.\n\n\"Damn it, that cat's out here again.\"\n\nThe old Taoist was rather sensitive to cats. He recalled now that the reason he had suggested catching that black cat in the first place was because his previous boss had a white cat, and he felt that if Zhou Ze had a black cat by his side, it would effectively boost his coolness factor.\n\nZhou Ze got out of the car, looking over there, still holding the notebook. On the back cover was a sticker of a black cat's head.\n\nThe black cat was nearly a hundred meters away from Zhou Ze. It was licking its paws, looking somewhat unsatisfied. A moment ago, it had been just a hair's breadth away from getting its first taste of the old Taoist.\n\nZhou Ze didn't run over to catch the cat, nor was he in the mood to play a game of hide-and-seek with it. He took out his lighter, sparked a flame, and brought the bottom edge of the notebook toward it.\n\n*To hell with your scheming.*\n\n*I'll just burn the whole damn thing!*\n\nThe black cat was stunned. It seemed it hadn't expected Zhou Ze to react this way. Its body tensed, and then it leaped directly over. Its black figure practically flew across the concrete road, pouncing toward Zhou Ze.\n\n*Just as I thought.*\n\n*So this black cat is something like the artifact spirit of this notebook?*\n\n\"Hmph!\"\n\nThe nails on Zhou Ze's left hand grew long, and he swiped directly at the black cat pouncing on him.\n\n\"Thwack!\"\n\nThe black cat was sent flying by Zhou Ze's blow. It landed on the ground, its body beginning to turn illusory, clearly in great distress. It was far, far weaker than Zhou Ze had anticipated.\n\n\"Hey, are you really going to burn it?\"\n\nA girl's voice came from behind Zhou Ze. He turned around and saw a little girl sitting on the roof of his car, swinging her feet as if she were watching a show.\n\nShe was watching a show. From start to finish, she had been watching.\n\nThe old Taoist stuck his head out of the car. Before he could even look up, a foot landed right on him.\n\n\"Ah, that hurts!\"\n\nThe old Taoist yelped in pain and pulled his head back in.\n\nHe really only had himself to blame. The girl was sitting on the car roof swinging her feet; if he stuck his head out and looked up, wouldn't he see everything?¹\n\n\"Who are you?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"I'm just passing by. Besides, I'm about to leave Tongcheng. I just wanted to remind you that this notebook is far more precious than you think. It's just been corrupted right now. By a bizarre twist of fate, it was picked up by a student who could draw, who then drew all these dorm room ghost stories in it.\n\n\"On top of that, it was steeped in the resentment and negative emotions of the students at this school, which is why it became like that.\n\n\"But its function is actually much higher-level than this. Its use is definitely not limited to being a pair of VR goggles.\"\n\n\"Why should I believe you?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nThe little girl jumped down from the car and walked up to Zhou Ze.\n\nA half-smile played on her lips.\n\nHer eyes were like star-filled skies, a world away from the simple, naive little girl from Sanxiang Village who had walked into his bookstore.\n\n\"Heh heh, this is fun. You, like this, are really fun.\"\n\nThe little girl reached out, wanting to touch Zhou Ze's face.\n\nZhou Ze's eyes narrowed slightly, but he didn't resist or refuse.\n\nHer palm was icy and cold. It wasn't very comfortable, to be honest.\n\nAs the little girl stroked his face, she looked up and let out a long breath. \"Did you know, this is a Judge's magical artifact. It's a degraded Yin-Yang Register.\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head, indicating he didn't know.\n\nHe was still a temp.\n\nOnly after becoming a permanent employee would he be considered a proper Ghostly Bailiff. Then he'd have to slowly work his way up to Head Constable, then Patrol Inspector, and only after that, Judge.\n\nOne could say that the rank of \"Judge\" was, for Zhou Ze right now, far too distant.\n\n\"If I hadn't isolated this register's influence and confined it to a single dormitory building, how long do you think it would have taken you to realize that what you were seeing was actually a drawing? That the place you were in was actually fake?\"\n\nThe little girl seemed to be talking to herself.\n\n\"I have to go. Last time's ring and this time's notebook can be considered my parting gifts to you. Take good care of them. You should have use for them in the future.\"\n\nThe little girl reached out and snatched forward. The black cat that Zhou Ze had just sent flying transformed into a streak of black light that flew into her palm. Then, the little girl sent it into the notebook.\n\nAt the same time, back in the bookstore, the figure of Sun Qiu, who had been reading a book, vanished instantly. The book he had been holding fell to the floor.\n\n\"Keep it safe. This thing, although it's badly damaged now, is still somewhat useful. In the future, you could even catch some ghosts and put them inside.\n\n\"Like some seductive female ghosts, or something. Then when you're in the mood, you can go in and take a look. In terms of user experience, it'll absolutely blow current VR adult technology out of the water.\"\n\nThe little girl withdrew her hand and studied Zhou Ze carefully once more.\n\n\"I have to go down. It'll be hard to come back up next time. You should try to keep a low profile too. Of course, there's no need to wrong yourself either. Ah, forget it. After your last life, you seem to have gotten used to it anyway.\"\n\n\"You know me?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Uh-huh. Do you still think that the 'you' from your last life was the real you?\" the little girl asked in return.\n\n\"If you're about to tell me something about a past life, that's just too cliché and melodramatic,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Then let me tell you an even more melodramatic story. I did indeed know the you from your last life.\" The little girl blinked, looking at Zhou Ze.\n\n\"And then, you raped me.\"\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze.\n\n\"What do you think? Melodramatic, right?\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"Back then, were you... this small?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nHe wanted to know if his past self had been that much of a monster.\n\nThe little girl bent over laughing.\n\nThen, she began to slowly grow up.\n\nA thin layer of black mist enveloped her.\n\nIt made it impossible to see her face clearly, but she had indeed transformed into the shape of a grown woman.\n\nZhou Ze felt a little more at ease.\n\n*Thank goodness.*\n\n*Not that much of a monster.*\n\nHowever,\n\nWhat Zhou Ze couldn't see was that the woman's face within the black mist was the wrinkled, chilling face of an old crone.\n\nThe old crone was dressed in a dark gold robe and wore a phoenix coronet, exuding boundless grace and dignity. It was just that her face was a complete mismatch for her figure and bearing, like an exquisite work of art that had been forcibly ruined and twisted.\n\n\"I will wait for you. I will slowly wait for you, wait for you to climb up, step by step. Wait for the day you return to the Underworld to be enfeoffed, for the day you can remember some things from your past life.\"\n\n\"Don't be like that. You're making me feel like I've walked onto the wrong movie set. We're not filming *The Legend of Sword and Fairy*.\"\n\n\"When that time comes, I'll torture you to death, and personally cast you into the Animal Realm. Only then will I feel the thrill of revenge.\n\n\"You're growing far too slowly. So slowly that I couldn't bear to watch anymore. I had to show up and give you a few good things to fatten you up quickly.\"\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze.\n\nHe suddenly felt that walking onto the wrong movie set would have been better than this.\n\n\"Heh heh heh...\"\n\nThe woman's figure and the surrounding black mist dissipated in an instant, sinking into the ground.\n\nShe was gone.\n\nShe left without a trace.\n\nThe car door opened, and the old Taoist, a clear footprint on his cheek, stumbled out rubbing his face.\n\nHe looked toward the spot where the woman had disappeared and snorted in displeasure:\n\n\"Tch, women.\"\n\n***\n\n**Footnotes:**\n\n1.  This is a direct translation of the narrative aside, which implies the old Taoist was trying to look up the girl's skirt.",

    "title": "Chapter 146 The Boss of the Boss",
    "content": "On the way back, Zhou Ze was driving. In his current state, the Old Daoist wasn't fit to drive anymore.\n\n\"Boss, was that woman really your karmic debt from a past life?\"\n\n\"What did you hear?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Er, don't worry, Boss! I'll keep your secret!\" the Old Daoist immediately said, patting his own scrawny chest.\n\n\"Dead men are the best at keeping secrets.\"\n\n\"...\" The Old Daoist.\n\n\"Screeeech...\"\n\nThe car slammed to a halt.\n\nThe Old Daoist jumped in alarm.\n\n*Holy shit, is he really going to kill me to shut me up?*\n\nZhou Ze habitually reached for a cigarette, only to find he was out. He looked at the Old Daoist, intending to ask for one, but saw him clutching his knees, trembling uncontrollably.\n\n*Was he really that scared?*\n\nZhou Ze reached out and patted the Old Daoist's shoulder.\n\n\"Hey.\"\n\n\"Ah!\"\n\nThe Old Daoist yelped, looking at Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze found it a little amusing. *Is my usual image really that bad? Bad enough to make the Old Daoist think I'd actually kill him to silence him?*\n\n\"Give me a cigarette.\"\n\n\"Oh, right.\"\n\nThe Old Daoist immediately took out his cigarettes, handed one to Zhou Ze, and then personally lit it for him, as cautious and attentive as a handmaiden from ancient times—just a bit too old for the part.\n\n\"Boss, what'd you stop for?\"\n\n\"Cut the act. Is this little performance fun for you?\"\n\n\"Er...\"\n\nThe Old Daoist rolled his eyes internally. *You think it's easy serving an ungrateful bastard like you?!*\n\nSometimes, the Old Daoist couldn't understand himself. Why give up a perfectly comfortable life to keep dealing with a ghost boss? But then he'd think about it and feel at peace. Maybe this was just life.\n\nOr maybe,\n\nthis was just what it meant to be a man.\n\nIf you didn't seek out a little excitement and a few challenges when you had nothing better to do, how boring would life be?\n\nBesides, the life he was living now was something his old self could never have experienced, and something most ordinary people would never experience either.\n\n\"So, Boss, what did we stop for?\" the Old Daoist finally asked.\n\n\"To get breakfast.\"\n\nZhou Ze said, then opened the car door and got out.\n\n*Breakfast? Boss, did you bring any juice¹? I didn't.*\n\nAhead was a row of breakfast stalls: one selling savory crepes, one serving noodles, another selling steamed buns and fried dough sticks. It was a small intersection with a fair amount of traffic, and many people would pull over here to grab a bite.\n\nZhou Ze walked up to a stall selling meat soup, run by a middle-aged man.\n\n\"Two bowls of beef soup,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"You got it. Want it spicy?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Alright.\"\n\nThe vendor first took out two bowls, adding scallions and cilantro, followed by some beef. Then, he ladled a scoop of broth from the pot that was kept simmering on a coal stove, poured it into the bowl, then poured the broth back into the pot. After that, he added various seasonings to the bowl before finally filling it to the brim with broth. He then placed the two bowls for Zhou Ze on a small table to the side.\n\nZhou Ze added some extra chili to his own bowl, asked for two flatbreads, and sat down.\n\nThe Old Daoist came over just then. He sat down next to Zhou Ze, rubbing his hands together, looking a bit constrained and immensely flattered. *Damn, the first time the Boss is treating me to a meal! This iron rooster² is actually treating someone! Should I cry a little to set the mood?*\n\nThe Old Daoist continued his death-courting internal monologue, then watched as Zhou Ze slowly and methodically tore his flatbread into pieces, dropping them into his soup bowl to soak.\n\nThe Old Daoist copied his example. Having traveled all over the country in his life, he was certainly no stranger to this kind of breakfast. He could tell from the vendor's accent that he was from Henan. And for many people from Henan, the day truly begins with a bowl of soup.\n\nHowever, the Old Daoist didn't drink or move. He just watched Zhou Ze in silence.\n\nZhou Ze felt a bit uncomfortable under his gaze. \"What's wrong? Don't like it?\"\n\n\"No, no, I'm used to it, I'm used to it,\" the Old Daoist replied evasively.\n\n*This soup... there's definitely something wrong with it!*\n\n*Stopping the car so suddenly to get breakfast was already suspicious, and now he's so formally tearing up the bread. This whole act is too much.*\n\nThe Old Daoist glanced sideways, sizing up the vendor again.\n\n*Is this vendor a ghost?*\n\n*Then this soup is definitely not clean!*\n\nThe Old Daoist felt he had seen through it all. *Damn it, the Boss is playing tricks on me again, just like that time in the dormitory when he told me to go first, then watched from the side as the building bent.*\n\n*He's definitely setting me up for a fall again!*\n\n*Waiting for me to drink this soup and make a fool of myself!*\n\n\"It's a little hot. I'll wait for it to cool,\" the Old Daoist explained.\n\nZhou Ze nodded and continued tearing up his flatbread.\n\nThe Old Daoist was actually getting hungry. He glanced at the vendor again, then stood up. \"Boss, this isn't enough for me. I'm going across the street to buy a couple of steamed buns.\"\n\nWith that, the Old Daoist ran across the small road, bought a few white flour steamed buns, and returned to his seat. He picked one up and started munching on it with gusto.\n\n*Damn it,*\n\n*food you buy yourself, you can eat without worry. It just tastes better!*\n\n*Plus, the buns on the lady selling the steamed buns were pretty huge, too.*\n\nAs he ate, the Old Daoist offered a steamed bun to Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze took the steamed bun, placed it next to his soup bowl, and then looked at the Old Daoist with a half-smile.\n\n*Huh?*\n\n*Why is he looking at me like that?*\n\nThe Old Daoist's mind started racing again.\n\n*No way...*\n\n*You're upset because I didn't fall into your trap and drink the soup?*\n\n*How can you be like that!*\n\n*Should I drink a little then?*\n\nThe Old Daoist kept chewing his steamed bun, his thoughts churning. Serving this guy was truly like accompanying a tiger; none of these ghost big shots were to be trifled with.\n\nBut this seemingly fragrant bowl of soup in front of him... who knew what was really inside it. If it were something like barbecued centipedes or roasted rats, he could probably stomach it, but the sheer terror of not knowing what it was... that was too much.\n\n\"Boss, you should eat. These steamed buns are really delicious,\" the Old Daoist said with a nervous laugh.\n\nZhou Ze picked up the steamed bun he had placed on the table. \"The table's not clean. The bun's dirty.\"\n\n\"I'll eat it then. I'm not picky. Can't let it go to waste.\"\n\nThe Old Daoist took the bun from Zhou Ze's hand and started gnawing on it again. In any case, he was not going to drink this meat soup!\n\nAt worst, he'd just make another excuse, say he was full from the steamed buns and couldn't drink anymore.\n\nZhou Ze looked at the Old Daoist and shook his head.\n\n*Heh,*\n\n*Disappointed, aren't you?*\n\n*Your little plan failed, didn't it?*\n\n*Aren't I smart?*\n\n*You're helpless, aren't you?*\n\nThe Old Daoist was secretly gloating.\n\nThen, the Old Daoist saw Zhou Ze lower his head, lift the soup bowl, and take a sip. He then picked up his chopsticks, plucked out a piece of meat, and put it in his mouth to chew.\n\nIt was clear that even with all the chili and strong flavor, eating was still a struggle for Zhou Ze, and swallowing looked painful. This was, however, consistent with Zhou Ze's usual way of eating.\n\nWhat surprised the Old Daoist was that the Boss was actually drinking the soup.\n\n*Could it be... I was overthinking things?*\n\n*This soup is fine?*\n\nThe Old Daoist didn't believe Zhou Ze would sacrifice himself just to trick him.\n\n*Was I just being paranoid?*\n\nThe Old Daoist watched as Zhou Ze continued to eat the soup and bread with great difficulty. He finally confirmed it: the soup was fine. He had been the one making a drama out of nothing!\n\nAt once, the Old Daoist lowered his head and took a sip of soup.\n\nMmm, very authentic, the flavor was amazing. *Delicious, really delicious.*\n\n*Damn it, I almost choked on that steamed bun just now.*\n\nThe Old Daoist started eating with abandon, thoroughly enjoying himself. Even in a city in Henan, it wasn't easy to find a soup stall with such an authentic flavor. To find one in Tongcheng, and a roadside stall at that, was something to be cherished.\n\nWith the soup, the Old Daoist finished off both the steamed buns and the flatbread. He even got a free refill of soup midway through. Yep, free refills—the real deal.\n\nZhou Ze ate about a third of his before he couldn't eat anymore. He put down his chopsticks and sat to the side.\n\nAfter finishing, the Old Daoist patted his stomach, feeling like he wanted more. *Am I still not full?*\n\nJust as he was thinking about whether to order another bowl, Zhou Ze made a move to get his wallet.\n\nThe Old Daoist took the hint, immediately getting up to pay the bill. He had at least that much sense.\n\nStanding up, the Old Daoist grabbed the car keys from the table first. \"Boss, let me drive back. You must be tired.\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. \"It hasn't been easy on you either. I'll drive.\"\n\n*The Boss has changed.*\n\n*He's really changed!*\n\n*Not only does he treat his subordinate to breakfast, but he even knows how to be considerate!*\n\nJust as the Old Daoist was wondering if he should wipe away a tear, use the moment to pledge his loyalty, and crank up the emotional atmosphere, Zhou Ze started walking toward the other side of the road. The Old Daoist naturally followed. Then, he saw Zhou Ze stop in front of the stall where he had just bought the steamed buns.\n\n*Heh heh,*\n\n*I told you the lady at this stall had big buns. You old faker, Boss. Yingying's aren't small either, you can look whenever you want.*\n\n*Hmph, men.*\n\n*The flowers at home are never as fragrant as the wild ones.³*\n\nThe Old Daoist's mind was racing with frantic commentary. It seemed that after his encounter with that woman from his past life, the Boss had changed, become more down-to-earth.\n\n\"Boss, what kind of filling do you want in your bun? Or just the plain white flour ones?\" the proprietress asked enthusiastically.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head and pointed a finger at her.\n\n*Damn, you animal! We were just looking, but you're actually hitting on her! Are you trying to buy the proprietress's \"buns\"?*\n\nThe Old Daoist watched excitedly as his boss flirted.\n\n*Huh, I thought the Boss couldn't get it up anymore?*\n\n\"You. Come with me. To the place you're supposed to be,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nThe Old Daoist froze.\n\n*Shit.*\n\nA bad feeling washed over the Old Daoist!\n\n*No way?*\n\n*It can't be?*\n\n*It's not that, is it?*\n\n*It's impossible, right?*\n\nThe proprietress pursed her lips, and her voice suddenly deepened. \"I died of illness too early. My wife is raising our three kids all by herself. She works two shifts a day and still has to come out to sell breakfast. It's too hard on her.\n\nThat's why I thought I'd possess her in the morning, to let her rest a little longer.\"\n\nThe voice was still a woman's, but the tone had clearly changed to another person's—presumably the husband's.\n\n\"Everyone's life is pitiful, so don't try to sell me a sob story. You possessing your wife's body is draining her life force.\"\n\nAs he spoke, Zhou Ze opened the steamer basket, took out a steamed bun, and gently pressed his thumbnail into it.\n\n\"Besides, selling this kind of bun to cheat the living of their money... even if it's to pay for your children's school fees, aren't you afraid of damaging their spiritual merit?\"\n\nThe steamed bun in Zhou Ze's hand slowly began to change.\n\nIt transformed into a paper-mâché object shaped like a bun. The \"filling\" inside was actually a messy lump of paste, and it had already turned black.\n\nBeside him, the Old Daoist immediately started to vomit:\n\n\"Blech!\"\n\n***\n**Footnotes:**\n1.  **Juice (汁水):** In this story's context, this is slang for the special sustenance ghosts or supernatural beings like Zhou Ze need to consume, as they cannot eat regular food properly.\n2.  **Iron Rooster (鐵公雞):** A Chinese idiom for a very stingy person, from whom you cannot pluck a single \"feather\" (money).\n3.  **The flowers at home...

    "content": "The old Taoist was beside them, vomiting his guts out. Everything he'd just eaten came back up, a truly miserable sight. On the ground was a puddle of red, white, and yellow—so many colors it looked like a condiment shop had opened.\n\nTears welled in his eyes. The regret, the bitterness in the old Taoist's heart... how could he be so damn unlucky?\n\nHe had been so careful, so cautious, thinking he'd avoided one pitfall, only to realize he had foolishly and gleefully leaped into an even deeper one, all while shouting on the way down:\n\n\"So floaty!\"\n\n\"Leave her body. Come with me.\"\n\nZhou Ze urged. He was just one short. Send this one back to Hell, and he could finally get his permanent position.\n\nPerhaps this was a case of \"wearing out iron shoes in a fruitless search, only to find it by chance.\"¹ He had been running around in circles at that school, even dealing with a supposed karmic debt from a past life, yet he hadn't managed to catch a single, bona fide ghost. And then, on the way back, he'd found him (her).\n\nThe woman's head was bowed as if she had accepted her fate, but she still spoke up.\n\n\"I want to stay with her a little longer. She's willing, too. We can still see each other every night when we dream, and I can see my three children.\"\n\nZhou Ze was unmoved. Every dead person has their own lingering attachment to the world of the living; it's a characteristic of any intelligent life form. A survival instinct always urges them to seize any opportunity to remain.\n\nEven Zhou Ze himself was the same. But understanding was one thing; rules were another.\n\nBesides, if the husband's soul remained in the woman's body, her health would soon fail. In the end, it would only harm them both.\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nThe woman suddenly shoved the stall in front of her, sending the steamers tumbling toward Zhou Ze. Then she turned and ran. She had to escape; she didn't want to be caught.\n\nZhou Ze pushed the steamers aside. With a flick of his fingers, his nails swiped through the air, releasing a black mist invisible to ordinary people that instantly wrapped around the woman.\n\nThe woman let out a muffled grunt and collapsed to the ground.\n\nZhou Ze took a few steps forward, came to the woman's side, and knelt. He placed a hand on her forehead, and with a pull, he extracted a black, ghostly soul.\n\nIt had the face of a man, who struggled and roared in fury, thick with unwillingness and hysteria.\n\n\"She's willing! She's willing to stay with me! She told me in her dreams at night! We were going to raise the children together! She's willing!\"\n\nThe man was arguing his case, then glared at Zhou Ze.\n\n\"She's willing! What right do you have to butt in!\"\n\n\"I need the credit.\"\n\n\"...\" the man fell silent.\n\nZhou Ze was being honest. When it came down to it, he needed the credit, and he was just one point short. He had already waited for days; he had no choice but to take him back to close the case and make his position permanent.\n\nThe man was stunned for a moment. Zhou Ze's frank admission that he was acting out of self-interest left him with no rebuttal, because he knew that no matter how much he argued or protested, it wouldn't soften the other's heart.\n\n\"Let me go home and see my three children one last time.\"\n\nThe man pleaded.\n\n\"This time, I promise I won't run. I won't try to escape.\"\n\n\"You're in no position to bargain with me. And I'm not filming a TV special.\"\n\n\"At my home... there's another... ghost!\"\n\n\"Alright then. It's only right you get to see your home before you go. There's compassion beyond the letter of the law, right?\"\n\nThe old Taoist, who had just finished vomiting, heard this and suddenly felt the urge to vomit again.\n\nBut he held it in.\n\nHe didn't dare.\n\nThe woman woke up, dazed and groggy. The old Taoist helped her up, and they started back together. Being possessed by a ghost, even one's own husband, took a significant toll on body and spirit.\n\nFollowing the male ghost's directions, Zhou Ze started walking toward his home.\n\nThe old Taoist was the restless type. Although he'd earlier teased the woman about her \"big buns,\" he wasn't about to take advantage of the situation now. She was pitiful enough as it was; he couldn't do something so beastly. So instead, he struck up a conversation with the male ghost.\n\n\"Brother, where are you from? Listening to your wife's accent, she's not from around here either.\"\n\nThe Tongcheng dialect was easy to recognize, with a very high degree of identifiability, as it was basically on a different channel from Mandarin. Dialects from some other places, however, were sometimes so similar to the Mandarin language family that native speakers would unconsciously carry their accent over when speaking Mandarin.\n\n\"Sichuan,\" the man replied.\n\nBy now, he had come to terms with the situation and felt a sense of resignation. The key was Zhou Ze's attitude, which was so starkly different from the compassionate Taoist priests and monks he'd seen on television.\n\n\"So how did you die?\" the old Taoist asked.\n\n\"Died of pleasure.\"\n\n\"How did you die of pleasure?\" the old Taoist pressed.\n\n\"Drug... overdose.\"\n\n\"Ah...\" The old Taoist was suddenly intrigued, asking like a curious child, \"Taking that stuff, what's it really feel like? Is it really that good?\"\n\nZhou Ze shot the old Taoist a sideways glance. The old Taoist stuck out his tongue and didn't dare say another word.\n\n\"Heh, of course it's good. So good it makes you feel like you're dying and going to heaven,\" the male ghost replied.\n\n\"So good you became a ghost and bankrupted your family?\" Zhou Ze added, twisting the knife.\n\nAs a doctor in his past life, Zhou Ze knew exactly how terrifying the harm of that stuff was to the human body. Ordinary people only knew that taking it was addictive and would drain one's finances, but in reality, much of the physical damage it caused was completely irreversible.\n\n\"Right, right! Look at the state of you, what a dog's life you've become. Your wife is working so hard to raise the kids, while you went and got high till you died.\"\n\nThe old Taoist immediately grasped the spirit of Zhou Ze's line of conversation and chimed in.\n\n\"Hah,\" the man snorted. \"The crap the rich people here use is nothing. God knows how much junk it's mixed with. Where I'm from, almost the whole village is in the business. You buy it there, and it's high purity and cheap.\"\n\n\"And besides, I made money from this. I was trying to earn money for my family. One trip, carrying it back, could make a hundred thousand. That's worth ten years of hard labor in the fields. With the money I earned, I even opened a factory, started a workshop, and bought a big truck for transport.\"\n\n\"Bullshit. If you made so much money, why are your wife and kids in such a miserable state now?\" The old Taoist didn't believe him.\n\nThe male ghost seemed to have gotten into a stubborn mood with the old Taoist. \"Heh. I'm a son of a bitch if I'm lying to you. I used to be loaded, much more loaded than you can imagine.\"\n\n\"After you made your first pot of gold, did you keep trafficking?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Of course. Why wouldn't I? Can opening a factory, a workshop, or running a transport business make money as fast as this? It's a tiny investment for a huge return. Who would want to run some stupid factory that takes three years just to break even? It was really pointless.\"\n\n\"Tsk, tsk, tsk.\" The old Taoist clicked his tongue.\n\nActually, the old Taoist had seen plenty of people like this.\n\nThis male ghost had probably been a poor farmer before. He took a risk trafficking that stuff and made his first fortune, turning his life around. But once you've tasted something that good, it's truly hard to let go. If you told him to open a factory, run a proper business, and live a decent life, he wouldn't be able to. His values and his perception of money had completely collapsed.\n\nIt was similar to many prostitutes or gamblers. For a prostitute, she could easily make tens of thousands a month. For a gambler, one bet could win thousands, even tens of thousands. After their perception of money is hit by that kind of impact, telling them to go straight and get an honest factory job for three or four thousand a month feels meaningless to them.\n\nAnd then,\n\nthe person is ruined.\n\nIt becomes difficult to start over and live a good life.\n\nWhy do so many people who are determined to wash their hands of it and go straight end up falling back in?\n\nBecause they simply can't handle the rhythm of a normal, ordinary person's life anymore.\n\n\"So, if you're saying the whole village over there is in this business, you must have known that stuff is harmful to your body, right? Why did you still use it?\" the old Taoist asked, a bit perplexed.\n\n\"When the whole village is doing it, you start to think it's no big deal. The environment is different,\" the man said, a bit wistfully. \"It's like if your dad, your uncle, your older brother, and your colleagues all smoke. Even if 'Smoking is harmful to your health' is printed right on the cigarette box, you'd still think it's not a big deal.\"\n\n\"After all, everyone is doing it.\"\n\nThe old Taoist nodded thoughtfully.\n\nThen, the old Taoist asked again, \"So where's your money? Did you smoke it all away before you died?\"\n\n\"I left a lot of money behind,\" the man said. \"I didn't let my family down. I didn't let my wife and kids down.\"\n\n\"Heh,\" the old Taoist chuckled.\n\nThe family lived in a residential complex's... converted garage. The ground floor, originally someone's garage, had been modified to be rented out as a one-room apartment.\n\nThe woman was helped into the room. Inside were three children, all staring with wide eyes at Zhou Ze, the old Taoist, and their mother.\n\nTwo boys and one girl, they all looked to be elementary school age. One of them still had a red neckerchief tied around his neck.\n\nThe three children's clothes were a bit ragged, but their faces were clean and they seemed to be in good spirits. Although their living conditions weren't great, their mother must have taken good care of them.\n\nBut no matter how you looked at it, this family did not look like one that had been left a large sum of money after the man's death.\n\n\"Hey, didn't you say you made a lot of money? How come your wife and kids ended up in Tongcheng, living here?\" the old Taoist asked.\n\n\"She wanted to bring the kids here. She didn't want to stay in our old village anymore,\" the man replied.\n\nAt this point, Zhou Ze spoke up. \"So, where's the other ghost?\"\n\nBoss Zhou was always of the opinion that when it came to performance credit, the more the merrier. He really wasn't in the mood for emotional columns or charity work.\n\nThe male ghost's gaze shifted toward a curtain in the corner.\n\nZhou Ze walked over,\n\nand pulled the curtain aside.\n\nBehind the curtain was a small plastic bathtub. Cowering inside the tub was a very young-looking man, trembling uncontrollably. On his chest was a crimson bloom, dazzlingly conspicuous.\n\n\"He's my son. After I died, he started using with the money I left at home. Then the money ran out, and he followed my old path: trafficking to support his habit.\"\n\n\"His luck was bad. He got caught.\"\n\n\"The quantity was too large.\"\n\n\"Sent to Chengdu.\"\n\n\"Executed.\"\n\n***\n¹A Chinese idiom meaning to search high and low for something, only to find it effortlessly by chance.",

    "content": "\"So, don't you think this is a kind of retribution?\"\n\nZhou Ze looked at the man. To be honest, for this person, and for his son who had become a ghost but, like his old man, still lingered in the mortal world, Zhou Ze felt not a shred of sympathy.\n\nMan acts while Heaven watches. The wheel of karma turns, and retribution is always certain.\n\n\"Retribution for what? I don't believe in any damn retribution. I transported the drugs myself, took the risks myself, and earned the money myself. What retribution is there?\"\n\n\"How many people have had their families torn apart, wives and children scattered, because of the drugs you trafficked? While they are certainly at fault for their own weakness and for going down the wrong path, you cannot escape the original sin.\"\n\nZhou Ze raised his hand, and the Gates of Hell opened.\n\nHonestly, for this kind of person—no, for this kind of ghost—there was nothing more to say, and he couldn't be bothered to say it anyway.\n\nThe son's soul was forcibly detained by Zhou Ze. He still tried to struggle, but there was no escaping Zhou Ze's grasp. He was sent directly through the Gates of Hell by Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze didn't rush to check his credentials booklet. Instead, he grabbed the husband's soul as well. The husband's soul seemed to have accepted his fate. He didn't struggle, merely looking at Zhou Ze with a cold, mocking gaze.\n\n\"There are plenty of bad people in this world. The good die young while the wicked live for a thousand years. How many of them truly face retribution?\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't argue. He seized him and sent him through the Gates of Hell as well.\n\nAnd with that, the dust settled.\n\nZhou Ze opened his credentials booklet. The two characters for (Temporary) next to his position had vanished, replaced by the two characters for \"Underworld Emissary.\"\n\nHe'd been made permanent.\n\nHe was finally no longer a temp worker living from one day to the next.\n\nAt that moment, Zhou Ze felt a simple joy and pride, much like people from a decade or two ago felt when they entered the state system and secured a so-called \"iron rice bowl,\"¹ feeling as if they had reached the pinnacle of their lives and become a cut above the rest.\n\nTurning to the next page, a judgment verse appeared:\n\n*A mere traveler in the mortal realm,*\n*Your coming and going were both adrift;*\n*Alas, your eyes were blind, as was your heart,*\n*So your fortune and your fate both ran cold;*\n*Let this be a warning against ill-gotten wealth,*\n*For your home and your family are now squandered and lost.*\n\nThe three lines of verse likely summarized the husband's life. As for the son who had been executed by firing squad, because Zhou Ze had reaped him first, he was the one who completed Zhou Ze's promotion. And because Zhou Ze reaped the ghost husband second, the first judgment after his promotion was for the ghost husband.\n\nThe meaning of the verse was simple. For this man, this life, if nothing had gone wrong, should have been an ordinary one. But his heart was consumed by greed, and he completely squandered the meager karmic fortune he had, until in the end, not only was his family's wealth gone, but his child and relatives were implicated as well.\n\nWalking out of the garage that served as a home, the old Taoist's heart was heavy. All those dolls in the room, and that woman who had fled the drug-dealing village alone with three children.\n\n*Sigh.*\n\nHow pitiful.\n\nTruly pitiful.\n\nThe old Taoist looked up and saw Zhou Ze stretching lazily in front of him, looking to be in a very good mood, not the least bit upset or saddened by the family's fate.\n\n\"Finally made permanent,\" Zhou Ze muttered. Before, it hadn't seemed like a big deal, but being stuck at ninety-nine percent on his performance meter lately had been truly agonizing.\n\nNow his performance chart had refreshed. It was at three-thousandths, or 0.3%.\n\nThis meant that if he wanted to qualify for the rank of Head Constable, aside from finding a few more Underworld Emissaries like the little loli to recognize him as their leader, he had a very long road ahead of him in terms of performance alone.\n\n\"Boss, that family... they're so pitiful,\" the old Taoist couldn't help but say after they had left the residential complex.\n\n\"Pitiful how?\"\n\n\"That woman and those three kids. Their lives are going to be so hard from now on.\"\n\n\"What's the use of you pitying them? When they were getting rich off crime, living it up, they didn't think to order you a Meituan delivery.\"\n\n\"Uh...\" The old Taoist felt the boss had a point, but it also seemed to make no sense.\n\n\"When their family was well-off, the eldest son could do drugs whenever he wanted, the other kids could wear new clothes, play with more expensive toys, and go to better schools, and his wife could be decked out in gold and silver. Since they enjoyed the good times together, they have to share the burden when things fall apart. Isn't that how it works? Using dirty money from drug trafficking burns through one's karmic fortune the fastest. You get your kicks for a moment, but you pay for it with a lifetime of retribution. That's fate, and they brought it on themselves. There's no need to pity them. I think you should pity yourself instead. You ate so many of those paper-made steamed buns. Are you sure you'll be okay?\"\n\n\"Boss, don't mention those buns ag—\"\n\nBefore the old Taoist could finish his sentence, he suddenly let out an extremely foul fart.\n\nIt was long and meandering, like the tune of *Moon Reflected in the Second Spring*,² and just as heart-wrenching.\n\n\"Boss, wait a sec. I need to find a place to relieve myself. I can't hold it in.\"\n\nWithout even time to find a restroom, the old Taoist located a nearby patch of overgrown grass.\n\nA quarter of an hour later, the old Taoist returned, his legs trembling. He had clearly been drained by the ordeal. It was no wonder; he had eaten far too many of those buns. Other people who might have accidentally bought and eaten one would probably get an upset stomach, but the old Taoist had witnessed what the buns were made of. The double-whammy of psychological and physiological shock had directly led to his current state.\n\nThe two got back in the car. Just as the old Taoist was about to start the engine, he clutched his stomach again. \"Nope, I can't. I have to go again.\"\n\nWhen the old Taoist walked back this time, his face had begun to turn pale.\n\n\"Damn it, they deserved it! That family really deserved it!\"\n\nAfter suffering so miserably, the old Taoist no longer felt a shred of sympathy for that family.\n\nThis just proved a certain saying: most people's kindness is just sentimentality seen from their own perspective.\n\nZhou Ze sat down in the driver's seat. He didn't dare let the old Taoist drive. He remembered all too well that he had died in a car crash the last time he drove, and he had no desire for a repeat.\n\n\"I'll take you to the hospital.\"\n\nThe old Taoist nodded. He had to go to the hospital, or he might just crap his old life away.\n\nThe sky had cleared up for a while that morning, but it wasn't long before it started raining again. The weather had been truly fickle lately, making it hard to predict.\n\nZhou Ze drove the car into the People's Hospital parking lot and accompanied the old Taoist to register for a consultation. He wondered if Dr. Lin was here, but he had no plans to go looking for her.\n\nEver since the incident with his sister-in-law, he hadn't contacted her. He figured he should just let the relationship end. To try and sort it out would just be a tangled mess, a pointless back-and-forth.\n\nThe old Taoist took a specimen cup to the restroom to collect a sample for testing. Zhou Ze sat on a bench outside, taking out the notebook. He didn't dare open it, just toyed with it in his hands.\n\nThe black cat pattern on the back of the notebook was much clearer than before. Moreover, when you looked at it, you got the feeling that it was also staring back at you.\n\nPeople came and went in the hospital. As Zhou Ze held the notebook, it would occasionally give a jolt. It was very slight, but the sensation was clearly transmitted to his mind through his fingertips.\n\nZhou Ze noticed that the notebook would only tremble slightly when people in hospital gowns or those being pushed on gurneys passed in front of him, and the intensity varied.\n\nThis was a major discovery. It seemed this notebook could predict the life and death of those around him. The closer someone was to death, or the more mortal danger they were in, the more violently it would shake, as if to remind its owner who nearby was about to kick the bucket.\n\nHis phone rang just then. Zhou Ze answered. It was Bai Yingying.\n\n\"Boss, are you alright?\" Bai Yingying asked anxiously from the other end.\n\n\"I'm fine, what's wrong?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Little Ke found the Japanese priest's location. She's waiting for you at the bookstore. She's also worried sick about you, so scared something might have happened to you. She's just terribly worried.\"\n\nIn the bookstore, as she said this, Bai Yingying shot a deliberate glance at the little loli sitting across from her.\n\nThe little loli's cheeks puffed out in anger!\n\nShe was furious. Even a fool could tell that Bai Yingying was subtly badmouthing her to Zhou Ze.\n\nSo it was true, all women were born to be masters of palace intrigue.³ The silly, sweet Bai Yingying had actually taught herself, galloping far ahead of the competition on the road to winning favor.\n\n*Ying ying ying!*\n\n\"Heh,\" Zhou Ze chuckled. Of course he could read between the lines of Bai Yingying's words.\n\nThe little loli wanting him dead...\n\n...was a certainty.\n\nJust as he himself had once hoped the little loli would meet with an accident in Chengdu and never return.\n\n\"I'll be back in a bit. The old Taoist ate something bad, I'm with him at the hospital.\"\n\n\"Okay, Boss. Love you, ying ying ying.\"\n\nAfter hanging up, Bai Yingying looked at the little loli again, as if in triumph.\n\nThe little loli turned up her cute nose and snorted.\n\n\"Hmph, childish.\"\n\n\"I wonder who's the childish one. I can make a bet with you, you know. If something really happens to the Boss, he'll definitely take you down with him before he dies, but he won't take me.\"\n\n\"...\" The loli was speechless.\n\nScheming bitch!\n\nScheming zombie!\n\n\"Because someone has to be there for the Boss's funeral,\" Bai Yingying said calmly. \"The Boss once said he doesn't want ordinary people to handle his funeral again. He doesn't want to go through the experience of being sent to the crematorium when he's not even dead.\"\n\n...\n\nOn the hospital bench, Zhou Ze was boredly scrolling through Weibo when he came across a big news story. A tornado and hailstorm, a natural disaster, had struck Yancheng, the city right next to Tongcheng.\n\nThe Jiangsu-Zhejiang region had a very good geographical location and had always been spared from earthquakes and other major natural disasters. For locals, the worst they usually had to deal with was heavy rain flooding some farmland. But this time, the tornado strike had caught the entire Jiangsu region off guard.\n\nWhen Sichuan was hit by earthquakes, many citizens of Chengdu were accustomed to it, even able to calmly move their tables and chairs out to an open area without buildings to continue playing mahjong while waiting for the aftershocks to end.\n\nBut the people of Jiangsu really had no experience with this kind of extreme natural disaster.\n\nSome doctors and nurses started running about, as if an emergency assembly had been called.\n\nDr. Lin, in her white coat, also ran past Zhou Ze. Then she stopped in her tracks, looking at him with some surprise.\n\n\"What are you doing here?\"\n\nDr. Lin was much thinner than before, and her clothes seemed a bit too large for her. A beauty grown thin is the most heart-rending sight, making one want to comfort her.\n\n\"Accompanying a friend to see a doctor,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\n\"A tornado hit the next city over. There are many injured. Our hospital is organizing a medical team to go there for disaster relief. I'm about to leave. By the way, I already signed the divorce papers and mailed them to your bookstore, but you never sent them back.\"\n\n\"Oh, my bookstore moved,\" Zhou Ze explained.\n\n\"Alright, we'll talk about it when I get back.\"\n\nDr. Lin left in a hurry. The team over there had already gathered and was preparing to depart.\n\nZhou Ze slowly stood up.\n\nHis expression was grim.\n\nIt wasn't because his first meeting with Dr. Lin in a long time was spent discussing divorce papers. In fact, for both of them, it was a kind of release.\n\nThe key was...\n\n...that just now, when Dr. Lin had been standing right in front of him, talking to him...\n\n...the notebook in his hand had begun to tremble with extreme violence.\n\nThe moment she moved away, the notebook suddenly fell silent again.\n\nThis meant...\n\n...she was very likely about to die!\n\n---\n**Footnotes:**\n¹ \"Iron rice bowl\" (铁饭碗, *tiě fàn wǎn*) is a Chinese term for a secure, state-provided job with guaranteed lifetime employment.\n² *Moon Reflected in the Second Spring* (二泉映月, *Èr Quán Yìng Yuè*) is a famous and melancholic piece of Chinese music for the *erhu*.\n³ \"Palace intrigue\" (宫斗, *gōng dòu*) refers to the schemes and power struggles within an imperial harem, a popular genre in Chinese media.",

    "content": "The old Taoist walked out of the restroom carrying his \"secretions,\" ready to take them to the lab for testing. Zhou Ze looked at him and said,\n\n\"Something urgent came up. I'm leaving first. Can you handle it on your own?\"\n\n\"...\" said the old Taoist.\n\n*Just when I needed care the most, you...*\n\n\"Should I call the monkey to come keep you company?\"\n\n\"...\" said the old Taoist.\n\n*Are you sure you're not kidding?*\n\n\"Well then, take care of yourself.\"\n\nZhou Ze took his car keys and walked out of the hospital.\n\nThe old Taoist stood where he was and sighed, lamenting his difficult life. Both of his bosses had been a bit cold and ungrateful, lacking even the most basic social graces.\n\nBut then, the old Taoist had a thought and felt relieved.\n\n*It’s because they didn't know how to be human that they both became ghosts.*\n\nHeh heh.\n\nThe old Taoist chuckled to himself and trotted off to the lab. It had to be said, his cheerful personality had definitely played a huge role in him living to such a ripe old age in good health.\n\nAs Zhou Ze walked out of the main entrance of the lobby, he happened to see a minibus and three ambulances driving out. He immediately went to the parking lot, got his car, and followed them.\n\nHe didn't call Dr. Lin to tell her to get out of the vehicle and not go. He was a doctor himself and knew very well that when faced with this kind of situation, doctors had a responsibility to step forward.\n\nMore than a decade ago, when SARS was rampant, many media outlets reported on doctors and nurses in epidemic zones resigning or taking leave, which caused a public uproar. But in reality, far more doctors and nurses fought on the front lines, some even becoming infected with SARS themselves.\n\nZhou Ze's car followed the hospital vehicles, and together they got on the provincial highway.\n\nYancheng really wasn't far from Tongcheng. Coupled with the fact that the Yangtze River Delta region was all flat plains with an incredibly developed transportation network, rescue forces from all over could arrive and provide support very quickly after a natural disaster struck Yancheng. The Wenchuan earthquake back then had suffered greatly from transportation issues; after all, it was a mountainous region, and the traffic situation was truly dire.\n\nIt was precisely after the Wenchuan earthquake that the country had been investing heavily in recent years to rebuild Sichuan's transportation network. If another disaster were to occur, the People's Liberation Army probably wouldn't have to risk their lives parachuting in.\n\nHalf an hour later, traffic on the highway started to back up. The ambulances turned on their sirens and took the emergency lane. Some unruly drivers who had been occupying the emergency lane immediately moved aside when they saw the ambulances behind them. The scene was quite harmonious.\n\nZhou Ze, however, was in an awkward position. As he followed the ambulances, many nearby drivers gave him the middle finger for his shameless lane-cutting.\n\nThis made Zhou Ze consider calling Dr. Lin and asking if he could just get on an ambulance and join the rescue. After all, Dr. Lin knew the level of his medical skills. But on second thought, he decided against it.\n\nLast night, there was the school incident, then the breakfast stall incident, followed by his official promotion. He hadn't slept in two days and was truly exhausted. On this trip, Zhou Ze only wanted to ensure Dr. Lin's safety. If he were to actually participate in the rescue work, it would be too tiring; his body couldn't take it.\n\nBesides, it wasn't like they were short one doctor.\n\nIt had to be said, the life of a bookstore owner since his reanimation in a borrowed body had indeed changed Zhou Ze a lot. His once diligent and conscientious personality had been worn down into laziness.\n\nThe rescue teams from the thirteen cities of Jiangsu, including those from Shanghai, were of course not foolish enough to all head straight for the center of Yancheng. Instead, they were dispatched according to a unified command to various areas that had reported disasters.\n\nDr. Lin's team soon exited the highway and drove into a village under the jurisdiction of Funing County.\n\nAt that moment, hail was still falling from the sky, and there were even small whirlwinds in the distance. It was unclear if they would form into another tornado.\n\nMore than half of the houses in the village had collapsed to varying degrees. The older-style houses had basically all fallen. There were many pedestrians on the road, all with panicked expressions.\n\nAfter all, most of the local elderly had never witnessed such an extreme natural disaster in their entire lives. No one had any experience. They had often seen mudslides, earthquakes, or typhoons happening in other places, but they never expected it to happen to them.\n\nWhen the ambulances arrived, the injured residents spontaneously gathered and orderly received wound treatment and medical care. Not far away, firefighters were searching the collapsed houses for survivors.\n\nZhou Ze parked his car further back. He didn't get out, instead sitting in the car and watching Dr. Lin, who was busy in the tent. Of course, from the looks of it, the situation here was still manageable. The residents' injuries were only minor; it wasn't a big problem.\n\nEven the ones with faces covered in blood only had superficial wounds. Nothing fatal. So there was no need for Zhou Ze to get involved.\n\nAbout half an hour later, a firefighter ran over, announcing that someone was trapped under the collapsed old house over there. The situation might be urgent, and they needed a doctor to assist with the rescue.\n\nDr. Lin and a male doctor immediately ran over. Zhou Ze tossed his cigarette butt and had no choice but to get out of the car.\n\nFirefighters were already excavating under the collapsed old house, but they had clearly run into a problem. Someone was trapped underneath, apparently pinned down. Digging blindly could cause the house to collapse further, endangering the person trapped below.\n\nSome nearby villagers had also spontaneously joined the rescue, but no one dared to act rashly; they could only follow the firefighters' instructions.\n\nWhen Zhou Ze walked over, Dr. Lin was shouting to the trapped person below, trying to determine their physical condition. Her hair tie had fallen out somewhere, and the strong wind was blowing her hair all over the place, but she didn't look messy at all.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of such a chaotic, post-disaster environment, these people in white coats were beautiful in their own right.\n\nA short firefighter walked past Zhou Ze. The notebook in Zhou Ze's pocket suddenly trembled. The intensity of the vibration was no less than it had been for Dr. Lin!\n\nInstinctively, Zhou Ze reached out and put a hand on the man's shoulder.\n\nThe firefighter stopped, surprised, and looked at Zhou Ze. \"What is it?\"\n\n\"You... be careful.\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't know what to say. He was at a loss for words. Was he supposed to say, *Don't go any further, you might die?*\n\nBut if he didn't go, who would?\n\nThe young, short firefighter also paused for a moment.\n\nIt seemed he had never encountered a situation like this before, but a warmth still flowed through his heart. He smiled and said,\n\n\"Got it.\"\n\nThen, the firefighter went to the front and began to tie a rope around himself. Because the collapsed building was originally three stories high, the situation inside was quite complex. After discussion, the fire brigade decided to dispatch a short firefighter to scout a way down first and begin the rescue from the inside.\n\nWatching that firefighter tying the rope around himself, Zhou Ze, standing in the crowd, pursed his lips and kept looking up and down.\n\nSo conflicted.\n\nWhat a pain in the ass.\n\n*If you hadn't walked past me, I wouldn't have known anything. If you ended up sacrificing yourself, I could have just mourned for you and offered my highest respects.*\n\n*But now I can actually foresee that you're going to die.*\n\nZhou Ze decided that after this was over, he had to find a way to shut the notebook off or stop carrying it with him.\n\n\"Fuck!\"\n\nCursing himself for being a meddling fool, Zhou Ze squeezed out of the crowd, walked over to the short firefighter, and also picked up a rope and started tying it around himself.\n\nThe firefighters to the side were stunned. One of them asked, \"Who are you? What are you doing? Don't interfere with the rescue!\"\n\nRescue work really needed to be done by professionals. Many people who participated in rescues out of sheer passion were indeed moving, but such reckless and amateurish behavior could sometimes lead to them and the trapped person ending up in an even more dangerous situation.\n\nDr. Lin also saw Zhou Ze. She didn't know he had been following her car all along and was a bit surprised.\n\n\"I used to be in the special forces. I'm skilled. Let me go down,\" Zhou Ze said calmly.\n\n\"Special forces?\" The captain was taken aback.\n\n\"Yeah, have you seen *Wolf Warrior*?\" Zhou Ze asked in return.\n\n\"*Wolf Warrior*?\"\n\nA dark look crossed the captain's face.\n\n*What the hell are you talking about!*\n\n\"Ask her. She's my wife.\"\n\nZhou Ze pointed to Dr. Lin, who was standing to the side.\n\nThe captain looked at Dr. Lin. She suddenly wanted to laugh. *What does one thing have to do with the other?*\n\nBut she knew Zhou Ze's identity and was well aware that if he was willing to participate in the rescue, he would indeed be much more capable than an ordinary person. So, she nodded and said,\n\n\"Yes, he's retired from the special forces.\"\n\nWith the doctor's guarantee, the captain was reassured. This was a time when they needed all the help they can get, and he was certainly happy to accept help from someone with professional skills.\n\nAt once, the captain pointed to the short firefighter next to Zhou Ze and said,\n\n\"He Li, you go down with this warrior—oh, no... this comrade.\"\n\n\"Yes, Captain.\"\n\n\"Don't. I can go down alone. He'll just get in my way,\" Zhou Ze said lightly.\n\n\"I won't get in the way!\"\n\nHe Li had already secured his safety rope. He walked straight over and, with the help of his comrades, was lowered through a small opening. Before he went down, he shot Zhou Ze a glare.\n\nClearly, he was furious at being looked down on by Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze was truly helpless.\n\n*I'm already rushing to make a selfless contribution, and I still can't stop you from marching to your death?*\n\n*From now on, whoever wants to be an unsung hero can go ahead. It's too damn frustrating.*\n\nZhou Ze had no choice but to quickly tie his safety rope and go down as well. The space below was incredibly tight. Zhou Ze and the firefighter named He Li were about two meters apart. Both were looking for footholds to descend further, trying to make contact with the trapped victims below first.\n\n\"Waaah...\"\n\nNot long after going down, Zhou Ze heard a baby crying from below.\n\n\"Hello? Hello!\" Zhou Ze shouted down.\n\n\"We're down here,\" someone shouted back.\n\n\"Don't move! We're coming down to get you out right now. Don't make any sudden moves...\" He Li was also shouting.\n\n\"My leg is pinned. My daughter-in-law and my grandson are also over there. Save them first, save them,\" the voice from below said. It sounded like an old man.\n\n\"Sir, don't worry, we've already started the rescue...\"\n\n*CRASH...*\n\nA sound of something being pushed away came from below.\n\nThe old man below seemed to have heard his grandson's cries and was trying to push off the debris on top of him to check on his daughter-in-law and grandson.\n\nBut this clearly illegally constructed three-story building was already in a precarious state. The moment he moved, the entire structure was affected. Zhou Ze could feel the concrete slab under his feet starting to tremble again.\n\n\"Sir, don't move! Don't move! We're coming down, we're almost there!\"\n\nBut the movement below continued.\n\n\"You fucking old fool, stay the hell still!\" Zhou Ze roared.\n\nSure enough, swearing was more effective. The old man below immediately stopped moving.\n\nZhou Ze used his fingernails to snap several steel bars that were in the way and even pried open a concrete seam. He quickly descended. Not far from him, a woman lay there, holding a baby. Blood was flowing from her head. She wasn't dead, but she was clearly disoriented.\n\n\"Give me the baby first, the baby!\" Zhou Ze shouted to the woman.\n\nThe woman's gaze cleared slightly. She struggled to crawl over and passed the baby to Zhou Ze through a gap between slabs. She knew that the sooner the rescuers got the baby out, the sooner the baby would be out of danger.\n\nZhou Ze took the baby and passed it through the steel bars to He Li beside him, yelling, \"You take the baby up first!\"\n\n\"You take the baby and go up first!\" He Li said.\n\n\"Piss off, you go up first!\"\n\nZhou Ze's attitude was firm. He didn't know if the other trapped people could be saved, but if this firefighter stayed down here any longer, he was very likely going to be a goner.\n\nForced by Zhou Ze's attitude, He Li had no choice but to take the baby and head back up the way they came.\n\nZhou Ze, meanwhile, continued to tear away obstacles with his fingernails and pulled the woman out. He then untied the safety rope from his own body, tied it around her, and signaled to those above to pull her up, shouting at the same time,\n\n\"Is the baby up yet?\"\n\n\"The baby's up! Be careful down there!\" Dr. Lin shouted from above. \"The wind is picking up again, be careful.\"\n\n*Heh heh.*\n\n*Even though we're basically getting a divorce, hearing my wife worry about me like this is actually quite nice.*\n\nZhou Ze gave the woman a push from below, and she was finally, slowly, pulled up.\n\nAlright, just one old baby left.\n\nZhou Ze moved through the debris and saw the old man sitting on the ground with a miserable look on his face. A wooden plank was pinning his leg, its ends held down firmly by concrete slabs.\n\n\"Comrade, you go on out first. I'm not in a hurry. This building is about to collapse.\"\n\nZhou Ze shot him a look.\n\n*A moment ago you were moving around down here, nearly getting us all killed, and now you're trying to be a saint?*\n\n\"Don't talk. I'll lift the plank. You try to pull your leg out.\"\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\nZhou Ze used his fingernails to pry open the gap in the concrete slab. At that moment, a sharp pain shot through his fingertips. Zhou Ze looked down and saw that all ten of his fingers were already bleeding.\n\nAs miraculous as these nails were, they weren't a power drill, after all. Constantly going up against steel bars and concrete was taking its toll.\n\n\"Harder!\"\n\nZhou Ze lifted the wooden plank with both hands.\n\n\"My leg is out! It's out!\" the old man shouted.\n\n\"Can you still move?\"\n\n\"Yes, my leg's not broken. I can move.\"\n\n\"Good. Follow this path, you climb up first. Grab that rope.\"\n\n...\n\n\"You're injured. Let me treat your wounds.\"\n\nA female nurse was treating He Li's injuries.\n\nDown below, He Li had gotten several cuts from sharp debris.\n\n\"I'm fine. I have to go back down and save people,\" He Li refused.\n\n\"Don't move. The woman is out too, there's only one person left down there. You don't need to go back down. Your wounds must be treated immediately, what if they get infected?\" the nurse insisted.\n\nHe Li had no choice but to let her treat his wounds.\n\nAt that moment, the wind picked up again, much stronger than before. The tent flapped violently, sounding as if it could be blown away at any moment.\n\nHe Li suddenly saw the tree that had been tilted by the wind earlier start to sway again. He immediately pushed away the nurse who was treating his wounds and rushed out.\n\nThe nurse was pushed to the ground. \"What are you doing!\" she said, annoyed.\n\nThat tree couldn't be allowed to fall. Its path was directly toward the collapsed house. If the tree smashed into it, the already teetering structure would surely face a second collapse.\n\nHaving been down there, He Li knew that the situation below was unstable, with many areas having unbalanced load-bearing points.\n\n*Creeeak...*\n\nThe large tree began to topple. It could no longer support itself.\n\nOthers nearby also noticed, but they didn't have time to react. They could only watch as the tree slowly fell.\n\nAt that moment, a short figure rushed out. He ran into the path of the falling tree.\n\n*THUD!*\n\nThe trunk of the tree slammed onto his shoulder. He immediately spat out a mouthful of blood and fell to his knees. His knees smashed into the ground, which even caved in slightly, but because he had slowed its descent, the tree did not crash directly to the ground.\n\nThe surrounding firefighters and villagers immediately rushed over, grabbing the tree, trying every which way to move it aside.\n\nThe tree was finally moved safely to the ground.\n\nBut the short figure kneeling on the ground...\n\n...would never stand up again.\n\nThe old man was pulled up.\n\nThen, Zhou Ze came up too.\n\nDr. Lin ran over, crying, and hugged Zhou Ze. At that moment, Zhou Ze was covered in dust and debris, but Dr. Lin didn't mind at all.\n\nPatting Dr. Lin on the back, Zhou Ze signaled that he was okay.\n\nExcept for his fingernails.\n\nThey hurt like hell.\n\n\"Phew...\"\n\nHe let out a long breath.\n\nDr. Lin began to check Zhou Ze's body for any wounds that needed treatment.\n\nZhou Ze, however, fumbled in his pocket for a crushed, deformed cigarette, lit it, and asked,\n\n\"Where's that short firefighter?\"\n\n*He came up a while ago, he should be fine, right? If he's okay, then you should be okay too.*\n\n*This crappy notebook is definitely no match for the premonitions in the* Final Destination *movies; it's not that mystical. After all, it's a cheap knockoff.*\n\nHearing his words, Dr. Lin's body suddenly stiffened.\n\nZhou Ze's brow slowly furrowed. He asked,\n\n\"Where is that firefighter?\"\n\nWhen Zhou Ze walked over to the tent and saw the small body covered by a white sheet, he instinctively crushed the lit cigarette he was holding into his palm. Then he abruptly grabbed Dr. Lin's hand and dragged her toward his car.\n\n\"What are you doing? What are you doing... you're hurting me.\"\n\n\"Come with me. Leave this place with me!\"\n\n\"I still have to work. I have to keep saving people,\" Dr. Lin retorted.\n\nZhou Ze's gaze swept over Dr. Lin.\n\nDr. Lin saw that Zhou Ze's eyes were filled with bloodshot veins. It was terrifying.\n\nAt the same time, Zhou Ze put one hand around Dr. Lin's head, pressing her face against his chest. To an outsider, it might have looked like a young couple having an intimate conversation.\n\nBut what Zhou Ze said was:\n\n\"If you don't come with me,\n\nright now,\n\nI will kill you.\"",

    "title": "Chapter 150: Knock on the door when accidental!",
    "content": "In the Nissan, Zhou Ze sat in the driver's seat, with Dr. Lin in the passenger seat.\n\nNormally, for a newlywed couple, young and full of vigor, sitting together in a car could easily lead to something intimate. Under the influence of sparks flying like heaven's thunder striking earth's fire, even the car itself might tremble in acknowledgement.\n\nBut here and now, the atmosphere was somewhat awkward.\n\nZhou Ze continued to smoke, the image of the short firefighter replaying in his mind.\n\nHe felt a pang of sorrow. The firefighter had probably died still holding some resentment and hatred for him, because Zhou Ze had mocked him to his face. Yet at the final moment, he had held up the massive tree with his own frail shoulders.\n\nOtherwise, if that building had collapsed again, he and the old man would likely have never made it out.\n\nZhou Ze knew his own situation perfectly well. His body was made of flesh and blood. Even as an Underworld Bailiff, he would have died in that environment. He might have had a sliver of a chance if he’d entered his zombie state, but at the time, it was completely unexpected, and he wouldn’t have had time to enter that state anyway.\n\nSo, when it came down to it, that firefighter had saved his life.\n\nHe had intended to save him, but in the end, he was the one who was saved.\n\nThis feeling made Zhou Ze sigh with emotion. But at the same time, the firefighter’s sacrifice made him agonize over the predictive power of that damn notebook.\n\nDr. Lin… was she also destined to die?\n\n*If King Yama bids you die at the third watch, who dares keep you till the fifth?*\n\nZhou Ze had already tossed the notebook into the car. He had no intention of carrying it with him anymore. Otherwise, in the future, walking down the street, he’d see that this person was about to die, that one might die, and he’d end up more exhausted than those superheroes with their bleeding hearts.\n\nOut of sight, out of mind. Birth, old age, sickness, and death are the norm of human existence. You can all just handle it yourselves.\n\nDr. Lin bit her lip, unsure of what to say. Zhou Ze's forceful attitude made her a little uncomfortable, but she also knew that he wouldn't be acting like this if something truly serious wasn't about to happen.\n\n\"Can… you explain it to me clearly? What exactly is going on?\" Dr. Lin asked. She wanted an explanation.\n\nZhou Ze licked his lips and said, \"I have something that can predict a person's recent life or death. It predicted that you are going to die very soon. Before this, it predicted that the firefighter would die. I tried to save him, but he still died in the end.\"\n\nHearing this, Dr. Lin's expression grew heavy.\n\nShe didn't argue with Zhou Ze, nor did she forcefully demand he let her out of the car, shouting that even if she had to die, she would die at her post, that there were still so many injured people who needed her.\n\nShe was very calm.\n\nAfter hearing Zhou Ze's explanation, she calmly accepted his arrangements.\n\nZhou Ze was very satisfied with this. It was also Dr. Lin's most attractive quality; she was truly gentle and understanding. When he was with her, she always knew how to make him feel at ease.\n\nHe reached out and took Dr. Lin's hand. Sensing her palm was a little cold, Zhou Ze smiled.\n\n\"I'm by your side. It's okay.\"\n\nDr. Lin nodded and continued to sit in the passenger seat. But then, as if a thought occurred to her, she said, \"Will I affect you?\"\n\nDr. Lin was worried that Zhou Ze would get into an accident trying to save her.\n\n\"We're not divorced yet, after all.\"\n\nDr. Lin said no more, continuing to sit there quietly.\n\nThe rescue efforts over there had quickly gotten on track. Although the wind was still strong, the extreme tornado-like conditions from before were no longer occurring. With the arrival of rescue teams from various regions, the disaster relief work was proceeding in an orderly fashion.\n\nSomeone from the hospital came to ask about Dr. Lin's situation, but Zhou Ze turned them away, using the excuse that his wife wasn't feeling well.\n\nWell, given Zhou Ze's earlier action-hero-like performance saving people, the hospital staff wouldn't say anything about Dr. Lin's absence. After all, the couple had already done more than enough.\n\nThere were some snacks and water in the car. Zhou Ze had Dr. Lin eat something while he took out his phone and dialed the little loli's number.\n\nThe call connected quickly, and the little loli's disgruntled voice came through.\n\n\"I found the priest for you, but when are you coming back? What if he runs away? Do you know how many times I was almost discovered while tailing him? He's probably already on alert…\"\n\n\"Shut up.\"\n\nThe little loli immediately fell silent.\n\n\"I have a Book of Yin and Yang in my hands. They say it's something used by the Underworld Judges.\"\n\n\"You really found that thing?\"\n\nThe little loli had actually guessed something of the sort when she saw Sun Qiu's spirit, which was why she thought Zhou Ze would most likely die there.\n\nBut what she hadn't expected was that not only did Zhou Ze survive unscathed, he had even gotten his hands on the item.\n\nThis was absolutely shocking.\n\nOne had to know that the hierarchy of the Underworld was strict, and Underworld Bailiffs were the lowest rank in the sequence.\n\nIt was a bit like two low-level soldiers guarding a city gate, and one day, one of them pulls out the Heirloom Seal of the Realm to show off to the other.\n\n\"It… can it predict life and death?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"It can sense life and death,\" the little loli corrected him.\n\n\"Is it 100% accurate?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"I'm not sure about that, but its accuracy should be relatively high. However, it can't be 100% accurate. Even the Books of Life and Death held by the Ten Yama Kings can have errors, let alone something from the level of an Underworld Judge. Besides, if I'm not mistaken, the Book of Yin and Yang you have should be damaged, its quality degraded?\"\n\n\"Right.\"\n\n\"Then it's probably not that accurate.\"\n\n\"Alright.\"\n\nWith that, Zhou Ze hung up the phone.\n\nIn the bookstore, the little loli was so angry she slammed her phone on the table!\n\nWhat kind of person was this!\n\nHe just hangs up the moment he's done talking? He comes to me when he needs something solved and kicks me away when he doesn't?\n\nShe had even been thinking of reminding him that since he'd gone to another city, he should greet the local Underworld Bailiff, or else it would be seen as a provocation.\n\nMoreover, they had just suffered a natural disaster over there and were probably dizzy with work. An outside Bailiff showing up without a word of warning beforehand could easily cause a misunderstanding.\n\nForget it.\n\nYou're on your own.\n\nThis lady is done waiting on you.\n\n***\n\n\"You eat something too.\"\n\nDr. Lin handed a piece of bread to Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze took the bread and took a difficult bite, chewing with extreme agony.\n\n\"Let's just stay here for now,\" Zhou Ze said. \"I don't feel safe driving home like this.\"\n\nDr. Lin nodded in agreement.\n\nBy dusk, Zhou Ze had Dr. Lin sleep for a while to rest. He himself stood outside the car.\n\nThe rescue teams had already left the village to help in other disaster areas. For now, the village was relatively quiet. Half the houses, being of better quality, hadn't been blown down, and many villagers were taking shelter in them. Others had already gone to stay with relatives.\n\nZhou Ze stretched. He had a feeling that if they could make it to tomorrow still safe and sound, this crisis would probably be considered over.\n\nWhen Zhou Ze looked into the car, Dr. Lin was on the phone, telling her little sister to do her homework properly and not get distracted by watching TV.\n\nZhou Ze found himself thinking that if the Underworld Bailiff who had possessed his sister-in-law were still around, he would have someone to share the burden with right now. After all, they were aligned on the matter of protecting Dr. Lin.\n\nUnfortunately, some things were just wishful thinking. Zhou Ze didn't regret killing that Bailiff.\n\nAs night deepened, Zhou Ze got back into the car and turned on the interior light.\n\nDr. Lin fell asleep after her phone call. Zhou Ze kept his eyes open, watching their surroundings.\n\nHonestly, if it was something like in *Final Destination*, where all sorts of unbelievable coincidences string together to ensure you die in an accident, then there was really no way to fight it. But he figured it probably wouldn't be that terrifying.\n\nSometime late at night, Zhou Ze, who was exhausted but couldn't sleep a wink without Bai Yingying by his side, suddenly heard the sound of tools striking something.\n\nIt was very close.\n\nJust a short distance in front of where the car was parked, where another two-story building had been flattened by the tornado.\n\nIt was probably villagers trying to salvage their property from inside their collapsed house. Zhou Ze had no intention of being a busybody. At a time like this, he couldn't possibly leave Dr. Lin alone here and run outside to ask if they needed help or something.\n\nJust then, Dr. Lin, who had slept for a while, woke up. She looked at Zhou Ze with a pained expression and reached over to drape her own coat over his body.\n\n\"I'm not cold,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Mm.\"\n\n\"What's wrong?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"I need to… relieve myself.\"\n\n\"I'll go with you.\"\n\nZhou Ze looked around.\n\n\"Right there in the grass behind the car. No one will see.\"\n\nDr. Lin was a little embarrassed, but she nodded nonetheless.\n\nThen, Zhou Ze got out of the car with her.\n\nDr. Lin hesitated for a moment, but she didn't try to hide anything, nor did she ask Zhou Ze to turn around. Right in front of him, she pulled down her pants and squatted.\n\nIn many horror movies, this kind of idiotic plot point always appears. The characters know the vicinity is dangerous, but when a girl in the group needs to pee, she still foolishly tells her protector to turn around and not look.\n\n*It's embarrassing, you know~*\n\nAnd then, the accident happens right at that moment.\n\nZhou Ze certainly wouldn't repeat that kind of moronic plot and setup.\n\nSo, he stood ramrod straight, and watched!\n\nWatched intently!\n\nWatched carefully!\n\nTo ensure her safety.\n\nSafety first!\n\nSoon, Dr. Lin stood up, her cheeks flushed, and walked back to the car with Zhou Ze.\n\n\"You get in first. I'll grab some water from the trunk.\"\n\nDr. Lin obediently got into the car first, settling into the passenger seat.\n\nOnly, the moment she sat down, her body suddenly stiffened.\n\n\"What do you want to drink? Lao Xu stored a lot of stuff back here. There are sodas, mineral water, and milk.\"\n\nZhou Ze called out from the back.\n\nDr. Lin didn't answer.\n\nBecause she had discovered that in the driver's seat, someone had already gotten in, without her knowing when.\n\nAnd this person looked exactly like Zhou Ze. He was now turning his head, smiling at her, and saying softly, \"Hey, he's asking you. What do you want to drink?\"",

    "content": "The man in the driver's seat did indeed look exactly like Zhou Ze, but Dr. Lin knew the real Zhou Ze was at the trunk getting drinks.\n\nCoupled with what Zhou Ze had told her earlier, she knew that danger could strike at any moment. And now, it had.\n\nThe man was holding a notebook, the same one Zhou Ze had been holding earlier. He was toying with it, seemingly very interested, but he didn't open it, merely flipping it over and over in his hands.\n\nHowever, he looked at Dr. Lin far more often than he looked at the notebook. Clearly, in his eyes, Dr. Lin was more important.\n\n\"Heh.\"\n\nThe man let out a soft chuckle and leaned back slightly.\n\nThen, a wisp of green smoke drifted from his mouth, thick with a hallucinogenic effect. Dr. Lin wanted to call out to Zhou Ze behind them, to warn him, but she lost consciousness in an instant.\n\nIt all happened too quickly, giving her no time to think or react. She was just an ordinary person, not some special forces operative or a queenly figure.\n\nThe man leisurely straightened his clothes, pushed open the car door, and stepped out.\n\nThe moment he got out, his entire being transformed into the likeness of Dr. Lin—her clothes, her disposition, everything was a perfect match, without a single flaw.\n\nEven the blush that had not yet completely faded from her cheeks was still there.\n\nThis was enough to show that he was an absolute perfectionist, someone who nitpicked every detail.\n\nUnlike the Faceless Woman, his transformation was more like a refined art, while hers was a simple and crude application of change.\n\nHe walked to the back of the car and saw Zhou Ze, who had just closed the trunk and was holding the drinks.\n\n\"What's wrong?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"I'm a little scared,\" he said, his voice identical to Dr. Lin's, very gentle.\n\n\"I'm here, don't be afraid.\"\n\nWith that,\n\nZhou Ze put down the drinks and pulled him directly into an embrace.\n\n\"...\" Him.\n\nSimple.\n\nCrude.\n\nEven he was caught completely off guard.\n\nFeeling the warmth from another man's body, a flash of irritation and disgust appeared in his eyes. But he didn't resist. Instead, in that instant,\n\nHe opened his mouth.\n\n\"Pfft!\"\n\nBefore the green smoke could be exhaled,\n\nA hand clamped down over his lips, pressing down hard.\n\nZhou Ze turned his head to look at him, a faint, unreadable smile on his face.\n\nHe was a little bewildered, but more importantly, the green smoke in his mouth could neither be coughed out nor swallowed, which was extremely uncomfortable.\n\n\"Thump!\"\n\nA knee smashed heavily into his abdomen. He opened his mouth and let out a grunt of pain, his body curling up on the ground.\n\nHe was confused. He looked up at Zhou Ze.\n\n\"On the road to the Yellow Springs, there's a woman who loves to cosplay as other people. Sorry, but I've been trained by her. So, I guess it's just your bad luck. Now, whenever someone tries to get close to me by imitating someone I know, I get a special premonition.\"\n\nHaving undergone the \"special training\" of the Faceless Woman, Zhou Ze's sensitivity in that area had been completely awakened, almost like an instinct.\n\nZhou Ze reached out and grabbed him by the neck. His body was somewhat weak, still in Dr. Lin's form. Dragging him to the car door, Zhou Ze checked on Dr. Lin and saw that she was only asleep and not in any serious danger.\n\nBeing dragged like a dead dog by Zhou Ze, his body twitched slightly.\n\nZhou Ze let go. He fell to the ground, smoke rising from all over his body, like an otaku's girlfriend deflating, and his whole form began to shrivel.\n\nIn the distance,\n\nA man and a woman approached. The man was tall, about one meter ninety, wearing military camo that showed off his muscular arms. He looked very strong.\n\nThe woman was short, with a face full of freckles. She was chewing gum, constantly blowing bubbles.\n\nA wisp of green smoke slowly coalesced behind the woman, forming the figure of a woman in a long, green dress. She stood behind the pair, looking timid and seemingly terrified that her discovery had led to the mission's failure.\n\nStill, she lowered her head and whispered something to the tall man and the woman.\n\nThe tall man rolled his neck, letting out a series of sharp cracks from his joints. He then clenched his fists. He said nothing, but this was a form of intimidation in itself.\n\nThe freckled woman, however, took the gum out of her mouth, casually stuck it onto her male companion's muscular arm, and took a few steps forward. She looked at Zhou Ze and asked with a smile:\n\n\"Brother, you've crossed the line.\"\n\n*Are they the local Ghost Messengers?*\n\nZhou Ze wasn't entirely clear on how Ghost Messengers from one place were supposed to interact with those from another, nor did he understand the unwritten rules between them. Of the two Ghost Messengers he knew,\n\nOne was killed by him.\n\nOne was captured by him.\n\nIt seemed that when it came to his peers, Zhou Ze had always been that simple and crude.\n\nThe little loli had meant to remind Zhou Ze to greet the local Ghost Messengers when he got to Yancheng, just as the Bald Monk had first come to visit Zhou Ze when he arrived in Tongcheng.\n\nSometimes, a greeting, a heads-up, could prevent a lot of trouble.\n\nBut Zhou Ze had hung up the phone directly at the time, so the little loli's reminder was never spoken. And perhaps, even if the little loli had said it, Zhou Ze wouldn't have abandoned Dr. Lin to go \"party\" with his Yancheng peers.\n\nBesides, in Zhou Ze's view, the other party had struck first. Their previous posture clearly indicated they wanted that female ghost to knock both him and Dr. Lin out.\n\n\"So what if I did?\"\n\nFaced with their questioning, Zhou Ze retorted.\n\nHe was here to save someone, to save Dr. Lin. At the same time, he had also saved a family. He wasn't here to steal things or act like a bandit.\n\n\"Brother, with that tone of yours, you'd make me think you were the Lord Inspector himself gracing us with his presence.\"\n\nThe freckled woman smiled faintly, then reached up to part her hair, adding:\n\n\"Leave the woman in the car. You can go. We can overlook the matter of you crossing the line without giving notice.\"\n\nZhou Ze looked at her.\n\nHe said nothing.\n\nAt first, the freckled girl thought Zhou Ze was considering it.\n\nBut slowly,\n\nThe freckled girl realized Zhou Ze's gaze was like he was looking at a complete idiot.\n\nYou couldn't blame Zhou Ze. He really didn't know how to get along with his peers. He had no concept of these unwritten rules and so-called forbidden territories.\n\nPerhaps Zhou Ze's greatest impression of the Ghost Messenger community came from the one who returned from Rongcheng seriously injured.\n\nIn a single night, one person had killed dozens of Ghost Messengers. Their credentials had fallen to the ground like cabbages by the roadside, a handful for the taking.\n\nSo, it was very likely that Zhou Ze's perspective had been warped back then.\n\nHe always felt that his peers were just small fries, like mobs in a video game that give free EXP.\n\n\"This woman, we must keep her. She has something on her that we want.\"\n\nWith that,\n\nThe freckled girl took a step forward.\n\nWith a single stride,\n\nA gust of yin wind swept over, carrying a greasy thickness.\n\nZhou Ze felt his body suddenly grow heavy, and the air around him instantly became incredibly thin.\n\nThe tall man also walked over at this moment, closing in on Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze extended his nails,\n\nBut his opponent was faster, directly seizing Zhou Ze's wrist and twisting it back.\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nZhou Ze's entire body was slammed against the car door, which dented from the impact.\n\nThe little loli had once filled Zhou Ze with immense terror,\n\nBut now, the little loli was being kept by him.\n\nAnd now, that feeling of dread, of being dominated by a veteran Ghost Messenger, seemed to be washing over him again.\n\nThe tall man smiled at Zhou Ze and reached out to pinch his neck.\n\n\"You should have just stayed in your Tongcheng. What are you doing running around? And bringing her with you, no less. You're basically parading a car full of treasure in front of a den of bandits. Are you deliberately looking for thrills?\"\n\n\"Her... what about her?\"\n\nZhou Ze was very confused.\n\nIf they were after his notebook, that would be easy to understand. After all, it was the Judge's Yin-Yang Registry; even in a degraded state, it was still the Yin-Yang Registry.\n\nBut the other party seemed to be valuing the casket over the pearls,¹ focusing on Dr. Lin instead.\n\nWhat was wrong with Dr. Lin?\n\n\"A person blessed by a Ghost Messenger who sacrificed their own merits to do so... what do you think she signifies?\"\n\nThe freckled girl glanced at Zhou Ze.\n\n\"A rookie is a rookie. You can't even see this. Or maybe, you can see it, but you've been pretending not to, trying to play out some kind of clichéd ghost-human love story?\n\n\"You are a ghost, a dead person, not a person of the living world. Having too many attachments to ordinary living people will only harm her. This is a piece of advice for you, little boy.\"\n\nThe freckled girl took the gum from the tall man's arm, put it back in her mouth to chew, then opened the car door and looked at the unconscious Dr. Lin inside.\n\n\"I'm curious. The Ghost Messenger who willingly gave up so much just to bless her must have been a higher rank than us. To be so generous.\"\n\nZhou Ze knew that the Ghost Messenger the freckled girl was talking about must have been the one who had possessed his sister-in-law. It was natural that she was good to Dr. Lin.\n\nIn fact, she had been so good to the point of obsession. He himself was where he was today thanks to her.\n\nZhou Ze seemed to recall that when he killed her, her Ghost Messenger credential was on the verge of collapsing and wasn't left behind in the end. Did this mean that she had already overdrawn it before?\n\nOverdrawn it on this \"blessing\" the freckled girl spoke of?\n\n\"Don't touch her,\"\n\nZhou Ze said.\n\nThe tall man, who was pinching Zhou Ze's neck, couldn't help but be amused that Zhou Ze was still issuing warnings and threats at a time like this.\n\n\"Of course we won't kill her. We just want the blessing on her. We're Ghost Messengers, law enforcers of the underworld. We definitely won't kill living people.\n\n\"Rest assured. Even though you're a rookie, you're still our peer. We'll give you that much face. At worst, she'll just get very sick, and after a year or two of recovery, she'll be fine.\"\n\nThe tall man reached out and patted Zhou Ze's face, sighing in admiration.\n\n\"This skin you chose is really good, much more handsome than this big oaf of mine. I'm actually a little envious of you.\"\n\nThe freckled girl spat the re-chewed gum into her palm and then moved to place it on Dr. Lin's forehead.\n\n\"Hey, be careful. Don't suck her soul out. If you actually kill her, you and I will have to take the blame together,\" the tall man reminded her.\n\n\"Relax. She's such a beautiful woman, I couldn't bear to kill her either.\"\n\nSaying this,\n\nThe freckled girl deliberately glanced at the \"little boy\" beside her.\n\n\"She is, after all, the female lead in our peer's little ghost-human love story. What do you say...\"\n\nShe suddenly froze.\n\nBecause she saw the rookie, who was being held by the neck and controlled by her partner,\n\nHis baleful aura,\n\nWas growing thicker and thicker...\n\n***\n\n**Footnotes:**\n\n1.  **Valuing the casket over the pearls:** A Chinese idiom (買櫝還珠, mǎi dú huán zhū) that means prioritizing the less valuable item over the more valuable one.",

    "content": "The tall man only felt a bone-piercing chill spread from his palm. He subconsciously wanted to let go, because the coldness seemed to have penetrated his flesh and stimulated his very soul, making him feel a terrifying throb.\n\nAnd yet,\n\nHe couldn't pull his hand back.\n\nBefore, he was the one choking Zhou Ze with his hand.\n\nBut now, it was Zhou Ze who had deliberately lowered his chin, pinning the man's hand fast against his own neck.\n\nThe freckled girl stood up straight, looking at Zhou Ze. She was smart, very rational. The moment this incredible, malevolent aura rose from Zhou Ze, she began to size up the situation.\n\nShe immediately smiled and said:\n\n\"Sir, if you are a Constable or an Inspector on a plainclothes patrol, just reveal your identity. We'll offer our amends and apologies as needed. As for today's incident, how about we just pretend it never happened?\"\n\nThose who have died once are always smarter than the living, better at knowing which way the wind blows.\n\nJust as the little loli who had returned gravely injured had submitted before Zhou Ze, it was precisely because they had died that they deeply understood what a precious opportunity it was to continue clinging to this life.\n\nHell... what a truly terrifying place.\n\nIf it were the Zhou Ze from before, he might have really taken the olive branch. But unfortunately, the current Zhou Ze had already lost his sanity.\n\nA coppery bronze luster began to rise on his skin, dyeing his entire body.\n\nTwo fangs slowly grew out, revealing a glaring coldness.\n\nA ghastly green face,\n\nEyes silent and soundless,\n\ncarrying a natural iciness.\n\n\"Crunch…\"\n\n\"Aaargh!\"\n\nThe tall man let out a cry of pain.\n\nZhou Ze's two fangs pierced directly into the back of his hand. In an instant, the man's entire body began to convulse. It seemed as if this one bite had crippled most of his physical body.\n\nThe tall man kicked out, wanting to send Zhou Ze flying, or at least break free from him. However, his foot was caught by one of Zhou Ze's hands.\n\nHe wanted to kick, he wanted to use all his strength,\n\nbut his foot wouldn't budge.\n\nThis young man, whose face he had just been patting while calling him a handsome pretty boy, now seemed to contain a terrifying strength within his body, completely overpowering him.\n\nZhou Ze lifted his head.\n\nWith a *schlick*,\n\nthe fangs tore a large piece of flesh from the back of the tall man's hand.\n\nAt the same time, Zhou Ze's fingernails turned a dark red. The five fingers gripping the man's shoe began to squeeze.\n\n\"Pop!\"\n\nA crisp snap,\n\nlike a small firecracker set off by a child during New Year's, it exploded.\n\nThe tall man's shoe burst open, and his foot disintegrated along with it.\n\nThe tall man backed away, his face filled with terror, and fell to the ground.\n\nZhou Ze, his head slightly lowered and body tilted, looked at him.\n\nHis gaze was as placid as an old well.\n\nAfter a moment, Zhou Ze raised his hand, looked at his palm with some disgust, and crouched down to wipe it on the man's body.\n\n*What if he has athlete's foot?*\n\n*What then?*\n\nIt seemed some habits were truly impossible to change.\n\nFor example,\n\nbeing a neat freak?\n\nThe tall man lay there on his back, not daring to move. Their positions had now been completely reversed.\n\n\"Buddy, we can talk this out. You know it too, even for a Ghost Envoy, we only get one chance to choose a body,\" the freckled woman said to Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze didn't respond, as if the woman didn't exist at all.\n\nHis hand slowly came to rest on the man's chest. His fingertips gently drew a line down from the man's neck.\n\nHis fingernails were like the sharpest of scalpels.\n\nWith the crisp sound of tearing leather,\n\nthe tall man's chest was sliced completely open, yet not even a drop of blood flowed out. His nails were just that sharp!\n\nThe tall man looked at the woman beside him, his eyes pleading for help.\n\nThe freckled woman could no longer remain calm. She opened her palm, and the surrounding air stagnated once more. An immense pressure began to bear down on Zhou Ze.\n\n\"ROAR!\"\n\nA suppressed roar escaped Zhou Ze's throat. The black mist around him instantly boiled, and even the air seemed to be dyed with a torturous heat.\n\nThe freckled woman staggered, took two steps back, and collapsed to the ground.\n\nHer gaze, as she looked at Zhou Ze, was filled with a terror that came from the depths of her soul.\n\n*Damn it,*\n\n*is this still a Ghost Envoy?!*\n\n*How could this possibly be a Ghost Envoy!*\n\nAt that moment, the freckled girl truly had the feeling of \"there's a traitor among us.\"\n\nPeople used to joke about a husky showing up in a wolf pack; now it was the other way around. A real prairie wolf had infiltrated a pack of huskies.\n\nZhou Ze crouched beside the tall man, wisps of black smoke continuously emitting from him. If one looked closely, they would see that the tall man's head and limbs were completely bound by the black smoke, rendering him unable to move.\n\nZhou Ze was a doctor,\n\nso he was very experienced when it came to performing surgery.\n\nHe carefully examined the tall man's lesions.\n\nThe liver,\n\nthe lungs,\n\nthe intestines...\n\none by one, he took them out,\n\ndangled them in front of the tall man,\n\nand then,\n\ntossed them aside.\n\nIt would have been even better if there were a few medical students nearby to take photos and notes, and incidentally shower their teacher with compliments like \"66666¹.\"\n\nHeaven have mercy, the tall man was simply stunned speechless. But he couldn't pass out, and he was already so numb he couldn't feel the slightest pain. This was the most agonizing torture—being forced to watch with your own eyes!\n\nZhou Ze continued to do as he pleased, like a boy who had discovered a novel new toy.\n\n*It's been a long time since I've played this game of studying the human body.*\n\n*I kind of miss it.*\n\n*Yes,*\n\n*this is the feeling.*\n\n*The human body is truly the most wonderful thing in the world.*\n\n*Its harmony,*\n\n*its aesthetic,*\n\n*the structure of every single blood vessel, all so masterfully crafted, forming the architecture of life, bearing the weight of the soul.*\n\n\"He's a Ghost Envoy, you can't kill him! Aren't you afraid of punishment from the Underworld?!\" the freckled woman, collapsed on the ground, screamed.\n\nShe was about to be driven mad.\n\nTruly, she was about to be driven mad.\n\nThe scene before her,\n\nthe atmosphere,\n\nit was even more of a hellish battlefield than the ones in Hell!\n\n\"We didn't want to kill her! We said, we didn't want to kill her! We were wrong, but our crime doesn't deserve death! We didn't want to make a mortal enemy of you, really! We didn't want to kill anyone, and we didn't want to kill you! You're the one who crossed the line! You crossed the line without any warning! You're at fault too, you're at fault too!\" the freckled girl continued to shout.\n\nZhou Ze turned a deaf ear, continuing his work. A moment later, he clapped his hands. The examination was over.\n\nThen,\n\nhe lowered his head,\n\nopened his mouth,\n\nand began to inhale.\n\n\"Hissss…\"\n\nIt was like splashing a bowl of water into a wok of boiling oil—an instant explosion.\n\nThe tall man's black soul was sucked out and disappeared into Zhou Ze's mouth.\n\nHis corpse began to rapidly decay, melting into a pool of pus.\n\nZhou Ze lifted his head,\n\nhis eyes closed.\n\n*The taste of a soul...*\n\n*so delicious.*\n\nSlowly, Zhou Ze stood up and walked over to the freckled girl.\n\nThe freckled girl instinctively scrambled backward. She was afraid, truly afraid. Not even before Lord Inspector had she ever felt such a clear and distinct fear!\n\nZhou Ze tilted his head, walking forward slowly, but he was still faster than her crawling.\n\nSlowly,\n\nZhou Ze caught up to her.\n\nSlowly,\n\nZhou Ze walked to her side.\n\nSlowly,\n\nZhou Ze lifted his foot.\n\nSlowly,\n\nZhou Ze brought his foot down, stomping on her abdomen.\n\nEverything was slow, like a graceful and melodious piano piece, carrying its own unique rhythm.\n\n\"Squelch…\"\n\nOne stomp,\n\npierced right through,\n\nlike a nail,\n\nhe pinned the woman directly to the ground.\n\nThe woman coughed up bloody foam, her body twitching and contorting uncontrollably.\n\n*I said so much,*\n\n*analyzed so much for you,*\n\n*reasoned with you so much,*\n\n*told you all about the consequences,*\n\n*and you're still going to kill me just like that.*\n\n*But could you, from beginning to end,*\n\n*not say,*\n\n*a single word?*\n\nThis was the source of the freckled woman's greatest indignation. It was as if, in his eyes, the two of them were ants not even worthy of a conversation.\n\nZhou Ze had already delivered the first stomp.\n\nHe let out a burp.\n\nHe looked a bit helpless.\n\nFacing a delicious meal after you're already full is a truly vexing problem.\n\nThen,\n\nhe lifted his foot again.\n\nStill slowly lifting,\n\nstill slowly falling.\n\n\"SPLAT!\"\n\nHer head exploded,\n\nsolving the woman's troubles with her freckles.\n\nIn the same motion, the woman's soul was crushed by the surrounding black mist. Her corpse also rapidly decayed, merging with the ground around it.\n\nAfterward,\n\nZhou Ze seemed a bit lost.\n\nHe stood on the spot,\n\nseemingly thinking about something.\n\nPerhaps because he had devoured the soul of a Ghost Envoy once before, and had now done so again,\n\nso,\n\nthis time, his existence seemed to last a bit longer than the previous two times.\n\nBut a longer duration also brought its own troubles.\n\nFor example:\n\n*Who am I?*\n\n*Where am I?*\n\n*Where am I going?*\n\nHe was genuinely pondering these questions. After thinking it over and over, he turned his head and saw Dr. Lin sitting in the car.\n\nHe walked over, leaned in,\n\nlowered his head,\n\nand rubbed his fangs against Dr. Lin's delicate, flawless face.\n\nSome of his saliva dripped down onto Dr. Lin's forehead, then spread down to cover her entire face, blurring her features.\n\nHe seemed to greatly enjoy this sensation, to be infatuated with it.\n\nThen,\n\nhis gaze fell upon the notebook that had been left on the driver's seat, which the ghost in green had not taken with her.\n\nHe reached out and picked up the notebook.\n\nAs the notebook neared Dr. Lin, it began to tremble violently, signifying that she was about to die soon.\n\nThis was the warning of the Yin-Yang Register. It was said that the Book of Life and Death in the hands of Yama recorded the time of every person's life and death, possessing supreme authority.\n\nThe Yin-Yang Register, derived from the Book of Life and Death, had a similar function.\n\nThe notebook trembled violently and unceasingly, reminding its master:\n\nThis woman,\n\nis about to die!\n\nZhou Ze looked at the notebook in a daze, as if looking at a novel new toy.\n\nHowever,\n\nthis toy was clearly not much fun. The vibrating sensation was more annoying than anything.\n\n\"ROAR!\"\n\nHe held the notebook up in front of him.\n\nZhou Ze let out a furious roar at it.\n\nAnd then,\n\nand then,\n\nand then,\n\nit actually fell silent.\n\nIt stopped vibrating...\n\n---\n¹ Chinese internet slang, pronounced \"liù liù liù,\" used to express that someone is amazing or skilled.",

    "content": "By morning, the sun had finally emerged. The weather was calm and sunny—a complete contrast to the wind, rain, and rampaging tornado of the day before.\n\nDr. Lin squinted. She had finally woken from her unconscious state of the previous night.\n\nUpon waking, she noticed her face felt a bit dry, as if something was stuck to it, even matting her eyelashes shut. She gently wiped her face, and when she opened her eyes, she saw the white stains she’d rubbed onto her palm.\n\nShe pulled down the car's vanity mirror and saw her face was covered in these white stains, which carried a strong odor.\n\nAlthough Dr. Lin was inexperienced in certain matters, she was a doctor. Besides, information was readily available in this day and age; it was no longer the ancient times when a mother had to show her daughter erotic art before her wedding to pass on the necessary skills.\n\nThese marks on her face… they looked like… semen stains.\n\nSubconsciously, Dr. Lin opened the car door, her heart in a panic. The bizarre scene from last night still left her with a lingering fear. Then, she saw him—Zhou Ze, sitting on the ground, leaning against the car, covered from head to toe in blood.\n\nAt that moment, Zhou Ze was a truly miserable sight. It was as if there wasn't a single patch of undamaged skin on his entire body, like a prisoner who had just been brutally interrogated and then tossed out to fend for himself.\n\n“A'Ze, A'Ze!”\n\nDr. Lin immediately squatted down, calling his name, terrified that the worst had happened.\n\nThis time, his period of unconsciousness had been much shorter than before. It was as if his body was slowly getting used to it. Perhaps it was also due to having devoured the souls of several Hell Officials, which had nourished and strengthened certain parts of him.\n\nIn any case, after being unconscious for only half the night, Zhou Ze actually managed to open his eyes at the sound of Dr. Lin's voice.\n\nThe first thing he saw was Dr. Lin's face. He was so startled he gasped, then struggled to complain, “You're putting on a face mask this early in the morning?”\n\nDr. Lin was both amused and exasperated, but in his current state, she couldn't bring herself to hit him, nor did she have the heart to scold him. She could only pull a wet wipe from the car and clean her face.\n\nAs she wiped, she examined it more closely. It didn't seem to be semen stains after all.\n\n“I'll call for an ambulance for you,” Dr. Lin said.\n\n“Don’t…”\n\nZhou Ze shook his head weakly.\n\n“Call… the bookstore… Tell the old Daoist… to bring… his monkey… here.”\n\nDr. Lin hesitated for a moment, suppressing her professional instinct to call for an ambulance, and chose to follow Zhou Ze's instructions. She took his phone and called the bookstore.\n\nThe old Daoist happened to be the one who answered. He immediately understood that his boss must have gone on one of his rampages again.\n\nWithout missing a beat, he said he would set off with the monkey at once.\n\n“Where do we go now?” Dr. Lin asked Zhou Ze.\n\n“Let's just find somewhere to settle down for now,” said Zhou Ze. “Help me into the car. You drive. Find a small motel. Oh, right, check the grass over there. Look for something that looks like a driver's license and grab it for me.”\n\nHearing this, Dr. Lin immediately went to search the patch of grass ahead. It was actually quite easy to find; two spots in the grass were clearly stained with grease, as if someone had splashed lard on them in the dead of night.\n\nOf course, Dr. Lin would have no way of recognizing it as corpse oil.\n\n“Are these them?” Dr. Lin asked, having found two small booklets and handing them to Zhou Ze.\n\nBoth Hell Official IDs were yellowed with age but undamaged, which meant they were still usable.\n\n“That's them.”\n\nZhou Ze motioned for Dr. Lin to put the two items away, then got into the car with her support.\n\nThere was hardly a large patch of uninjured skin anywhere on his body. But fortunately, this wasn't his first rodeo,¹ and with Dr. Lin sitting beside him, the pain wasn't enough to make him cry out.\n\nHowever, due to the recent tornado, many residents whose homes were damaged or had collapsed had chosen to stay in motels temporarily. As a result, from the village to the small county town, every single motel, large or small, was fully booked.\n\nDr. Lin drove the car to the far end of the county town and got out to ask at a small motel there.\n\nMeanwhile, Zhou Ze was slumped in the passenger seat, gazing up at the sky through the car window.\n\nJust then, an old man carrying a vegetable basket walked past the car.\n\nThe old man was truly old, with a full head of white hair and a goatee. His back was stooped, yet there was still a certain vigor in his stride.\n\nMost importantly, as the old man walked past, Zhou Ze clearly felt as if his own gaze had been pricked.\n\nThe old man stopped and looked at Zhou Ze in the car. Looking puzzled, he knocked on the window and asked, “Young man, caught in the disaster?”\n\nHe meant, were you injured in the tornado?\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\n“Why not go to the hospital?” the old man asked curiously.\n\n“Poor.”\n\n“…” The old man.\n\nAfter a moment's hesitation, the old man reached in to examine Zhou Ze's injuries. “These superficial wounds are certainly… uniform,” he remarked. “All over your body.”\n\n“Mm.”\n\nJust then, Dr. Lin came back. She glanced at the old man standing by the car window and said to Zhou Ze, “Still no rooms.”\n\n“Of course there aren't any rooms available now,” the old man said, shaking his head. “Never mind. Come stay at my place. My courtyard is large.”\n\nDr. Lin looked at Zhou Ze, asking for his opinion.\n\nZhou Ze nodded. In truth, he had no idea why the old man had suddenly decided to help him. After all, in this day and age, you wouldn't dare casually help a stranger on the street unless you had a net worth of tens of millions.\n\nThe old man's home was indeed very large, a courtyard-style house. When Zhou Ze got out of the car, the old man helped Dr. Lin support him into one of the rooms.\n\nHis strength was quite impressive.\n\nOnce they were inside and Zhou Ze was lying down, the old man said he was going to get some Chinese medicine for him and left.\n\nDr. Lin sat by Zhou Ze's side, finding it hard to believe they had run into such a kind-hearted person who would take two strangers home with him.\n\n“There really are more good people in this world,” Dr. Lin sighed.\n\nZhou Ze, however, was looking at the frames on the wall beside the bed. They held a collection of medals, certificates of merit, and some group photos. In all likelihood, the old man was a veteran.\n\n“Are you hungry?” Dr. Lin asked.\n\n“I'm okay,” Zhou Ze shook his head.\n\n“Young lady, can you cook?” the old man asked, walking in with a bowl of medicinal paste.\n\n“Yes, I can,” Dr. Lin answered.\n\n“Then you go cook. I'll apply some plaster for him. It's very effective for external injuries.”\n\nDr. Lin glanced at Zhou Ze again. Clearly, she was still a little worried about leaving him alone in the room.\n\nZhou Ze nodded at her, signaling for her to go.\n\nThe old man sat on the edge of the bed, patted the sheets, and said, “You're not the modest type, are you? No hang-ups?”\n\nZhou Ze shook his head.\n\n“Then take off your clothes. Ah, forget it, let me help you.”\n\nThe old man reached out and helped Zhou Ze remove his shirt. Gazing at the dense network of injuries covering his body, the old man clicked his tongue. “Tsk, tsk. Even on the battlefield, injuries like these were a rare sight.”\n\n“You were a soldier, sir?” Zhou Ze asked.\n\n“I was. During the war against the Japanese devils, I was just a kid, could only handle a red-tasseled spear. I properly enlisted when we fought Old Jiang, and after that I went to Korea, and to South Tibet.”\n\n“I was lucky. Didn't die, and wasn't badly hurt either.”\n\n“Blessed with good fortune.”\n\n“King Yama won't take me, so there's nothing to be done. I mean, look at me. I get all this allowance money every month and can't contribute a thing to the country. I might as well have King Yama send a Hell Official or someone to just take me away.”\n\n“…” Zhou Ze.\n\n“Alright, all applied. Your frame… you look like a frail scholar, but you feel surprisingly tough. A good foundation. You a martial artist?”\n\n“Sort of,” Zhou Ze said perfunctorily.\n\n“Do you know why I brought you home?” the old man asked.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head.\n\n“I like the look of you.”\n\n“That's a good reason.”\n\n“Well, when you get to my age, you can pretty much just do whatever you please. No need to worry about so many consequences.”\n\nDinner was made by Dr. Lin, but Zhou Ze didn't eat much.\n\nAfter dinner, the old man invited Zhou Ze to a game of Chinese chess, while Dr. Lin went to look at the antiques in the old man's collection room.\n\nZhou Ze lay on the bed, facing the chessboard. The old man would make a move, then Zhou Ze would call out his, and the old man would place the piece for him.\n\nZhou Ze wasn't a very skilled chess player, so the old man intentionally gave him a handicap, leaving one of his own Rooks untouched. Even so, the game was a close match.\n\nAs they played, the sky grew dark. Zhou Ze got a phone call. It was from Bai Yingying.\n\nShe said the old Daoist had run into traffic police on the way. Because he was driving without a license, both he and the car had been detained. The monkey had been forced to hide in some nearby bushes, not daring to let the police see it, or the old Daoist would face the additional charge of illegally keeping a nationally protected animal.\n\nThis was completely unexpected for Zhou Ze. He had been counting on the old Daoist and the monkey to arrive soon so he could be treated properly. He never imagined the old Daoist would get into trouble himself. So, it turned out that he wasn't the only one without a license—the old Daoist had been driving illegally all along.\n\n“What's wrong?” the old man asked after Zhou Ze hung up.\n\n“The friend coming to pick me up ran into some trouble on the road. He probably can't make it tonight.”\n\n“If he can't come, then just stay here. I like the look of you.”\n\n“…” Zhou Ze.\n\nWhen the chess game was over, the old man yawned as if ready for bed. He waved to Zhou Ze, put away the chessboard, and said he was going to his room to sleep.\n\nAfter the old man left, Dr. Lin came in. However, her expression was grim.\n\n“What's wrong?” Zhou Ze asked.\n\n“A'Ze, that old man… he's a little strange.”\n\n“What's so strange? Didn't you say earlier he was a very nice person?” Zhou Ze asked.\n\n“Anyway, he makes me feel uneasy. And there's something strange about this courtyard house, too.”\n\n“It's fine, I'm here,” Zhou Ze said comfortingly.\n\nBut he wasn't finished. He continued, “I'm here, and you know exactly what state I'm in. If anything happens, just remember to carry me on your back when you run. Don't leave me behind.”\n\n“…” Dr. Lin.\n\n“I'll go get some hot water to help you wipe down.”\n\nDr. Lin got up and walked out. As she emerged from the kitchen with a basin of hot water, she happened to notice a light on in the room next to Zhou Ze's—the old man's room.\n\nAs she drew closer, she could hear the sounds of drinking and finger-guessing games² from inside, along with the old man's voice mixed in with a clamor of others.\n\n“Old Li, you have guests today, huh?”\n\n“Yeah, a young lady and a young man.”\n\n“That young lady is quite a looker, like a landlord's daughter.”\n\n“You've been secretly checking her out?”\n\n“Looking doesn't cost me anything, what's wrong with that?”\n\n“The guy's even better looking,” a voice suddenly chimed in.\n\n“You rascal, I knew there was something off about you. Turns out you really don't like women, you're into *that*.”\n\n“Like him? I wouldn't dare. It all depends on whether *he* likes *us*.”\n\n“What do you mean?”\n\n“If he doesn't like us, then we won't be able to drink wine, eat meat, or live this kind of life anymore.”\n\n---\n¹ `一回生二回熟` (yī huí shēng èr huí shú): A Chinese idiom literally meaning \"unfamiliar the first time, familiar the second.\" It implies getting used to something through repetition.\n\n² Finger-guessing games (`划拳`, huáquán): A type of traditional drinking game popular in China where participants simultaneously shout a number and show a number with their fingers.

    "content": "Dr. Lin strode into Zhou Ze's room. This time, she was certain there was something wrong with the courtyard house. After all, there had only been three people in the courtyard before: herself, Zhou Ze, and the old man. How was it possible that the room next door was suddenly filled with a large group of people drinking and chatting so boisterously at night?\n\nAnd the things they were saying were obviously pointed.\n\n\"A'Ze, there's something wrong with this courtyard. We should go.\"\n\nZhou Ze put down his phone and yawned. To be honest, he was exhausted, but he couldn't sleep without Yingying by his side. Needing sleep both physically and mentally but being unable to get it was the worst kind of torment.\n\n\"The room next door, I just heard a lot of people talking,\" Dr. Lin continued.\n\n\"It's nothing, it's nothing.\" Zhou Ze waved his hand dismissively. \"You were just frightened yesterday. You'll be fine after a few more days of rest.\"\n\nIn truth, after close contact with spirits, it was inevitable for a living person to be affected. It was similar to being \"infected\" by a certain kind of magnetic field, which allowed one to see and hear things not normally perceptible. After a while, once the magnetic field dissipated, things would return to normal.\n\nCow tears had a similar effect.\n\nDr. Lin picked up a towel and began to wipe Zhou Ze's body. Zhou Ze, for his part, was quite enjoying it, though judging by her technique, Dr. Lin's skill at looking after people was certainly not as good as Yingying's.\n\nAfter she finished wiping him down, Dr. Lin put the towel aside, bit her lip, and said, \"I didn't mishear. If you know what's going on and are just telling me not to overthink it, then I can stop thinking about it.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\nDr. Lin said no more. She took off her jacket and lay down on the bed as well, but she lay on her side, her arm cushioning her head.\n\nFrom Zhou Ze's perspective, he could only see her back—a slim yet buxom silhouette that was quite alluring.\n\nIn truth, women looked better with a bit of meat on their bones like this.\n\nZhou Ze went back to scrolling through his phone. Since he couldn't sleep and was bored anyway, he might as well. He could only blame that good-for-nothing trickster, the Old Daoist. If the Old Daoist had arrived by now, his injuries would be recovering much faster with the monkey's help.\n\nThe old man's plaster was certainly not bad, and the wound still had a cool, tingling sensation, but it was a far cry from the monkey's mud.\n\nDr. Lin's breathing gradually steadied. It was hard to tell if she was asleep or not.\n\nBut slowly, the sounds from next door grew louder and louder. The sounds of drinking games, of bragging, and even of a man singing Huangmei opera in a strained falsetto.\n\nIt felt as if someone had placed ten televisions in the next room, all playing different programs.\n\nZhou Ze saw Dr. Lin's body tense up beside him, one hand subconsciously covering her ear.\n\nShe wasn't asleep.\n\nAnd for her, falling soundly asleep while being neighbors with a group of *those things* was indeed a bit too much to ask.\n\nZhou Ze tapped the corner of his phone against the wooden bed frame and scolded, \"It's the middle of the night! Have some decency and don't disturb other people's rest.\"\n\nAfter Zhou Ze shouted, the other side instantly quieted down. It was dead silent.\n\nZhou Ze went back to his phone.\n\nHe didn't know how long he'd been at it—the phone was plugged into its charging cable, so he wasn't worried about the battery—but by two o'clock in the morning, Zhou Ze couldn't hold it in anymore.\n\nHe had actually wanted to go during the day, but had held it in until now.\n\nHe glanced at Dr. Lin, who was still lying on her side, and propped himself up with his hand on the edge of the bed, preparing to get up. But his injuries were truly quite severe; Zhou Ze couldn't support his own weight and fell back onto the bed with a creak.\n\nDr. Lin turned over, looked at Zhou Ze, and asked directly, \"Need to use the toilet?\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\nDr. Lin helped Zhou Ze out of bed, and they walked out of the room together.\n\nThe rooms in the courtyard house didn't have toilets. There was a single outhouse on the diagonal opposite side of the yard, a separate small room. It was a rural-style pit toilet with a wooden frame on top for one to sit on, and a pit or a large vat underneath.\n\nTo be honest, the old man didn't seem to be short on money. His monthly stipend was probably quite substantial, and Dr. Lin had once been invited to see his collection room, which held many fine collectibles. Selling just one or two of them could easily buy a house.\n\nZhou Ze leaned one hand against the wall and was about to unbuckle his belt with the other when Dr. Lin reached out and unbuckled it for him.\n\nThis took Zhou Ze by surprise. At this moment, Dr. Lin was truly like a wife caring for her sick husband. Everything was so natural, without a hint of pretense.\n\nZhou Ze decided to just let it happen. He slowly closed his eyes, waiting for his \"pipe\" to be taken out by a pair of soft, delicate hands. Then all he'd have to do was open the floodgates and let the water flow. Afterward, his \"pipe\" would probably even be held and given a little shake.\n\nHowever, just then, a very unfriendly voice called out.\n\n\"Need a hand?\"\n\nIt was the old man's voice. The old man had gotten up in the middle of the night to use the toilet.\n\nDr. Lin, who was crouching down having just unbuckled Zhou Ze's belt, heard him and looked up at Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze desperately wanted to shout, \"Continue!\" \"Don't stop!\" but he gritted his teeth and pretended to be calm. \"Let him do it,\" he said.\n\nDr. Lin looked at Zhou Ze, a little worried.\n\n\"He's not going to push me into the cesspit, is he?\" Zhou Ze smiled. \"I know what I'm doing.\"\n\nDr. Lin nodded and walked out of the toilet. The old man came in.\n\n\"Well, what a coincidence. When a man gets old, he doesn't sleep so soundly. Always getting up in the night. The plumbing's got problems too, can't compare to you young folk. Always gotta pee, can't hold it, can't get it all out.\"\n\nWith the old man's help, Zhou Ze finished his business. The old man supported Zhou Ze under the arms, with his back to him, which conveniently freed up Zhou Ze's hands to turn on the faucet himself, thus avoiding any awkwardness.\n\nThe old man helped Zhou Ze out of the toilet, where Dr. Lin was waiting to take over.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. \"You go back and rest. I'm going to the old gentleman's room for a chat.\"\n\nThe old man was taken aback when he heard this, but he still nodded and said, \"Right.\"\n\nThis old man was a lot like the Old Daoist, switching between dialects from all over. The Old Daoist had drifted all over the country from north to south when he was young, and the old man was probably the same, having followed the army into battle from a very young age, so his accent had naturally become a muddle.\n\nUpon entering the old man's room, Zhou Ze saw it was rather small, as a large black curtain divided the space in two.\n\nZhou Ze could only see the old man's bed and a small tea table; that was all the space could accommodate.\n\nThe old man settled Zhou Ze onto the bed and poured him a pot of cool herbal tea.\n\n\"Lift the curtain, let me see,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Nothin' to see. Not a good idea to look at this stuff in the middle of the night.\"\n\n\"I want to see,\" Zhou Ze insisted.\n\n\"Fine, if you wanna see, I'll let you see. It ain't nothin' shameful, really.\"\n\nThe old man seemed to get excited. He stood up, walked to the side of the black curtain, and then yanked it open with a powerful flourish.\n\nThe gesture was reminiscent of a flag-bearer at Tiananmen Square unfurling the national flag during a flag-raising ceremony.\n\nThe curtain was pulled back.\n\nInside, a six-tiered, stepped platform was revealed. And on the platform, rows upon rows of spirit tablets were displayed.\n\nBeneath the platform stood a table laden with offerings like old rice wine and cured meat, with two incense sticks burning beside them.\n\n\"So lively,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nThe old man was thrilled. He rubbed his hands together excitedly and said, \"I don't know why, but I just find you to my liking, kid.\"\n\n*You've said that many times today.*\n\n\"I just wanted you to come over to my place, have a seat, stay a while.\"\n\nThe old man picked up the rice wine from the offering table, took a swig, and smacked his lips, his excitement growing. He pointed at the tablets on the shelves and said:\n\n\"Come on, let me introduce you.\n\nThis is our Company Commander Chen. I was just a kid back then, only knew to follow the others and call him Company Commander Chen, never knew his full name. Died in '45, got hit by the *guizi*¹ mountain artillery. We couldn't even find all the pieces of his body. A real pity. The *guizi* surrendered that same year. He never got to see it.\n\nThis is Wang Gouzi, Zhao Sanquan, Wu Wazi. They were in my squad too. Died during the advance into the Dabie Mountains. Our regiment was covering the rear, holding off the enemy.\n\nThis is Zhou Zhou, Sun Decai, Qin Liangyou. Died in the Huai'an Campaign. That battle, tsk tsk, it was brutal.\n\nThis is Zhao Peng, Sun Zhigang, Zhai Dazhuang, Ge Shufeng... They died in Korea. You know about the American bastards' napalm bombs? When I went out looking for them, they were all cooked through. Dammit, even now I can still remember the smell of cooked human flesh. Made me unable to eat meat for ten years after. Of course, it wasn't so easy to get meat back then anyway.\n\nThis is Zhu Houquan, this is...\"\n\nThe old man reeled off many, many names in one breath, including where these men had died and whether they were in his squad or his company at the time. He spoke in great detail, which meant he had always kept the information about his fallen comrades locked away in his heart, never once forgetting.\n\nAnd Zhou Ze, sitting on the edge of the bed, kept nodding.\n\nIt was a bit awkward; his injuries prevented him from standing up.\n\nIn truth, Zhou Ze had figured it out. The old man couldn't see. He couldn't see that the room was actually packed wall-to-wall with people.\n\nThey were sitting on the floor, leaning against the walls, sitting by the offering table, some cleaning their ears, some reading a book, some dozing off.\n\nEvery time the old man introduced a name, that person would look up, glance at Zhou Ze, and give a simple, honest smile, as if to say they'd met, that they were now acquainted.\n\nZhou Ze would return a smile and a nod.\n\nWhen the old man finished his introductions, his throat seemed a little hoarse. He picked up the rice wine from the table and took another gulp.\n\n\"That felt good! Well, youngster, are you scared?\n\nI'm tellin' you, with a lineup like this, not even a hell-constable would dare step through that door!\"\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze.\n\nThe old man let out a long breath and sighed, \"Youngster, I really, truly find you to my goddamn liking!\"\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Don't laugh when I say this, but it's just like I said this afternoon. Back in the day, I was never a coward in battle, always at the front of the charge. But goddammit, I just couldn't get myself killed. It was always the comrades next to me who fell. Sometimes, after a battle, I'd be the only one left in the whole squad.\n\nI don't know why I never died, why I've lived until now, and lived pretty well at that. Just dabbling in some antiques and stuff brings in money.\"\n\n\"A life of wealth and honor,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nThis truly was a life of wealth and honor. If the old man hadn't become a soldier, if he'd gone into business or something else, he would have undoubtedly succeeded and become prosperous.\n\n\"Heh heh, to hell with a life of wealth and honor. I've figured it out. My comrades fell one by one, and I was the only one who didn't die. It was Heaven letting me live so I could give them a home, so that after they died, the guys would have a place to gather.\n\nWe couldn't afford wine or meat back then. Now things are better. We can eat meat, drink wine, sleep and snore without worrying about the next day's march. My being alive... that's its purpose.\"\n\nZhou Ze looked at the old man and said nothing.\n\nZhou Ze also looked at the room full of people. To be honest, this was the first time Boss Zhou hadn't looked at a group of ghosts with an eye for performance quotas.\n\n\"Don't laugh, but these past few years, as I've gotten older, I don't sleep so soundly anymore. So every night before bed, I have a little rice wine.\n\nHey, it actually works.\n\nEvery night after I fall asleep, I can dream of my old comrades. We're all sitting around a table together, drinking, eating meat, and shooting the breeze.\n\nYou have no idea how great it feels.\n\nIt's just as if they're all really living here with me!\"\n\n***\n**Footnotes:**\n¹ *Guizi* (鬼子): A derogatory term for foreign invaders, particularly Japanese soldiers during WWII.

    "content": "Right up until he walked out of the old man’s room, Zhou Ze didn't say a word. He could only silently admire the fact that the old man was truly born under a lucky star. Living with dozens of departed souls, not only was he completely unaffected, but his fortune had always been good.\n\nA fate like that was beyond envy.\n\nZhou Ze didn't ask if those military spirits were willing to go to Hell. Perhaps their lingering obsession was simply because the old man was still alive, and the old man was willing to offer them sacrifices. Coupled with their old camaraderie, they were able to gather in the old man's home, drinking and shooting the breeze together every night as he slept.\n\nIt was a very leisurely and peaceful life, and it didn't cause any disturbance to the people around them. As a Ghost Emissary, he could very well let them be.\n\nPresumably, when the old man finally died of natural causes, his own departed soul would truly join the ranks of his comrades. Then they would all descend into Hell together, and they wouldn't be lonely on the Yellow Springs Road.\n\nJust like when they had campaigned across the country and fought in wars, as long as they were together, they wouldn't feel afraid. It was just one road, anyway; all they had to do was follow the red flag.\n\nIf Zhou Ze were to forcibly take these military spirits away, the old man would be greatly affected. It would be like completely severing the original rhythm of his life, and Zhou Ze was genuinely worried that the old man might suffer some mishap as a result.\n\nNo matter what, the man had at least helped him sincerely. To turn around and harm him would be difficult to justify.\n\nHowever, because of Zhou Ze's interruption, the gathering in the old man's room ended quickly tonight, and no more sounds came from the room next door.\n\nPerhaps the military spirits themselves knew in their hearts that their ability to remain here rested on a single thought from Zhou Ze.\n\nAfter returning to their room, Dr. Lin helped Zhou Ze lie back down on the bed. She still lay on her side, looking at Zhou Ze. The night had been full of twists and turns; Zhou Ze hadn't been able to sleep in the first place, and Dr. Lin hadn't slept very soundly either.\n\nHe reached out, took a lock of her hair, and gently rubbed it in his hand. Zhou Ze savored the feeling.\n\nIt had nothing to do with kinship, nothing to do with love, nothing to do with responsibility. Any reasonably normal man with a beautiful woman lying next to him would feel a sense of pleasure, even if he couldn't do anything.\n\n\"The experiences of the last two days have been... very rich,\" Dr. Lin said.\n\nZhou Ze nodded. For an ordinary person, accepting that her husband's body was inhabited by another soul was already difficult enough, let alone experiencing a series of supernatural events. It was a testament to Dr. Lin's fortitude.\n\n\"Will I keep seeing... those things?\" Dr. Lin asked.\n\n\"No, it'll be fine in a couple of days. Once you get back, take some time off to rest properly.\"\n\nDr. Lin nodded. She was always so compliant.\n\n\"Have you been well lately?\"\n\n\"Quite well,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\n\"That's good.\"\n\nDr. Lin nestled against Zhou Ze and slowly closed her eyes, seemingly falling asleep again.\n\nZhou Ze still couldn't sleep. He simply took out the two Ghost Emissary certificates. The centers of both documents had started to turn white and showed obvious creases, meaning they could withstand, at most, one more \"master recognition.\"\n\nTwo certificates were equivalent to two official posts on the roster. In the mortal world, people who could secure an official post could walk with their noses in the air. In the Underworld, these two items were actually even more in demand.\n\nHowever, Zhou Ze hadn't decided how to use them. He had originally thought about finding two candidates from among the dozens of military spirits, but on second thought, it seemed impossible.\n\nIt wasn't that Zhou Ze had moral scruples, but purely because the conditions for inheriting a Ghost Emissary certificate were incredibly strict. It had to be a departed soul who possessed a physical body.\n\nEven if an ordinary departed soul could possess someone, it wasn't a true \"reanimation of a corpse\" and didn't meet the criteria.\n\nThe only ones who could truly inherit this were stowaways from Hell like himself, Tang Shi, and Liang Chuan. The certificate's purpose wasn't to grant you magical power or strength; in reality, it served only a symbolic function.\n\nIt could enhance an already good situation, whitewashing your gray identity. That was all.\n\nIt was like bandits who had taken to the hills in ancient times gaining official positions after accepting amnesty from the imperial court. An ordinary, law-abiding peasant would never be entitled to such a privilege.\n\nTherefore, these two certificates were actually quite useless—like chicken ribs, tasteless to eat, yet a pity to throw away.\n\nFinding other stowaways from Hell was incredibly difficult. Tang Shi once said that she had searched the mortal world for half a year before finding Liang Chuan, and only after that did she find him.\n\nTo this day, they numbered only three in total.\n\nZhou Ze's fingertip rubbed against the Ghost Emissary certificate. Suddenly, he noticed that under the stimulation of his nail, the certificate actually emitted a wisp of blue smoke.\n\nThe smoke had a pleasant scent that was wonderfully refreshing.\n\nThen Zhou Ze saw that the certificate seemed a bit more tattered than before, and he immediately stopped what he was doing.\n\nThis was truly too extravagant, even more so than smoking the finest cigars.\n\nPutting the certificates away, Zhou Ze took out his phone, planning to wait out the night. Tomorrow, he would have Dr. Lin drive him back to the bookstore in Tongcheng. Xu Qinglang and the others should be handling the old Daoist's matter, which would probably require burning a large sum of paper money.\n\nFortunately, whether the old Daoist returned or not wasn't a huge problem.\n\nThe key was to find that monkey.\n\nBut soon, Zhou Ze heard a \"rustling\" sound coming from the courtyard wall, as if something was climbing over it.\n\nThe sound grew louder; it seemed there was more than one thing climbing the wall. Gradually, the noise woke Dr. Lin as well.\n\nDr. Lin's sleep quality tonight was truly worrying; every time she had just drifted off, she was woken up.\n\nJust as life is troublesome for people with the yin-yang eyes, when you can perceive things that ordinary people can't, it is indeed a very distressing matter.\n\nDr. Lin's state would likely last for another day or two before her body's \"magnetic field\" dissipated and returned to normal. She would also have to be careful not to catch a cold, or she could easily get sick.\n\n\"There's a sound... outside?\" Dr. Lin asked Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\nDr. Lin thought it was the \"noisy\" people from next door, but it wasn't. The blame lay with Zhou Ze's meddling hand moments ago. By damaging the Ghost Emissary certificate, he had caused it to emit a fragrance. Not only did Zhou Ze find the scent pleasant, but it had also instinctively drawn some nearby wandering ghosts closer.\n\nThis was a business opportunity. Zhou Ze thought about getting up to go outside and sign for a batch of deliveries.\n\nBut just then, the old man from the room next door came out again, seemingly headed for the outhouse.\n\nWhen you get old, the plumbing tends to get rusty; leaks and drips are the most common things.\n\nThis made Zhou Ze a little worried. Although wandering ghosts were usually just a handful of stragglers and couldn't cause much trouble, the old man was old, after all. If he were affected in any way, the consequences could be serious.\n\nIf the old man had stayed in his room, protected by that group of comrades, there would naturally be nothing to worry about. But now that he had come out, there was a certain probability of an accident.\n\nMilitary spirits were very different from ordinary departed souls. Their range of activity was actually not large, and they abided by their own \"discipline.\" The world's restrictions on them were indeed much stricter than on other departed souls.\n\nGeneral Chen Yi once wrote the line, \"I go now to the netherworld to rally my old troops, / With ten thousand banners, to slay King Yama.\" But in reality, as the Underworld's stability-maintenance department, it could tolerate you wandering about as a lone ghost, causing minor trouble. But if you tried to team up and stir up real trouble, then sorry, the Underworld was no pushover.\n\nMoreover, when Zhou Ze had entered the courtyard earlier, he hadn't sensed the presence of the military spirits at all. It wasn't until he entered the old man's room and the old man lifted the curtain that he saw the room packed full of people. This meant that this group of military spirits could only operate within the limited area of that room.\n\nRegardless, he was the one who had summoned the ghosts; he couldn't let the old man get into trouble on his account.\n\n\"Help me up,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nDr. Lin helped Zhou Ze out of bed.\n\nJust as the two reached the doorway, they heard a conversation outside.\n\nIt sounded like a man and a woman.\n\n\"The room on the left has a lot of people, and they seem fierce,\" the woman said.\n\n\"Yes, but they can't come out. Don't be afraid, I'm here,\" the male ghost said.\n\n\"The room on the right is like us, a man and a woman. The man seems to be injured,\" the woman added.\n\nDr. Lin also heard the conversation and looked at Zhou Ze with some concern.\n\nZhou Ze, however, was no longer worried. He truly hoped the pair would charge straight at him; it would save him the trouble of going out.\n\n\"No way. That man is more terrifying than everyone in the left room combined. He makes my scalp go numb. Don't provoke him.\"\n\nDr. Lin looked at Zhou Ze in surprise.\n\nZhou Ze lifted his chin slightly,\n\nplaying along with the rhythm of a guy trying to act tough in front of his girl.\n\nThis ghost couple really knew the score.¹\n\n\"We can't go to the left, and we can't go to the right. So where is that fragrance coming from? There's only an old man over by the latrine. Perhaps it's with him,\" the woman muttered.\n\n\"We can only try our luck with him. This courtyard house is too uncanny, even more so than our own gravesite.\"\n\nThe male and female ghost seemed to have reached an agreement and prepared to make a move on the old man.\n\nIn truth, Zhou Ze had still underestimated the allure of that fragrance for ghosts. This pair had clearly been ghosts for many years, almost to the point of becoming full-fledged spirits.\n\nThe common saying \"ghostly clever\" isn't just an adjective; it can also be a noun. Any being can become a spirit after cultivating to a certain level.\n\nThe old man was a bit tipsy from the alcohol. His hand kept fumbling, unable to get a grip on his \"pipe.\" It was very frustrating.\n\nThe two ghosts, one male and one female, rushed directly into the latrine.\n\nJust as Zhou Ze, supported by Dr. Lin, stepped out of the room to resolve the problem,\n\nhe heard two terrified screams from the man and woman:\n\n\"There's a ghost!\"\n\n\"There's a ghost! There's a ghost!\"\n\nThen, right before Zhou Ze's eyes, the man and woman shot through the courtyard wall and fled in terror.\n\nDr. Lin was in disbelief, and the more she thought about it, the more horrified she became. She murmured:\n\n\"That old man... is a ghost too?\"\n\nA ghost, walking around like a living person, had even brought her and Zhou Ze home? Had eaten with her, played chess?\n\nZhou Ze shook his head and corrected her:\n\n\"They weren't shouting 'yǒu guǐ' (there's a ghost),\n\nthey were shouting 'yǒu guì' (there's a noble),\n\nas in, a 'noble person.'\"\n\nWhere a noble person is present, gods and ghosts keep their distance.\n\n***\n**Footnotes:**\n¹ *Knew the score*: The original text uses a modern slang term, 有B數 (yǒu B shù), which means to be self-aware or to know one's own limitations. \"Knew the score\" is a fitting English equivalent.",

    "content": "Zhou Ze suddenly felt that this old man was a real treasure. Not long ago, the old Daoist had even chatted with him about whether they should set up an altar for a God of Wealth or a statue of Guan Gong in the bookstore.\n\nNow, thinking about it, what was the need for those statues? Just inviting this old man to come live in the bookstore would be enough to ensure its feng shui would be prosperous.\n\nIt wasn't that Zhou Ze had never met people of distinguished status before, but this old man was so distinguished it was like a glitch in the system.\n\nIt was still the same thought: he had gone to be a soldier. If he had pursued any other profession, or if the backdrop of the era he lived in had been different, he would have undoubtedly achieved extraordinary things.\n\nBut everyone's fate is different, and so are their choices. Perhaps for the old man, choosing to be a soldier, to fight side-by-side with his comrades, was the choice he regretted the least.\n\nEven now, at the ripe old age of ninety, he could still happily reunite with his comrades every night in his \"dreams.\" He didn't feel like he had lived his life in vain, nor did he feel he had wasted his years and given up other, more wonderful things.\n\nThe old man had said he had no children, so if he passed, he would be well and truly gone.\n\nPerhaps the reason he was still alive was simply that he treated his home as an inn, a place for his comrades who had sacrificed their lives to gather.\n\nIn fact, looking at it from another angle, Zhou Ze felt that the couplet hanging on his own bookstore's entrance was better suited for the old man's door.\n\n*Take it with a grain of salt; thus I have heard.*\n\nThe Zhou Ze of today would find it very difficult to reach such a state of being. Especially after tasting success, his actions had become very pragmatic, and he had lost his former lazy and leisurely nature.\n\nBut the old man, in this courtyard house, was a case of: *In this great dream, who awakens first? All my life, I have known myself.*¹\n\nUnfettered and natural, free from constraints. Though the courtyard house was small, his memories were vast and distant.\n\nAfter that, everything was quiet until dawn.\n\nIn the morning, Xu Qinglang drove over. The old Daoist was sitting in the front passenger seat, and the monkey had been found as well.\n\nWhen Zhou Ze was helped into the car, the old Daoist hung his head, looking extremely embarrassed.\n\nHis boss was weak after unleashing his ultimate power, yet he, who had been rushing to provide support, had somehow been pulled over by the traffic police for driving without a license.\n\nXu Qinglang not only had to use some connections to get him out but also had to burn a good deal of paper money. Even though Boss Zhou hadn't said anything, the old Daoist himself felt the sting.\n\n\"Old Daoist,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Yes, Boss.\" The old Daoist glanced nervously at the boss sitting in the back.\n\n\"Let's go get our driver's licenses together in a while.\"\n\n\"Uh... alright.\"\n\nIn truth, both Zhou Ze and the old Daoist knew how to drive, but Xu Le didn't have a license, and the old Daoist had never bothered to get one. If they were to actually take the test, it would really just be a formality.\n\nThroughout the journey, Xu Qinglang kept looking at Dr. Lin in the back seat through the rearview mirror.\n\nHe watched her wipe Zhou Ze's face, watched her peel fruit for him, watched her ask with great care where he felt uncomfortable.\n\nIn short, the entire car was filled with the sickeningly sweet smell of their PDA.²\n\nThe old Daoist, however, didn't mind. Anyway, every one of his ghost bosses had endless luck with women and female ghosts. You couldn't be envious of that kind of thing. If you wanted to be envious, you'd have to die first.\n\nThe old Daoist didn't want to die, so he was willing to endure the loneliness of being a bachelor. Zhou Ze had once asked him why he didn't find a partner to live a good life with, and the old Daoist replied that his ambitions lay in all four corners of the world.\n\nIf he were to marry a wife, he would be letting down all the fallen women in the world waiting for his comfort. It would truly be their loss, so he could only sacrifice himself for the greater good of all.\n\nTwo hours later, Xu Qinglang parked the car in front of Dr. Lin's home.\n\nBefore getting out, Dr. Lin made a point to say, \"I'll send another copy of the agreement. Just sign it and mail it back to me.\"\n\nZhou Ze felt a little disappointed. Although this trip hadn't been long, the experience had been quite eventful. Yet, after all that, the two of them seemed to have circled back to the same rhythm they were in before they left.\n\nThe divorce agreement.\n\nZhou Ze nodded. He didn't try to make her stay, nor did he say anything more. He just waved goodbye, reminding her to rest well. After these meaningless pleasantries were over, Dr. Lin went upstairs and home. Xu Qinglang started the car again, and twenty minutes later, they were back at the bookstore.\n\nThe old Daoist got out first, taking the monkey to go dig in the mud.\n\nXu Qinglang helped Zhou Ze open the car door, handed him a cigarette, and smiled. \"If you really like her, you should be a little bolder.\"\n\n\"And then Dr. Lin thinks I'm great in bed and leaves three thousand yuan for me on the nightstand?\" Zhou Ze retorted.\n\n\"...\" Xu Qinglang was speechless.\n\n\"Actually, it's fine like this. I'm not a person of the living world. It might not be a good thing for her to get too involved with me.\"\n\n\"This isn't some romantic drama; there's no need for so many twists and turns. To be honest, if it had been Dr. Lin who showed up in that Maserati that day instead of the Faceless Woman, you two would probably be calculating your due date by now.\"\n\nZhou Ze suddenly felt that Xu Qinglang had a very good point; he found himself at a loss for a rebuttal.\n\n\"Of course, if it really comes down to it, IVF is very convenient these days anyway. The Lin family has money. You could just tell her parents they found themselves a son-in-law who can't get it up, and if they want a grandchild, they'll have to do IVF. I bet the Lin family would be more than willing to spend the money for you.\"\n\nZhou Ze looked at Xu Qinglang with some surprise.\n\nHe felt that Xu Qinglang had become corrupted.\n\nThe once-so-honest and simple Old Xu had actually learned to fight back, and right after Zhou Ze had just made fun of him.\n\nTruly, the world's morals are in decline and the hearts of men are not what they once were.\n\nZhou Ze was about to get out of the car with Xu Qinglang's help, but a white figure ran over directly, gently lifted Zhou Ze into her arms, and carried him into the bookstore, saying at the same time:\n\n\"Boss, the bathwater is at the perfect temperature.\"\n\nAfter Bai Yingying had bathed Zhou Ze, she carried him upstairs to the bedroom. Tea and fruit had also been prepared in the room. Zhou Ze drank half a cup of tea, and Yingying, ever so thoughtful, used her own thigh as a pillow for him, her hands massaging his head with just the right amount of pressure, helping him slowly drift off to sleep.\n\nThis...\n\n...was life.\n\nThis...\n\n...was true living.\n\nHe woke up to find it was already night. He ate something with a side of sour plum juice, and with Bai Yingying's help, he went downstairs and sat on the sofa.\n\nBefore long, Xu Qinglang also came downstairs. He was wearing a wine-red suit, his hair was perfectly coiffed, and it seemed he had even sprayed on some cologne.\n\n\"All dolled up like that. Where are you off to?\" Zhou Ze asked, waving the newspaper in his hand.\n\n\"None of your business,\" Xu Qinglang shot Zhou Ze a look.\n\nThat one look perfectly embodied the phrase \"a cheating wife.\"³\n\nAfter adjusting himself in the mirror one more time, Xu Qinglang, feeling good about himself, asked Bai Yingying:\n\n\"How's this getup?\"\n\n\"Very beautiful,\" Bai Yingying said.\n\n\"Before this getup, you were a streetwalker flitting through the Parisian night. After this getup, you're the highest-priced king of gigolos in the Magic City.⁴\"\n\nAfter speaking, Zhou Ze took a sip of coffee.\n\n\"I wasn't asking you.\"\n\nXu Qinglang waved a dismissive hand at Zhou Ze.\n\n\"A man who can't get it up has no right to run his mouth.\"\n\nAs Xu Qinglang spoke, he looked at Bai Yingying and gave her a look that said, *you know what I mean*.\n\nBai Yingying blushed, her hands fidgeting in front of her. Actually, the boss's...\n\nXu Qinglang left, taking a taxi. The bookstore seemed to retain a lingering trace of his flamboyance.\n\nBai Yingying refilled Zhou Ze's coffee and said, \"Boss, Xiao Ke is still waiting for your reply about that Japanese priest.\"\n\n\"Tell her to keep an eye on him. It's not convenient for me recently.\"\n\nBai Yingying nodded to show she understood.\n\n...\n\nWhen he reached the hotel room door, Xu Qinglang hesitated.\n\nIn his pocket, he had six thousand yuan in cash.\n\nShe had contacted him again. He hadn't wanted to come, but he felt that some things needed to be cleared up.\n\nFor example, he wasn't the gigolo she mistakenly thought he was. So, he had come. Not only was he going to return the three thousand she had left last time, but he was also going to give her another three thousand.\n\nThen, he would tell her in a very serious, straight-faced manner,\n\n*You were great,*\n\n*I was very satisfied,*\n\n*This is your service fee.*\n\n*Phew...*\n\nA man...\n\n...must pick himself up from wherever he was scorned.\n\nHe pressed the doorbell of the hotel room.\n\nThe door opened.\n\nThe woman inside was graceful and poised. She must have just finished showering. She wore no makeup, which made her all the more captivating. The skin she revealed gave one an impulse, as if a demon had descended.\n\n\"I...\"\n\nXu Qinglang cleared his throat. He had just uttered a single word when his lips were blocked by another's.\n\nAnd then,\n\nHeaven's thunder struck earth's fire,\n\nFriction ignited a raging inferno,\n\nEverything proceeded as a matter of course,\n\nAnd then,\n\nThey had a hell of a time.\n\nAfter the third round, Xu Qinglang did not fall asleep. Although he was very, very tired, like an old ox that had exhausted all its strength from plowing, he forced his eyes open.\n\nReaching for his clothes, he was going to give her the money. This time, he would be the first to pay!\n\nDignity,\n\nHe could not forget his dignity!\n\nA man who owned over twenty properties,\n\nMust have his own dignity!\n\n\"What are you doing?\"\n\nThe woman asked, lying in bed with a slender cigarette between her fingers.\n\n\"Paying you.\"\n\nXu Qinglang was unbuttoning his suit pocket.\n\n*Slap!*\n\nA stack of money was pulled out from under the pillow by the woman and tossed in front of Xu Qinglang.\n\nIt was several tens of thousands.\n\nXu Qinglang froze.\n\nHe suddenly felt that the few thousand in his pocket,\n\nSeemed a bit too shabby to take out.\n\nHis dignity seemed to have been trampled once again, torn to shreds.\n\n\"I'm very satisfied with you. Extremely satisfied,\" the woman said.\n\n\"I'm very satisfied with you too,\" Xu Qinglang replied, not showing any weakness.\n\n\"Satisfied with my price, right?\"\n\n\"...\" Xu Qinglang was speechless.\n\nSoon, Xu Qinglang came to his senses. He gathered the money on the bed, grabbed the woman's hand, and placed the money back in it.\n\n\"I don't want your money, and I'm not... Huh? Your wrist?\"\n\nHe hadn't noticed last time.\n\nHe hadn't noticed during the three rounds just now either.\n\nBut now Xu Qinglang saw it.\n\nOn the woman's left wrist, there were twenty densely packed scars. A few of them were fresh, not yet fully healed.\n\n\"Every time I'm with a man who satisfies me, I feel great pleasure. And when I'm pleased, I want to leave behind something to commemorate it, something that can remind me later of this joyful and wonderful time.\n\n\"Like today, for instance.\"\n\nThe woman's right hand produced a razor blade from somewhere.\n\nRight in front of Xu Qinglang,\n\n*Shlick.*\n\nA sound,\n\nA bright red gash appeared.\n\nThe woman lifted her head,\n\nOpened her mouth,\n\nAnd continuously sucked in sharp breaths of cold air.\n\nShe must have been in great pain, but her expression was one of absolute bliss, like a drug addict who had finally gotten their fix.\n\nThen,\n\nThe woman took the still-burning cigarette and pressed it directly onto the new scar.\n\n\"Hiss...\"\n\nThe woman took a deep breath.\n\nAnd then sighed:\n\n\"Feels good...\"\n\n---\n**Footnotes:**\n\n1.

    "title": "Chapter 157: Boss Zhou, who is low on his money",
    "content": "Xu Qinglang felt a tingling sensation crawl up his scalp. He had seen plenty of ghosts, and funnily enough, he wasn't afraid of them. But this living, breathing person, the one with whom he had just shared a passionate night,¹ left him so horrified he was speechless.\n\nThe woman glanced at him. Seeing his terrified expression, she seemed to find it all the more amusing. She reached out and tapped his chin lightly.\n\n\"How cute. Like a dear little quail.\"\n\nThe woman's fingers were a bit cold. Xu Qinglang shuddered, immediately threw on his clothes, and got out of bed. He didn't dare to even look at the woman. He left the money she had thrown on the bed, not bothering to pick it up, and flung the door open, fleeing as if for his life.\n\nCompared to last time, when he woke up to find three thousand yuan on the nightstand, Xu Qinglang felt that today was an even greater failure.\n\nHe was a bit lost. After leaving the hotel, he squatted alone on the curb and lit a cigarette.\n\n*This woman has some serious issues.*\n\nBut if you ignored that heavily scarred wrist, she was truly beautiful.\n\nIt seemed that nothing in this world was ever absolutely perfect. Heaven always had a habit of creating some small flaw in beautiful things, as if that was the only way to satisfy its aesthetic.\n\nFor most men, having a beautiful, skilled-in-bed woman from a good family who was willing to be your friend-with-benefits—and even pay you for it—would seem like a pretty sweet deal.\n\nIn fact, Xu Qinglang had, to some extent, harbored such thoughts before. That kind of uninhibited pleasure, with no consequences for one's own life or future, sought only for a fleeting moment of bliss, was enough to make a man drop all his defenses and willingly sink into it.\n\nHe reached up and ran a hand through his hair, tormented.\n\nJust then, a pair of high heels appeared behind Xu Qinglang. He turned his head and saw the woman.\n\nShe was still smoking, her wrist now covered by her sleeve, showing no trace of the scars. She bent down to look at Xu Qinglang, the valley of her cleavage so unfathomably deep it could trap the gaze of most men.\n\n\"Little brother, did big sister scare you?\"\n\nXu Qinglang shook his head, refusing to look at her, and continued smoking his cigarette.\n\n\"Well, I'm off then. I'll call you next time I'm in the mood. Right, here's your money.\"\n\nThe woman took the cash out of her purse.\n\n\"I don't want it. I don't need money.\"\n\nThe woman paused, looking at him as if he were a petulant child.\n\n\"What a coincidence,\" she said. \"Neither do I.\"\n\n*Whoosh!*\n\nThe woman threw the tens of thousands of yuan in her hand directly into the air. The bills began to flutter down, attracting the attention of many passersby. Then she got into a car parked nearby and sped off.\n\nXu Qinglang sat amidst the flurry of banknotes, which couldn't help but remind him of a scene from the movie *God of Gamblers* he'd seen as a kid.\n\nChow Yun-fat, tossing banknotes into the air, then dancing gracefully with a woman in a rain of money.\n\nSniffling, Xu Qinglang silently stood up.\n\nHe walked a few steps away,\n\nThen stopped.\n\nHe looked back at the pile of money on the ground.\n\n*Heh.*\n\n*Do I need money?*\n\nHe turned his head and continued walking forward.\n\nJust then, a few passersby, seeing Xu Qinglang leave, instinctively moved closer, intending to pick up the money.\n\nXu Qinglang stopped in his tracks again.\n\nHe quickly walked back.\n\n\"I don't need it, but *that guy* does. If he knew I left money on the ground for the sake of some stupid pride, he'd curse me to death!\"\n\n***\n\n\"Achoo!\"\n\nIn the bookstore, Boss Zhou, who had been reading the newspaper for half the night, let out a loud sneeze.\n\n\"Boss, did you catch a cold?\" Bai Yingying asked with concern.\n\n\"Heh, someone must be thinking about him,\" the old Daoist said from the side, pinching his fingers as if divining. \"Tsk tsk, it must be so.\"\n\n\"The floor's a bit dirty. It needs to be mopped again,\" Zhou Ze said slowly.\n\nThe old Daoist's face immediately fell. Looking utterly miserable, he picked up the mop and started cleaning.\n\nJust then, a Porsche pulled up in front of the bookstore. A woman in gorgeous, exquisite clothing walked in. She looked to be in her thirties, exuding an air of grace and poise from head to toe.\n\n\"Wow, she's so beautiful. Like a lotus flower emerging from the water,\" Bai Yingying exclaimed from the side.\n\nIt was a fair comment; the woman was indeed beautiful, the kind who became more captivating the longer you looked.\n\n\"And the dew on the lotus hasn't been wiped off yet.\"\n\nZhou Ze smiled.\n\nThe woman's cheeks were flushed, her eyes glistening, and her body had a certain languidness to it, like the earth after being nourished by a spring rain, gestating new life.\n\n\"Who's the boss?\"\n\nThe woman surveyed her surroundings and asked.\n\nZhou Ze frowned. *Who's the boss?*\n\n*Could this high school girl holding a coffee be the boss?*\n\n*Could that old farmer grunting and mopping the floor be the boss?*\n\n*There are only three people in the store.*\n\n*Who's the boss?*\n\n*Are you blind?*\n\nZhou Ze pursed his lips and ignored her. *You're a living person, anyway, not a ghost.*\n\nIn the end, no one actually paid her any mind.\n\nBai Yingying went to tidy up the counter, the old Daoist continued mopping, and Zhou Ze remained on the sofa, sprawled in the \"Ge You slouch.\"²\n\n\"I have business with your boss. Wang Ke sent me.\"\n\nAt the mention of Wang Ke, Zhou Ze slowly sat up.\n\nSeeing this, the woman walked over and sat down on the sofa opposite him.\n\nShe got straight to the point.\n\n\"My husband has been having some psychological issues lately. He keeps thinking he's seeing ghosts. I had Dr. Wang take a look, and he recommended I come here to find you. He said you're an expert in this area.\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't answer. Instead, he took out his phone, preparing to chew Wang Ke out. They had agreed he wouldn't send any trouble his way, and here he was, pushing another mess onto him.\n\nSo was his previous promise just bullshit?\n\nThere were limits to helping and caring for friends. After all, Zhou Ze had never considered himself a living Lei Feng.³\n\nBefore he could dial the number, a bank card was tossed onto the coffee table.\n\n\"There's a million in this card. The PIN is 003003.\"\n\nZhou Ze's process of calling Wang Ke to demand an explanation was interrupted. He felt a surge of anger. *Can't you see I'm about to make a call?*\n\n*What do you mean by throwing a card on the table, telling me there's a million in it, and giving me the PIN?*\n\n*Don't you know my maid's funerary objects are worth hundreds of thousands apiece?*\n\n*Don't you know the old man mopping my floor could do a livestream selling spirit money and make a fortune in minutes?*\n\n*Didn't you see that the chef I hired owns over twenty properties?*\n\nZhou Ze put down his phone.\n\nHe reached out.\n\nAnd picked up the card.\n\n*Sigh.*\n\n*I'm just too much of a nice guy, I value friendship too much. When a friend needs help, I just have to lend a hand.*\n\n\"This is the deposit,\" the woman added.\n\nZhou Ze's hand trembled slightly.\n\n*Sigh, my injuries haven't fully healed yet. This body is just a bit weak. My hand even starts shaking just from picking up a small card.*\n\n\"Yingying, we have a guest. Why haven't you served coffee?\" Zhou Ze called out to the counter, dissatisfied.\n\n\"Coming!\"\n\nBai Yingying immediately brought over a cup of coffee.\n\nThe woman watched Zhou Ze calmly, enjoying the feeling of beating someone into submission with money.\n\nWhether in bed or out of it, with men or with women, the money in her hand had always made her invincible.\n\n\"Tell me about the situation. How old is your husband?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"He's ninety-three,\" the woman replied.\n\nZhou Ze gave the woman an unexpectedly long look.\n\n\"That's right. I'm with him for his money and inheritance. I told him we were in love, and the old man, feeling good about himself, believed it.\"\n\nThe woman said this with the same calm demeanor.\n\n\"Thank you for your honesty.\"\n\n\"Even if I weren't honest, you would have assumed as much.\"\n\nThe woman picked up the coffee, took a sip, and frowned slightly.\n\n\"There's no sugar.\"\n\n\"I don't like sugar,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nThe woman put the coffee down. \"In any case, when do you have time to come to my house and see my husband? He's been so paranoid lately that it's impossible for us to carry on a normal married life.\"\n\n\"Pfft—\"\n\nZhou Ze, who had been drinking his coffee, choked.\n\nBai Yingying carefully wiped his mouth with a napkin, then retreated.\n\n\"Pardon my bluntness, but I'd think you'd want him to kick the bucket sooner rather than later.\"\n\n\"Well, he was on the verge of dying, practically bedridden. But ever since he started yelling about seeing ghosts, his spirits have been noticeably better than before.\"\n\nThe woman continued, looking troubled.\n\n\"At this rate, I don't think he'll be dying anytime soon. By natural causes, I mean.\"\n\n\"I understand. So, what exactly do you want me to do?\"\n\n\"Fix his current state. I don't care if it's a version of senile dementia with psychotic features or if there really is a ghost haunting him. I want him back to normal, back to lying in bed quietly, waiting to die.\"\n\n\"Alright, I agree. I will do my best to cure your husband's illness.\"\n\nA cold smile flickered across the woman's lips.\n\n\"Hypocrite.\"\n\n\"Right, did your husband ever say who was haunting him? What I mean is, what is the identity of the ghost haunting him? Did he know them?\"\n\n\"His ex-wife, his son, his daughter, his grandson, his granddaughter, and his great-grandson, great-granddaughter.\"\n\nThe woman counted them off on her fingers.\n\n\"A lot of people.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, are they...?\"\n\n\"Five years ago, their whole family held a party on a cruise ship. There was an accident, the ship sank, and there were no survivors. His entire family was wiped out, except for him, as he happened to be on shore for a business meeting that day.\"\n\n\"I see.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded upon hearing this.\n\nIn that case, it was equally possible that the old man was either being tormented by restless spirits or was suffering from a mental breakdown brought on by extreme psychological stress.\n\n\"And how long have you been married to him?\"\n\n\"Five years.\"\n\nThe woman replied with the same imperturbable calm.\n\nZhou Ze didn't ask any more questions, instead fiddling with the bank card in his hand.\n\nThis was a pool of muddy water—no, it was more like a cesspool.\n\nIf he waded in, he'd likely get himself dirty, or at the very least, he'd have to smell the stench.\n\n\"One million for the deposit, five million upon completion.\" The woman looked at Zhou Ze, her smooth fingers lightly touching the back of his hand.\n\nBai Yingying, watching from the side, pouted. *She's so old and still trying to seduce men!*\n\nIt didn't occur to Yingying that in terms of age, everyone else in the bookstore, including the old Daoist, combined wasn't as old as her.\n\n\"Plus, I'll sleep with you three times,\" the woman added.\n\nBai Yingying's expression soured even more.\n\n*Damn her to hell!*\n\n*Utterly shameless!*\n\nZhou Ze calmly moved the woman's hand away.\n\nAnd said:\n\n\"How about we cancel that last condition and change it to eight million?\"\n\n---\n**Footnotes:**\n\n1.  **Shared a passionate night:** The original text uses a classical Chinese idiom, `共赴巫山雲雨` (gòng fù wū shān yún yǔ), which literally means \"to go together to Mount Wu for clouds and rain.\" It's a poetic euphemism for sexual intimacy.\n2.  **\"Ge You slouch\":** The original text uses `葛優躺` (Gé Yōu tǎng), a popular Chinese internet meme referring to a specific slumped, lethargic posture of actor Ge You from the 1993 TV series *I Love My Family*.

I'll go with you.\"\n\n\"Hm? What's wrong?\"\n\n\"Look at you, Boss, you're still injured.

In truth, judging from the time Bai Yingying single-handedly destroyed that corpse ghoul, her combat power was actually formidable.\n\n\"It's fine, Boss. You know he has... *that* kind of problem. What are you so worried about?\n\n\"Sure, a million to sleep with a woman once is way too expensive, but for a top-shelf beauty like her, a million is actually not a bad deal.

He went straight up to the second floor and into his room.\n\nWhen Zhou Ze woke up the next morning, Xu Qinglang still hadn't emerged from his room.\n\n\"Where is he?\"\n\nZhou Ze looked at the takeout breakfast before him; it was obvious the house chef had skipped work.\n\n\"He got drunk last night and hasn't woken up yet. He reeked of alcohol when he came back,\" the Old Daoist explained.\n\nZhou Ze nodded and said no more.\n\nAfter eating breakfast and changing into a casual outfit, Zhou Ze turned his head and called to Bai Yingying,\n\n\"Bring me my cane.\"\n\nBai Yingying and the Old Daoist were arguing about something behind the counter. Hearing Zhou Ze's call, she immediately grabbed the cane and ran over, then shot the Old Daoist a meaningful look.\n\n\"What's wrong?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Nothing. I was just telling the Old Daoist to remember to wake Old Xu up to cook dinner tonight. Boss, you're still recovering, takeout isn't nutritious enough.\"\n\n\"It's fine.\"\n\nLeaning on his cane and supported by Bai Yingying, Zhou Ze walked out of the bookstore, hailed a cab, and left.\n\nMeanwhile, behind the counter, the Old Daoist scratched his head helplessly and pulled out an electric wheelchair.\n\nTo suck up to the boss, he had ordered this electric wheelchair right after the boss went on a rampage in Yancheng last time. He had just been thinking of presenting it as a surprise gift for the boss.\n\nWho knew that jiangshi² would insist on not letting him give it, even saying he might die if he did.\n\nAiya,\n\nThis female jiangshi is getting more and more jealous. This humble Daoist is a man; don't tell me I'm going to compete with you for the boss's favor?\n\nShe even dared to threaten to kill me.\n\nThinking this, the Old Daoist helplessly pressed a button on the wheelchair.\n\nThe wheelchair began to play music:\n\n\"Wuu wuu wuu wuu wuu... Little Erlang, off to school with his bookbag...\"\n\nWhile playing the music, the wheelchair even started moving on its own, spinning in place.\n\nSo cheerful, so very cheerful.\n\n\"I'll give it to him when the boss gets back tonight.\"\n\n...\n\nThe taxi arrived at the address, and to Zhou Ze's surprise, what he saw wasn't some mansion, but a private residence built in the countryside.\n\nIt was three stories tall with its own courtyard wall. Although this kind of house was spacious and offered a lot of freedom, it wasn't actually that expensive—at least, compared to the woman casually tossing out a card worth a million, living here seemed a bit out of place.\n\nHe rang the doorbell.\n\nA woman in homewear and an apron came out. After she opened the door, Zhou Ze realized that this woman, who looked more like a proper housewife than a proper housewife, was the same one who had come to his bookstore yesterday.\n\nThe clothes make the man. The woman now, at least in terms of her aura, was like a completely different person from yesterday.\n\n\"Please, come in.\"\n\nThe woman bowed her head slightly, gesturing for Zhou Ze and Bai Yingying to enter, then closed the door.\n\n\"After my husband fell ill, he insisted on moving here. This used to be his ancestral home. It was treated as the family estate and hadn't been lived in for decades. It was renovated and rebuilt a few years ago.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded and walked into the main hall. The layout of the hall was also very ordinary, just like a normal family's home. On the south-facing wall hung the portrait of a deity, though Zhou Ze honestly couldn't recognize who it was.\n\nBelow it were incense and candles, as well as a table.\n\n\"My husband is on the second floor. Please follow me.\"\n\nThe woman kept her eyes lowered submissively, as if this was her persona at home—a perfect, domestic wife.\n\nBai Yingying kept her eyes fixed on her. Although she had faith in her boss,\n\nStill...\n\nHah, men!\n\nThey went up the stairs to the second floor. The moment she pushed open the door to the balcony, Zhou Ze saw that the balcony corridor was plastered with paper talismans of all shapes and sizes.\n\nBai Yingying subconsciously took a step back. Zhou Ze shook his head, signaling for her not to be afraid.\n\nThese paper talismans were all for show.\n\nWalking further in, the door to the second room was pushed open. Zhou Ze saw it was a room with a tatami mat layout. An old man with graying hair, now just skin and bones, was sitting there, muttering to himself as if chatting with someone.\n\nZhou Ze also noticed something else: from the main gate—no, to be precise, from the road outside the main gate all the way to every corner of this house, there were surveillance cameras.\n\nHe estimated that even the bathroom was the same.\n\nTherefore, in this place, the woman had to keep up the act. The old man definitely had a backup plan for his inheritance. Rich people aren't usually that stupid.\n\nZhou Ze sat down next to the old man, reached for the red wine on the side, poured a glass, and took a sip.\n\nTasted pretty good. The man knew how to enjoy life.\n\nThe old man seemed to be \"playing\" with his great-granddaughter and great-grandson, constantly making cooing sounds to amuse children and telling them stories.\n\nZhou Ze leaned back and listened. From the looks of it, the old man likely had a mental problem, because Zhou Ze didn't see any ghosts in the room.\n\nBai Yingying stood at the doorway, but after a while, she felt a bit stuffy and went out onto the balcony to look at the farmland scenery outside.\n\nThe woman brought over some snacks and offered them to Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head, indicating he didn't need any, then clapped his hands and called out,\n\n\"Old Master, are these your great-grandchildren?\"\n\n\"Ah?\" The old man's eyes were somewhat cloudy, but within that cloudiness, there was a strange excitement.\n\nThe woman had said before that her husband was bedridden, just waiting for him to breathe his last so she could receive her inheritance. But now, the old man was sometimes delirious, sometimes perfectly normal, yet his spirits were getting better by the day. He could eat, move, and get out of bed. You could call it a final burst of energy before death, but wasn't it lasting a bit too long?\n\n\"Yes, my great-grandchildren. Come, Junjun, call this man 'uncle'.\"\n\nThe old man gestured for his \"great-grandson\" in front of him to come over.\n\n\"Aww, so well-behaved.\"\n\nZhou Ze praised, even though he couldn't see a single hair.\n\nNext,\n\nIt was story time between Boss Zhou and the old man. The old man talked about his business, recounting how he had started in middle age and how he had improved his family's fortunes.\n\nZhou Ze hadn't done much research at first, but he later learned that the old man's ancestral home was Tongcheng, but he had snuck over to Southeast Asia as a young man and made his fortune there. After the economic reforms, he returned, cut off his old smuggling business, and laundered his identity to become an overseas Chinese investor.\n\nHonestly, this old man was a minor legend in his own right. His story of success could be written into an inspirational, chicken-soup-for-the-soul autobiography.\n\nZhou Ze listened with great interest. The old man even had his great-granddaughter and great-grandson recite ancient poems and sing songs. Zhou Ze still couldn't see a thing, but he clapped and cheered nonetheless.\n\nThe whole process was a bit like those young heartthrob actors who film their scenes against a green screen, with a stand-in doing the acting, and their faces pasted on in post-production.\n\nAs they were chatting, the woman came again.\n\n\"Husband, Mr. Zhou, lunch is ready. We can eat now.\"\n\nHearing this, the old man's previous amiability vanished. He became fierce, a fierceness that seemed like all bark and no bite. In short, he roared fearfully,\n\n\"They're all down there! They're all down there! I'm not going! I'm not going! They're all waiting for me down there!\"\n\nAs he shouted, the old man curled up on the tatami mat, looking like a terrified child.\n\nThe woman looked a bit helpless and glanced at Zhou Ze, signaling that he could come down to eat.\n\nZhou Ze got up and bid the old man farewell.\n\nJust as he was about to leave, his hand was grabbed by the old man.\n\nThe old man said with great earnestness, \"Don't go down there. They're right below. They were sent back by the Sea Dragon King, and they'll eat you. Really, you'll die if you go down there!\"\n\n\"Mhm, don't worry. I was sent by Sun Wukong to return the Golden-Hooped Rod. Relax.\"\n\nZhou Ze reached out and patted the old man's shoulder. While the old man was chewing on that last sentence, he slipped away.\n\nThe three of them walked from the balcony toward the staircase.\n\nThe woman asked in a low voice, \"Is there a way to treat him?\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. \"Let Wang Ke take a look. This old man probably has psychological issues or a rare form of dementia. There are no ghosts around him.\"\n\n\"Then you can keep the deposit. Stay for lunch before you go. I'm quite good at French and Japanese cuisine. My Chinese cooking is just average.\"\n\nIf there were ghosts, Zhou Ze would have seen them.\n\nWhat a pity. This deal was off the table.\n\n\"Come back! Come back!\"\n\nThe old man suddenly shouted, standing at the door of the room.\n\nZhou Ze glanced back, then continued walking downstairs with the woman.\n\n\"Then you can keep the deposit. Stay for lunch before you go. I'm quite good at French and Japanese cuisine. My Chinese cooking is just average,\" the woman said humbly.\n\nDescending the stairs, they reached the main hall. To be honest, Zhou Ze was actually keen to taste the woman's cooking.\n\nThis just went to show, to successfully marry into a wealthy family and achieve the status of a young wife to an old man, it's really difficult without some genuine skills. This path wasn't an easy one to walk.\n\nIf you just lie on your dorm bed watching TV dramas and fantasizing, it's likely to remain just a fantasy forever.\n\nHowever,\n\nWhen Zhou Ze turned the corner into the living area,\n\nHe froze.\n\nBehind him, Bai Yingying also froze.\n\nAround the table in the main hall,\n\nIt was filled with people.\n\nThere were old and young, men and women—four generations under one roof.\n\nThe entire family was sitting there, neat and orderly.\n\nEach of them was staring at the rice bowl in front of them, and in each bowl, a pair of chopsticks was stuck upright.³\n\nAt the same time,\n\nEvery single one of them was soaked to the bone.\n\nWater droplets dripped incessantly from their chins and the hems of their clothes.\n\nThe living room floor was already a wide, wet patch,\n\nas if it had just been mopped.\n\n***\n\n**Footnotes:**\n\n1.  **\"Even if you haven't eaten pork, haven't you seen a pig run?\"**: A common Chinese idiom meaning one can have knowledge about something through observation, even without direct experience.\n2.  **Jiangshi**: A type of reanimated corpse, or \"hopping vampire,\" from Chinese folklore.\n3.  **Chopsticks stuck upright in rice**: This is a major cultural taboo in many East Asian countries, as it resembles incense sticks burned as offerings for the dead at a funeral or grave. It is a powerful symbol of death.",

    "content": "Zhou Ze's lips parted slightly. Then, he subconsciously grabbed the woman, who was still walking forward.\n\nThe woman was a bit surprised. She glanced at Zhou Ze, not knowing what he intended to do.\n\n\"I take back what I just said.\"\n\nZhou Ze gently cracked his neck.\n\n\"This house of yours... it really isn't clean.\"\n\nA thoughtful expression appeared on the woman's face.\n\n\"Don't worry, I'm not some charlatan.\"\n\n\"I believe you're not a charlatan,\" the woman said very seriously. \"Besides, it's only a few million. Even if I were swindled, it wouldn't matter.\"\n\nThose words...\n\nWhat a flex,¹\n\nThey really grated on the ears.\n\nA few million was like a few hundred to her, just to buy some peace of mind?\n\n*Spendthrift woman.*\n\nZhou Ze mourned silently for the old man upstairs. Why was he still making such a fuss at his age? Was the family fortune he had worked so hard to build just going to fall entirely into this woman's hands?\n\nFortunately, Zhou Ze still had some professional ethics. The woman was the one who hired him, so he wouldn't go looking for extra trouble.\n\nOf course, in the eyes of Bai Yingying beside him, Zhou Ze and this woman currently looked a bit like they were in cahoots, a living, breathing, new-century version of Wu Dalang and Pan Jinlian.²\n\nIf this were made into a TV drama, the boss and this woman would be the classic villains!\n\n\"Your husband isn't mentally unstable. There really is something unclean here. Let's not talk about the money for now. We can discuss it slowly after I've taken care of things here. Yingying, take her upstairs.\"\n\n\"Boss, you're all alone...\" Bai Yingying didn't want to go up. The boss was still injured.\n\nAt that moment, Zhou Ze really wanted to poke his maid's forehead with his middle finger. It wouldn't matter if something happened to him, but if some accident befell this woman, who would he collect his final payment from?\n\nThe woman was very obedient. Even though she couldn't see anything, she at least projected an attitude of \"I believe you\" and willingly stepped back.\n\n*What a clever woman. Sensible, able to change her demeanor at will—a vixen in bed, a lady out of it, can cook, can act, and can even pretend to be understanding.*\n\nZhou Ze glanced at Bai Yingying again. *Sigh, his own Yingying still had so much to learn.*\n\nUnder Zhou Ze's stern gaze, Bai Yingying could only accompany the woman upstairs. She needed to protect both the woman and the old man.\n\nNow, only that family and Zhou Ze remained in the entire hall.\n\nThese people maintained a formal sitting posture, straight as ramrods, like primary school students in class. Even the oldest woman among them was the same.\n\n*That old woman must be the old man's original wife.*\n\nFor ordinary people, even if the lingering souls of deceased relatives came back to visit, it would be one or two at most. But this old man? His entire family, four generations under one roof. Zhou Ze counted, and there were about twenty of them.\n\nThe scale of this family reunion³ was truly immense. No wonder the old man was scared out of his wits.\n\nIf his old wife had returned, or a child, or a grandchild, that would have been acceptable. But for the whole extended family to come back together—anyone would be scared stiff.\n\nLeaning on his cane, Zhou Ze approached them. The closer he got, the more clearly he could feel an icy coldness washing over him, and the air grew thick with a damp, salty smell.\n\nThe old man's family had reportedly perished at sea in a cruise ship accident. As for whether there was some inside story, Zhou Ze didn't know, nor did he want to know.\n\nRegardless, this family right here would count as a considerable amount of \"business\" for him. He could collect them all in one go.\n\n\"*Gurgle...*\"\n\n\"*Gurgle...*\"\n\nThe sound of water began to emanate from the surroundings. It was coming from their necks. From the old woman to the young children, their necks were all swelling up like bloated frogs.\n\nImmediately after,\n\n\"*Retch...*\"\n\nEveryone in the hall began to vomit.\n\nMurky seawater mixed with silt spewed from their mouths, along with some dead fish and shrimp!\n\nBefore, the hall had merely looked like it had just been mopped.\n\nBut now,\n\nIt was like a seafood market, reeking with the thick stench of fish—like a room in a love hotel that had been used continuously for a month without the sheets ever being changed.\n\nZhou Ze covered his nose with his hand and lifted his foot, only to find that seawater had suddenly risen to his ankles.\n\nThe hall was like a reservoir, and the twenty-odd people were like twenty-odd faucets on its edge, pouring water in.\n\nThe water pooled without draining, slowly filling the hall.\n\nZhou Ze moved closer, placed a hand on a middle-aged man's shoulder, and with his nails growing out, stabbed directly into the man's shoulder.\n\n\"*Tsssss...*\"\n\nThe sound of deep-frying oil sizzled as thick black smoke began to rise from the middle-aged man's body. Yet he remained seated, motionless, as if completely at Zhou Ze's mercy.\n\n\"*Crack...*\"\n\nA crisp sound came from under Zhou Ze's feet.\n\nThen, a green belt wrapped around Zhou Ze's arm. Zhou Ze instinctively retreated, but the belt was extremely agile and shot right after him.\n\nWhen one end of the belt lifted up, stopping less than a decimeter from Zhou Ze's eyes, it froze.\n\nThis was no belt. It was clearly a sea snake, green from head to tail.\n\nThe sea snake flicked its tongue. After gaining a perfect strike position, it paused, as if merely intending to intimidate Zhou Ze.\n\nThe water around them continued to rise. It was as if the twenty-odd people had an endless supply in their stomachs. The water level in the living room had already reached Zhou Ze's waist.\n\nThis was fake, and yet it was real.\n\nZhou Ze could choose to leave this sensation, to simply walk away, but that would mean admitting defeat, voluntarily stepping down from the ring.\n\nNever mind whether he'd get his service fee; he also wouldn't be able to turn this family of souls in for his quota.\n\n\"*Splash...*\"\n\nThe painting hanging on the living room wall was also washed down by the water and slowly drifted over to Zhou Ze's side.\n\nZhou Ze had found this deity portrait strange from the start. Most families would hang portraits of Maitreya Buddha, Guanyin, or the God of Wealth in their main halls, but the god in this painting was clearly not one of the mainstream ones.\n\nThe portrait depicted a male figure with the body of a fish but human hands and feet, riding a two-headed dragon. It was definitely a god, but ordinary families almost never hung this one. It was basically an indie choice.\n\nAt this moment, the sea snake seemed to be slowly tightening its coils. Zhou Ze felt a constricting force on his wrist. This was a warning, a second warning. A warning to Zhou Ze that he need not interfere in this matter.\n\nThe painting slowly drifted right in front of Zhou Ze, touching his body.\n\nZhou Ze frowned slightly, thinking hard. Finally, he remembered who this sacred figure in the painting was!\n\nSo, he really had to thank himself for reading so many books after becoming a bookstore owner. Every day with nothing to do, he would sit on the downstairs sofa, drinking coffee and reading, and had made a point of brushing up on ancient tales of the strange and supernatural.\n\nThis was... a sea god!\n\nFor people today, the first sea gods that come to mind are probably Mazu or Poseidon. In reality, however, the Chinese mythological system has a much older sea god.\n\nA passage from the *Classic of Mountains and Seas, Great Wilderness: East* records: \"In the isles of the East Sea there is a god, with a human face and a bird's body, who wears two yellow snakes as earrings and treads upon two yellow snakes. His name is Yu Guo. The Yellow Emperor fathered Yu Guo, Yu Guo fathered Yu Jing. Yu Jing resides in the North Sea, and Yu Guo resides in the East Sea. They are sea gods.\"\n\nAn ancient sea god. Actually, considering the old man upstairs had started out as a sea smuggler, it was understandable that he would hang this portrait in his house.\n\nBut what did this mean?\n\nA group of relatives who died at sea suddenly returning five years later for revenge? Who brought them back? Who permitted them to return?\n\nFor those who died in remote places, especially those who suffered a violent death, it's actually very difficult for their souls to return. That's why in the folk custom of burning offerings, there's an essential step: \"calling the soul.\" It's meant to beckon the soul of the one being commemorated to come back and enjoy the incense from their descendants.\n\nBut for people who died at sea like this, they would either go straight to Hell, or even if they managed to linger as souls, they'd be like something out of *Pirates of the Caribbean*—doomed to languish at the bottom of the sea or drift about with some ghost ship.\n\nNow, here they were, the whole family, neat and tidy, having returned together. They were sitting prim and proper, visiting the old man. Without an external force pushing from behind, without the tacit approval of some party, was that even possible?\n\nCould it be... that the sea god was truly enraged?\n\nIt was almost certain that there was something suspicious about the deaths of the old man's family. And the old man had married this woman that very same year.\n\nIf a powerful god was truly enraged and carrying out punishment and retribution, did a minor ghost emissary⁴ like him really have any right to interfere?\n\nBesides, to confront an entity of the sea for something like \"making money\"... wasn't that a bit foolish?\n\nZhou Ze looked up. The woman and the old man should be upstairs. The woman wanted the old man to die of natural causes so she could inherit the fortune, and ghosts and gods wouldn't be caught on surveillance cameras.\n\n\"Hey, buddy, can we discuss something? Can you make the old man's death look a little more natural? And then, can I take the old man's new wife upstairs away with me?\" Zhou Ze asked the portrait.\n\n\"*Hiss!*\"\n\nThe sea snake suddenly grew furious, opening its fangs and lunging at Zhou Ze's chest.\n\nZhou Ze's gaze sharpened. He had been on guard against this snake the whole time. He instantly grabbed its tail with his fingertips, and the snake's head stopped just a few centimeters from his chest.\n\n\"Not even willing to talk? Give a guy some room to negotiate, will you, big brother?\" Zhou Ze said with a wry smile.\n\n\"I may be a ghost emissary, the lowest-ranking official in the underworld administration, but I'm still an official. Don't just ignore me like this, boss man.\"\n\n\"*Hisssss!*\"\n\nThe sea snake thrashed wildly.\n\n\"*Splat!*\"\n\nThe snake's body snapped in two. The head flew to Zhou Ze's chest and bit down on his body.\n\nIn that instant, what Zhou Ze felt wasn't a physical wound but an agonizing pain from his soul, as if the snake's fangs had pierced two holes right through it.\n\nCold sweat immediately broke out. Zhou Ze sank to one knee, propping himself up with one hand to keep from falling into the \"water.\"\n\n\"*Huff... huff...*\"\n\nZhou Ze forcibly ripped the snake's head off.\n\nHis black nails crushed it to pulp.\n\n\"So we're not playing by the rules anymore, huh...\" Zhou Ze muttered to himself, his expression growing darker and darker.\n\nThen, he slowly raised his head, a black light swirling in the depths of his eyes.\n\n\"In that case, I'd like to see if you can fucking run all the way from the sea to the land to act so high and mighty!\"\n\n---\n¹ **Flex:** The original term, `扎比` (zhā bǐ), is modern slang for showing off or bragging, often in a way that makes others feel bad. \"Flex\" captures this sense of flaunting wealth.\n\n² **Wu Dalang and Pan Jinlian:** Famous characters from the classic Chinese novel *Water Margin*.

    "content": "\"Listen, little sister, is your boss's part-time job being a Taoist priest or a monk?\"\n\nOn the balcony, the woman took out a slim cigarette and smoked it silently. At home, under surveillance, she would never smoke; she would always deliberately maintain her image as a good, virtuous wife.\n\nBut for some reason, at this moment, she felt a bit agitated and wanted to use the cigarette to steady her emotions.\n\n\"You've got it backward. The bookstore is the part-time job,\" Bai Yingying replied.\n\n\"Oh, how interesting.\"\n\nThe woman reached out to adjust Bai Yingying's hair bun and said softly,\n\n\"Has he brainwashed you? To make you admire him so much?\"\n\nBai Yingying looked at the woman as if she were looking at an idiot.\n\nThe woman shook her head. She didn't believe it, but as she had said, since it was someone Wang Ke recommended, she was willing to spend a few million to see it go down the drain.\n\nThe old man cowered at the doorway of the room, watching his wife and Bai Yingying. He waved and shouted,\n\n\"Come in! Hurry and hide inside! They'll come, they're going to come, they're really going to come!\"\n\nThe woman ignored her husband and continued to smoke her cigarette.\n\nBai Yingying paid him even less mind. She was worried about her boss downstairs, afraid something might happen to him.\n\nHer boss had just gone berserk in Yancheng, and his physical condition was now very poor. In other words, the so-called skill cooldown period wasn't over yet, so the danger factor was naturally higher as a result.\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nThe living room door downstairs was pushed open,\n\nand Zhou Ze, drenched in a cold sweat, came tumbling out. He was soaked from head to toe, as though drenched by cold sweat.\n\n\"*Huff... huff... huff... huff...*\"\n\nLying on the floor, Zhou Ze gasped for air, taking huge gulps as if it were precious, cherishing every breath.\n\n\"Boss!\"\n\nBai Yingying shouted anxiously from the balcony.\n\nZhou Ze staggered to his feet, picked up the crutch that had fallen beside him, and waved up at her, signaling for Bai Yingying not to come down. Then he walked back into the living room.\n\nAbout ten minutes later,\n\nZhou Ze came tumbling out again. This time, he lay there for a full five minutes before slowly getting up, propping himself up again with the crutch. Zhou Ze's body seemed to be swaying unsteadily.\n\n\"Boss...\"\n\nBai Yingying called out again.\n\n\"Don't come down! Protect them! I refuse to believe that a mighty dragon can't crush a local snake!\"¹\n\nZhou Ze continued walking back inside.\n\nThe woman exhaled a smoke ring and said, \"Such a realistic performance.\"\n\nObviously, she thought Zhou Ze was putting on a show, just like those Taoist priests performing rituals, doing nothing more than pleasing an audience to get paid.\n\n\"Urk...\"\n\nThe woman was rendered speechless.\n\nBecause Bai Yingying's hand was wrapped directly around her throat.\n\nHer feet were already off the ground. This high school girl had lifted her up so easily with just one hand.\n\n\"This isn't an act,\"\n\nBai Yingying said with grave seriousness.\n\n\"If something really happens to the boss, rest assured, I will definitely take it out on you.\"\n\n\"He... he himself... for... for money...\" the woman retorted with difficulty.\n\n\"You're a woman. Don't you understand a certain truth?\" Bai Yingying shot back.\n\n\"Wha...t...\"\n\n\"And that is: don't try to reason with a woman.\"\n\n***\n\nZhou Ze walked into the living room again. By now, the room was almost completely filled with water. It was full of liquid, yet the twenty-some people were still there, endlessly spewing water.\n\nTruly endless, a genuine, massive sea.\n\nAnd the sea serpent whose head Zhou Ze had blown up at the beginning had now become a water python, its barrel-thick torso constantly swimming back and forth, exuding an immense pressure.\n\nHowever, on closer inspection, the giant python's body was also a mess of mangled flesh and blood. In many places, its scales were missing. Clearly, in its repeated clashes with Zhou Ze, it too had been severely wounded.\n\n\"*Hisssssss...*\"\n\nThe water python charged again.\n\nZhou Ze lifted his head, gritted his teeth, and thrust his hands forward. Bloodstains reappeared on his fingernails; he had clearly reached the breaking point again.\n\nHis body was indeed somewhat weak now, having just been drained in Yancheng recently.\n\nIf he were at his peak, Zhou Ze felt he wouldn't be in such a sorry state.\n\nThis was just a sea serpent. Even if it came in the name of a Sea God, it was still just a snake. In a one-on-one fight, he wouldn't have been this intimidated.\n\nWhat Zhou Ze was actually worried about was whether, if a being like the Sea God truly existed in this world, his choice this time would anger it.\n\nOf course, the other party hadn't really given him a choice.\n\nZhou Ze had wanted to back down, to retreat. He'd rather not fight if he didn't have to, rather not poke the tiger if he could avoid it. But the other side's attitude was too aggressive, giving him absolutely no way out.\n\nBoss Zhou loved money, and he loved results, but he loved his life even more.\n\n\"*Hisss...*\"\n\nThe water python's body slammed into Zhou Ze again. He fell to the ground, his face pale, but his fingernails simultaneously plunged into the python's body, pulled out a red halo of light, and instantly crushed it!\n\nNext, the water python and Zhou Ze lay on the ground together, staring at each other.\n\nThe water python tried several times to coil up again but failed. Zhou Ze also wanted to get up, but he couldn't move.\n\nOne man, one snake, staring each other down. Even if you lose the battle, don't lose the face. They were locked in a stalemate.\n\n\"Aren't you tired?\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nThe water python didn't respond, only stared intently at Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Did the Sea God really send you?\" Zhou Ze continued to ask.\n\nThe water python still didn't respond.\n\nZhou Ze took a deep breath. With a person, you could at least talk. But with a beast,\n\nHow do you talk?\n\nAs if it had perceived Zhou Ze's thoughts, the water python suddenly raised its head, its gaze filled with fury as it stared at him.\n\nHeh.\n\nJust like that monkey.\n\nCan it directly sense a person's thoughts?\n\n\"*Vmmm!*\"\n\nThe water python began to tremble. In an instant, its body started to disintegrate, but from its shattering form, countless thumb-sized snakes began to emerge.\n\nThis dense swarm of things began to surge toward Zhou Ze like a tide that blotted out the sky!\n\n\"Get lost!\"\n\nZhou Ze propped himself up with both hands on the floor, forcing his head up. The nails of his ten fingers dug directly into the floorboards. Wisps of black qi were squeezed out, forming a protective circle around him. Any of the small snakes around him that touched the black qi were annihilated.\n\nThe stalemate between man and snake seemed destined to continue. Both sides were already at the end of their ropes, but they were still holding on.\n\nAnd just then, the twenty-some people who had been acting as \"faucets\" all shut their mouths in unison. Then, they slowly began to stand up.\n\nThey didn't walk toward Zhou Ze, nor did they walk toward the water python. Instead, they lined up, like elementary school students leaving school for the evening, and headed for the stairs.\n\nThey...\n\nwere going upstairs!\n\nZhou Ze wasn't sure if his arrival had stimulated them into action, or if he had just arrived at a very coincidental time.\n\n\"*Hisssssss...*\" One fearless little snake actually penetrated Zhou Ze's black qi. It compressed its body, then shot up, burrowing directly toward Zhou Ze's ear.\n\nZhou Ze felt a slick sensation by his ear. The thing was still trying its damnedest to drill its way in.\n\nBut there were more small snakes all around. Zhou Ze didn't dare pull his hands out of the floor, or else he'd experience the feeling of a \"snake pit.\" It was said that cruel kings in ancient times enjoyed this sort of thing, throwing their victims into a nest of snakes.\n\nBut the nauseating feeling coming from his ear was just too distinct. If he didn't stop it, heaven knows where that thing would end up.\n\nTongcheng had a tradition of temple fairs.² Zhou Ze remembered that when he was a child, the orphanage had also organized trips to attend them. At one fair, he recalled a stall where, for a two-yuan ticket, you could see a woman lying on a bed shrouded by a mosquito net, surrounded by many small snakes.\n\nThe woman would perform a trick for the ticket buyers: she would pinch a small snake, stuff it into her nostril, and then the snake would slowly crawl out of her mouth.\n\nAt the time, as a spectator, he had found it amazing, but Zhou Ze had no desire to experience it himself.\n\nBut Zhou Ze had no other options right now. He didn't have the Yin-Yang Register with him, because that thing would start vibrating like a vibrator³ whenever it was near someone on the verge of death, rattling your nerves.\n\nRight, he still had a bronze ring. But he had no idea what it did. He was carrying the ring, but if he put it on and it ended up killing him, there would be no one to complain to.\n\nDeep breaths, deep breaths, keep taking deep breaths.\n\nThe slimy thing in his ear was still pushing its way in, itching unbearably.\n\nZhou Ze could only subconsciously tilt his head, trying to squeeze his ear between his shoulder and arm in hopes of dislodging the thing.\n\nJust then, Zhou Ze suddenly remembered he seemed to have two Ghost Emissary IDs in his left pocket.\n\nIt's a gamble!\n\nPulling his hands from the floor, Zhou Ze quickly took out one of the Ghost Emissary IDs. Before the surrounding swarm of snakes could surge toward him, Zhou Ze rubbed the ID vigorously with his bloody fingernails. Green smoke began to rise from it, and then the ID started to crack, obviously ruined.\n\nBut the green smoke continued to rise, like a lit match.\n\n\"*Flick!*\"\n\nZhou Ze threw the Ghost Emissary ID out of the room.\n\nThe massive number of small snakes instantly abandoned Zhou Ze and pounced on the Ghost Emissary ID outside.\n\nPerhaps because the water python had divided itself into too many, too small pieces, the intelligence of each individual had been averaged down. Zhou Ze felt like he had just been playing fetch with a dog.\n\nAnd the family that had just been going upstairs also rushed down as if they'd gone mad, running into the swarm of snakes outside the living room. Apparently, the strange fragrance emitted by the burning Ghost Emissary ID had an overwhelming attraction for ghostly beings!\n\nAt that moment, Zhou Ze didn't relax or pause to catch his breath. He reached out directly, grabbed the portrait, and unhesitatingly tore it open with his nails.\n\n\"*Rrrrrip!*\"\n\nWith a crisp sound,\n\nthe portrait tore. The small snakes inside and outside the room began to slowly evaporate, and the family members began to melt away as well.\n\n\"*Slam!*\"\n\nA gust of sinister wind blew past, and the living room door slammed shut.\n\nFinally,\n\neverything returned to calm.\n\n\"*Huff... huff... huff... huff...*\"\n\nZhou Ze collapsed to his knees on the ground.\n\nSo tired.\n\nHe was completely drained.\n\nBut...\n\nlooking at it now...\n\nit seemed the Sea God wasn't all that great after all.\n\nFor a moment, Boss Zhou was filled with a sense of accomplishment, feeling incredibly good about himself.\n\n\"*Thump!*\"\n\n\"*Thump!*\"\n\nIt sounded like the wind was picking up outside.\n\nThe wind continuously battered the doorframe.\n\nAt first, Zhou Ze didn't think anything of it. But slowly, he realized something was wrong. The floor... it was still shaking and tilting.\n\nZhou Ze used his last ounce of strength to prop himself up against the wall and get to his feet. He staggered to the door,\n\nreached out,\n\nand pushed the living room door open.\n\nOutside,\n\nwas, shockingly,\n\na vast, boundless ocean!\n\n---\n¹TN: A play on the Chinese idiom 強龍不壓地頭蛇 (qiáng lóng bù yā dìtóushé), meaning \"a mighty dragon cannot crush a local snake.\" It signifies that even a powerful outsider is no match for a local power on their home turf.

    "content": "Oh, sea, oh vast sea, you are all water…\n\n***\n\nZhou Ze leaned against the doorframe, watching the surging waves outside. He felt a mix of helplessness and a headache, the kind of powerlessness you feel after a brutal battle, when you finally climb out from a pile of corpses only to see a fresh squadron of enemy cavalry charging at you.\n\nIt was as if all his previous efforts had been a joke, a farce, utterly meaningless.\n\n\"Boss! Come quick, Boss!\"\n\nBai Yingying suddenly shouted from upstairs, apparently having run into an emergency.\n\nZhou Ze looked up, then tried reaching his hand outside. The touch was icy cold, strikingly real.\n\nIn truth, they both knew deep down that this was fake. It had to be.\n\nThis wasn't some myth about the Dragon King flooding Chentang Pass to force Nezha to his death.¹ Zhou Ze couldn't possibly believe that the Sea God would actually flood all of Tongcheng just to cause trouble for a mere ghost emissary like him.\n\nFirst, the other party probably didn't possess such exaggerated divine power.\n\nSecond, even if he did, he wouldn't dare do it.\n\nThe seawater was fake, but here was the problem: it could deceive all your senses, making every perception from top to bottom believe you were drowning.\n\nIt could be called a form of hypnosis, but it transcended hypnosis. Ghosts typically used such methods to lure people to their deaths, but when *this* entity used it, it was far more terrifying.\n\nZhou Ze believed that even if he built a wooden raft and floated out, the Sea God could probably make him drift on the sea for ten days or half a month without any change, leaving him to die of thirst, starvation, or drowning.\n\nLeaning on the wall, Zhou Ze slowly climbed the stairs. Bai Yingying had just been calling for him.\n\nWhen Zhou Ze emerged from the staircase with some difficulty, he found himself not on the second floor of a residence, but on the deck of a cruise ship.\n\n\"Boss, this place has changed,\" Bai Yingying called out to Zhou Ze from the deck.\n\n\"What about the old man and the woman?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nHe had sent Bai Yingying to the second floor to protect them, but now she was alone.\n\nThen, Zhou Ze subconsciously sank into a chair to the side and let out a long sigh. Above his head was a sun umbrella, and beside him were drinks and liquor.\n\nZhou Ze was truly exhausted. It was a miracle this body hadn't fallen apart after all he'd put it through. Now, even the slightest movement caused all his joints to protest in pain.\n\n\"I don't know. Just now, my vision blurred for a moment, and then I found myself on this cruise ship.\"\n\nBai Yingying looked around and continued:\n\n\"Even though I know it's all fake, similar to the illusory arts my lady used to use, it's so realistic. Even the salty smell in the air is the same.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded, picked up a nearby glass, poured himself some ice water, and took two sips.\n\n\"If I'm not mistaken,\" he said, \"this should be the cruise ship that had the accident five years ago. Go look around. That family should be here somewhere,\" Zhou Ze prompted.\n\n\"What do we do when we find them?\"\n\n\"I don't know either. I'm not the one who knows illusory arts.\"\n\nZhou Ze rubbed the bridge of his nose. *Might as well take it as it comes*, he thought. If that great Lord Sea God wasn't willing to let it go, he could only wait and react. After all, the two of them were not on the same level.\n\nIn fact, Zhou Ze had been held over a fire this whole time. The key reason was that the Sea God's position was too high; he disdained to even talk to Zhou Ze, let alone negotiate or discuss terms.\n\nBai Yingying obediently went upstairs to search. The cruise ship had three levels: the middle deck, an upper level, and the cabins below. Soon, Bai Yingying came back down.\n\n\"No one's up there,\" she said.\n\n\"Then go check downstairs.\"\n\nBai Yingying went down to look again. When Zhou Ze had come up, the area below still had the appearance of the living room, but when Bai Yingying went down, it had transformed into the ship's cabins.\n\n\"Boss, still no one,\" Bai Yingying called out after checking.\n\n\"No one?\"\n\nZhou Ze found this hard to believe.\n\n\"That's right. I checked every room downstairs and confirmed there's no one. Not even a single crew member. This cruise ship is just stopped here on the sea by itself.\"\n\n\"That can't be right,\" Zhou Ze muttered to himself.\n\nThose in high positions always like to play these games of karmic cycles, probably because it makes them look more impressive. Just like when Patriarch Bodhi tapped Monkey Sun on the back of the head three times.²\n\nPreviously, upon seeing the sea and then the cruise ship, Zhou Ze had assumed the Lord Sea God wanted them to witness what exactly happened five years ago.\n\nOr perhaps, the Lord Sea God wanted to punish those he sought to punish while also showing off a high-level move—a performance so dazzling that you could only stand by, clap, and exclaim:\n\n\"Oh!\nSo that's how it is!\nOf course, that's how it is!\nWho knew that's how it is!\n666666666!\"\n\nBut now you've just whipped up an ocean and a cruise ship, and besides me and Bai Yingying, there are no extras? How is this script supposed to proceed?\n\nCould it be that the Lord Sea God ran out of battery, so he only managed to create half of it and couldn't finish the rest?\n\n\"Check again. See if there's any other information.\"\n\nZhou Ze could only grit his teeth and stand up. He headed downstairs first, while Bai Yingying went to check the upper level again.\n\n*Please don't let this be a half-finished product because he ran out of battery.*\n\nZhou Ze could only plead inwardly. If the Sea God was just setting a stage to show off in front of a ghost emissary like him, the worst outcome would be that the Sea God succeeded, showed him up completely, the people who were meant to die would die, he wouldn't be able to save them, and the final payment would be a lost cause. But after that, everyone could go their separate ways.\n\nBut if it was a half-finished product, how could the script continue?\n\nWere Bai Yingying and I just supposed to stand here awkwardly?\n\nHeaven knows how long this illusion would last. He was a complete novice in this area, and while Bai Yingying might know a little, she was a dabbler at best. He couldn't possibly be stuck in this godforsaken place for decades, waiting for Bai Yingying to become more powerful or for him to evolve further just to get out, could he?\n\nIn that time, forget about sour plum juice, there wouldn't even be food. This body of his couldn't go that long without eating.\n\nAs he thought about it, Zhou Ze actually leaned his head out a porthole to look down at the sea.\n\nWere there any fish?\n\nIf there were, he could at least survive by eating fish.\n\nBut this one look revealed something startling. Zhou Ze saw a mass of black clinging to the side of the hull at the waterline, like a patch of seaweed, swaying with the waves but never drifting away from the deck area.\n\nZhou Ze subconsciously bent down and extended his cane, trying to poke at it in the water, but he couldn't reach. He nearly fell into the sea himself.\n\nIn his current physical state, comparable to a man in his seventies or eighties, if he fell in, he would surely drown. He'd be hard-pressed to even splash around a few times in a death struggle.\n\n\"Yingying,\" Zhou Ze called upwards.\n\n*Thump, thump, thump…*\n\nBai Yingying quickly ran down.\n\n\"Boss, what is it?\"\n\n\"Go into the water and see what that thing is,\" Zhou Ze said, pointing down.\n\nBai Yingying leaned over to look and noticed the black mass of \"seaweed.\" She immediately leaped down.\n\nHer form was graceful,\nher movements precise,\nand she made only a small splash.\n\nAfter entering the water, Bai Yingying used her momentum to continue diving down. Zhou Ze waited on the deck.\n\nAbout half a minute later, Bai Yingying surfaced. The female zombie was now soaked from head to toe, and her skin had turned somewhat pale. Zhou Ze certainly didn't think it was because the seawater was too cold for her.\n\nA zombie, afraid of the cold?\nPossible?\n\n\"What is that thing?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Boss, they… they…\"\n\n\"Hurry up and say it,\" Zhou Ze urged.\n\nThis concerned whether he and Bai Yingying could leave this damn place.\n\n\"They're all down there, Boss. The whole family, they're all down there.\"\n\nBai Yingying pointed down into the water.\n\n\"All down there?\" Zhou Ze was surprised. Then, as a thought struck him, he pointed at the black mass. \"Is that… hair?\"\n\n\"Yes, it's hair,\" Bai Yingying confirmed.\n\n\"They all drowned?\"\n\n\"Umm…\"\n\nBai Yingying wore a dazed and cute expression, looking conflicted, troubled, and a bit lost.\n\nIf it weren't too far and his cane wasn't long enough, Zhou Ze would have loved to smack her on the head with it right then. *At a time like this, you're still floating in the water acting cute?*\n\n\"Boss, you should just jump down and see for yourself. It's not easy to describe,\" Bai Yingying said bluntly.\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze.\n\n*If I could jump down, why would I have called you over instead of jumping down myself?*\n\n\"Come on down, Boss. I'll catch you.\" Bai Yingying opened her arms. \"The thing down there… you really have to see it for yourself.\"\n\nZhou Ze hesitated for a moment, then tossed his cane aside, swung himself over the railing, and actually jumped from the deck.\n\nWith a *splash*, he hit the water and was caught by Bai Yingying.\n\n\"Boss, take a deep breath. I'll take you down. If you need to come up for air, pinch my chest.\"\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze.\n\nImmediately after, seeing Zhou Ze take a deep breath, Bai Yingying took him straight down. Her physical prowess was immense, completely outclassing that of any competitive swimmer, so even while carrying the burden of Zhou Ze, she moved through the water with ease.\n\nOnce underwater,\nthe first thing Zhou Ze saw was a large iron cage leaning against the side of the hull, as if nailed in place.\nInside this cage was a large, fixed altar table. On the table were a statue and a memorial tablet, unmistakably belonging to that Lord Water God. Even the offerings on it were fixed in place, remaining motionless relative to the iron cage despite being underwater.\n\nAt the same time,\ninside the iron cage,\nmore than twenty people,\nmen and women, old and young,\nwere drifting about, tossed by the currents in the cage.\n\nSome were at the bottom,\nsome were in the middle.\n\nOne woman, about twenty years old, was in the most pitiful state.\nHer head was stuck in a gap at the very top of the cage, accidentally fixed in place.\nAnd her hair stretched out from there,\nabove it all,\nfloating…\nfloating…\n\n---\n> ¹ A story from the Chinese classic *Investiture of the Gods* where Nezha, a divine protector, kills the Dragon King's son.

    "content": "Zhou Ze was utterly shocked. This spectacle was just too grand.\n\nEven Taoist priests in TV shows setting up an altar for a ritual don't have this much pomp. A typical temple ritual with some fruit and a pig's head is already considered quite a good setup.\n\nBut here,\n\nit was a live human sacrifice!\n\nMore than twenty living people,\n\nthat entire family,\n\nhad been deliberately placed here as offerings, sacrificed to the Sea God!\n\nZhou Ze's experiences were unique—he'd even been to Hell. Across two lifetimes, he had seen his fair share of both humans and ghosts. Logically, there weren't many things that could truly shake his spirit anymore.\n\nBut the scene before him made Zhou Ze lose his composure in an instant.\n\nKeep in mind, among them were not only old women with completely white hair and wrinkled skin, but also very young children. These people all should have had their own lives, their own laughter and joy, but now they were all imprisoned here. They couldn't even drift freely like fish, but could only be slammed by the waves from one side of the cage to the other.\n\nEven after death, they were still being kept in a pen!\n\nThe person who arranged all this seemed afraid their meticulously prepared offerings might spill out, causing the great Sea God to not eat his fill, or to eat uncomfortably, or to not be satiated—they were just that considerate.\n\n\"Gulp...\"\n\nHis body was a bit weak right now, so he couldn't hold his breath for very long. Zhou Ze reached out and lifted Bai Yingying's wrist, which was wrapped around his waist, signaling her to take him up for air.\n\nHowever,\n\nBai Yingying was unresponsive, as if she hadn't felt a thing.\n\nZhou Ze pinched her hand.\n\nShe remained impassive, not moving a muscle.\n\nZhou Ze grabbed her arm.\n\nShe still acted as if she hadn't noticed a thing.\n\nZhou Ze turned his head and glared at her.\n\nOnly to find that Bai Yingying had her eyes shut!\n\n*I can't see.*\n\n*I can't see anything at all.*\n\nThe nail on Zhou Ze's right index finger grew out.\n\nBai Yingying's body suddenly trembled.\n\nShe immediately carried Zhou Ze upward.\n\n\"Hah... hah... hah...\"\n\nAfter getting some air, Zhou Ze felt much better. He didn't bother getting on her case about her little games just now and said directly:\n\n\"Let's go up.\"\n\n\"You got it, Boss!\"\n\nBai Yingying didn't mention what had just happened either. Then, like a miniature King Kong, she wrapped her right arm around Zhou Ze's waist, clamped him under her arm like a rag doll, and grabbed the ship's hull with her other hand, hoisting herself right up.\n\nClean and decisive, effortlessly graceful.\n\nZhou Ze sat down on a chair first, catching his breath while also waiting for some of the water to drip from his clothes. Otherwise, they'd be too heavy and a struggle to wear.\n\n\"Boss, what exactly was going on down there?\"\n\n\"You don't know?\"\n\n\"How could I possibly know?\"\n\n\"Weren't you the madam who was caught having an affair with a scholar and then drowned in a pig cage?\"\n\n\"Er...\"\n\n\"Someone is using live people as offerings to the Sea God,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"As offerings? To a god?\" Bai Yingying was astonished. Even as a *jiangshi*,¹ she felt this was too cruel and inhumane.\n\n\"So what's happening now? We're here, and below us is an iron cage full of corpses. What's this all for?\"\n\n\"I'm not sure either. And I have a feeling that this matter can't be unrelated to that old man or that woman. At the very least, that old man is definitely involved.\"\n\n*Why is the old man definitely involved? Could that vixen possibly be an exception?*\n\nBai Yingying thought to herself.\n\nJust then, the wind picked up, and it was strong. The originally calm sea surface was now churning with turbulent waves, causing the cruise ship to rock back and forth, as if it could capsize at any moment.\n\nZhou Ze remained seated in his chair. To be honest, he felt somewhat helpless right now. If he were a Judge of Hell, he might have had the standing to communicate with the other party as an equal. But in his current state, he was clearly not being taken seriously.\n\nOf course, the most important question at the moment was, is this Lord Sea God considered a good guy or a bad guy in the traditional sense?\n\nDid he accept the offerings and give the sacrificer a corresponding reward, or did the sacrificer's actions make him feel angered and desecrated, so he came specially to punish him?\n\n*At his level, traditional concepts of right and wrong, good and evil, could hardly constrain his actions, right?*\n\n\"CRASH...\"\n\nWaves crashed over them, one after another, and the rocking of the cruise ship grew more and more violent. Bai Yingying planted her feet firmly, placing a hand on Zhou Ze's shoulder to help stabilize him on the deck.\n\n\"Boss, this ship is going to capsize.\"\n\n\"I know.\"\n\nLeaning on Bai Yingying's arm, Zhou Ze managed to stand up. When his gaze fell forward, he saw what looked like land. No, to be precise, it was probably an island, and not a small one at that.\n\n\"SCREEECH\"\n\nA harsh, mechanical grinding sound rang out. The cruise ship finally gave way and flipped completely over. Quick-witted and sharp-eyed, Bai Yingying grabbed Zhou Ze and jumped into the sea just before it capsized.\n\nIn that sense, Zhou Ze was lucky. How many drowning people, in the moments before their death, wish they, too, had a Bai Yingying by their side?\n\nBai Yingying swam, keeping Zhou Ze's head above the water so he could breathe fresh air. Zhou Ze was like a baby joey in its mother's pouch, being exquisitely cared for.\n\nAll he could do was keep his head up, breathing while spitting out the seawater that splashed into his mouth and nose,\n\nwhile... staring at the sky.\n\nFinally, Bai Yingying made it ashore.\n\nZhou Ze lay on the beach, panting heavily.\n\n\"Boss, there's another person lying over there.\"\n\nBai Yingying suddenly pointed toward the beach.\n\nZhou Ze turned to look. Sure enough, a young man was lying there, dressed in tattered clothes. If Zhou Ze himself was a salted fish² before, then that guy was a salted fish about to be dried out completely.\n\n\"I'll go kill him.\"\n\nBai Yingying said, adhering to her policy of nipping any potential danger in the bud.\n\nZhou Ze reached out and held Bai Yingying back, shaking his head. At the same time, he said, \"Don't you feel like that guy looks a little familiar?\"\n\n\"Familiar?\" Bai Yingying stared hard. Finally, she seemed to recall something. \"He looks a lot like that old man. Is he the old man's son? Oh no, or maybe his grandson.\"\n\n\"Doesn't look like it, and it shouldn't be,\" Zhou Ze denied.\n\nAt that moment, a python crawled out of the sea.\n\nThis python also looked somewhat familiar to Zhou Ze, really a lot like the one he had fought so hard against before. It was just that this snake now looked a bit smaller, and the scales on its body weren't as thick as before.\n\nThe snake slowly slithered onto the young man's body. It had no murderous intent or vicious aura. Moreover, it seemed completely unaware that Zhou Ze and Bai Yingying were right beside it, its gaze fixed only on the person beneath it.\n\n\"Boss, this snake is about to become a spirit,\" Bai Yingying suddenly said.\n\n\"I can see that.\"\n\nThis python gave off a feeling of intelligence and human-like emotion, a bit like the monkey Zhou Ze had first met.\n\nThe python opened its mouth, not to bite the young man, but to bite its own torso. It gnawed a wound into its own body, then slithered over the young man, bringing the self-inflicted wound to his lips.\n\nAt first, the python's blood just dripped slowly into the man's mouth. Soon, the man seemed to regain some consciousness and began to actively suck the snake's blood. The color was slowly returning to his face.\n\nFinally, the man let go, heaved a long sigh, and opened his eyes. The first thing he saw was the python, and he trembled in fear.\n\nThe python didn't linger. It slithered directly from the beach back into the sea, leaving behind a pool of blood on the ground.\n\nAfter the python had entered the sea and disappeared into the distance, the man immediately scrambled up, kowtowed several times in the direction the python had gone while muttering something, and then reached down to pick up a snake scale left on the ground.\n\n\"What's he shouting?\" Bai Yingying asked. The man's dialect was a bit thick, and she couldn't hear him clearly.\n\n\"He's thanking the Sea God for saving him,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\nThe man walked into the island's forest and disappeared from sight.\n\n\"So here's the question, Boss. How do we leave?\"\n\nBai Yingying asked, tilting her head. Then, as if she'd thought of something, she asked:\n\n\"I think being Robinson Crusoe here would be pretty nice too.\"\n\nThere was a copy of *Robinson Crusoe* in the bookstore, which Bai Yingying had read in her spare time.\n\nZhou Ze felt that his maid had been acting a little strange lately, as if she'd watched too many K-dramas and it had addled her brain.\n\nJust then, the cruise ship that had just capsized reappeared on the sea.\n\n\"Wow, Boss, the ship is back.\"\n\n\"I can see it.\"\n\nThe cruise ship had returned. This time, however, there were people on it, a lot of people.\n\nAn old man sat in a wheelchair, being pushed off the ship by an attendant. The attendant was a woman with her face veiled in white gauze, but from her figure and bearing, she also looked a bit familiar.\n\n\"Her chest has sagged a bit, her butt has gotten a bit fatter, and her waist is a bit thicker. Boss, if you reverse that and subtract a little, doesn't she look like a certain someone?\"\n\nIt was that woman, the old man's wife.\n\nMany people disembarked from the ship. The old man sat in his wheelchair, an IV drip still attached to him. Clearly, his time was short.\n\nAt that moment, Zhou Ze's gaze suddenly froze. He saw a priest disembark from the cruise ship, an Asian priest.\n\nYes, that's right.\n\nIt was this bastard who stole his ashes!\n\nExcept, this priest looked a bit younger now. His skin was fairer, with a round face and a harmless, innocent appearance.\n\nHe walked to the old man's side. The old man waved the woman away. The woman walked off to a great distance. Some things were not for her to hear, and she was self-aware and tactful enough to know it.\n\nThe old man seemed to be saying something to the priest, who nodded in agreement.\n\nThen,\n\nthe old man took out a black scale from inside his clothes.\n\nThe priest looked at the scale, then leaned down and whispered something in the old man's ear.\n\nUpon hearing his words, the old man's face first showed shock, then struggle. He seemed to be hesitating, conflicted. Finally, the old man looked at the IV drip still attached to him, then at the charming woman standing in the distance.\n\nHis fingers tightened their grip on the scale, veins bulging.\n\nThen he gritted his teeth, a vicious look on his face,\n\nand at the same time, nodded.\n\nThe priest gave a slight bow at his side.\n\n\"Boss, they're talking too quietly, I can't hear them.\"\n\nBai Yingying said, a little frustrated. She tried to walk forward to get closer to the old man and the priest, but however far she walked, the distance between her and the two men would lengthen by a corresponding amount.\n\nZhou Ze waved his hand.\n\n\"There's no need to listen.\"\n\n\"Then how do we get out of here?\" Bai Yingying asked, a little uneasy.\n\n\"We can leave,\" Zhou Ze smiled. \"In reality, there is no Sea God at all.\"\n\nBai Yingying didn't understand, but Zhou Ze did. Yes, there was no Sea God.\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\n\"There is no Sea God, only a snake that was mistaken for one.\"\n\nZhou Ze lifted his head, looked up at the sky, and shouted:\n\n\"You can't beat me. You're seriously injured because of me. This illusion can't be maintained for much longer, can it?\n\n\"Especially now that I know you aren't actually a Sea God, your illusion has lost ninety-nine percent of its deterrent effect. You think you still have a chance to kill me in here?\"\n\n\"Ssss...\"\n\nA snake's head slowly emerged from the sand beside Zhou Ze.\n\nAll the illusions in the surroundings began to shatter.\n\nZhou Ze was now sitting on the living room floor, with Bai Yingying standing beside him. Everything around them had returned to normal.\n\n\"I wasn't trying to kill you with this...\"\n\nThe python, covered in wounds from Zhou Ze's nails, actually spoke in a human voice, though it was somewhat shrill.\n\n\"Tsk, tsk.\" Zhou Ze reached out and patted the snake's head. Then he tilted his head back and said with a hint of resignation, \"You actually wanted to kill me directly at first. You didn't expect me to mess you up this badly, so you changed your approach and went for a roundabout tactic.\"\n\nWhen the hard approach didn't work, it switched to a soft one.\n\n\"He must die...\" the python said.\n\n\"I have a monkey at home. You two should have a lot to talk about. But in your current state, it's clear you won't live much longer before you turn to ash. What a shame.\"\n\n\"He must die...\" The python seemed to only know how to say this one phrase.\n\nZhou Ze was indeed reminded of the monkey, of the process of fighting it in the hospital back then, and of the final outcome, including how his conscience was \"eaten\" because of it.\n\nIt was the same choice, but this time, Zhou Ze's choice was different. He raised his hand and said very seriously:\n\n\"That woman, she doesn't deserve to die.\"\n\nThe python hesitated for a moment, then gave a slight nod, which counted as an agreement.\n\nThen, Zhou Ze lowered his hand and looked away.\n\nThe python nodded at Zhou Ze, rubbed its forked tongue against his arm, and then dragged its mangled body toward the stairs.\n\nBai Yingying couldn't quite understand. She looked at Zhou Ze and asked, \"Boss, didn't that snake save him? If it saved him back then, why does it want to kill him now?\"\n\n\"It's simple. Sixty years ago, this python had just gained sentience and was in the process of cultivating and accumulating good karma. So it took the initiative to save the young man who had washed up on the beach and was on the verge of death after a shipwreck.\n\n\"The young man survived, then prospered. He made a lot, a lot of money, became very rich and influential. Then the young man became an old man, riddled with illness and close to death.\n\n\"The old man didn't want to die. He still had a lot of money, and he wanted to continue enjoying his life.\n\n\"For other people, extending one's life beyond medical means is basically impossible. But the old man was different. He had seen the 'Sea God' in his youth. He considered the snake that saved him to be the Sea God.\n\n\"So, the old man planned to use this to extend his life. He felt that if the Sea God saved him once sixty years ago, then the Sea God should be able to save him again sixty years later.\n\n\"He even found a wandering sorcerer...\"\n\nWhen he mentioned the Japanese priest, a thick murderous intent flashed in Zhou Ze's eyes.\n\nThat bastard. This time, as soon as his injuries recovered, he had to kill him. No matter what else was going on, he had to kill him!\n\n\"That priest gave him a method for sacrificing to an evil god: using the lives of his own relatives to extend his.\"\n\n\"Ah...\" Bai Yingying gasped. \"So the family on the cruise ship that drowned five years ago?\"\n\n\"Didn't you see it all? They were deliberately arranged by the old man as a sacrifice. He used his first wife, his son and daughter, his grandsons and granddaughters, great-grandchildren, and so on, all of them as sacrifices to extend his own life.\"\n\n\"And then what?\"\n\n\"He succeeded. Because he had that scale, and the method the priest gave him wasn't just baseless nonsense. So, he succeeded.\n\n\"Didn't you see? Five years ago, the old man was in a wheelchair and could have kicked the bucket at any moment. But five years later, he could walk on his own and even have a marital life with his young wife from time to time.\n\n\"He succeeded. He really succeeded.\"\n\n\"So that means this python made a deal with that old man?\" Bai Yingying asked. \"Then why does the python want to kill him five years later?\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head.\n\n\"There was no deal. The python was screwed over, screwed over badly by that old man. It had been cultivating for a certain number of years, following a very righteous path. But because of the sacrifice the old man conducted using its scale, it was passively forced into the ranks of evil gods rejected by heaven and earth. A hundred years of effort basically went up in smoke.\n\n\"It was like a tainted blessing;³ the python was taken down in its confusion.\n\n\"That python probably ran into some kind of problem back then and spent five years just to partially resolve it. Then, at all costs, risking its own life and the destruction of its cultivation, it had to come to land to seek revenge on this old man!\n\n\"It saved him back then, but in the end, he was the one who ruined it.\"\n\nBai Yingying nodded thoughtfully. \"So, there's no Sea God at all?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\"\n\n\"So, Boss, you let it go up there for revenge this time?\" Bai Yingying asked.\n\nThe subtext was, *that's not what you did with the monkey last time.*\n\n\"I'm seriously injured. I can't beat it anymore. I don't want to risk my own life,\" Zhou Ze explained.\n\nBai Yingying pouted and pointed at herself.\n\nThe meaning was clear: *A snake that you practically beat to a pulp? I can handle it.*\n\n\"You're a little girl who's afraid of even rats and cockroaches. How could you possibly stop it, right?\"\n\nHearing this, Bai Yingying got the hint.\n\nShe immediately clasped her hands over her chest and swayed, whining:\n\n\"Ying ying ying,⁴\n\nthat's right,\n\nI'm so, so scared.\"\n\n---\n**Footnotes:**\n\n1.  ***Jiangshi*** (殭屍): A type of reanimated corpse in Chinese folklore, sometimes translated as \"hopping vampire\" or \"zombie.\" They are typically stiff and move by hopping.\n2.  **Salted fish** (鹹魚): A popular Chinese internet slang for someone who is listless, lazy, or has given up on their ambitions, lying around like a dried fish.\n3.  **Tainted blessing**: The original term is 毒奶 (*dú nǎi*), literally \"poison milk.\" It's modern gamer slang for a jinx, where cheering for someone or predicting their success paradoxically causes them to fail, as if they were given a \"heal\" that was actually poison.

    "content": "The matter had drawn to a close. The great voyage before, including the island and all that, seemed like a Nanke dream.¹ In the end, it was over.\n\nTo be blunt, things like demons and ghosts could never be considered high-class, otherwise this world wouldn't have \"humans\" as its protagonists. But the deficiencies in human nature always gave them room to act; some people, even, just loved to court their own doom.\n\nZhou Ze wasn't sure whether he should adopt the worldview of a ghost or a human. In fact, he was often a bit fuzzy on his own identity, so most of the time, he just considered himself a spectator.\n\nWatching flowers bloom, watching them wither; watching people laugh, watching ghosts weep.\n\nOnce you've seen enough of anything, you just go numb.\n\nZhou Ze had Bai Yingying help him up to the second floor again. Nothing here had changed. Even when he walked into the room, Zhou Ze could still see that old man lying on the sofa, fast asleep.\n\nBai Yingying was a little confused. \"He's not dead?\" she asked.\n\nZhou Ze was the one who put that python up there, after all. Had it failed to kill the man?\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. The man was already dead. The black qi on the old man's forehead was impossible to hide. Even if he didn't die in an instant, he would die in an extremely painful way over the next few days, suffering to the very end.\n\nThe woman was lying on the floor, her skirt hiked up, revealing a lot underneath.\n\nZhou Ze stared for a moment.\n\nBai Yingying pouted beside him.\n\nAfter a short while, Zhou Ze walked over and straightened the woman's clothes. They were both sound asleep. To them, much of what had just happened was also like a dream, but both of their fates had already been altered several times over.\n\nZhou Ze walked around the house a couple more times. Behind a wall, he found half of a snake's body. It was a small, green snake, already turned into jerky.\n\nAnd there was something off about the door to the house; it was carved with many strange patterns. Zhou Ze had Bai Yingying help him make a rubbing of all the patterns.\n\nThen, without waking the woman to ask about the final payment, Zhou Ze and Bai Yingying left directly.\n\nAfter returning to the bookstore, about a week passed. Xu Qinglang had also emerged from the terrifying atmosphere of that night and had begun taking charge of everyone's three meals a day at the shop.\n\nCoupled with the fact that one or two ghosts would come to the bookstore each night with business, Boss Zhou's days were quite full. Most importantly, his body had mostly recovered.\n\nIt was time to put some matters that should have been resolved on the agenda. For instance, that priest who had been causing trouble for the last five years—it was time for him to go to hell.\n\n\"Get in touch with Lin Ke. Tell her to meet at the bookstore tomorrow at noon,\" Zhou Ze said to Bai Yingying, who was pouring him tea.\n\n\"Okay.\" Bai Yingying immediately took out her phone to send a message. \"Boss, are we going after that priest now?\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded. Although the main reason for the death of the old man's family was the old man's own \"ghost-obsessed\" grand selfishness, that priest had also played a significant role in pushing things along.\n\nPlus, the man had stolen his ashes. This score definitely had to be settled.\n\n\"Boss, I think you've forgotten something very important,\" Bai Yingying reminded him.\n\n\"What's that?\"\n\n\"The final payment! There's still eight million of the final payment left.\"\n\n\"Heh.\"\n\nZhou Ze let out a laugh.\n\n\"Boss, you can't be like this. You let her off the hook just because she's pretty? You can't eat good looks.\"\n\n\"The one-million-yuan deposit should last us a long time. Didn't I already give you back the money you lent me? Go buy back those two burial items of yours.\"\n\n\"No, Boss, that's no way to run a life! You don't run the household, so you don't know how expensive things are. You just casually dismiss eight million yuan. How are we supposed to get by in the future? That's eight million, not eight hundred yuan!\"\n\nBai Yingying's tone was that of someone who has concluded that men are truly unreliable.\n\n\"Boss, there's news in the paper,\" said the old Daoist, walking over with a newspaper after just finishing mopping the floor.\n\nThe old man had died. It was in the paper. Many people went to offer their condolences. The cause of death was listed as a serious illness that he couldn't overcome.\n\nThe old man had been a respectable figure in life.\n\nHis funeral was a grand affair. In truth, that's just how the world is. Many people may appear magnificent on the public stage, but who knows about their hidden depravity? A different persona in public and in private—the public had long grown numb to such reversals.\n\n\"Ah!\"\n\nBai Yingying suddenly cried out.\n\n\"What is it?\" Zhou Ze was holding his tea, and her shout made him spill it.\n\n\"Look here, Boss,\" Bai Yingying said, pointing to another section of the paper.\n\nZhou Ze looked over. The headline read:\n\n\"Tycoon's Widow Donates Entire Fortune.\"\n\nIt was that woman. She had donated every bit of the property she was to inherit.\n\n\"Why would she do that?\" Bai Yingying found it hard to understand.\n\nThen, Bai Yingying looked at the perfectly calm Zhou Ze and asked, \"Boss, you already knew?\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head.\n\n\"Eight million yuan! Your eight million yuan was donated to Project Hope,² too.\"\n\n\"If it's donated, it's donated.\"\n\n\"Boss, what do you mean, 'if it's donated, it's donated'? This is money being donated, not eight million drops of sperm! Besides, Boss, I'm poor too. I want to buy more burial items. Why don't you donate some to me?\"\n\nBai Yingying sidled up to him, trying to be cute.\n\n\"What eight million?\" Xu Qinglang asked, walking over with a cup of coffee.\n\n\"It's that rich female client I told you about. We were supposed to get an eight-million-yuan final payment for solving her problem, but her husband died, and she donated the entire inheritance,\" Bai Yingying explained to Xu Qinglang.\n\n\"Is it that dramatic?\" Xu Qinglang was also taken aback. The donated sum must have been in the hundreds of millions.\n\n\"Well, look who's here,\" the old Daoist said, pointing at the doorway.\n\nStanding in the doorway was a woman dressed in a black formal dress, her face covered by a black veil.\n\nIt was an outfit many men would recognize—the attire of a widow.\n\nThe woman walked in, nodded slightly at Zhou Ze, and said, \"I'm moving back to my hometown to live. About your final payment, I'm sorry.\"\n\n\"Hey, what do you mean, 'you're sorry'? Do you know how poor my boss is? He can't even pay salaries, and you swindled him out of eight million!\" the old Daoist blustered.\n\n\"Old Daoist, the floor is dirty.\"\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\nThen, the old Daoist saw Zhou Ze make a gesture as if to pour his tea onto the floor, and he wisely shut his mouth.\n\n\"I truly am sorry. But you won't mind, will you?\" the woman said, looking at Zhou Ze.\n\n\"I don't mind. I just hope that when I'm well-off enough to have a barbecue on a cruise ship in the future, the seas will be calm.\"\n\n\"You're joking.\"\n\nThe woman turned, pushed open the door, and walked out. It seemed she had come specifically just to say those words.\n\nAt this moment, Xu Qinglang finally snapped out of it. It was her, it was really her. Although she wore a black veil, her voice and figure were exactly the same as that woman's!\n\nXu Qinglang immediately prepared to run after her, but his hand was gripped tightly by Zhou Ze.\n\n\"What are you doing!\" Xu Qinglang yelled at Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Whatever relationship you have with her, it's best you don't go.\"\n\n\"Impossible. There are some things I have to ask her about!\" Xu Qinglang insisted.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head with a sense of resignation and stood up. \"Fine, I'll go with you.\"\n\nWith that, Zhou Ze and Xu Qinglang walked out of the bookstore together. The woman was still walking up ahead. Xu Qinglang quickly caught up and grabbed the woman's shoulders with both hands.\n\nThe woman's body trembled. \"Little Quail, what is the meaning of this?\" she asked.\n\nXu Qinglang's Adam's apple bobbed a few times, but he didn't know what to say. Should he talk about how he had fled in terror?\n\n\"Your hand.\"\n\nThis was, after all, a woman he'd had a relationship with. A fleeting affair, perhaps, but a connection of exchanged bodily fluids nonetheless.\n\nXu Qinglang reached out and grabbed the woman's wrist. It was covered in scars. \"This is an ointment I brought specially from my hometown. It can remove scars.\"\n\nThe woman looked at Xu Qinglang with a faint smile, then glanced at Zhou Ze standing beside him. In the end, her gaze fell back on Zhou Ze.\n\n\"I didn't know there was a connection between you and him,\" Zhou Ze explained.\n\nThe woman nodded, indicating she believed him.\n\nThen, she took the initiative to hug Xu Qinglang tightly.\n\nXu Qinglang froze.\n\nShe was dressed as a widow, and Zhou Ze was right there. Xu Qinglang was instantly at a loss for what to do.\n\nAnd then,\n\na retching sound ended the awkwardness.\n\n\"Retch...\"\n\nThe woman threw up.\n\nShe threw up blood.\n\nIt splattered all over Xu Qinglang.\n\nThen she collapsed weakly.\n\n\"What's happening! What's happening!\"\n\nXu Qinglang roared, looking at his blood-covered hands.\n\nThe woman had already fallen to the ground, unconscious.\n\n\"She took poison,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Then save her! You have to save her! Why are you just standing there? What are you doing!\"\n\nXu Qinglang grabbed Zhou Ze's arm with one hand, shaking it.\n\n\"She can't be saved,\" Zhou Ze said calmly.\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"She wanted to die herself.\"\n\n\"How could she possibly want to die herself?\" Xu Qinglang asked, bewildered.\n\n\"She had to die.\"\n\nZhou Ze lit a cigarette. \"You should call 120.³ She took the poison herself, so it has nothing to do with you. Or, you could burn some paper money. Anyway, after you've dealt with her, come back.\"\n\nTurning, Zhou Ze walked back into the bookstore.\n\nSeeing Zhou Ze return alone, Bai Yingying immediately asked, \"Boss, where's Pretty Boy Xu?\"\n\n\"He has something to take care of.\"\n\n\"With that woman?\" A look of realization dawned on Bai Yingying's face. \"It must be that the woman was overcome by lust, ditched you, and set her sights on Pretty Boy Xu, right?\"\n\n\"She's dead.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Dead.\"\n\n\"How could she be dead?\"\n\n\"Suicide.\"\n\n\"How could she commit suicide?\"\n\nIn Bai Yingying's eyes, that woman was mercenary, materialistic, and pleasure-loving. How could a person like that possibly commit suicide?\n\n\"Why did Daji die?\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\nBai Yingying didn't understand why the boss was suddenly asking her this.\n\n\"You know the story of *Investiture of the Gods*,⁴ right?\"\n\n\"I know it,\" Bai Yingying replied.\n\n\"Then, why did she die in the end?\"\n\n\"Because she was a bad woman. She harmed loyal court officials. She deserved to die.\"\n\n\"Mmm. In the beginning, it was actually because King Zhou was disrespectful in Nüwa's temple. Nüwa was furious, so she sent down three fox spirits, including Daji, to bewitch King Zhou and accelerate the end of the Shang dynasty's fortune.\n\n\"In the end, Daji succeeded. The Shang dynasty fell. Daji originally thought she could go back and report that her mission was complete, because she had indeed completed it.\n\n\"Jiang Ziya pursued her to kill her. She ran to Nüwa, and Nüwa said:\n\n\"'You deserve to die.\n\n\"'I told you to go bewitch King Zhou to end the Shang dynasty's fortune sooner, but I didn't tell you to harm the loyal and prey on the common people.'\n\n\"And then,\n\n\"Nüwa killed Daji.\"\n\n\"This... Boss, you mean...\"\n\n\"The design of the house, the snake jerky hidden inside for years, and the fact that in the end, the old man was living in the house with only her.\"\n\n\"So that's how it is...\" Bai Yingying said, lost in thought.\n\n\"So, she had to die.\"\n***\n**Footnotes:**\n\n1.  **Nanke dream:** A famous Chinese parable about the vanity of human ambition and the illusory nature of glory.\n2.  **Project Hope (希望工程):** A real-life Chinese public service project aimed at financing education for children in impoverished rural areas.\n3.  **120:** The emergency medical services number in China, equivalent to 911 in the US or 999 in the UK.\n4.  ***Investiture of the Gods* (《封神榜》):** A 16th-century Chinese novel and one of the major works of Chinese mythology, detailing the fall of the Shang dynasty and the rise of the Zhou dynasty, intertwining historical and mythological figures.",

    "content": "Zhou Ze closed his eyes. He wasn't sleepy, but he liked the feeling of lying on the sofa by the glass window, letting the sunlight bathe his body.\n\nIn his past life, he was always working, constantly operating at the surgical table, with hardly a moment's rest. In this life, he could finally make up for it.\n\nAfter hearing Zhou Ze’s explanation, Bai Yingying seemed to understand, yet also not understand. But at least one thing was certain: Zhou Ze had foreseen this outcome long ago.\n\nThat was why the Boss hadn't been bothered about the remaining eight million of the final payment. No, it was probably because the Boss knew the woman wouldn't come to a good end, so he couldn't be bothered to chase her for it; he wouldn't get it even if he tried.\n\nBai Yingying ran a hand through her hair, then stomped her way over to the bar.\n\nThe Old Daoist was eating peanuts with the monkey, one for himself, one for the monkey. The man and the primate were both eating with great relish. He had been listening nearby when Zhou Ze was explaining things to Bai Yingying, and after hearing it all, he had simply smiled and walked away.\n\n\"Old Daoist, let me ask you something. Did you understand what the Boss was just talking about?\" Bai Yingying gave the Old Daoist's shoulder a nudge.\n\n\"Huh?\" The Old Daoist turned his head, looking at Bai Yingying with some surprise. Then he said, \"Didn't the Boss just explain it to you?\"\n\n\"I didn't fully get it.\" Bai Yingying took a deep breath and let it out heavily.\n\nAlthough the Old Daoist looked very old, he wasn't even half her age. Bai Yingying felt that he had a clearer perspective on some things than she did.\n\nThis was only natural, of course. Although Bai Yingying was two hundred years old, she had spent most of that time lying in a coffin, talking only with the ghost of Lady Bai. So, in essence, she still retained the innocence of a sixteen or seventeen-year-old girl.\n\n\"Actually, it’s quite simple. It’s like why Nuwa had to kill Daji. A saint, you see, must be radiant and holy. How could they have any blemishes?\n\n\"So, regardless of whether Daji completed her mission or not, she was destined to die. To bring about the downfall of the Shang dynasty, how could it be done without persecuting loyal officials and preying on the common people?\n\n\"You have to remember, in the *Investiture of the Gods*, even though King Zhou was a tyrant, quite a few deities and factions helped him. Jiang Ziya’s campaign wasn't exactly smooth sailing. Therefore, Daji was definitely the best kind of teammate.\n\n\"But, in reality, from the moment Daji was sent, she was already on death row.\n\n\"How many rulers in ancient times treated the blades in their hands the same way? When the rulers needed them, these blades would go and eliminate the people they didn't want to see. Once the task was done, it was a case of 'boiling the hunting dog after the cunning rabbit is dead.'¹\n\n\"Break the blade and show it to the world.\n\n\"Look,\n\n\"The evildoer has been executed by the great me. I am still just as pure and untainted.\"\n\n\"Then this woman?\"\n\n\"Didn't the Boss say he found some kind of formation and that dried half-serpent in the house?\n\n\"That was placed there by the woman, of course. The old man was so rich, why did he end up moving into his ancestral home? And whose hands designed and arranged the house?\n\n\"It's obvious the old man was set up. Although he brought it on himself and deserves no sympathy, looking at it objectively, someone led him into a trap step by step.\n\n\"Even if nothing had happened to that serpent in the sea, it would have been difficult for it to come ashore for revenge, let alone the fact that something *had* happened to it. So, someone must have been pulling the strings, that's for sure. And who was the most suitable person to pull the strings? Only that woman.\"\n\n\"She was the serpent's accomplice?\" Bai Yingying shook her head after saying it. \"No, that's not right. The Boss had an agreement with the serpent not to kill that woman. The serpent agreed to it at the time.\"\n\nThe Old Daoist glanced at Zhou Ze, who was still \"feigning sleep\" over there, and said, \"It's not about some serpent. This whole affair is very simple. Lord Sea God was displeased with that old man. Who knows if it was because the old man did something wicked when he was making his fortune in his early years, or perhaps he committed many dirty deeds in the name of the Sea God. Wasn't that old man involved in smuggling by sea?\n\n\"So, that woman was like the Daji sent by the Sea God. In fact, this humble Daoist even thinks that the reason the old man was selfish to a degree beyond human comprehension, to the point where he could grit his teeth and sacrifice his entire family, might very well have been due to that woman's bewitchment.\n\n\"Or, let's consider another possibility. Lord Sea God was displeased with that serpent, thinking that if the serpent became a spirit, it might affect him. So he set up a scheme to screw over the serpent as well. In the end, the serpent came ashore for revenge, even at the cost of its own complete annihilation. Lord Sea God was happy to see that happen.\n\n\"In short, no matter what, that woman had to die. With her dead, Lord Sea God is still Lord Sea God, continuing to maintain his greatness and sanctity.\"\n\n\"Then, that woman is really pitiful,\" Bai Yingying sighed.\n\n\"There's nothing pitiful about it. This is fate. It can't be changed. Look, even the Boss has accepted it.\"\n\nAt that moment, Zhou Ze stood up. He glanced at the Old Daoist and Bai Yingying, who were muttering to each other, and walked upstairs.\n\nPushing open the bedroom door, Zhou Ze walked to the window, lit a cigarette, and looked at a scroll on the windowsill. The day after the incident, Zhou Ze had asked the Old Daoist to go and buy it.\n\nThe Old Daoist had gone to great lengths to find an identical portrait of the Sea God. After all, very, very few households had his picture hanging on their walls.\n\nZhou Ze reached out and unrolled the scroll.\n\nHe stared at the portrait for a long time.\n\nFinally,\n\nHe took out a lighter, lit a corner of the paper, and placed it on the security bars of the window, watching it slowly burn to ash.\n\n\"What are you being sentimental about?\"\n\nThe little loli's voice came from behind Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Don't you know to knock before you enter?\" Zhou Ze said, a little displeased.\n\n*Biu!*\n\nThe little loli's figure appeared outside the door. Then she knocked.\n\n\"Knock, knock, knock...\"\n\n\"Come in.\"\n\n*Biu!*\n\nThe little loli's figure appeared inside the room again.\n\n\"Whose portrait did you burn?\" the little loli asked.\n\n\"None of your business.\"\n\n\"Fine, I won't bother. I came because I received a message from that stupid zombie.\"\n\n\"I said tomorrow.\"\n\n\"But he's going to Shanghai tonight, and then he has a ten o'clock flight back to Japan,\" the little loli reminded him.\n\n\"Why didn't you notify me about this before?\"\n\n\"I only just found his ticket information.\" The little loli had an expression that said, *I was already very fast*.\n\n\"So where is he now?\"\n\n\"One of three safe houses, probably. He used to rotate between them day by day, but today, I'm not sure if he'll stick to the pattern.\n\n\"However, I think there's a greater possibility he's at one particular location.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because when I was tailing him, I sensed another kind of incredible aura from the house at that location. It was very faint and not worth mentioning, but it was unique compared to the other two places.\n\n\"Since he's preparing to go back to Japan, I imagine he wants to take some things back with him. For example, his most successful research subject?\"\n\nAfter speaking, the little loli took two steps back and said to Zhou Ze:\n\n\"Anyway, you decide.\"\n\n\"Get Yingying. You and I will go to that place.\"\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\nZhou Ze changed into a black hoodie and walked down the stairs, calling out to Bai Yingying at the same time. Bai Yingying immediately followed him and got into the car without even asking what they were doing.\n\nAfter getting into the car, Bai Yingying found the little loli sitting next to her. This time, the little loli had clearly come only in her spirit form, without her physical body.\n\n\"Stupid zombie, one day you'll be sold and you won't even know it,\" the little loli mocked.\n\n\"You're jealous of me.\"\n\n\"Who would be stupid enough to be jealous of you?\"\n\n\"You're just jealous of me.\"\n\n\"I am not jealous of you!\"\n\n\"You're still jealous of me.\"\n\nThe little loli fell silent. She felt that continuing to argue about this topic was utterly foolish.\n\nZhou Ze took out his phone and said to the little loli, \"Give me the address.\"\n\nThe little loli recited the address. After Zhou Ze successfully set the location, he started the car. Not long after he drove off, a call came in.\n\nZhou Ze was about to hang up, but seeing it was Xu Qinglang, he answered.\n\n\"Hello, how are things on your end?\"\n\n\"The old man's family... how many people were there in total?\"\n\n\"Why are you asking that?\"\n\n\"Just answer me.\"\n\nZhou Ze closed his eyes, thought back for a moment, and said, \"Including the old man, twenty-four.\"\n\n...\n\nMeanwhile, in the emergency room of the Affiliated Hospital, Xu Qinglang sat alone on a bench in the corridor. He hung his head, staring at the floor tiles.\n\nFinally, a doctor came out, and a police officer walked over as well.\n\nPerhaps because he had burned the paper money, saving a lot of trouble and hassle, neither the doctor nor the officer came to question Xu Qinglang about the woman's death. Of course, Xu Qinglang wasn't a suspect in this matter anyway, because the woman had posted a suicide note and selfie on her social media before taking her life.\n\nThe suicide was an open-and-shut case.\n\nWatching the nurses push out a gurney covered with a white sheet, Xu Qinglang stood up, walked over to it, and said:\n\n\"I want to see her one more time.\"\n\nThe two nurses exchanged a look, mistakenly assuming Xu Qinglang and the woman who had poisoned herself were a couple. After a moment's hesitation, they nodded.\n\nXu Qinglang lifted the sheet and looked at the woman's plain face. She was still so beautiful.\n\nXu Qinglang had known her passion and romance in bed,\n\nBut now, she was cold.\n\nHe couldn't say he was heartbroken, nor could he say he was terribly sad. There was just a bit of disappointment and melancholy.\n\nXu Qinglang grabbed the woman's wrist and looked at the scars there. He traced his finger over them lightly, counting them one by one. These scars must have been made one by one, starting from about two months ago.\n\nIt seemed she had been preparing all along, conducting a final countdown.\n\nXu Qinglang looked up, walked to the hallway window, and pushed it open, letting the wind blow in.\n\nHe felt he shouldn't be sad, nor was the woman lying there worthy of his pity. But humans are just sentimental creatures like that.\n\nWhat she had done, what she had done to others, who she was, and so on...\n\nBut she had slept with me, so there was an instinctual sense of fondness and intimacy.\n\nHe let out a long breath.\n\nXu Qinglang subconsciously reached for a cigarette, then remembered he was in a hospital and put it back.\n\nHe had just counted.\n\nOn the woman's wrist,\n\nthere were,\n\ntwenty-four scars.\n\n---\n¹An ancient Chinese idiom (狡兔死，走狗烹) meaning to get rid of a subordinate once they have outlived their usefulness.",

    "content": "The great have their grand schemes, and the insignificant have their own small goals. Oftentimes, the two are not in conflict.\n\nAs for the matter of the wealthy old man, just how much of a role that Sea God played, Zhou Ze had no way of knowing. Perhaps, someday in the future, when Boss Zhou had earned enough money and felt he could enjoy the feeling of buying a yacht and drifting on the sea, he might find an answer.\n\nFor now, what he needed to do was strangle that Japanese priest—the one who'd been stirring up trouble from start to finish with a bizarrely high amount of screen time—and after sending him to the crematorium for incineration, use his ashes to mix into a curry chicken leg rice.\n\nFollowing the GPS, Zhou Ze drove to the entrance of an old residential complex. It was likely built long ago with pooled funds from some government work unit and was on the verge of demolition. Most of the residents had already moved out, leaving it looking dilapidated and cluttered, though a few scattered units were still occupied.\n\nSummer had already arrived in Tongcheng, but upon walking in here, you could feel a distinct chill. This wasn't the influence of any ghosts, just the peculiar psychological suggestion that comes from a sparsely populated place.\n\n\"The room at the far left on the third floor. A young man who works in Tongcheng is renting it,\" the Little Loli explained.\n\nZhou Ze nodded and went straight up without hesitation. It would be far too foolish for the three of them to just wait stupidly downstairs, even if they weren't sure the priest was inside.\n\nArriving on the third floor, he found the door locked. Zhou Ze opened it with his fingernail. Pushing the door open, he found the inside to be spotless—so clean it felt unsettling.\n\nA place where someone lived couldn't possibly be this clean. Not even a single speck of dust could be found in any corner; the most meticulous cleaning service would struggle to achieve this.\n\nThe walls,\n\nthe floor tiles,\n\nthe windowsill,\n\neven the toilet—all gleamed with a strange luster.\n\nSeeing the state of the room, Bai Yingying suddenly grew worried. She knew her boss was a stickler for cleanliness, so she feared he would be so impressed by the tidiness here that he'd start demanding she and the old Taoist keep the bookstore this clean.\n\nIf that happened, besides sleeping with the boss, all she'd be able to do is clean nonstop. She wouldn't even have time for \"eating chicken\" anymore. ¹\n\nThere was no one in the room. The small one-bedroom apartment couldn't hide anyone anyway.\n\nZhou Ze crouched down and scraped the floor tile with his fingernail. Looking at the nail, he saw some kind of crystalline substance caught in the crack.\n\nYes,\n\nthat was the reason the room was so clean. It wasn't that it had been cleaned well, but that a layer of a waxy, oil-like substance was coating everything, creating the deceptive visual impression that \"this place is very clean.\"\n\nEven the bedding on the bed was coated with the stuff.\n\n\"He's not here,\" the Little Loli said.\n\n\"I'm not blind,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\n\"So, on to the next location?\"\n\nThe Little Loli shrugged. Finding the Japanese priest was the first task Zhou Ze had given her. She had spent a great deal of time and effort monitoring and tailing him. If she failed to catch him now, all her previous hard work would be for naught.\n\nTo put in so much effort only to fall short at the last hurdle... it couldn't compare to the affection this dumb zombie gained just by foolishly whimpering \"ying ying ying\" next to the boss.\n\n*Pa.*\n\nThe Little Loli slapped herself.\n\n*What the hell am I thinking?*\n\n\"What are you doing?\" Bai Yingying asked, looking at her.\n\n\"Swatting a mosquito.\"\n\nBai Yingying shook her head.\n\n*Did you forget you're just a soul today? Swatting a mosquito?*\n\n\"The person should be back soon,\" Zhou Ze said, pointing toward the stove area.\n\nIt wasn't so much a stove as an induction cooker on a small table, with some seasonings, scallions, ginger, and garlic next to it.\n\nZhou Ze had noticed that this was the only area in the room not coated with the wax, meaning it had just been used. There were even chopped ingredients on the cutting board.\n\nPerhaps the person was chopping ingredients for a meal when they realized they'd forgotten to buy the main course.\n\nOkay, that explanation was a bit dumb, but at the moment, it seemed like a real possibility.\n\n\"Let's wait outside.\"\n\nZhou Ze closed the door and stood by the stairwell.\n\nThe Little Loli's soul slowly floated up and sat on the railing, her little legs swinging back and forth, the very picture of innocence and charm.\n\nBai Yingying pouted. For some reason, she was convinced this little loli would eventually become her rival for the boss's affection. Perhaps it was just a woman's intuition.\n\nSo, not to be outdone, Bai Yingying leaned on the railing with both hands, as if gazing at the distant scenery, but in a way that highlighted her posterior curves to the fullest, a posture that practically screamed, *my humble gate opens for you today*.\n\nZhou Ze stood for a moment, then sat on a nearby step with his back to the two competing women and lit a cigarette.\n\nActually,\n\nsometimes when he thought about it,\n\nBoss Zhou hadn't done too poorly in his past life, yet at thirty, he was still a bachelor who had never even been in a relationship. There were reasons for this.\n\nBack then, even if Dr. Lin wasn't as refined or well-developed as she was now, she was definitely not bad, and she had a fangirl-like admiration for him. The result? He hadn't even bothered to remember her name, treating her purely as a \"medical dog\" ² assigned to him for an internship.\n\nIf a guy like that wasn't destined to be alone forever,\n\nwho was?\n\nThe two women, one large and one small, had been putting on a spirited show of vying for attention, but now it felt like performing for a blind man. With that, they both settled down.\n\nAfter finishing his cigarette, Zhou Ze thought of Old Xu. Since he was just waiting for someone anyway, Zhou Ze took the opportunity to give Old Xu a call.\n\nOld Xu was still very green when it came to matters of the heart, a total novice. So it was inevitable that he would get too invested. With that woman dead, he must be feeling pretty terrible.\n\nThe call went through. A listless \"Hello\" came from the other end.\n\n\"Are you okay?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"I'm fine.\"\n\n\"Try to look on the bright side.\"\n\n\"Mm.\"\n\n\"Some things, when you look back on them later, are just an experience in your life, a memory. You'll understand when you're older.\"\n\nThe other end of the line was silent for a long time.\n\nZhou Ze thought Xu Qinglang was getting sentimental, touched by his words of comfort. But after a moment, Xu Qinglang's voice picked up slightly as he responded:\n\n\"Are you speaking from experience?\"\n\nIt was a rhetorical question.\n\n*We're both novices. At least I've lost my virginity, and you're still a virgin. You're comforting me?*\n\n\"I'm married,\" Zhou Ze reminded him.\n\nXu Qinglang fell silent again. He suddenly felt that Zhou Ze was truly the most shameless person he had ever met in his life.\n\n\"And I'm about to get divorced,\" Zhou Ze added.\n\nAt this point, the theme from *A Spray of Plum Blossoms* ³ should have started playing to accentuate Boss Zhou's melancholy and storied past.\n\nXu Qinglang remained silent. The level of shamelessness had just been raised by another order of magnitude.\n\n*Forcibly adding drama, a backstory, and a world-weary vibe to himself?*\n\nFor a moment, Old Xu didn't even know how to retort.\n\n\"Anyway, just try to look on the bright side.\"\n\nWith that, Zhou Ze hung up. He felt that if the call continued, an indignant Old Xu would start to fight back.\n\n*Yes, this kind of feigned comfort, which is actually rubbing salt in the wound, is what true friendship is all about!*\n\n\"Someone's coming.\"\n\nBai Yingying spoke up.\n\nBecause so few people lived in this building, very few people passed by the front. A man in a white short-sleeved shirt carrying a plastic bag was now walking this way, so there was a high probability he was the one they were looking for.\n\nZhou Ze turned to the side and looked down.\n\nSure enough, the young man was carrying the plastic bag and starting up the stairs of this building.\n\nThere was nothing unusual about the man. He had a fair face and delicate skin, giving off the impression of a weaker version of Xu Qinglang.\n\nZhou Ze felt that his aesthetic sense seemed to have a problem. Other men, when looking at women outside, would habitually compare them to their own wives.\n\nBut now, when he looked at men outside, he habitually compared any decent-looking pretty boys to Xu Qinglang.\n\nThe plastic bag in the man's hand was heavy. After he came up, he first saw Zhou Ze sitting on the steps, then he saw Bai Yingying standing by the railing.\n\nIn the end,\n\nhis gaze shifted to the Little Loli sitting on the railing, swinging her legs.\n\nAnd he lingered on the Little Loli for a few extra moments, a look of drooling desire on his face.\n\n\"That's him.\"\n\nThe Little Loli spoke.\n\nShe was here as a soul.\n\nAnyone who could see her definitely had a problem.\n\nBai Yingying took a step forward, attempting to grab the man's shoulder. The man jerked back a step and threw the plastic bag at her. Bai Yingying raised a hand to slap it away, and a dozen pig's trotters scattered and rolled across the ground.\n\n\"Crack…\"\n\nBai Yingying's fingers clamped down on the man's shoulder, but at that moment, instead of retreating, he advanced.\n\nWith a *whoosh*, Bai Yingying didn't move—she was much stronger than him—but his momentum and reaction caught her unprepared.\n\nThe fingers clamped on his shoulder instantly slipped off.\n\nSo slippery.\n\nNot just his skin,\n\neven his clothes were slippery!\n\nThe man flipped around, intending to jump over the staircase to escape. But Zhou Ze, who was sitting on the steps, reached out. His fingernails instantly grew long, piercing the man's calf.\n\n\"Ah!\"\n\nThe man let out a wretched scream and fell to the ground. Zhou Ze moved forward and clamped his fingers directly around the man's neck.\n\nThe man's body twitched uncontrollably, likely because the damage from Zhou Ze's fingernail was still escalating.\n\nThe Little Loli floated down gracefully and came to stand before the man.\n\nThe man's eyes rolled back. He looked at Zhou Ze, his gaze filled with fear and horror. He seemed to want to say something, but he couldn't even form words properly, only managing to let out a sound from his throat:\n\n\"Ah ah… ah ah… ah ah…\"\n\n\"Where is the Japanese priest?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Ah ah… ah ah… ah ah…\"\n\n\"Can you speak properly? If you can't, I'll have no choice but to finish you off.\"\n\n\"Ah ah… ah ah… ah ah…\"\n\nThe Little Loli lowered her head and placed her hand on the man's throat, as if listening to something.\n\n\"What's he saying? Translate,\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nThe Little Loli frowned, looking utterly incredulous.\n\nThen she looked at Zhou Ze and said:\n\n\"He's calling you…\n\nDaddy?\"\n\n***\n\n¹ **Translator's Note:** \"Eating chicken\" (吃鸡) is slang for playing the battle royale game PUBG, derived from the victory screen's message, \"Winner winner, chicken dinner!\"\n\n² **Translator's Note:** \"Medical dog\" (医学狗) is a popular, self-deprecating slang term used by medical students and interns in China to refer to their long hours and demanding work.\n\n³ **Translator's Note:** *A Spray of Plum Blossoms* (一剪梅) is a famous, melancholic Chinese song often used in dramas and, more recently, in memes to signify a moment of sadness or despair.",

    "content": "\"Ahhh... Ahhh... Ahhh...\"\n\nThe young man was bound in the corner of the room, unable to move, but he kept shouting at Zhou Ze.\n\nWhat he was shouting, Zhou Ze had already understood thanks to the little loli's earlier translation.\n\n\"Ahhh... Ahhh... Ahhh...\"\n\n\"Gag him,\" Zhou Ze said, growing impatient.\n\nHe had just received a million yuan, and before he could even get used to it, a son had popped out of nowhere.\n\nTsk, tsk.\n\nBai Yingying nodded, picked up a rag, and stuffed it directly into the man's mouth. The man could no longer make a sound, but his excitement was still plain to see.\n\nIt was like the ugly duckling finding the home of the white swan; the joy was truly written all over his face, as if he couldn't wait to rush into Zhou Ze's embrace for a nuzzle.\n\n\"What exactly is this thing?\" Bai Yingying asked the little loli beside her.\n\nThe little loli turned her nose up at the sky and let out a soft \"Hmph,\" adopting a posture that said, *I don't speak to people with low IQs*.\n\n\"What on earth is going on?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"It's obvious. You said your ashes were stolen before. Setting aside the extreme possibility that the Japanese priest is such a fanatical admirer that he wanted to collect your ashes and take them home, the rest is actually quite easy to guess. That Japanese priest learned some of your secrets and began to research them.\n\nFor example, cultivating a zombie similar to you. Actually, the Japanese really do have that kind of tradition. For instance, many of the so-called demon gods in Japanese mythology were created through hybridization. You are in me, and I am in you, with extremely chaotic characteristics.\"\n\nWatching the little loli explain on and on, Bai Yingying's sense of crisis intensified once more.\n\n\"Heh.\"\n\nZhou Ze gave a dry laugh.\n\nUsing his own ashes to create a derivative of himself?\n\nCome to think of it, it was quite interesting.\n\n\"Actually, there's one thing I've always been very curious about.\" The little loli tilted her head, looking at Zhou Ze. \"You don't seem to be the least bit curious about your own past secrets.\"\n\n\"What do I need to be curious about? I am who I am.\"\n\n\"Uh-huh, a different kind of firework.\"¹\n\nThe little loli stood up, her form drifting into the air and passing through the door.\n\n\"I'll go out and have a look. If that priest comes back here, I should be able to spot him in advance.\"\n\nInside the room, only Zhou Ze, Bai Yingying, and the captive remained.\n\nBai Yingying pointed at the captive and asked, \"Boss, your so... how should we deal with this thing?\"\n\n\"Is there any chance of saving him?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"He's essentially been poisoned by corpse venom, and very, very deeply. If it were at the very beginning, there might have been a way to solve it, but now, it's basically hopeless. Moreover, if he's left unattended, he's very likely to completely turn into a walking dead, with a primal impulse and craving for fresh human blood and flesh.\n\nHe is not a zombie, nor is he worthy of being classified in our lineage.\"\n\n\"But he seems to have some of his sanity right now.\"\n\n\"That's just a superficial appearance, Boss. From the moment he started calling you 'Dad,' it meant that his original self, that soul, that consciousness, had already been annihilated. He's more like a baby now, relearning and perceiving the world from his new perspective. And because he's connected to you in countless ways, he instinctively feels a sense of closeness to you.\"\n\n\"Then dispose of him.\"\n\nZhou Ze said.\n\nSince he couldn't be saved, it was better to get rid of him. Keeping him was like keeping a time bomb that could harm ordinary people. At a time like this, Zhou Ze wasn't about to indulge in misplaced compassion.\n\nBai Yingying nodded and reached out to grab the man's neck. Then, as if she'd thought of something, she said to Zhou Ze:\n\n\"Boss, could you turn your head and not watch?\"\n\nBai Yingying didn't want the boss to see her crude side.\n\nZhou Ze turned his head to the side.\n\nA moment later, he heard a *crack*.\n\nWhen he turned back, he saw that the man's head had been twisted off by Bai Yingying.\n\nA high school girl holding a human head, curiously examining the wound on the neck—the scene was utterly bizarre.\n\nA youthful innocence mixed with a skin-crawling horror.\n\nThe head was twisted off, but no blood spurted out. The blood vessels at the break in the neck were clearly visible, long since clogged and shriveled, with threads of black silk entwined within them.\n\nJust then, a wisp of black mist sprayed out from the nostrils of the head in Bai Yingying's hands. The mist condensed into the face of a man. He glanced over at Zhou Ze, his expression one of gratitude, and then slowly dissipated.\n\nHe was liberated.\n\nHe was indeed liberated, but due to his unique circumstances, he had lost the chance to be reincarnated. Still, an end like this was, in fact, a kind of bliss.\n\nZhou Ze reached up and gently rubbed the tip of his nose, his breathing growing a little heavier.\n\nTo be honest, his desire to see that Japanese priest dead had just grown a little stronger. From the moment the man had stolen his ashes, many of the recent events he'd experienced had continuously refreshed his hatred for that priest.\n\nBai Yingying put the head down and washed her hands at the faucet.\n\n\"Boss, we must kill that priest. He actually tried to add a hybrid species to our kind. And besides, that person... he was so pitiful,\" Bai Yingying said very seriously.\n\nListening to her, it sounded as if she was worried that her and Zhou Ze's offspring wouldn't be pure-blooded.\n\n\"He's here! I'll go hold him down! You two come down!\"\n\nThe little loli let out a piercing shriek inaudible to ordinary people and dove straight down from the balcony.\n\nThat Japanese priest was no ordinary person. Letting him walk up the stairs and into this room on his own introduced too many variables; who knew if he would sense something was wrong beforehand and simply run away.\n\nSo the little loli charged straight at him. Her job was to entangle him at all costs, buying time for Zhou Ze and Bai Yingying to surround him.\n\nThe Japanese priest stood there. He had just sneezed and was taking out a handkerchief to wipe his nose. His eyes were a little red; he had clearly caught a cold.\n\nBut just as he put the handkerchief away, a massive tongue appeared in his line of sight!\n\nThe priest retreated rapidly. The tongue swept horizontally again and again, drawing a circle with him at its center, trapping him inside.\n\n\"It's you again. You've been following and monitoring me time and again. Did you really think I didn't know!\n\nI originally thought you were just fulfilling your duties as a local Netherworld bailiff, but I didn't expect you to actually make a move. I am a living person! You can only manage the dead!\"\n\nThe priest was calm and composed. Clearly, he had long been aware of the little loli's surveillance.\n\nThe little loli remained silent, her feet hovering in the air, her mouth wide open, her long tongue twitching nonstop.\n\n\"I am leaving Tongcheng today. You could have turned a blind eye like you did before. Although the laws of the Netherworld are strict and inviolable, do you, a mere bailiff, truly have the face to represent the Netherworld!\"\n\nThe priest's hands formed a mudra.\n\nHe performed the Pace of Yu.²\n\nIn an instant, violent gales raged forth. The little loli's tongue began to break apart, and after holding on for a short while, it disintegrated completely.\n\nThe little loli closed her mouth, her lips writhing for a moment, and then her figure began to retreat.\n\n\"Scared already?\"\n\nThe priest smiled faintly, a touch of self-satisfaction in his voice.\n\nBut in the next moment, his expression changed. A white figure charged directly at him.\n\nThe priest flipped his hands downward, and two scalpels appeared in his grasp. He slashed directly at the white figure that was rapidly approaching!\n\n\"Clang!\"\n\nThe sound of metal striking metal rang out.\n\nThis was the sound of the scalpels striking the other party's body.\n\nThe priest's eyes narrowed. To possess such a formidable physical body—this was a zombie!\n\nBai Yingying took the priest's two slashes head-on, then slammed her shoulder viciously into his chest.\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nThe priest was sent flying backward, crashing heavily to the ground.\n\nBai Yingying did not continue her pursuit. Instead, she stood her ground, as if calming the baleful energy within her body. The priest's scalpels carried a sacred power that had agitated the flow of her baleful energy.\n\nIn comparison, the physical damage was secondary.\n\nAfter landing, the priest propped himself up with one hand and quickly stood up again. He wasn't surprised that the little loli was here; they had maintained a tacit understanding of minding their own business for some time.\n\nBut the appearance of this female zombie gave him a slight sense of foreboding.\n\nHe turned his head.\n\nSure enough, the priest saw that Zhou Ze had appeared not far behind him.\n\n\"Heh...\"\n\nZhou Ze reached up and flexed his wrist, walking toward the priest step by step.\n\n\"Sir, I think there may have been a slight misunderstanding between us. You could listen to my explanation.\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't respond, continuing to walk toward him.\n\n\"Sir, you should know the general gist of what happened, but I truly bear you no ill will. I am simply very curious about your past. I just want to help you find your past, to unlock your secrets.\"\n\nZhou Ze still didn't respond, continuing to close the distance with the priest.\n\n\"Sir, you must understand my sincerity. You know, I have always admired Chinese culture and have always held Chinese myths and legends in high esteem.\n\nThis is a kind of cultural centripetal force and cohesion. I am deeply captivated by Chinese culture, and I am willing to devote my heart and effort to understanding it.\"\n\nZhou Ze still didn't respond, continuing to walk forward. At the same time, long, ink-black fingernails slowly grew from his ten fingers.\n\n\"Everything I'm saying is true. In my eyes, you are also a part of Chinese culture, so I can't help but want to study you.\n\nYou can see how fluently I speak Chinese; that's how you know how fascinated I am with Chinese culture.\n\nDon't believe me?\n\nI can even sing Chinese songs for you.\n\nDon't you Chinese people just love to hear foreigners speak Chinese and sing Chinese songs, and then feel your hearts swell with pride and arrogance?\n\nGet incredibly pumped, you do!\"\n\nThe priest took a deep breath. At first, he had harbored some hope, but seeing Zhou Ze approach step by step without any hesitation, he decided to drop the pretense.\n\nHe stabbed the two scalpels backward into his own palms. Blood flowed out, soaking the blades.\n\nThe priest slowly let his earlier smile fade and said in a low voice:\n\n\"I've said so much. You should at least say a few words before you strike. Otherwise, this is so awkward for me.\"\n\n\"Baka,\" said Zhou Ze.\n\n\"...\" said the priest.\n\n---\n**Footnotes:**\n¹ A Chinese internet slang phrase literally meaning \"a different kind of firework,\" used to describe someone who is unique, eccentric, or stands out from the crowd.\n² The Pace of Yu (禹步, Yǔ Bù) is a ritualistic gait in Taoism used for magical purposes.\n\n---\n\n**Author's Note:**\n\nIn Dragon's memory, for many, many years, no book from the horror genre has made it into the top ten of the overall monthly ticket rankings.\n\nLast month, we were number one on the new book monthly ticket chart!\n\nEven when Dragon said his body couldn't take it after two consecutive new-book periods and he needed to rest and not compete for the rankings, at the end of the month, we were still tenth on the overall monthly ticket chart.\n\nWe have already set many records for the horror genre.\n\nSo let's push forward one more step.\n\nWith every step,\n\nWe are setting new records!\n\nMonthly tickets,\n\nI'm begging for monthly tickets",

    "content": "For a very long time—oh, no, to be precise, for his entire previous life—Zhou Ze had been someone who couldn't fight.\n\nHe’d never learned kung fu, nor had he practiced taekwondo; he wasn't even clear on the basic stances and moves.\n\nThat was why, when he first saw the newly awakened Bai Yingying, in Xu Qinglang's words, she stood in the bookstore with the tyrannical aura of a king, like some big, burly man.\n\nAnd Zhou Ze, using just his fingernails, had charged at her like an original wife catching the mistress, scratching her in a wild frenzy. He’d clawed Bai Yingying into a mental breakdown, directly causing her to go from Bai Yingying to Bai *Ying-ying*.¹\n\nIn the six months since becoming an underworld emissary, Zhou Ze had become aware of some of his own problems, but he hadn't exactly done anything to shore up his weaknesses.\n\nThere were many different reasons for this, but of course, the biggest reason was… laziness.\n\nOne good trick was all he needed to get by. When faced with ghosts and ordinary people, his fingernails were more than enough.\n\nEven if he encountered a slightly stronger opponent, he could always go berserk.\n\nAlthough he knew very little about where this \"berserk mode\" of his came from, he adhered to the lazy principle of \"go with the flow,\" and he had quite a good time using it. The only side effect was that he would be paralyzed for a long time afterward.\n\nSo, even though Zhou Ze knew he couldn't fight, he wasn't afraid of a fight. In fact, he was gradually developing the misconception that \"I'm very good at fighting.\"\n\nThe Priest took a step forward, scalpel in hand. His arm swung, lightning-fast, the blade aimed straight for the space between Zhou Ze's eyebrows.\n\nZhou Ze didn't dodge. *No matter how many roads you take, I only need one.* His right hand shot directly toward the Priest's face.\n\nThe result of this move would be the Priest's scalpel piercing Zhou Ze's temple, but the Priest himself would have five new skylights punched in his own head to let the air in.\n\nThe Priest hadn't expected Zhou Ze to be so resolute. Even with the absolute advantage of an ambush, he was playing a fierce game of trading life for life.\n\nAnd then,\n\nThe Priest chickened out.\n\nHe pulled back his hand and retreated. Zhou Ze didn't manage to grab his face, only grazing his chest.\n\n*Smack!*\n\nA whip of black mist lashed out.\n\nThe Priest was sent flying. Although he landed on his knees and quickly rolled back to his feet, he had clearly come out worse for wear in that first exchange.\n\nSeeing her boss being so ferocious, Bai Yingying's mouth hung wide open.\n\nVaguely, she seemed to recall the fear of being dominated by his frantic clawing and… gouging when she first met him in the bookstore.\n\nThat was, for her and the boss, truly a case of \"if only life were like the first time we met.\"\n\nThe little loli watched from the side, chewing on her own tongue as if it were bubblegum, then she suddenly let out a \"pfft\" of laughter.\n\nShe had figured it out. Zhou Ze didn't actually know how to fight at all.\n\n*How pathetic. And this idiot zombie next to me is still swooning over him.*\n\n*If you don't go help, your boss could really die at the hands of that piece-of-shit priest, you know that?!*\n\n*Can't you get a damn clue how much 'mettle' your boss actually has?*\n\nThe Priest shot up again. He was fast. This time, he didn't dare charge directly at Zhou Ze, opting for a flanking maneuver instead. After all, he was a bit intimidated by Zhou Ze's \"all-out\" fighting style and couldn't quite get a read on him.\n\nMoreover, he knew that Zhou Ze's truly terrifying state was when he turned into a zombie. He had fought Zhou Ze in that state before and had several ribs broken. His injuries had been anything but light, and that was when Zhou Ze had just finished a grueling fight with the temple goddess, Lady Qingyi.\n\nAnd so, the Priest and Boss Zhou fought, trading blows back and forth, making it look like a real spectacle. You advance, I retreat; you retreat, I advance; you flank, I flank. It was quite the show.\n\nZhou Ze was brimming with confidence, while the Priest was on edge. They actually managed to give off the air of a duel between masters. At least from the special effects and action choreography, it was more aesthetically pleasing to an audience than the flailing haymakers of so-called modern martial arts masters.\n\nFinally, Bai Yingying snapped out of it, charged forward again, and joined the fray.\n\nThe little loli didn't dare to continue sitting on the mountain to watch the tigers fight. Although she really hoped the Priest would kill Zhou Ze with lightning speed, which would grant her freedom, she didn't dare take the gamble. If Zhou Ze didn't die and discovered she'd been watching the fire from the other shore, she would be the one to die.\n\nBai Yingying's fighting style was even more direct than Zhou Ze's. She proactively took the damage for him, single-mindedly protecting her master. Plus, her physical constitution was indeed excellent, and she didn't lose out taking the Priest's hits head-on. This created more space and opportunities for Zhou Ze to attack. With the little loli's repeated sneak attacks as support, the Priest was truly in a miserable state.\n\nAfter getting several terrifying gashes from Zhou Ze's claws, the Priest's eyes narrowed. Fresh blood once again coated his scalpels. He then plunged the twin blades into the concrete ground and formed a hand seal.\n\nIn an instant, a barrier appeared. During a sneak attack, the little loli slammed right into it, causing her soul to become unstable for a moment, forcing her to retreat.\n\nThis barrier had a suppressive effect on all beings of darkness. And strictly speaking, all three of them—Zhou Ze, Bai Yingying, and the loli—were not of the righteous path and would be suppressed.\n\nThe little loli knew when to quit, resolutely refusing to let herself get seriously injured.\n\nBut Bai Yingying was much more straightforward.\n\nShe started ramming into the barrier over and over. Even though malevolent energy scattered from her body with each painful impact, she gritted her teeth and continued, intent on shattering this barrier with brute force!\n\n*That big dummy.*\n\nThe little loli snorted with disdain.\n\nAt that same moment, Zhou Ze also dug his ten fingers into the ground. A black light began to emerge in his eyes, and then, he slowly began to lift his hands!\n\nThe scalpels the Priest had stuck in the ground began to be slowly pulled out by an unseen force. Coupled with Bai Yingying's constant ramming, the barrier started to become precarious.\n\nBeads of sweat had already appeared on the Priest's forehead. His eyes began to dart around. It was obvious that in this situation, it would be very difficult to win the fight. He was already this passive even before Zhou Ze had used his ultimate move. If this stalemate continued, he would only sink deeper and might very well die here.\n\nSo, he planned to slip away. He was looking for an opportunity to escape.\n\nBlood began to seep from Zhou Ze's fingertips, as if they had been cut by sharp blades. At the same time, Zhou Ze growled at the little loli on the side:\n\n\"If he doesn't die today, you'll die in his place.\"\n\nA threat.\n\nA naked, blatant threat!\n\nThe little loli froze for a moment. She hadn't expected Zhou Ze to say something like that. All this time, although she was Zhou Ze's subordinate, subdued by him, her prideful heart was unwilling to truly be reduced to a slave like Bai Yingying. She had always maintained her pride.\n\nShe had always reminded herself that she was different from that idiot girl Bai Yingying!\n\nBut Zhou Ze's words completely shattered her pride.\n\nHis words could be translated to mean: *You are my dog. If you can't catch the prey, then this dog can be cooked and eaten.*\n\nIt was very realistic, tearing away all warmth.\n\nThe little loli shot a furious glare at Zhou Ze. Right now, she wanted nothing more than to kill this man, to tear him to pieces!\n\nBut her form still flickered, turning into a streak of black light that shot directly toward the Priest.\n\n\"Up!\"\n\nZhou Ze forcibly pulled out his bloody hands.\n\nThe scalpels the Priest had plunged into the ground immediately flew out.\n\nBai Yingying crashed forward. The Priest barely managed to block with his arms crossed, but the little loli appeared directly behind him, her entire soul piercing into his body.\n\n\"Ahhhhhhh!!!!!\"\n\nA man's and a little girl's agonized screams erupted from the Priest's mouth.\n\nBai Yingying delivered an elbow strike, smashing it viciously into the Priest's chest. The Priest was sent flying like a fly being swatted. Bai Yingying quickly followed up, pinning the Priest down and relentlessly pounding her fists into his chest.\n\n*Thud!*\n\n*Thud!*\n\n*Thud!*\n\nA continuous barrage of heavy punches.\n\nThe muffled thuds echoed throughout the residential complex, but the Priest's body displayed an unnatural toughness. Under the continuous assault of Bai Yingying's zombie fists, it merely emitted the sound of cracking joints. If it were an ordinary person, Bai Yingying would have long since beaten him into meat paste—and a very springy meat paste at that.\n\n\"Ah!\"\n\nAt that moment, the little loli who had drilled into the Priest's body shot out. Her soul was somewhat tattered, much dimmer and more transparent than before.\n\nShe pointed at the Priest and said, \"There's something wrong with his body!\"\n\nYes.\n\nThere was definitely something wrong with this body.\n\nBai Yingying, who had been hammering away at him, felt it deeply. It was as if she were trying to chew a piece of beef full of gristle; she just couldn't chew it to pieces!\n\n\"Hahhh...\"\n\nThe Priest seemed to have made some sort of decision. His eyes began to turn crimson, and his muscles started to wither.\n\nBai Yingying paused.\n\n*Holy shit, why does this feel so familiar!*\n\nThe Priest seemed to be in great pain, and it was clear he was doing this out of desperation. He knew that his research had not succeeded at all; it was still in the exploratory, failure-ridden stage.\n\nBut he had no choice.\n\nOtherwise, he would soon be beaten into a bouncy meat paste by this female zombie—a paste that, with a little flour, could be rolled into pissing beef balls² and tossed into a hot pot.\n\n\"Roar!\"\n\nThe Priest's body went rigid. Bai Yingying smashed a fist down on his head.\n\n*Bang!*\n\nThe Priest fell again, cratering the ground before bouncing back up. He crashed directly into Bai Yingying, forcing her to stumble back several steps. \"Tsk, tsk, tsk.\"\n\n\"Ugh... Ugh...\"\n\nThe Priest slowly got to his feet, his body swaying. Half of his face was ashen, the other half gray. He looked like Ouyang Feng³ with his Toad Style. In short, his whole being was filled with a sense of chaos and strangeness.\n\nBai Yingying prepared to charge again but was stopped by Zhou Ze's hand.\n\n\"You rest for a bit. Don't let yourself get too badly injured.\"\n\nHearing this, Bai Yingying nodded obediently but looked at Zhou Ze with some concern, as if to say, *Boss, can you handle this alone?*\n\nZhou Ze appeared calm and unruffled.\n\nHe took a few more steps forward.\n\n\"Ahem...\"\n\nHe coughed lightly.\n\nIt seemed he was trying to get the Priest's attention.\n\nThe Priest's eyes locked onto Zhou Ze.\n\nHis expression constantly shifted.\n\nFirst hatred,\n\nthen anger,\n\nthen confusion,\n\nand finally, bewilderment.\n\n\"What do you call me,\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nThe Priest tilted his head, continuing to stare at Zhou Ze, a gurgling sound coming from his throat.\n\nHe covered his mouth, pressing down hard. He seemed to be trying to stop something.\n\nBut the craving burst forth, an impulse that was simply impossible to suppress.\n\nZhou Ze opened his arms.\n\nHis expression was gentle.\n\n*Come on,*\n\n*Papa loves you.*\n\nFinally,\n\nThe Priest couldn't hold it in, couldn't bear it any longer.\n\nHis experiment had a major flaw, one he was unaware of, because he had only stolen the ashes of Zhou Ze's past life to conduct his experiments. He had never managed to capture Zhou Ze himself to participate!\n\nAt last, the hand covering his mouth slipped away.\n\nThe Priest cried out excitedly:\n\n\"Otou-san...\" (Father)\n\n---\n**PS:**\n\nRight now we're 9th on the overall monthly ticket rankings,\n\nAnd 5th in the Fan Team competition,\n\nBut Dragon feels,\n\nWe can go even higher!\n\nTo all the dears who still have monthly tickets, please vote for Dragon!\n\n---\n**Footnotes:**\n\n¹: A pun in the original.

    "title": "Chapter 168 Deadpool!",
    "content": "There is a story about a highly skilled blacksmith who first forged an extremely sturdy cage, and then forged an equally sturdy iron lock.\n\nThen he walked into the cage he had built to feel its sturdiness for himself, and the lock hanging on it suddenly fell shut.\n\nHe was trapped inside. And because his workshop was in a remote location and business wasn't very good, by the time someone found him, he had long since died of thirst or starvation in the cage.\n\nAnd the Japanese priest before him now was just like the blacksmith in the story. He had meticulously crafted a cage and a lock, only to end up trapping himself.\n\nThe priest was, after all, different from the young man upstairs whose suffering had been ended by Bai Yingying snapping his neck. He was a cut above, with a stronger will.\n\nAnd so,\n\nHe still retained a sliver of his sanity.\n\nWhen that young man had called Zhou Ze \"Dad,\" the elation, the sheer joy, the overwhelming excitement—it was a truly genuine and tear-jerking display of emotion.\n\nBut when this Japanese priest called out \"Ōtōsan,\"¹ it was fraught with immense awkwardness, coyness, shame, and repression—a feigned resistance. He was like the heroine in some cheesy drama who'd been drugged with an aphrodisiac by the villain.\n\n\"Ōtōsan!\"\n\nAfter crying out once, a look of terror filled the Japanese priest's eyes. How had things turned out this way? He had an extremely ominous premonition, one that told him events were spiraling toward an extreme more terrifying than death.\n\nAt this point, things had taken a turn for the better—at least from Zhou Ze's perspective, that was certainly the case.\n\nHe continued to stand with his arms open. In response to that cry of \"Ōtōsan,\" he nodded lightly and answered:\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nA call and response created an interaction, and with interaction, the urge grew even stronger!\n\nThe Japanese priest's eyes were wide open; he could no longer control himself.\n\n\"Ōtōsan!\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Ōtōsan!\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Ōtōsan! Ōtōsan! Ōtōsan!!………………\"\n\nThe first time was awkward, tinged with a raw dryness and a sharp pain.\n\nThe second time was much easier, with the first having broken the ice.\n\nAfter that, it became second nature. The struggling man gave up the struggle, because he had grown numb.\n\nZhou Ze slowly squatted down and clapped his hands at the priest, as if coaxing his corgi to come over for a cuddle.\n\nThe priest staggered toward Zhou Ze, and then, just the same, he truly lay down before him. The skin on his face twitched and trembled. His subconscious told him he absolutely could not do this, but that heartfelt impulse and intimacy surging from within shattered his sanity.\n\n\"Good boy. Stop struggling,\" Zhou Ze said to him softly.\n\nThe priest slowly closed his eyes.\n\nHe was, more or less, resigned to his fate.\n\n\"Pfft...\"\n\nHowever, Zhou Ze showed no subsequent tenderness. His sharp fingernails plunged directly into the crown of the priest's head.\n\nThe priest's body began to tremble uncontrollably, but his face showed a look of enjoyment.\n\n*Both thunder's fury and sweet dew are blessings from the sovereign.*²\n\nThis phrase was perfectly embodied by him.\n\nThe reason Bai Yingying was so deferential to Zhou Ze now was essentially the same. In ordinary human society, one could still shout the slogan, \"Are kings and nobles destined to be so by birth?\" But in the genes of other species, the inferior submitting to the superior is an instinct, difficult to change and difficult to resist.\n\nThe little loli walked to Zhou Ze's side. Looking at the priest below, who was simultaneously enjoying and being tortured, she pursed her lips and finally spoke:\n\n\"Not considering actually adopting a godson? Anyway, there isn't much difference between you and the Nine-Thousand-Year-Old.\"³\n\n\"This is a son I can't afford to have,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\nYes, taking this Japanese priest home—even if not as a son but as a pet—seemed like a decent idea. His bookstore was already full of strange people; adding one more priest wouldn't be impossible.\n\nBut Zhou Ze was no collector, and this priest was too dangerous. Zhou Ze didn't know how long this \"father-son\" relationship would last, nor when the priest might \"wake up\" on his own.\n\nKeeping a dog was fine; a dog at least understood loyalty. But keeping a venomous snake was playing with fire. One day, it might actually bite him.\n\nThe priest's body slowly began to turn black as the dark energy from Zhou Ze's fingertips continuously poured into him, frantically destroying his tissues.\n\nThis torture lasted for about twenty seconds. The priest stopped moving, his entire body turning a deathly shade of blackish-blue.\n\nZhou Ze withdrew his fingernails, but at the same time, his other hand shot forward, palm clenching tight.\n\n\"Ah!\"\n\nA black soul was seized by Zhou Ze. It was the priest's face, twisted with struggle and boundless fury.\n\nHe couldn't imagine that this would be his end—to have so shamefully and voluntarily presented his neck to his enemy, awaiting execution.\n\nThis ending was too frustrating, too unbearable. He was truly unreconciled, deeply and utterly unreconciled.\n\nHe still had other methods, other secret arts. Even if the situation was truly dire, he was not without a chance to escape with his life.\n\n\"Yingying,\" Zhou Ze called out.\n\n\"Here, Boss.\"\n\n\"Find some gasoline. Burn his body for me.\"\n\n\"Yes, Boss.\"\n\nZhou Ze casually took a small stack of joss paper from his pocket and burned it with a lighter.\n\nThis would ensure that no outsiders would see or accidentally stumble upon him while he was destroying the evidence in the residential complex.\n\nJoss paper could be exchanged for money, but it could also ward off trouble. Using it in this way, simply to avoid trouble when no wrong had truly been done, had always been effective.\n\nThe priest's soul was still struggling ceaselessly in Zhou Ze's palm. After struggling for a while, he began to plead.\n\nEven in death, the soul of a character like him was somewhat different from an ordinary person's.\n\nZhou Ze ignored him, simply holding onto him.\n\nBai Yingying found the gasoline and placed it on the ground, then silently walked out again.\n\nA moment later, Bai Yingying returned, carrying a barbecue grill on her shoulder. She set the grill up nearby.\n\nZhou Ze was stunned.\n\nThe little loli was also stunned.\n\nZhou Ze pointed at the grill and asked:\n\n\"What's the meaning of this?\"\n\nBai Yingying looked a little lost. She looked up at Zhou Ze and asked, \"Boss, aren't we barbecuing him?\"\n\n\"You like to eat this?\" Zhou Ze pointed to the Japanese priest's corpse nearby.\n\nBai Yingying shook her head. \"Boss, weren't you the one who said you wanted his ashes mixed with rice?\"\n\nAs she spoke, Bai Yingying even produced a bag from the side.\n\n\"I even went out of my way to buy rice.\"\n\n\"...\" said Zhou Ze.\n\nThe little loli beside them snorted with laughter like a pig.\n\nZhou Ze really wanted to pat Bai Yingying on the head and ask her, in a soft, gentle voice, if she was doing this on purpose.\n\nBut he decided against it, because Bai Yingying was genuinely the type of person who might take his angry \"hyperbole\" literally.\n\nAt least, you had no reason to blame her for this.\n\n\"I hadn't finished my sentence,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"What?\" asked Bai Yingying.\n\n\"I was going to say, I'll take his ashes, mix them with rice, and feed it to my Yingying for a midnight snack.\"\n\nThe expression on Bai Yingying's face immediately became priceless.\n\n\"Just burn it first, then find a public toilet to dump the ashes,\" Zhou Ze said, no longer teasing the female jiangshi.\n\nYou couldn't blame Zhou Ze for being so particular about ashes; after all, most people don't go through the experience of having their own ashes stolen and then having to hunt down the thief for revenge.\n\nSo, special circumstances call for special measures. Since you stole my ashes, I'll return the favor with yours. An eye for an eye.\n\nBai Yingying began to pour gasoline on the priest's corpse. The priest's soul thrashed about frantically at the sight, but Zhou Ze just made him watch from the side.\n\n\"Boss, I'm lighting it.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\nBai Yingying lit the fire. The priest's corpse began to burn, and for a moment, the smell of roasting meat filled the air.\n\nA wave of despair emanated from the priest's soul.\n\nHowever, as it burned, Zhou Ze suddenly noticed something was wrong and took a step forward.\n\nBai Yingying also let out a sound of surprise, because she saw the corpse in the fire slowly sit up.\n\n\"Boss, do corpses do that when they're burned?\" Bai Yingying asked Zhou Ze.\n\nWhy ask Zhou Ze?\n\nBecause Zhou Ze had experience.\n\nIn theory, a corpse suddenly twitching or sitting up during cremation could be explained by science.\n\nZhou Ze didn't have time to explain,\n\nBecause soon, there would be no need for any scientific explanation.\n\nThe corpse didn't just sit up,\n\nIt freaking stood up.\n\nHere, you take the pen.\n\nHow do you explain this?\n\nThe corpse walked out of the flames. It was still on fire, still burning. Its clothes had long since been incinerated, and its skin was a gruesome sight.\n\nBut it still walked out. Its eyes remained closed, even though its entire face was a mangled, pitted mess of flesh. But as it stepped out of the firelight, it slowly opened them.\n\nWithin the eye sockets,\n\nWas a hollow emptiness.\n\nBut soon, two green rings of light appeared, glowing with a peculiar luster.\n\nFor some reason, as this thing walked out, Zhou Ze felt a telepathic connection with it, as if this creature was another version of himself—unadulterated, utterly pure.\n\n\"Ugh...\"\n\nIt opened its mouth,\n\nBut no words came out.\n\nThe priest's soul, clutched in Zhou Ze's palm, was ecstatic at this moment. He had succeeded! His research had succeeded at such a time, in such a bizarrely coincidental way!\n\nHowever,\n\nZhou Ze raised him up,\n\nAnd then,\n\nOpened his hand.\n\nThe priest was stunned.\n\nHe was freed, just like that?\n\n\"Ugh...\"\n\nBut in the next instant,\n\nThe corpse suddenly moved. It opened its mouth, revealing black fangs, and lunged at the priest's soul, biting down and tearing at it ferociously.\n\nThe priest didn't even have time to scream before his own corpse tore him apart in the most brutal way, scattering his soul to the winds!\n\nAfter finishing,\n\nThe corpse raised its head again and looked at Zhou Ze.\n\nThe two of them just stared at each other.\n\nThen,\n\nThe corpse silently bent over,\n\nAnd on one knee,\n\nIt knelt.\n\n---\n**Footnotes:**\n1.  *Ōtōsan*: Japanese for \"father.\"\n2.

    "content": "\"What in the world is this?\"\n\nThe old Taoist watched as an adult figure draped in black gauze stepped out of the car. He wondered, *Didn't the Boss and the others go out for revenge? Never mind not losing anyone, how did they come back with an extra person?*\n\nAnd this person was truly strange, completely covered from head to toe, not even showing their eyes.\n\nHe couldn't even tell if they were male or female.\n\nSo mysterious.\n\nA person in black?\n\nHmm?\n\nNo, that's not right.\n\nThere was a fragrant smell…\n\nLike Brazilian barbecue.\n\nThe old Taoist stuck his nose close to the person and took a sniff. It really was fragrant, wonderfully so. He then turned his head to look at Zhou Ze and asked:\n\n\"Boss, did you guys go out for barbecue?\"\n\n\"Blech...\"\n\nThe little loli at the side really couldn't take it anymore. It was truly disgusting, especially seeing the old Taoist stick his nose up to that thing and sniff with a look of intoxication.\n\nShe was truly thankful she hadn't brought her physical body along today, or she would have really thrown up.\n\n\"I brought him back to help you with chores. From now on, you can have him help you with things,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"What?\"\n\nThe old Taoist was utterly shocked.\n\n*Son of a bitch!*\n\nHe had just been mocking that little broad Bai Yingying for trying to curry favor with the little loli all day, and now his own position was being threatened?\n\nEven this job of sweeping floors, kowtowing to ghosts, living without a salary, and having to make offerings to them from time to time—even this gig has someone trying to snatch it from me?\n\nIs there any justice in this world!\n\nThe job market is just too brutal these days!\n\n\"Go give him a bath. Be gentle,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"A bath?\"\n\nThe old Taoist paused for a moment, then asked:\n\n\"She's a woman?\"\n\n\"Yes, she is, so you need to be gentle. She has severe autism.\"\n\nHearing this, the old Taoist…\n\n*Heh heh.*\n\nHe subconsciously rubbed his calloused hands together.\n\n\"Is this... appropriate?\"\n\n\"I trust your character.\"\n\nZhou Ze reached out and patted the old Taoist on the shoulder.\n\n*I have high hopes for you.*\n\nThen, Zhou Ze said to the veiled person, \"Follow him. Do whatever he tells you to do.\"\n\nThe veiled person walked over to the old Taoist's side, very obediently.\n\nThe old Taoist was a little shy, but he still led the person to the bathroom.\n\nZhou Ze and the others also entered the bookstore. Bai Yingying poured Zhou Ze a cup of coffee. Zhou Ze picked up the coffee, took a sip, and then said:\n\n\"Go lock the bathroom door from the outside.\"\n\n\"On it.\"\n\nBai Yingying quickly went and locked the door.\n\nA short while later,\n\nThe old Taoist's terrified screams echoed from the bathroom. Then, he began to pound on the bathroom door, sounding like he was in utter agony.\n\n\"Boss, let me out! Let me out!\"\n\n\"We'll talk after you've washed him clean,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"...\" The old Taoist.\n\nAbout half an hour later, the old Taoist came out, his face alternating between green and white. He didn't eat dinner and just sat alone at the counter, contemplating the meaning of life.\n\nThe visual shock had indeed been too powerful, so strong that it nearly caused the old Taoist to have a mental breakdown.\n\nThe little loli went back. Her soul had been out of her body for too long, and she had to return to rest.\n\nXu Qinglang still hadn't returned by dinnertime, likely still wallowing in melancholy. Zhou Ze had no choice but to order takeout again.\n\nFollowing Zhou Ze's instructions, Bai Yingying went out and bought a few outfits, the kind that could cover the entire body. Such clothes were hard to find, so Bai Yingying could only buy a few Spider-Man and Iron Man costumes. After putting one on that guy, he looked much more normal.\n\nThis way, he could move around and do things in the bookstore in the future without worrying about scaring people.\n\nAfter dinner, Zhou Ze saw the old Taoist still sitting there, looking completely out of it, and felt a pang of sympathy.\n\nHe also felt a little guilty.\n\nAt that moment,\n\nZhou Ze walked over and stood in front of the old Taoist.\n\nThe old Taoist looked at Zhou Ze with a dazed expression.\n\n*I feel so wronged...*\n\n*I just want to cry.*\n\n\"Boss...\"\n\n\"It's alright now. Try not to dwell on it,\" Zhou Ze comforted him.\n\n\"Boss, next time you do something like this, can you at least give me some mental preparation beforehand?\"\n\nIt wasn't that the old Taoist was too naive, but rather that the people around a ghost were all weirdos. It wasn't entirely impossible for a shy girl to ask him to help her bathe and chat about life.\n\nBut when he, filled with anticipation and excitement, helped that person take off their clothes,\n\nWhat was revealed was a large expanse of charred skin, with pus oozing from all over...\n\nThe fantasy was lush,\n\nBut reality was bone-thin.\n\nThis huge disparity was enough to make the old Taoist collapse. He even felt he might catch the same \"problem\" as the Boss because of this.\n\nThis was the Boss's revenge, it had to be. Who told him to always talk about patronizing prostitutes¹ in front of the Boss?\n\nThat was like talking about how spoiled and disobedient your son is in front of a eunuch. It was a death wish.\n\n\"Don't worry, it won't happen again.\"\n\n\"Okay, thank you, Boss.\" The old Taoist took a deep breath and asked, \"Boss, what is that thing?\"\n\nThat guy couldn't even be considered human anymore.\n\n\"It's that Japanese priest,\" Zhou Ze answered.\n\n\"What?\" The old Taoist was astonished.\n\n\"You can ask Bai Yingying for the specific details. Anyway, he's quite safe now, completely under my control. You really can have him help with cleaning and stuff in the future.\"\n\n\"You got it.\" Hearing this, the old Taoist finally felt a bit better.\n\n\"You're getting old, too. You shouldn't do too much of *that* kind of work anymore. You should also pay more attention to your health.\"\n\n\"Don't you worry, Boss. This humble Taoist is in great shape. I can go for half an hour at a time. I make them feel like earning my money is a real difficult ordeal.\"\n\n\"Oh.\"\n\nJust then, Xu Qinglang walked in from outside. He went to the counter, poured a glass of red wine, and downed it in one go.\n\nClearly, he was still very down in the dumps.\n\nZhou Ze patted the old Taoist's shoulder again and said, \"Don't worry. Next time I ask you to do something, I'll definitely let you know what it is.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Boss.\"\n\n\"He'll be staying in the same room as you from now on, sleeping with you. This is your advance notice.\"\n\n\"...\" The old Taoist.\n\nZhou Ze walked up to Xu Qinglang and said, \"What's wrong? Still feeling down?\"\n\n\"I'm fine. It's not like I can't get over it.\" Xu Qinglang stuck out his tongue and licked his lips, then poured another glass of red wine and continued drinking.\n\nZhou Ze didn't know how to comfort him. He figured Xu Qinglang would probably get over it himself after a while.\n\n\"Old Zhou, tell me, are there really gods in this world?\" Xu Qinglang asked.\n\n\"There probably are. After all, I'm a Ghost Emissary.\"\n\nIf there's one, there can be two. If there are two, there can be three. And from three, all things are born.\n\nXu Qinglang nodded. \"So, is there a sea god, too?\"\n\n\"If you think there is, then there probably is.\"\n\n\"That sea god... is a real piece of shit.\"\n\n\"Perhaps he wasn't a person to begin with. Maybe he was a giant sea turtle that achieved spiritual cultivation, you never know.\"\n\nA group of students walked in through the bookstore's entrance. The one in the lead was a girl, about seventeen or eighteen, likely in high school.\n\n\"Sir, there are so many of us, can we get a discount?\"\n\n\"What discount? It's on me,\" a chubby male student said.\n\nAfterward, the students gathered around a table and started copying from each other's homework.\n\nEveryone was copying very diligently and seriously, as if they were actually doing the work themselves.\n\n\"Feels like old times,\" Xu Qinglang said, holding his wine glass in one hand and pointing at the students with the other.\n\n\"I never copied. Others copied from me,\" Zhou Ze said with a smile.\n\n\"I know, I know, you're the top student, the academic elite.\" Xu Qinglang poured a glass of wine for Zhou Ze as well.\n\n\"A milk tea for everyone, please,\" the chubby boy called out, waving his hand.\n\n\"Alright.\"\n\nXu Qinglang nodded and went to the back kitchen to start making the milk tea.\n\nAfter a while, the chubby boy came over himself and asked, \"Is the milk tea ready yet?\"\n\n\"I'll bring it over to you when it's done,\" Bai Yingying said.\n\n\"It's fine, I'll wait here. I'm done copying anyway.\"\n\nThe chubby boy played on his phone at the side, then took out a cigarette and lit it, turning his back to his classmates in the distance.\n\nSoon, Xu Qinglang had all the milk teas ready, sealing each cup.\n\nThe chubby boy took one cup, inserted a straw, then grabbed a few more cups and walked over to his classmates.\n\nBai Yingying carried the rest of the milk tea over on a tray.\n\nA moment later, Zhou Ze proactively got up and walked over to the students, looking left and right. This made the students who were copying homework feel very uncomfortable; after all, copying homework isn't exactly something to be proud of.\n\nHowever, Zhou Ze did see one exception. A girl dressed a bit more plainly but with delicate features wasn't copying; she was doing the work herself.\n\nThen she would pass the parts she finished to the classmates around her to continue copying.\n\nIt was a very natural arrangement. A group of slackers definitely needed a top student to act as their pillar of strength.\n\n\"The ice is melting, hurry up and drink it,\" the chubby boy said to the top-student girl, pushing the cup of milk tea toward her.\n\nThe girl shook her head, indicating she wasn't thirsty, and at the same time said, \"Let's not come here next time, it's too expensive.\"\n\n\"Not at all, not at all, I have plenty of allowance,\" the chubby boy said, showing off. \"Just have a little. The milk tea at this place is pretty good, made with real care. I came here last time, and it's sold at a high price.\"\n\nHearing this, Zhou Ze suddenly had the urge to tell this chubby student that the milk tea and drinks sold at his bookstore were all made by Xu Qinglang in the back kitchen with Xiang Piao Piao² instant mix. Ever since Old Xu realized he needed to start taking care of himself, he had become increasingly lazy.\n\nThe girl hesitated for a moment, put down her pen, and reached for the milk tea.\n\nBut just then, Zhou Ze walked by, his arm bumped it, and the milk tea fell to the floor, splashing some out.\n\n\"Oh, my apologies. I'll get you a new one.\"\n\nZhou Ze bent down and picked up the milk tea from the floor.\n\nThe chubby boy looked up and glared at Zhou Ze. \"What are you doing, wandering around here for, you idiot!\"\n\n\"Alright, don't be angry, it's just a cup of milk tea,\" a classmate beside him advised.\n\nZhou Ze ignored the chubby student. He took the milk tea back to the counter and said to Xu Qinglang:\n\n\"Mix another packet.\"\n\nXu Qinglang nodded.\n\nZhou Ze walked outside and stood at the bookstore entrance, smoking a cigarette.\n\nAt that moment, Bai Yingying happened to be sitting behind the counter playing PUBG on her phone. Seeing the cup of milk tea Zhou Ze had brought back sitting on the counter, she simply picked it up and started drinking it. It had only fallen on the floor, no one had drunk from it, so it wasn't dirty.\n\nShe didn't need to eat, but she sometimes needed to replenish some fluids.\n\nAnother half hour passed.\n\nThe students in the group began to leave one by one after they finished copying their homework.\n\nIn the end, only the chubby student and the top-student girl were left. The chubby student said attentively:\n\n\"Should I get a taxi to take you home?\"\n\n\"No, thank you, I'll take the bus back.\"\n\nThe girl packed her schoolbag and walked out of the bookstore.\n\nThe chubby student sighed, stood up, and went to the counter to pay.\n\n\"Nine hundred in total,\" Xu Qinglang said, calculating by headcount, with a minimum spending of one hundred per person.\n\n\"Alipay.\"\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\nThe chubby student paid the bill. As he turned to leave, he saw Zhou Ze walking in from outside.\n\nHe snorted through his nose, clearly very displeased with Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze smiled at him.\n\nThen, as the chubby student passed by him,\n\n*SLAP!*\n\nA crisp sound rang out.\n\nZhou Ze slapped the chubby student squarely across the face.\n\nA human figure was slapped right out of his body. The chubby student was sent spinning in place, completely dazed, seemingly unaware that he had just been slapped.\n\nHe looked at Zhou Ze in confusion and said, \"What happened to me?\"\n\n\"You walked into the door. Hurry on home now.\"\n\n\"Oh, thanks, Boss.\"\n\nThe chubby student nodded and smiled at Zhou Ze, then walked out of the bookstore.\n\nAnd inside the bookstore,\n\na short man was left behind.\n\nThe man was kneeling on the floor, trembling.\n\n\"That's some hairstyle,\" Xu Qinglang said, leaning on the counter.\n\nIndeed, the short man's hairstyle was certainly something.\n\nOther people's Mohawks were already alternative enough.\n\nHe was even more extreme.\n\nOn his head,\n\nwas a knife, sticking straight out.\n\n---\n**Author's Note:** We're about to fall out of the top ten.

    "title": "Chapter 170: Being stern!",
    "content": "Lust is a knife hanging over one's head; it was already glaringly obvious what kind of ghost this fellow was.\n\nIn truth, both in ancient and modern times, people have often regarded the word \"philandering\" with great tolerance.\n\nIn ancient times, it was considered exceptionally elegant for a scholar to be a philanderer, frequenting flower streets and willow lanes. Even in the modern day, when some Casanova boasts of his conquests, you may not agree with his lifestyle, but you wouldn't think it a heinous crime.\n\nAfter all, it is all built on a foundation of mutual consent.\n\nIt could be \"sweet talk,\" it could be \"mutual loneliness,\" or it could be a \"clean transaction.\" In this regard, people are quite open-minded.\n\nBut the kind of lecher who enjoys using force and despicable means will often be met with scorn and condemnation from society. It's said that in prison, the lowest status belongs to rapists.\n\nThe man knelt there, kowtowing nonstop to Zhou Ze, hoping Zhou Ze would spare his life.\n\nThe bookstore was, in effect, Zhou Ze's execution ground. Especially after Zhou Ze became an official agent, this place became a special kind of venue. The motley assortment of ghosts and ghouls outside would be inexplicably drawn to the bookstore, either pushing open the door in a daze and walking right in, or attaching themselves to other things or finding other ways to connect with the shop.\n\nBoss Zhou was fishing; the willing would take the bait.\n\nActually, at first, Zhou Ze hadn't noticed there was a ghost lurking on that fat student. That's right, even Xu Qinglang hadn't seen it.\n\nZhou Ze had only noticed the fat student secretly putting a drug into a cup of milk tea. As for what kind of drug it was, everyone knew full well it couldn't possibly be cold medicine.\n\nBased on the principle that this was his shop, and by law, he was responsible for the life and safety of the customers consuming products in his shop, Boss Zhou had no choice but to intervene.\n\n\"Hey, you saw it from the start, didn't you?\" Xu Qinglang said to Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Ah, yeah.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded silently.\n\nThere was no need to explain this. Letting the people around you think you're so awesome, so amazing—it's best to let such a beautiful misunderstanding continue.\n\n\"Heh heh, the way you walked up and slapped that guy, knocking a ghost right out of him... to be honest, it was quite unexpected. You looked a bit like a Celestial Master from Mount Longhu.\"\n\nOld Xu was still hyping him up. Zhou Ze remained silent, accepting the praise.\n\nHe really wanted to say that at the time, he was just thinking of giving the punk a slap to teach him a lesson. It was purely because the guy pissed him off and he felt like slapping him. At worst, he could beat him up and burn some joss paper for him later. But then came the unexpected discovery: the lecherous ghost attached to the fat student had actually been slapped right out by him.\n\nIn fact, Zhou Ze had also pondered why neither he nor Xu Qinglang had seen this lecherous ghost before. In retrospect, there was likely only one reason: everyone has lust in their heart.\n\nEveryone has that impulse, that restlessness, that desire. This desire is similar to the pursuit of money and power; it is an expression of human nature. Because of this, the lecherous ghost could use that as cover to hide itself.\n\nWhether it existed or not, the fat student was lustful. Therefore, that was its best camouflage.\n\nZhou Ze opened the Gates of Hell, grabbed the short, lecherous ghost on the floor with one hand, and prepared to send it to Hell.\n\n\"Spare me, spare me, spare me...\"\n\nThe lecherous ghost was still begging.\n\nBut aside from begging for mercy, it had nothing else useful to say, like \"spare me and I can give you such-and-such,\" or \"spare me and I can tell you some important news.\"\n\nWell,\n\nin a situation like this, Boss Zhou was still one to despise evil and remain impartial.\n\nIn the end, the lecherous ghost was tossed through the Gates of Hell.\n\nTonight's revenue had another entry added to it.\n\n\"You think every lecherous ghost has a knife over its head?\" Xu Qinglang asked.\n\n\"Remember that teacher in the tall hat we met before?\" Zhou Ze retorted.\n\n\"Yeah, but he was framed. That one shouldn't count.\"\n\nThat teacher in the tall hat had clearly been framed, but under the weight of public rumor, even Zhou Ze's fingernails couldn't pry that tall hat off his head.\n\nPerhaps Hell has this sort of tradition. Or perhaps it's because Hell is simply too large, and the officials of the underworld administration are lazy and negligent in their governance, so they like to use a one-size-fits-all approach, mostly carrying over the \"verdicts\" from the mortal world.\n\nThose who wear hats keep their hats, those who are branded keep their brands. Whatever conclusion the mortal world reached, the underworld administration inherited it. This greatly reduced the administration's workload. As for whether any of them were wrongly accused—sorry, nobody cared.\n\nHaving made a sale today, Boss Zhou couldn't be bothered to stay up until dawn. He went to the bathroom, took a shower first, and then went upstairs in his bathrobe.\n\nWatching Zhou Ze's back as he went up the stairs, Xu Qinglang took another sip of red wine. His gaze fell upon the problematic milk tea Zhou Ze had brought over earlier. The cup was now empty.\n\nXu Qinglang stretched. Of course, Xu Qinglang knew who drank it. And it seemed the person who drank it had sensed something was off and had already snuck upstairs earlier.\n\nHeh heh.\n\nOld Xu's eyes wandered as he waited for the good show.\n\nPushing open the bedroom door, Zhou Ze sensed a slight chill.\n\nHe wasn't afraid of the cold, but the stark difference in temperature between the bedroom and the outside still caught his attention.\n\nHe glanced up at the air conditioner; it wasn't on. So why was it so cold?\n\nOn the bed, Bai Yingying was lying there, covered by a blanket, still squirming nonstop.\n\nZhou Ze was slightly displeased. How many times had he told her not to get on the bed before showering? It was a sign of disrespect to the bed. Of course, the most important reason was that Boss Zhou was a clean freak.\n\nHe didn't care how pretty or beautiful you were; if you dared get on his bed without showering, sorry, he would kick you right off.\n\n\"Ahem...\"\n\nHe stood by the bed and coughed.\n\nNormally, Bai Yingying would probably have been scared into jumping up and admitting her mistake, promising she would never dare to do it again.\n\nBut this time, Bai Yingying actually remained on the bed, not moving.\n\nNo, she did move.\n\nShe used her legs to flip up, clamping the blanket between them. A soft \"ying ying ying\" sound came from under the covers.\n\nYing ying ying... ying ying ying...\n\nSometimes melodious, sometimes gentle, sometimes passionate, sometimes deep.\n\nHe yanked open the blanket.\n\nBai Yingying turned on her side and looked at Zhou Ze. Her eyes were as seductive as silk, her hair was disheveled, her face was flushed, and her red lips framed pearly teeth. She was truly a sight to evoke pity and desire.\n\nIt made one want to spur their horse into a gallop, to gallop until they returned wrapped in a horse's hide.\n\n\"Did you wet the bed?\"\n\nZhou Ze asked.\n\nThe atmosphere killer,\n\nthe destroyer of all things sweet and innocent,\n\nthe man who should be sent to the stake—Ze,\n\nwas once again demonstrating why he was still a single dog at thirty in his past life.\n\nBai Yingying bit her finger, slowly curling her body, then sat up. She placed her hands on Zhou Ze's shoulders and whined coquettishly:\n\n\"Boss... I want... ying ying ying...\"\n\nZhou Ze chuckled.\n\nIt was a helpless chuckle.\n\nHe first looked down at the blanket he had just yanked off and thrown onto the floor, which was now stiff enough to be used as a cutting board.\n\nThen he looked between Bai Yingying's legs.\n\nYou want it,\n\nbut I don't dare to give it.\n\nThis is the body of a normal person. If I really gave it to you, I'd have to go to the hospital tomorrow to see Doctor Lin for amputation due to frostbite.\n\n\"That milk tea, did you drink it?\"\n\nZhou Ze suddenly thought of something and asked.\n\n\"Milk tea... what milk tea... ying ying ying... I want it, Boss... ying ying ying...\"\n\nAs she spoke,\n\nBai Yingying leaped.\n\nHer physical prowess was not something a Zhou Ze without his powers activated could resist. He was directly tackled to the floor.\n\nA dull \"thud\" echoed from the floorboards.\n\nDownstairs, Xu Qinglang raised his head and looked up, a hint of loneliness and sorrow in his eyes. He poured himself another glass of red wine.\n\nThe Old Daoist, who was playing cards with the monkey, also looked up, glancing at the ceiling in confusion.\n\n\"Boss, I really like the way you smell. I really, really like it, oh, ying ying ying...\"\n\nBai Yingying transformed into a domineering female CEO, pinning Zhou Ze down, undressing him while simultaneously flirting.\n\nA look of helplessness appeared on Zhou Ze's face.\n\n\"Yingying, get off.\"\n\n\"Boss, give it to me...\"\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze.\n\nThis wasn't a question of giving or not giving,\n\nnor was it a question of getting hard or not getting hard.\n\nWhether you've got a Water Curtain Cave or an ice cavern down there,\n\ndon't you have a goddamn clue?\n\nAt that moment, Zhou Ze steeled his heart. He had no choice but to. The nail on his right finger grew long. He didn't dare to pierce Bai Yingying, merely using the nail to caress her back.\n\n\"Ahhh!!!!!!!!!!\"\n\nBlack mist began to enter Bai Yingying's body. The stimulation caused her to fall to the floor and start rolling around. Zhou Ze didn't stop, continuing to use his nail.\n\nBai Yingying rolled back and forth, screaming nonstop.\n\nShe was most afraid of the Boss's nail.\n\n...\n\nDownstairs,\n\nXu Qinglang, who was drinking red wine, spat it out with a \"pfft.\" He looked up, somewhat astonished. That intense?\n\nThe Old Daoist was so scared he dropped the cards in his hand. He looked up at the ceiling again.\n\nHoly crap,\n\nthe Boss is going wild?\n\nBoth Old Xu and the Old Daoist felt deeply wounded in that moment.\n\nIt was the sorrow and bitterness of being outmatched in an area where a man can least afford to admit defeat.\n\n...\n\nAfter a long while, Zhou Ze retracted his nail.\n\nLying on the floor, almost completely drained, Bai Yingying's eyes finally regained their clarity. As if she had vented everything, she looked at Zhou Ze in a daze:\n\n\"Boss, what just happened?\"\n\n\"You said your back was a little itchy, so I helped you scratch it.\"\n\n\"Oh, thank you, Boss.\"\n\n\"Go downstairs and take a shower,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Okay, Boss.\"\n\nLeaning on the wall, Bai Yingying slowly walked downstairs. As she walked, she swayed from side to side, moving with great difficulty.\n\nShe saw Xu Qinglang and the Old Daoist looking at her with expressions of sympathy.\n\nFrom then on, for a very long time, neither Xu Qinglang nor the Old Daoist ever brought up the matter of getting hard in front of Zhou Ze again.\n\nAccording to the Old Daoist,\n\n\"Can't even boast anymore, really can't. The women I find are pitiful fallen women, but the Boss KO'd a zombie.\"\n\n\"How can you even compare that?\"",

    "content": "The next morning, Zhou Ze sat on the sofa by the bookstore's glass window, reading the *Yangtze Evening Post* as usual.\n\nIn front of him sat a cup of coffee and a small piece of cake.\n\nBoss Zhou's life was just that leisurely, just that good-for-nothing, just that lacking in ambition. He was just coasting, just getting by day by day.\n\nBack then, Xu Qinglang had criticized Zhou Ze, saying there was no future in him coasting along like this. He was too much of a salted fish,¹ completely wasting his rebirth.\n\nMost importantly, he was wasting his \"golden fingernail.\"²\n\nAnd then...\n\nAnd then Xu Qinglang failed to change Boss Zhou's decadent ways and was instead assimilated by him.\n\nOriginally a second-generation demolition rich³ who, despite owning over twenty properties, still ran his own business operating a noodle shop and hadn't lost his life's ambition,\n\nhe was slowly converted by Boss Zhou,\n\nand also became a salted fish who started using skincare and knew how to maintain himself.\n\nActually, Zhou Ze felt that his current life was quite good. The bookstore had plenty of novels, including many about rebirth. In those stories, the reborn protagonists were all full of deep-seated grievances, either seeking to become kings and conquerors or to look down upon the world with disdain.\n\nWhen the old Daoist had nothing to do, he would also flip through these books and always remarked that the boss was different from the people in them.\n\nBut the old Daoist could rationalize it himself. Books, of course, were fake. Besides, if the protagonists in the books were really like his own boss, just sunbathing and lazing around every day,\n\nwho would read it?\n\nWould readers come just to watch you sunbathe, sunbathe, sunbathe some more, and continue to sunbathe?\n\nThe priest in the Spider-Man costume was cleaning. He cleaned meticulously, not missing a single detail. He always carried out Zhou Ze's instructions without the slightest deviation.\n\nBai Yingying was somewhat relieved that this \"colleague\" was a man, otherwise she'd be facing competition again.\n\nAfter getting over his initial apprehension, the old Daoist had also grown used to the priest's presence. Although he could still smell roasted meat when they first started sleeping in the same room at night, he had gradually gotten used to it.\n\nNow, the old Daoist could finally find some free time. Emulating his boss, he would find a sofa to lie on, sip a little tea, read a little yellow book,⁴ and leisurely enjoy life.\n\nBusiness during the day was always slow.\n\nThere were hardly any customers.\n\nAnd so,\n\nthe bookstore's boss was sunbathing and reading the paper,\n\nthe old Daoist was drinking tea and reading a little yellow book,\n\nXu Qinglang was mixing his new cocktail creation,\n\nBai Yingying was playing *Honor of Kings* on her phone,\n\nthe little monkey, after gorging on the old Daoist's peanuts, was lying there sleeping.\n\nThe entire place, from top to bottom,\n\nexuded the aura of salted fish,\n\ncompletely at odds with the bustling atmosphere of the South Street commercial district outside.\n\nIt wasn't until noon that a customer finally walked in.\n\nXu Qinglang looked up and saw a young man entering. The man was quite tall and looked frail and scholarly, but his face was covered in stubble. It was clear he had been neglecting his appearance due to some recent troubles.\n\nXu Qinglang was very displeased to be disturbed. He glanced back at the \"minimum charge one hundred per person\" sign, wondering if they weren't being ruthless enough.\n\nHow about changing it to \"one thousand\" next time?\n\nOtherwise, these people who think they have a bit of money and want to experience a \"petty bourgeois\" atmosphere would keep coming in and disturbing him.\n\nThis was clearly a business for ghosts, so why were the living always trying to join in on the fun?\n\nSpending a hundred yuan just to sit here, read a book, and drink some instant coffee or milk tea,\n\nare they stupid or something?\n\nThe man pointed to the glass in front of Xu Qinglang and said:\n\n\"A cocktail.\"\n\nThen, the man sat down right in front of Xu Qinglang.\n\nXu Qinglang nodded. Although he felt annoyed at being disturbed, he had come from the food and beverage industry, so he wouldn't go so far as to be rude to a customer.\n\nPresently, a cocktail was quickly mixed and placed before the man.\n\nThe man took a sip and seemed quite satisfied. Then he lay his head on the bar and just looked at Xu Qinglang.\n\nAt first, Xu Qinglang didn't think much of it. But the man just kept lying there, taking a sip of his drink, then continuing to stare at him. Another sip, another stare.\n\nXu Qinglang felt as if he was being treated as a side dish to go with the drink.\n\nThe phrase \"a feast for the eyes\" was mostly a compliment when used for a woman, but Old Xu had always considered himself a man.\n\nOh, no.\n\nHe *was* a man, not that he *considered* himself one.\n\nThis made Old Xu a little uncomfortable. He asked, a bit disgruntled, \"More to drink?\"\n\n\"You're really good-looking.\"\n\nThe man suddenly smiled.\n\nHe had the look of a total pervert.\n\nXu Qinglang took a deep breath and licked his lips. He was planning to hit someone.\n\n\"Hey, you're so pretty, a lot of men must like you, right?\"\n\nthe man asked again.\n\nXu Qinglang rolled up his sleeves, preparing to hit someone.\n\n\"There must be, right? Heh heh, you want to hit me? You think I'm insulting you?\"\n\nThe man raised his head, looked at Xu Qinglang, and then pointed to his own face.\n\n\"Go ahead and hit me. Hit me right here.\"\n\nHe was being so cheap,\n\nthat Xu Qinglang was actually a little embarrassed to hit him. Still, he said in a deep voice:\n\n\"I'm perfectly normal in that department.\"\n\n\"Oh.\"\n\nThe man replied, looking somewhat disappointed. Then he picked up the glass and took another sip.\n\n\"What's up? Someone's taken a liking to you?\"\n\nBoss Zhou, having finished his sunbathing, walked over at this moment.\n\nThe man, as if drunk or perhaps already filled with anger, suddenly smashed the glass in his hand on the floor.\n\nWith a crisp \"smash,\"\n\nthe glass shattered all over the ground.\n\n\"Spider-Man,\" who had been cleaning nearby, stopped what he was doing. He walked over, glanced at the customer, and then at Zhou Ze.\n\nThe meaning was,\n\nshould he kill this person.\n\nA murderous intent was already emanating from Spider-Man.\n\nZhou Ze waved his hand.\n\nSpider-Man immediately retreated and went back to cleaning in another area.\n\n\"Sorry about that. I'll pay for it.\"\n\nThe man took out his wallet.\n\n\"Broken-hearted?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nThe man shook his head. \"Lost my job.\"\n\n\"I understand,\" Zhou Ze shrugged.\n\nThe man looked at Xu Qinglang, paid the money first, and then said, \"Can I get another drink?\"\n\nXu Qinglang nodded and made him another drink. Then he pointedly gestured to the glass and said, \"This glass is a work of art. I bought it for two thousand yuan.\"\n\nThe implication was, if you smash it again, you'll pay two thousand.\n\nThe man was taken aback for a moment, then smiled sheepishly and took a sip.\n\nZhou Ze sat down next to him and said to the man:\n\n\"If you don't mind, you can tell us what's making you unhappy so we can all have a laugh.\"\n\n\"...\" The man.\n\nThe man gave a wry smile and said:\n\n\"I used to be the deputy director of the logistics department at Tongcheng University.\"\n\n\"A director at such a young age,\" the old Daoist chimed in, having also sidled over. \"Your family must have some powerful connections, right?\"\n\n\"...\" The man.\n\n\"Don't mind them, keep going,\" Xu Qinglang urged. \"We haven't gotten to the tragic part yet.\"\n\n\"...\" The man.\n\nThe man nodded and said, \"There was an incident where a stray dog on campus bit someone, so I was held responsible and dismissed. My job before was to handle campus security.\"\n\n\"Then you deserved it. It was your own negligence,\" the old Daoist analyzed from the side.\n\n\"The problem is, last year I was planning to take the security guards and round up all the stray dogs on campus. We did it, too, but we were stopped.\"\n\nThe man took a deep breath and then exhaled heavily.\n\n\"Stopped by your superiors?\"\n\n\"Stopped by the students,\" the man replied.\n\n\"Eh... why would they stop you?\"\n\n\"They said what we were doing was too cruel and heartless. We had contacted the local stray animal shelter, but they were under a lot of pressure and couldn't take in so many stray animals. Our plan was to find homes for as many as we could, and for those we couldn't place or re-home, we'd just kill them.\"\n\n\"Kill them directly? Tsk tsk, how cruel,\" the old Daoist smacked his lips. \"But that's right, too. You can't let students be put in danger on campus, otherwise it would become a huge issue.\"\n\n\"Later, I remember a student wrote an article online exposing what we were doing. It was even picked up by the media. The headline was:\n\n*'A University That Can't Even Tolerate a Stray Dog, How Can It Tolerate a Person?'*\"\n\n\"Tsk tsk, that's a mighty accusation,\" the old Daoist commented.\n\n\"Back then, it was because the students hung banners in protest and obstructed our actions that the whole thing was eventually dropped. We couldn't proceed.\"\n\nThe man wiped his mouth, then moved the glass to the side before daring to slam his hand hard on the table, venting his frustration:\n\n\"The most infuriating thing is, last week, two female students were attacked by a pack of stray dogs on campus at night. Both were bitten and sent to the hospital!\n\nThen the university investigated to assign blame, and it became my responsibility. They fired me outright!\"\n\nThe man slammed his hand on the table again.\n\n\"I can't accept it. I really can't. Back when I was preparing to solve the problem with the security guards, not only did the students at the university curse me out, but a huge crowd of people online cursed me out too. I was even criticized and disciplined because of it.\n\nNow that the stray dogs have bitten people, I'm the one who has to take responsibility. It's become my dereliction of duty again.\"\n\nHearing this, the old Daoist reached out and patted the man's shoulder.\n\nThis guy was truly unlucky.\n\n\"There's nothing to be done about it. Protecting small animals is the 'political correctness' of our time.\"\n\nXu Qinglang pushed a fruit platter in front of the man, as a small comfort.\n\nThe man grumbled and complained for a while longer before dejectedly walking out of the bookstore. Whether he went to a small restaurant to get drunk or went home to sleep, it was impossible to know.\n\nThe old Daoist turned back and said to Xu Qinglang, \"Old Xu, what was that 'correctness' you just mentioned?\"\n\n\"Political correctness.\"\n\n\"Oh, right, that thing. I'm finding that I really hate that term now. My livestream channel was banned several times for that reason. Said I was mocking some group or whatever. It's ridiculous. You can't even speak freely anymore. One careless word and you've hurt someone or other. Why are those people so thin-skinned?\"⁵\n\nThe old Daoist was a livestreamer. Despite his age, he was very trendy.\n\n\"Political correctness is necessary,\" Zhou Ze spoke up. \"It's just that it's becoming more and more distorted and abused nowadays.\n\nWhen society's emotional protection of certain groups surpasses the pursuit of truth, it means there's a problem.\"\n\n\"Right, that's exactly the feeling. Boss, what you said was so insightful, so brilliant. No, I, the old Daoist, must find a pen and paper to write this down, to properly ponder and comprehend it.\"\n\nThe old Daoist knew his job description. Cleaning was secondary; his primary duty was to offer up a \"66666\"⁶ to the boss when needed.\n\n\"Alright, let's not talk about this anymore. What's for lunch?\" Zhou Ze asked Xu Qinglang.\n\n\"Scrambled eggs with chives, stir-fried wood ear mushrooms with chives, stir-fried pork with chives, stir-fried bull pizzle with chives, chive and egg drop soup...\"\n\n\"Hm?\" Zhou Ze.\n\n\"To help you recover. You must have been exhausted last night,\" Xu Qinglang said with a look of concern.\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze.\n\nAh,\n\nafter a long hesitation,\n\nZhou Ze glanced over and saw that Bai Yingying was still focused on playing *Honor of Kings*.\n\nSo, he tactfully,\n\nnodded his head.\n\n————————\n\nBegging for a wave of monthly tickets,⁷ help the Bookstore get back into the top ten on the overall rankings.\n\nDragon is rolling around, begging for monthly tickets,\n\nrolling over here...\n\n...rolling over there...\n\nIn short,\n\nFire the monthly tickets at Dragon!\n\n***\n**Footnotes:**\n1.  **Salted fish (鹹魚, xiányú):** A popular Chinese internet slang for someone who is lazy, unambitious, and has no desire to work hard, much like a salted fish just lying there.\n2.  **Golden fingernail (金手指甲, jīnshǒuzhǐjiǎ):** A pun on \"golden finger\" (金手指, jīnshǒuzhǐ), a common term in web novels for a protagonist's special power or cheat ability.

    "content": "For lunch, Zhou Ze didn't eat much, striking a haughtily reserved pose as if he had no need for extra nourishment.\n\nHe had a little bit to eat, washing it down with some plum juice.\n\nThe old Taoist, however, ate a great deal, eating with a wild abandon, with the gusto of an old general proving he could still eat heartily. More than half of the dishes on the table ended up in the old Taoist's stomach.\n\nBy the afternoon, the old Taoist couldn't stop glancing outside the bookstore. His mind had clearly begun to wander, ready to go out and spread a little love.\n\nIn any case, with Spider-Man now available to handle the bookstore's cleaning, his own workload had indeed become much lighter.\n\nHowever, at three o'clock in the afternoon, Zhou Ze's phone rang.\n\nThe caller ID showed an unknown number. Zhou Ze answered, and a very hoarse voice came from the other end:\n\n\"Save me... save me...\"\n\nZhou Ze tilted his head slightly, holding the phone a little farther away from his ear.\n\nThe static on the other end was really heavy, like a string of small firecrackers going off.\n\n\"Hello?\" Zhou Ze asked again.\n\n\"I'm at General Mountain, save me... save me...\"\n\n*Click!*\n\nZhou Ze hung up the phone directly, tossed it onto the coffee table, and picked up his coffee for another sip.\n\nBeside him, Xu Qinglang looked up at Zhou Ze and asked casually, \"Whose call was that?\"\n\n\"A prank. A call for help.\"\n\n\"What if it's real?\" Xu Qinglang asked with a smile.\n\n\"He said he's at General Mountain, but that's too far. I can't be bothered to go.\"\n\nBoss Zhou was a man who hated trouble. Why run all over the place when he could just sit in the bookstore and wait for business to come to him?\n\nZhou Ze couldn't even be bothered to think about the real reason for this call for help, nor did he have the time to figure out if it was real or fake. He wasn't God, nor was he one of the Powerpuff Girls, zipping off to wherever he was needed.\n\n\"Boss, this humble Taoist would like to go out and buy some daily necessities.\"\n\nThe old Taoist came over to Zhou Ze at that moment to ask for leave.\n\nJust as Zhou Ze was about to nod his approval, his phone rang again. It was the same unknown number.\n\nZhou Ze simply put it on speaker:\n\n\"Hello?\"\n\n\"Save me... save me... I'm at General Mountain... They're going to kill someone... They're going to kill someone... General Mountain... General Mountain...\"\n\nThe voice was much clearer this time, but there was still a lot of static.\n\n\"Save me... save me... I'm at General Mountain... They're going to kill someone... They're about to kill... a child... a woman... They are executioners... executioners...\"\n\nXu Qinglang and the old Taoist looked at each other. If this was a prank, it was possible, but no one usually paid any attention to Zhou Ze's private number. Besides themselves, no one would contact Zhou Ze. Who would be bored enough to set up a prank for him?\n\nThen... what if it was real?\n\nBut how could you explain someone randomly dialing a number and it just happening to be Zhou Ze's? Wouldn't they just dial 110 for help themselves?¹\n\nRight now, neither possibility made much sense.\n\nZhou Ze hung up the phone again and rubbed his temples.\n\n\"What's for dinner tonight?\" Boss Zhou asked.\n\nEvidently, Boss Zhou's trouble-averse personality was still putting up a fight, trying its best to steer clear of this strange phone call. Regardless of whether it was real or fake, he just didn't want to go out. Was that so wrong?\n\n\"Spaghetti,\" said Xu Qinglang.\n\n\"Right, Old Taoist, you just said you wanted to go out for a bit. Go ahead, just remember to be back early.\"\n\n\"You got it.\"\n\nThe old Taoist went out in high spirits, marching out full of vigor and swagger. *This old man will indulge in a youthful folly!*\n\n\"Yingying, go out and buy me an unregistered SIM card,\" Zhou Ze said to Bai Yingying.\n\n\"Okay, Boss.\"\n\nBai Yingying left the shop and returned a short while later. Although the real-name registration for mobile phone cards was strictly enforced in the country, these types of cards, which didn't require an ID, could still be bought everywhere. They were likely registered under a stranger's ID.\n\nAfter swapping the card in, Zhou Ze dialed 110. The operator on the other end quickly answered the emergency hotline.\n\n\"Hello, this is the Tongcheng Police Service Desk...\"\n\n\"I want to report a crime. Someone said there's a murder case at General Mountain. You'd better check it out. I don't know if it's true or not. Okay, that's all.\"\n\n\"Please wait a moment, sir. Did you say General Mountain?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"In that case, would it be convenient for you to provide your contact information and address? We will send someone to get in touch with you.\"\n\nZhou Ze hung up the phone again, then took out the SIM card and swapped his own back in.\n\nAfter changing the card back, Zhou Ze hesitated. \"Something feels off.\"\n\n\"What's off?\" Xu Qinglang asked.\n\n\"I can't put my finger on it, but I just feel like something's not right.\"\n\n...\n\nThere were some clubs on South Street, but they were a bit too expensive and high-end. Although the old Taoist's pockets were reasonably full, he preferred to comfort those older, faded women. Of course, no matter how old and faded they were, they were still around his daughter's age, which was still a bit beastly of him.\n\nBut the ones in the clubs were all of his granddaughter's generation. That would be worse than a beast!\n\nHe took a taxi to Gangzha and, with practiced ease, found a foot massage parlor.\n\nThe rolling shutter door was down, but the old Taoist knew this didn't mean they weren't open for business.\n\nHe smoked a cigarette outside and waited for a while. The shutter was pulled up, and an old man slightly younger than him walked out. The two exchanged a knowing smile.\n\nAh, the camaraderie of \"brothers-in-law.\"²\n\n*Ten years of fate to share a boat, a hundred years to share a pillow, a thousand years to become 'brothers-in-law'.*\n\nThe old Taoist ducked down and went inside.\n\nInside was a woman in her forties with heavy makeup. She said to the old Taoist:\n\n\"Brother, I'm going to take a shower first. You wait a bit, okay?\"\n\n\"Sure, sure.\"\n\nThe old Taoist sat down on the sofa, facing the television.\n\nAs the woman washed herself inside, the old Taoist was already getting worked up outside.\n\nBut then,\na news report on the television made the old Taoist's jaw drop.\n\n\"Our station has the latest news. There has been a new development in the case of the family annihilation at General Mountain that occurred a week ago. The police have locked onto a primary suspect, a young man named 'Ye Qing'.\n\n\"We now broadcast the police's wanted notice. Ye Qing, male, 25 years old, formerly employed at the Tongcheng Waterworks, a friend of the deceased family. He went to General Mountain with the family on the day of the incident.\n\n\"After the incident, Ye Qing's whereabouts have been unknown. Anyone with information is urged to report it to the police. The police are offering a reward...\"\n\nThe old Taoist stared at the television screen, completely stunned.\n\nJust then, the woman came out from her shower. Seeing the old Taoist staring at the news, she clicked her tongue and said:\n\n\"That happened last week. A family of three, all killed. Their heads were cut off, and they still haven't been found. It's really tragic. The husband and wife were both quite young, and the child, I think she was only five, a little girl.\"\n\nThe old Taoist shot to his feet.\n\nDrawing on the experience he'd gained solving cases with his former boss, he keenly sensed that the phone call his boss had received before he left was definitely no ordinary matter!\n\n\"Sis, Big Brother didn't bring his medicine today. I've gotta go.\"\n\nWith that, the old Taoist ran straight out of the foot massage parlor.\n\n...\n\nWhen the old Taoist got back to the bookstore by taxi, he found that Zhou Ze wasn't on the first floor.\n\nSpider-Man sat there, motionless.\n\nXu Qinglang was behind the bar with cucumber slices on his face.\n\n\"Where's the boss?\" the old Taoist asked.\n\nXu Qinglang silently pointed upwards with his hand.\n\nThe old Taoist immediately ran up the stairs and pushed open the door to the boss's bedroom.\n\nIn the bedroom,\nthe boss was lying on the tatami mat, his head resting on Bai Yingying's lap while she massaged his head.\n\nThe boss had a \"I'm so tired, I handle a million things a day, I'm so overworked\" look.\n\nBai Yingying had a \"Boss, you're truly so tired, so overworked, so worn out, I feel just awful for you\" look.\n\nPah,\n\nShameless couple!\n\nThe old Taoist savored the insult in his mind.\n\nThen, he said with righteous indignation:\n\n\"Boss, something's happened.\"\n\nZhou Ze turned his head slightly to look at the old Taoist standing in the doorway. \"What is it?\"\n\n\"Boss, at General Mountain, there was a murder last week. A family of three was killed. Not only has the killer not been found, but even the three victims' heads are still missing.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\nNo wonder the police took his tip-off call so seriously. It all made sense now.\n\n\"Boss, that call you got was very likely a tip from someone in the know,\" the old Taoist reminded him.\n\n\"Mm,\" Zhou Ze grunted again.\n\nThen, he continued to immerse himself in the pleasure of Bai Yingying's perfectly executed massage.\n\n\"...\" The old Taoist was speechless.\n\nHe understood. The boss probably already knew in his heart, but he likely just hated trouble and didn't want to deal with it. The \"trouble\" here probably wasn't just the trouble of investigating the matter, but also the trouble of a Ghost Emissary meddling in the affairs of the living.\n\nThe latter trouble was likely greater, and more sensitive, than the former.\n\nThis left the old Taoist feeling helpless. It was a classic case of the eunuch worrying while the emperor remained calm—the most frustrating situation of all.\n\nJust then, Zhou Ze's phone rang again. It was on the bedside table, charging. Zhou Ze frowned, clearly not wanting to answer, so he didn't ask Bai Yingying to get it for him.\n\nThe old Taoist ran over directly, saw it was the same unknown number, and immediately pressed the answer key.\n\n\"Save me... save us... I'm at General Mountain... They're here... They're here... They're going to kill someone... They're killing...\"\n\nZhou Ze reached up and dug a finger in his ear.\n\n*Can't hear it, can't hear it.*\n*I'm deaf.*\n*I'm deaf.*\n*My hearing's gone bad.*\n\nBut then,\na little girl's painful and tragic scream suddenly erupted from the phone: \"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!!!!\"\n\nZhou Ze's eyes snapped open, his face a mixture of helplessness and conflict.\n\nThe call disconnected from the other end.\n\nThe old Taoist swallowed hard, took out his own phone, walked over to Zhou Ze, and held it up to the boss's face. \"Boss, this is a photo of the victims' daughter.\"\n\nA picture of an innocent-looking five-year-old girl was placed before Zhou Ze's eyes.\n\nZhou Ze glanced at it, then looked away. The old Taoist continued to keep the phone screen aimed at Zhou Ze's eyes.\n\n*Look.*\n*Take a good look.*\n*How can you bear it?*\n*Can you?*\n*Are you even human!*\n*Oh, wait, even a ghost couldn't bear it, right?*\n\n\"Boss, let's investigate. They haven't even found this girl's head,\" the old Taoist urged.\n\nZhou Ze remained silent.\n\n\"Boss, I think the caller is very suspicious. It's like he's right there at the scene.\"\n\nZhou Ze sighed, giving up the struggle. He silently stood up.\n\nHe said to Bai Yingying, \"Find me a set of casual clothes and some sneakers.\"\n\n\"Right away, Boss.\" Bai Yingying immediately got up to find the clothes.\n\nZhou Ze then looked at the old Taoist and chuckled. \"With your level of skill, you're trying to play detective and analyze a case?\"\n\n\"Huh?\" The old Taoist was a little baffled.\n\n\"Who am I?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"A Ghost Emissary, Boss.\"\n\n\"Then what's this call I'm getting from an unknown number?\"\n\n\"It's...\"\n\n\"A ghost call.\"\n\n---\n¹ 110 is the emergency police number in China, equivalent to 911 in the US or 999 in the UK.\n² \"Brothers-in-law\" (連襟) refers to men who have married sisters. Here it's used humorously for two men who frequent the same prostitute.",

    "content": "The person who drove was Xu Qinglang. It was not that Zhou Ze had to be with Xu Qinglang, but because neither he nor the Taoist had any driving certificate.\n\n\n\nTry to think about it, if you and the old Taoist drive out, and meet the traffic police halfway through, and are detained for unauthorized driving, then the lee will be big\n\n\n\nThe old Taoist has tried it once last time. This time, you must be careful\n\n\n\nBai Baobao and Spider stayed in the bookstore to see the store, but Zhou Ze did not let them follow him.\n\n\n\nLocated in Tongcheng's suburbs, bordering the nearby Yangzhou, the car was still quite far away. I set off from the bookstore and didn't delay it along the way. It took about an hour and a half to reach my destination.\n\n\n\nThere are no mountains in the long triangle plain. Even if there are, they are just small hills. They are not worth mentioning in Sichuan and the mountainous areas in the northeast.\n\n\n\nThis is like the southerners who have never seen the snow and it is very exciting to see the snow. If you let people in the plains drive into the mountain road for the first time, it will also be very exciting.\n\n\n\nThe Yangtze River Mountain has only been developed in recent years. Several hot spring mountain banks, which are larger and more upstream, have attracted some passenger flow. Some nearby villagers have also set up small homestays, but it is not time to form a scale.\n\n\n\nXu Qinglang directly opened the car into a store called \"Wen Ya Hot Spring Resort\". He booked a room here. In fact, the murdered family of three also lived here at that time, but they did not die in the head, but on the mountain road down the mountain.\n\n\n\nBut even so, the impact of this incident on this hotel business is extremely terrifying.\n\n\n\nThe most obvious thing is that Xu Qinglang originally booked a small villa with a hot spring pool in the courtyard for 1,500 days. The front desk actually upgraded him to a room with a daily rent of 5,000 yuan from the small courtyard.\n\n\n\nAnd whether the front desk is still welcome, the service attitude is as simple as seeing my parents, and I am so passionate that I can’t be more enthusiastic.\n\n\n\nLater, Zhou Cheng realized that it seems that there are only one of his own customers in the entire hotel now.\n\n\n\nAfter entering the room, Xu Qinglang asked the service student to release water to the hot spring pool. He planned to go and soak it first. Zhou Ze had already said it when he called him out. He was only responsible for starting the car and didn't care about the remaining matters. After all, he was still doing beauty treatment when Zhou Ze called him.\n\n\n\nThe old Taoist was attentive and kept checking case information online. Zhou Ze was sitting on a rattan chair with a cell phone on the coffee table in front of him.\n\n\n\nLet Boss Zhou go and search for traces and spider horses like the police. This is not true, and the police are more proficient in these things than themselves. After all, they are specialized in the art industry. Boss Zhou just needs to be responsible for answering the phone.\n\n\n\nIn fact, Zhou Ze really didn't want to be too busy and didn't want to get into trouble, but the girl's cry on the phone was really too difficult to bear.\n\n\n\nIn addition, since this time it is very likely to be a \"ghost call\", since there is a matter of ghosts involved, it can be legitimate to take action to take care of it yourself.However, after I called several times before, when Zhou Ze arrived at the Rongjun Mountain, he was no longer calm and extremely peaceful.\n\n\n\nXu Qinglang had already entered the pool and started taking a bath. He also added rose essential oil to himself, lay inside and flirted with water splashes, and stretched out his thighs to touch them lightly. This posture really looked like the beautiful scenes in the early years of Hong Kong three-J films.\n\n\n\nHot eyes,\n\n\n\nIt's really too eye-catching.\n\n\n\nIf you don’t know that he is a man, you can still enjoy it.\n\n\n\nBut you know he is a man, you feel very disgusting\n\n\n\n\"Boss, why don't we go to the case to have a look first?\" The old Taoist took the initiative\n\n\n\nZhou Ze really wanted to refuse, but it seemed even more painful to stay in the restaurant and watch the Queen Xu in the yard making a fool. At that moment, he was just a little bit. After saying a word from Xu Qinglang, he left the hotel with the old Taoist.\n\n\n\nOnly one person is left in the room. Xu Qinglang feels even more attentive. Generally speaking, if there is any water in the hot spring pool, it depends on whether you soak in the water and see if there is any white skin on your feet. If it is white skin, it means that the water is not different from the big bathhouse.\n\n\n\nOld Xu Yi was soaking happily, his arms were open, his posture was stretched, and there was a cheap red wine delivered by the hotel. At least, the artistic conception of Xu Qinglang was soaked out.\n\n\n\n\"Dingdong...Dingdong......\"\n\n\n\nThe door sounds up\n\n\n\nXu Qinglang walked out of the pool with some reluctance, put on a bathrobe, and after opening the door, Xu Qinglang saw a serviceman coming with three glasses of milk and some snacks.\n\n\n\n\"Sir, this is what the hotel gives you.\"\n\n\n\n\"Okay, thank you\"\n\n\n\nAfter taking the thing, Xu Qinglang closed the door, put the thing on the coffee table with his hands, then took off his bathrobe and walked back into the pool.\n\n\n\n  Soaking and when he was about to fall asleep, Xu Qinglang suddenly heard the sound of \"cracking\", as if a mouse was biting something\n\n\n\nXu Qinglang initially thought that he had heard it. Maybe he had been in the hot spring for a long time, and the whole person was a little drunk, but this sound continued.\n\n\n\nBack at the head, looking at the living room in the house, Xu Qinglang did not see anyone or rat\n\n\n\n\"Gudu……gudu………gudu……………”\n\n\n\nThe sound is still continuing.\n\n\n\nIn the living room\n\n\n\nPurple his lips, Xu Qinglang walked out of the Chizi again and put on his bathrobe again\n\n\n\nAlthough he is not an ordinary person, he is not afraid of living here, but Zhou Ze is not here at the moment. If he really encounters something, he will still be a little troublesome.\n\n\n\nWhen the family is gone, there is no backbone\n\n\n\nThe living room checked it, and what made Xu Qinglang a little confused was that when he walked into the living room, the sound that had previously heard disappeared again.Xu Qinglang sat down on the living room sandbath, then looked at the coffee table in front of him, which contained snacks and milk just delivered by the service.\n\n\n\nBut there is a big block missing from the snacks\n\n\n\nStealed by a mouse\n\n\n\nXu Qinglang picked up his cell phone silently. He felt that things were a bit strange. Although the family did not die in this hotel, the hotel was still operating normally, how could it be proved that this hotel must be clean.\n\n\n\nBut Wanyi was really something that mice or other animals stole food. He called Zhou Cheng so that he could come back, and would he be laughed at that time.\n\n\n\nXu Qinglang was a little hesitant. He looked behind the sofa and under the coffee table. He hoped to see something like a mouse or squirrel hiding here. He would feel relieved.\n\n\n\nBut, I still couldn't find the trace of the animals\n\n\n\nXu Qinglang walked to the yard outside again. Before he could get off the pool, he stood beside the pool and waited\n\n\n\n\"Click click...\"\n\n\n\nThe chewing sound came up again, and Xu Qinglang's eyes were wandering around the living room. Finally, he determined the source location of the sound\n\n\n\nAt that moment,\n\n\n\nXu Qinglang rushed over directly, opened the teahouse there, but it was still nothing, and the sound disappeared directly, but there was also a small refrigerator here\n\n\n\nIn the refrigerator\n\n\n\nXu Qinglang reached out and slowly grabbed the refrigerator handle, then turned on the refrigerator directly.\n\n\n\nThere was cole and beer in the refrigerator, and nothing else\n\n\n\nChangshu breathed, and Xu Qinglang felt that he was really afraid of seeing something in it. That picture made people feel numb when they thought about it.\n\n\n\n\"The heaven and earth are invincible, the mysterious heart is correct\"\n\n\n\nXu Qinglang pinched his handprints, then took out a heart-protecting lens, placed it directly on the coffee table in the center of the living room, and then sat silently on the sand.\n\n\n\nI won't go to the hot springs anymore.\n\n\n\nI won't go to other places anymore.\n\n\n\nJust sitting here alone, stunned\n\n\n\n\"Tick………Tick………”\n\n\n\nThe living room was constantly urging, but the sound of chewing people that had been constantly squeezing seemed to have never appeared again because Xu Qinglang was sitting here.\n\n\n\nAfter sitting for about half an hour, Xu Qinglang picked up his cell phone again. This time he was ready to call Zhou Cheng and asked when they would come back. It was the evening meal.\n\n\n\nXu Qinglang would not say that he was scared by something that even the hot springs were not comfortable.\n\n\n\nBut I don’t know what, but the phone shows that there is no signal. Why can’t the phone call be called?\n\n\n\nXu Qinglang stood up from the sofa,\n\n\n\n At this point, if he hadn't been able to detect the strange atmosphere, it would have been a waste of time\n\n\n\n\"Dingdong...Dingdong...Dingdong...Dingdong...Dingdong...\"\n\n\n\nThe sound of the door sounds again\n\n\n\nXu Qinglang walked around the gate and opened the door.A female waiter, who was holding an unopened bathrobe in his hand, passed away\n\n\n\n\"This is the new bathrobe you want\"\n\n\n\n  \"what\"\n\n\n\nXu Qinglang was stunned for a moment. When did he want to get a new bathrobe?\n\n\n\n\"It's this room, you need an extra bathrobe.\" The female service member looked at the door sign again, confirmed it, and said, \"It's OK, then I'll leave first, I wish you a happy vacation.\"\n\n\n\nThe female service member closed the door before leaving.\n\n\n\nXu Qinglang walked back with this new bathrobe that had not been opened\n\n\n\n\"Ha-la-la-la-...\"\n\n\n\nThe hot water in the pond is being released again, and it is free to release it without any reason.\n\n\n\nThen, the refrigerator door that I had closed before was opened again\n\n\n\nThere are fewer snacks delivered on the coffee table\n\n\n\nPick up your phone and you'll die, there's still no cell phone number\n\n\n\nSlowly, Xu Qinglang felt that he was about torture. This was not his suspicion. He was not so fragile. This was indeed something strange and incredible was actually happening around him.\n\n\n\nXu Qinglang wanted to wash his face, so he walked to the sanitation room, put the bathrobe around, then lowered his waist to wash his face. When he was about to get his facial cleanser, he suddenly realized that the new bathrobe he had just placed next to the face pool was missing.\n\n\n\nXu Qinglang raised his head and pointed at the lens.\n\n\n\nI found out that it is now in the lens,\n\n\n\n On my own body,\n\n\n\nThree people standing,\n\n\n\nA man, a woman, and a child\n\n\n\nAll three of them were wearing bathrobes.\n\n\n\nHe was moist and pale,\n\n\n\nJust like this, standing straight on his Xu Qinglang's body\n\n\n\nXu Qinglang subconsciously tilted his head, wanting to see more carefully.\n\n\n\nThe family of three in Xiaozi also followed Xu Qinglang's actions together,\n\n\n\n\"Plop\"\n\n\n\n\"Plop\"\n\n\n\n\"Plop\"\n\n\n\nThree sounds,\n\n\n\nFamily of three,\n\n\n\nThree heads,\n\n\n\nFall together",

    "content": "If this situation is an ordinary person, if you want to be shocked, you will start yelling and hysterical;\n\n\n\nFortunately, Xu Qinglang himself is a metaphysicist. Although he only knows a little bit of fur, he will not be scared by this so-called \"dirty thing\".\n\n\n\nHe was just a little helpless. But the old man was actually taking a hot spring bath. As a result, Boss Zhou, who came out to find you, didn't meet you. I was actually waiting for you here and came to the door.\n\n\n\nXu Qinglang silently calmed his mind. He knew that ordinary ghosts could only find loopholes in your heart to make it difficult for you. As long as you can avoid panic, you can greatly restrain the impact of ghosts on yourself.\n\n\n\nBut what made Xu Qinglang a little strange was that the family didn't seem to be thinking about it. They began to squat on the ground, fumbled on the floor of the sanitation with both hands, as if looking for something\n\n\n\nI didn't figure it out at first, but soon Xu Qinglang figured it out. They were looking for it-\n\n\n\nYes, at first they had a head, but now they are gone. They are looking for a head\n\n\n\nThe news report also said that the police discovered their corpse, but the head of their family of three has not been found yet.\n\n\n\nThe ancients said that all the things must be buried in the soil. Even the ancient Taishu would let the teacher return to the teacher to bury his treasures together, so don't say it's a human being.\n\n\n\nWhile they were groping on the ground, Xu Qinglang walked out of the sanitation room with his hands and feet, and returned to the living room.\n\n\n\n A smoke, the previous tightness was gone, or maybe, the unknown is the most terrifying thing. The previous tension brought by the strange movements is actually from the unknown. Now, after knowing who is making trouble, I have fallen into a lot of my heart.\n\n\n\n  A glanced at the phone again and found that I still had no signal and had no way to contact Zhou Ze directly. Xu Qinglang sighed and curled up his legs and turned on the TV.\n\n\n\nThe TV is just a few channels, and the animation \"The Bear Is Not a Comedy\" is playing\n\n\n\nXu Qinglang looked at him, but he didn't run out of the house and ran away in panic. He knew that Zhou Ze was looking for them. In addition, at present, the family was actually the victim. Their greater thought was to look for their own heads, and they would not have too strong offensiveness and resentment.\n\n\n\n\"The Bears Are Not Away\" has been released, and \"Detective Conan\" will be played next\n\n\n\nXu Qinglang snaked his eyebrows and changed the channel. When he looked at Conan at this time, he always felt strange.\n\n\n\nBut what's more coincidental is that after changing a local station, it was broadcasting the incident in the Junshan Gate, the police's investigation of the suspect and the head of the deceased.\n\n\n\nThis makes me even more panicked.\n\n\n\nThe ghost of the deceased family of three is in this room, and there is a live broadcast that is more realistic than this oneXu Qinglang subconsciously wanted to change the station again.\n\n\n\nBut he suddenly realized that the family of three had actually crawled in front of the TV and stopped, as if they were also reading the news.\n\n\n\nHe hesitated for a while, but he still stopped cutting the table\n\n\n\n …………\n\n\n\nBy the time Zhou Ze and the old Taoist came back, Xu Qinglang was already lying on the living room and fell asleep\n\n\n\n\"Yeah, this posture is so sarcastic.\"\n\n\n\nThe old Taoist walked forward and wanted to slap Xu Qinglang's thigh to wake him up, but thought about it and let it go. He was afraid that he would play with him. The old Taoist paid great attention to his name and had been \"knowing hard\" for seventy years, but he didn't want to go astray in the end.\n\n\n\n\"Hey, wake up,\" Zhou Ze shouted\n\n\n\nBut Zhou Ze was a little surprised and slept so hard\n\n\n\nAt that time, Zhou Ze approached Xu Qinglang two steps and found that there was a faint black fog covering Xu Qinglang's eyebrows, which was being raped.\n\n\n\n  Stretching out his nails, Zhou Ze used his index finger nail to click Xu Qinglang’s eyebrows. Xu Qinglang’s eyebrows were pierced, and a few drops of black blood were flowed out. Then he slowly opened his eyes and stretched out his waist.\n\n\n\n\"There is something wrong with this room,\" Zhou Ze said with a look around\n\n\n\nXu Qinglang just now clearly showed that he was being penetrated by the evil spirit, but Xu Qinglang was not an ordinary person, which is enough to show that there was something very evil in this room that had been stuck in this room.\n\n\n\n\"I saw that family, right in this room.\"\n\n\n\nXu Qinglang opened his mouth\n\n\n\n\"What?\" The old Taoist was startled and hurried to the boss's side, making preparations for protection\n\n\n\nThe old man said that he wanted to come to investigate the case and claim revenge for the family of three. He was also the one who was scared of this. He was the one who belonged to Mr. Ye Haolong.\n\n\n\n\"That family of three is here.\" Zhou Ze was a little puzzled, \"It shouldn't be. I asked the front desk before. The family of three lived in another house, not ours, and that house is now temporarily suspended for rent. He said that he was preparing for the clothes and other voices and asked the monks and Taoists to come and do a Taoist priest to make a Taoist ritual.\"\n\n\n\n\"The goods are real, the family of three crawled in this room, looking for a head,\" Xu Qinglang affirmed, \"I just fell asleep.\"\n\n\n\n\"Yes,\" the old Taoist should be merciful\n\n\n\n\"That should be because I have been together with them for a long time, and my body was invaded by evil spirits.\" Xu Qinglang slammed his brain. Obviously, he is still a little confused now.\n\n\n\nIn Chinese medicine, there is a saying that evil enters the body and causes colds to become hot. So Qinglang is almost the same now, and there is a serious cold strife.\n\n\n\n\"But what happened to me that family of three is not doing to me. They are looking for their own heads. If they find it, they will not be able to make a decision if they don't have it.\" Xu Qinglang guessed\n\n\n\n\"But the problem is that I didn't feel a little different when I entered this house for the first time before and now I'm the second time now.\"Zhou Ze said with some confusion, \"If the soul of the three of that family is really staying here, I will never fail to see it. At least, I will never be able to see it even if I can see it.\"\n\n\n\nAs a ghost, if you can't tell whether there are ghosts in a room or not, you can really retire.\n\n\n\n\"But I must have seen them,\" Xu Qinglang affirmed. As soon as he thought about it, he mocked himself: \"Maybe, I have some talents that I may not have discovered myself.\"\n\n\n\n\"This is impossible\"\n\n\n\nThe old Taoist curled his lips, looking at Xu Qinglang and beautiful, and said directly: \"Boss, I think it's okay that we can see but we can't see it. In fact, the reason is very simple\n\n\n\nThere must be something. Maybe we didn’t do it after doing it, so the conditions for touching are different, so naturally the things we see are different.\"\n\n\n\n\"So, what's the matter with him that we didn't do it,\" Zhou Ze asked\n\n\n\n\"Skin care, BB cream, facial mask...\" The old Taoist pinched his fingers\n\n\n\nActually, Xu Qinglang has more makeup than white jeans. Of course, female jeans are an exception. She is young and always 16 years old, and she doesn't need makeup to whiten or whiten.\n\n\n\nSpeaking,\n\n\n\nThe old Taoist seemed to remember something.\n\n\n\nThen he pointed to the hot spring pool in the yard outside the house and said:\n\n\n\n\"He was the only one who took a hot spring bath, and we didn't even take a bath.\"\n\n\n\n …………………\n\n\n\nThe old Taoist first took off his clothes and got out of the pool. The water in the pool was still warm. The old Taoist put some hot water and lay there.\n\n\n\nBeautiful is very beautiful\n\n\n\nBut when Xu Qinglang came to soak, the old Taoist became a little jealous\n\n\n\nYes, if it was a woman, he would not be jealous, but the other party was a man\n\n\n\nThe broken skin, the tender and long legs, the hazy face under the water, the old man subconsciously covered a certain position with a bath towel.\n\n\n\nThen lower his head and silently recite the only Taoist thoughts he will do\n\n\n\nFinished,\n\n\n\nFinished,\n\n\n\nThis is the greatest success in the future.\n\n\n\nLooking at Empress Xu's skin and figure, then looking at her thin figure, her protruding ribs, and her skin like the old elm skin, the old Taoist silently felt a sound of aging for a year.\n\n\n\nIf you think about the pilgrimage when you first became a monk, who wouldn't praise the pretty Taoist priest?\n\n\n\n  Asia Yuyue, a pig knife, a pig knife, a pig knife\n\n\n\nOld Xu is also a little embarrassed. He is not very accustomed to take a bath with others. In fact, many people are like this. Similar to the bathhouses of boys in college, there are also many boys who are so shy that they have to wear inside to take a bath.\n\n\n\nWhen Zhou Ze walked over there, the old Taoist and Xu Qinglang looked at the side togetherThe old Taoist thought to himself, just like the boss, I guess I have a lot of red meat on my body. Even if the boss is not fat, I usually eat less and have less chewy hair. After removing my clothes, I guess I am not good enough for myself.\n\n\n\nBut when Zhou Ze passed by, Lao Dao and Xu Qinglang both ate\n\n\n\nOnly the few days on Zhou Cheng's body, the scars that were not yet fit were clearly visible, adding a kind of smell of the male protagonist in the war film. At the same time, the muscles were clearly horny. He was not the kind of fitness muscular man, but the strength and elegance that he showed after removing his clothes also blinded the golden dog eyes of the two people in the hot spring pool at this time.\n\n\n\n\"It's unfair\"\n\n\n\nThe old man is a little silly, looking at the newspaper all day long and then lying on the maid's lap and humming, how is the man so good?\n\n\n\nIn fact, Zhou Ze knew the reason. Every time he opened, his body quality would be improved, and he didn't need to do anything to fight.\n\n\n\nAll three of them sat in the pool.\n\n\n\nThe old Taoist started pouring rose essential oil into it, sprinkled petals, and then took a bath towel to scrub himself.\n\n\n\nThe heat in the hot spring pool also slowly rose.\n\n\n\nThe videos are slowly beginning to become blurred\n\n\n\n\"You poured too much essential oil,\" Xu Qinglang said dissatisfiedly\n\n\n\n\"It's free anyway, it's not wasteful.\" The old Taoist said disdainfully\n\n\n\nThen, the old Taoist who was scrubbing suddenly realized that a leg was rubbing gently in his calf position, and the legs were very smooth and tender.\n\n\n\nBeautiful legs\n\n\n\nIt must be true, the boss has a lot of muscles on his legs, not this touch\n\n\n\n  hey-hey, \n\n\n\n  well,\n\n\n\n  hey-hey,\n\n\n\n  well,\n\n\n\nThe old Taoist was full of troubles in his heart. He really didn't want to change, but at this time, he couldn't help but feel distracted.\n\n\n\nThe legs began to penetrate deeper again.\n\n\n\n  oh,\n\n\n\n  oh,\n\n\n\nOh oh oh,\n\n\n\nThe old Taoist subconsciously took a breath of breath,\n\n\n\nThe sound of the sound has changed\n\n\n\nAt this moment, the old Taoist felt a little confused and said to himself, \"No, no, I can't suck, I can't suck.\"\n\n\n\n\"Old, what do you mean? Can you take a good bath?\" the old Taoist shouted to Xu Qinglang.\n\n\n\n\"Are you sick?\" Xu Qinglang replied lazyly\n\n\n\n\"Then what are you doing when you flirt with me? If you have the ability, go flirt with the boss. I'm not good at this.\"\n\n\n\n\"…………” Zhou Cheng\n\n\n\n\"Who has flirted with you\"\n\n\n\n\"Hey, I don't agree yet\"\n\n\n\nThe old Taoist reached out and put his hand into the pool, grabbed the leg, pulled the leg up, and then stood up as he himself\n\n\n\nI'll let you not accept it.\n\n\n\nLet you not accept it\n\n\n\n\"Haha, I've caught it\"\n\n\n\nThe old Taoist stood up and found that the boss and Xu Qinglang looked at him in a daze. This time he saw clearly. Xu Qinglang sat on the other side of the pool, and was separated from him by the boss. His legs could not be that long.\n\n\n\nThe old Taoist swallowed,\n\n\n\n  On the top,\n\n\n\nSee the part I was holding in my hands,\n\n\n\n Thighs………",

    "content": "A human thigh, just like that, was in the old Daoist's hand. When he looked down at it, he was so scared he even forgot to drop it.\n\nJust then, Zhou Ze and Xu Qinglang got out of the pool. The two of them quickly changed their clothes in the living room.\n\nOnly after they left did the old Daoist come to his senses. He hurriedly threw the thigh away and scrambled out of the hot spring pool as if fleeing for his life. He wanted to get dressed, but seeing the Boss and Xu Qinglang open the door and prepare to leave, he just grabbed a bathrobe, wrapped it around himself, and followed them out of the hotel.\n\nThe old Daoist was not Xu Qinglang, after all. He didn't have the guts to stay alone in a haunted house.\n\nThe layout of this resort was vast, resembling a villa complex. The landscaping was also very well done. Normally, after checking in at the front desk, a concierge would drive guests to their chosen villa in an electric tour cart. If you wanted to go dine or leave the premises, you could also call the front desk to arrange a pickup.\n\n\"Looks like it's going to rain, doesn't it?\" The old Daoist looked up at the sky. Dark clouds pressed down from above, looking like a thunderstorm was about to break.\n\nZhou Ze didn't answer and continued walking forward. Xu Qinglang followed behind Zhou Ze, his expression grave.\n\nThey had experienced the incident at Three Villages and were not unfamiliar with this kind of situation. As for the old Daoist, due to his tenacious life force, he hadn't been able to enter Three Villages last time and still hadn't quite caught on to what was happening.\n\nAfter walking for about five minutes, they reached the reception building ahead. The restaurant, which served breakfast, lunch, and dinner, was in the area to the left of the first floor.\n\nWhen the three of them walked into the building, they noticed many people dressed in bathrobes like the old Daoist coming in from outside and heading directly into the restaurant to eat.\n\n\"Well, well, looks like this is how rich people enjoy themselves. Eating out in a bathrobe really adds some flavor.\"\n\nThe old Daoist was a little embarrassed at first, but now, seeing that everyone was doing it, he relaxed.\n\nZhou Ze walked toward the reception desk first and found that the staff there were all gone. Except for the restaurant, the other areas were completely empty, without a single person in sight.\n\nIn the end, Zhou Ze had no choice but to enter the restaurant.\n\n\"Hello, sirs. Please show me your room key card.\" There were, however, uniformed waiters here.\n\nXu Qinglang handed over the key card. The waiter swiped it, verified the room type and the number of diners permitted, and nodded.\n\n\"Enjoy your meal.\"\n\nWith that, the three of them walked inside.\n\nThere were quite a few people inside. It was a buffet. Zhou Ze and Xu Qinglang found a place to sit.\n\n\"Boss, how about I go get something to tide us over?\" the old Daoist suggested.\n\nZhou Ze looked at the old Daoist, then pointed to a person nearby.\n\nThe old Daoist followed his gaze and saw a pretty young woman sitting there eating. She wasn't bad-looking at all.\n\nThe young woman lifted the glass of milk in front of her and took a sip. Then, with a \"plop,\" one of her eyeballs actually fell out and plopped right into the glass of milk.\n\nThe old Daoist subconsciously swallowed.\n\nThen, the young woman reached into the milk, stirred it around, and finally fished out her eyeball, stuffing it back into its socket.\n\nThe old Daoist swallowed hard twice more.\n\n\"Still hungry?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nThe old Daoist immediately shook his head and sat down obediently next to Zhou Ze.\n\n*So moved,*\n\n*Truly, so deeply moved,*\n\n*For the first time, the Boss didn't deliberately screw me over. He even specifically told me the food here couldn't be eaten!*\n\nPerhaps because he was used to being \"messed with,\" the old Daoist felt even more grateful to Zhou Ze at this moment. He had truly suffered too many losses like this in the past.\n\nIncluding the incident with the steamed buns, which had nearly made him shit half his life away. Though, thinking back, that incident didn't seem to be the Boss's fault.\n\n\"Is there a great ghost here?\" Xu Qinglang asked in a low voice.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. He wasn't sure. The Three Villages incident was due to the influence of that bronze ring. That bronze ring was still on him now. When he was at the bookstore, he usually had Bai Yingying keep it in the bedroom for him, but when he went out, he would definitely carry it with him, just in case he needed it—purely a matter of luck.\n\nAs for the Yin-Yang Register, Zhou Ze couldn't possibly carry it with him. What if they ran into a child or something and it vibrated a few times? Should he go save them or not?\n\n\"Let's just observe for now.\"\n\nZhou Ze reached up and gently touched his face. It was covered in a layer of sweat.\n\n\"The humidity here is insane,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nXu Qinglang nodded. \"I feel it too. It's like we're still soaking in the hot spring.\"\n\nThe old Daoist could only listen from the side, his eyes darting around. He saw a young man at the opposite table eating noodles while chewing on his own fingers, treating them like cloves of garlic and savoring them with relish.\n\nHe saw the chef over there, when cooking rice noodles, sticking his own arm into the pot to stir. When it was done, he scooped it out directly with his hands, unafraid even though his arm had been boiled bright red.\n\n*Good heavens...*\n\nThe old Daoist watched for a bit, then didn't dare to look anymore. He lowered his head, pretending to be deep in thought.\n\nHe wasn't particularly panicked or scared. After all, the Boss was right beside him. If the sky fell, there was someone tall to hold it up.\n\nIn truth, since ancient times, a place with many ghosts often implies one of two possibilities.\n\nOne is the presence of a great ghost, like a Ghost King, who would naturally gather some mountain sprites, wild monsters, and lonely spirits under his command—for instance, the former Lady Bai, or the Old Black Mountain Demon from *A Chinese Ghost Story*.\n\nThe other possibility is the influence of a special magical artifact, like the bronze ring that created the situation at Three Villages last time.\n\nIf it was merely the influence of a magical artifact, the problem would be smaller, since an artifact has no likes or dislikes, nor any intelligence. But if this General's Mountain was the domain of some Ghost King, the problem would be much bigger.\n\nIt wasn't that Zhou Ze was afraid of angering the Ghost King, but he didn't want any extra trouble.\n\nHe had come here because of that \"ghost call.\" He only wanted to complete his original plan. Of course, if he could collect all the ghosts here, that would be for the best. The newly-confirmed Boss Zhou's performance record was quite pitiful at the moment.\n\n\"That family of three is here,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nAt the entrance, the family of three walked over. They sat down at the table next to Zhou Ze's group. The daughter sat in her seat while the father and mother went to get food.\n\nThen,\n\nthe father and mother brought back a lot of food.\n\nThe family of three sat in their chairs, ramrod straight, facing the food on the table, completely motionless.\n\nThey had no heads, so naturally, they couldn't eat.\n\n\"Is it them?\" Zhou Ze looked at Xu Qinglang.\n\n\"Yes, it's them,\" Xu Qinglang confirmed with a nod.\n\nUnderstanding, Zhou Ze stood up and walked over, taking a seat in the empty chair next to the father.\n\n\"Can you speak?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nThe family of three remained silent.\n\n\"I'm here to help you. You can tell me who killed you. You're looking for your heads, right? I can help you.\"\n\nZhou Ze explained.\n\nThe family of three still remained silent.\n\nZhou Ze pointed at the little girl.\n\n\"She was so young, her life had just begun, and she was murdered. As parents, aren't you furious?\"\n\nJust then,\n\nthe wife's arm rose. She dipped her finger into the soup in front of her and began to write on the table with the liquid.\n\nZhou Ze watched carefully,\n\nand then his expression changed.\n\nNot because the woman had written something shocking,\n\nbut because she didn't seem to realize she still had a vegetable leaf stuck between her fingers. As she wrote a word, the leaf swept back and forth across it.\n\nZhou Ze couldn't understand a single thing she was writing!\n\nBut the woman continued to write earnestly. She wanted to avenge her daughter, but the more earnestly she wrote, the more frustrated Zhou Ze became. He couldn't read it.\n\n\"The words are smudged. Take the vegetable leaf off,\" Zhou Ze reminded her.\n\nAt that moment,\n\na few waiters from the service counter up front shouted, \"Meal service is over!\"\n\n*Rustle...*\n\nEveryone who was dining stood up at once. Even Zhou Ze and the old Daoist stood up with the crowd. Then everyone in the restaurant, including the chefs and waiters, began to line up and walk toward the exit. Everything was orderly, as if it had been rehearsed countless times.\n\nThe family of three did the same, getting up and heading for the exit.\n\nZhou Ze reached out to grab the husband's wrist, but the husband passed right through him. Zhou Ze grew out his fingernails, but he still couldn't grab them.\n\nAt this, Zhou Ze became furious. The nails on all ten of his fingers grew long, and black mist instantly spread from him.\n\nHe was ready to make a scene,\n\ndone playing charades with them.\n\nHowever, his nails, which had previously been infallible against spiritual bodies, seemed to have lost all their effect. The people around him continued on their way, completely unaffected.\n\nZhou Ze frowned slightly.\n\n*They...*\n\n*aren't ghosts?*\n\n*If they're not ghosts, not souls, then what are they?*\n\nSoon, everyone had left the restaurant, leaving only Zhou Ze, the old Daoist, and Xu Qinglang.\n\n\"Boss, what happened just now?\" the old Daoist came over and asked. He had seen the Boss strike a pose and thought he was about to flip the tables, but who would have thought it would be all thunder and no rain?\n\n\"These things aren't wandering souls,\" Zhou Ze said with certainty.\n\n\"If they're not wandering souls, then what are they?\" The old Daoist was baffled.\n\n\"Perhaps it's something like a magnetic field,\" Xu Qinglang speculated. \"There might be some mineral deposits in General's Mountain, causing the magnetic field here to change. It's like how lightning can sometimes record images from long ago. Every place has ghosts, but so many here is clearly impossible. Perhaps this supernatural phenomenon has recorded the traces of all ghost activities over many years, which is why it gives us the illusion that there are many ghosts here?\"\n\nJust then, Zhou Ze's phone rang. He answered it. It was the same unknown number.\n\nThis time, the voice on the other end was incredibly clear:\n\n\"Save me... save me... I'm at General's Mountain... save me... save me...\"\n\n\"We're at General's Mountain too! Where the hell are you!\" the old Daoist roared into the phone.\n\n\"They're coming... they're coming... they're here... ah...\"\n\nA scream came from the phone.\n\nThen there was a burst of static.\n\nAnother baffling ghost call with no valuable information.\n\nHowever, just as Zhou Ze was about to hang up,\n\nanother voice suddenly came from the other end:\n\n\"Amitabha!\"\n\n\"It's a bald donkey!\"¹ the old Daoist exclaimed excitedly. \"A bald donkey! There's a bald donkey causing trouble here! This humble Daoist has finally discovered the truth!\"\n\nZhou Ze frowned and exchanged a look with Xu Qinglang. Zhou Ze asked, \"That voice just now, did it sound familiar?\"\n\nXu Qinglang also nodded. \"It did sound a bit familiar.\"\n\nThen,\n\na second sentence came from the phone:\n\n\"Amitabha, I've finally found you, hehehe!\"\n\n***\n*Footnotes:*\n¹ \"Bald donkey\" (秃驴, tūlǘ) is a common, derogatory slang term for a Buddhist monk, often used by characters like this Daoist priest to show rivalry or disdain.",

    "content": "\"Amitābha, this poor Taoist has finally found you, hehehe!\"\n\nWhen this sentence played from the phone,\n\nZhou Ze and Xu Qinglang both turned their gazes to the old Taoist beside them.\n\nThe expression on the old Taoist’s face was a rich tapestry of shock, terror, hesitation, and helplessness.\n\nYes,\n\nZhou Ze and Xu Qinglang had said before that the voice sounded a bit familiar.\n\nNow, it was proven that it was, in fact, the old Taoist's voice.\n\nIt was only because a voice transmitted through a phone is inevitably a little distorted, and because Zhou Ze and Xu Qinglang hadn't considered the possibility of the old Taoist's voice being in there, that they had been caught by the blind spot right under their noses.\n\nBut following \"Amitābha\" with \"this poor Taoist\" was the old Taoist's common verbal tic, and the \"hehehe\" that came after it perfectly captured his shameless demeanor.\n\nThe old Taoist was a Taoist priest. He might even forget his own real name sometimes. He was called Lu Fangweng. The ancient poet Lu You also went by the sobriquet \"Fangweng,\" but despite sharing a name with the great ancient poet, the old Taoist’s way of doing things was far more unreliable.\n\nDabbling in shady dealings, roaming the land, a hard-knock life spanning decades—he had done almost everything. He always considered himself a Taoist priest, yet he lacked even a shred of a Taoist’s integrity. Aside from the inexhaustible supply of ancestral paper talismans hidden in his crotch that still had some effect, you could hardly find a second characteristic on him that marked him as a Taoist.\n\nEven his usual phrase, \"Wuliang Tianzun,\"¹ he often misspoke as \"Amitābha.\"\n\nSeeing that the Boss and Xu Qinglang were both staring at him,\n\nThe old Taoist gave an awkward smile,\n\npointed a finger at his own face, and said:\n\n\"You can't possibly think this poor Taoist is the mastermind, can you?\"\n\nAlright,\n\nGenerally speaking,\n\nIn a suspense drama, the character at the beginning with the least presence, the most unlikely suspect, often steps into the spotlight at the end, rips off their mask, and gives everyone a surprise—they were the killer all along. And those who are loud and suspicious from the start often turn out to be innocent.\n\nBut when it came to the old Taoist,\n\nHim, the mastermind?\n\nHim, standing in the shadows, orchestrating all of this?\n\nXu Qinglang and Zhou Ze both shook their heads slightly. \"Let's just get out of here first.\"\n\n\"Yeah, right.\"\n\nThe two turned and walked out of the restaurant.\n\nThe old Taoist had been nervous at first, afraid his boss and the others would misunderstand something. But seeing that the Boss and Old Xu had immediately dismissed any suspicion of him, the old Taoist suddenly felt a little let down.\n\nThis feeling of being \"trusted\" wasn't as pleasant as one might think.\n\n\"Boss, why don't you reconsider just a little bit…\"\n\nZhou Ze and Xu Qinglang continued walking without looking back.\n\n\"Even just pretending would be nice…\"\n\nThe old Taoist felt a bit helpless and could only follow them out.\n\nFrom the restaurant, all the way back to the rented villa, they didn't see a single other person on the road. The three of them returned to the side of the hot spring pool.\n\nZhou Ze stepped into the hot spring first, buried his face in the water, and when he lifted his head again, he wiped the water from his face. The dark clouds and the oppressive atmosphere in the sky had vanished.\n\nIt seemed he was right. The entrance was, in fact, this hot spring.\n\nThe old Taoist and Xu Qinglang had also returned. Everyone's clothes were soaking wet. Clearly, the space they had been in wasn't a completely independent place, but a supernatural \"environment\" built upon the real world.\n\nFor example, when they were lying in the hot spring earlier, Zhou Ze and the others were naked. It was only after the old Taoist pulled a human leg from the pool that they scrambled out, got dressed, and left the room.\n\nAnd now, the clothes were still on all three of them, with the old Taoist still wrapped in a bathrobe.\n\nThe hot spring pool was a bit like a hypnotic pendulum, allowing you to see a few more things, but in reality, you might just be seeing \"hallucinations\" while your body is still walking around in the real world.\n\nSometimes, Zhou Ze couldn't help but wonder about the many madmen in this world who liked to spout nonsense and were seen by those around them as classic cases of \"something wrong with their head, mentally unstable.\" Could it mean that they were genuinely able to see a \"world\" that, while based in reality, was completely invisible to ordinary people?\n\nOf course, this was like how among the many reports of natural and accidental deaths filed each year in countries around the world, many murder cases are actually hidden, never discovered or investigated. The specific details of such situations are truly unknowable.\n\nXu Qinglang took off his clothes, changed into a bathrobe, and then walked over to Zhou Ze, gesturing for him to take off his wet clothes as well. He then hung both their sets of clothes on a rack outside to dry.\n\nZhou Ze sat on the living room sofa, toying with the phone in his hand.\n\nThe old Taoist, sitting nearby, used a kettle to boil water and make tea, proactively handing a cup to Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze took the teacup, swirled it, and said, \"Old Xu, have you ever seen a movie called *The Shining*?\"\n\n\"That horror film?\" Xu Qinglang asked.\n\n\"Yeah. I feel like the situation we're in now is somewhat similar to *The Shining*. A reality and an illusion that are hard to tell apart, plus that scene of all the guests who died here and nearby dining together—it's very much like that photograph in *The Shining*.\"\n\n\"So, what's your point?\" Xu Qinglang took a sip of tea. \"Got a big appetite?\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. \"I don't feel like dealing with this place's secrets for now. It's right here anyway, there will be plenty of opportunities later. To be honest, I've almost forgotten why we came here in the first place.\n\n\"Forget it, let's just find the killer of that family of three before we talk about anything else. The key is that ghost call; we have to figure it out, otherwise I just can't feel at ease.\"\n\nSpeaking of the ghost call, Zhou Ze looked at the old Taoist again. How did the old Taoist's voice end up on the phone?\n\nCould it be that the person on the phone was a voice mimic? Able to imitate the old Taoist's voice and way of speaking?\n\n*Ding dong... ding dong...*\n\nSomeone was ringing the doorbell outside.\n\nThe old Taoist got up to open the door. A hotel attendant was standing outside. He asked with some concern, \"Hello, I just wanted to ask if you need any assistance?\"\n\n\"Assistance?\" The old Taoist was baffled.\n\n\"It's like this: earlier, I saw the three of you wandering around the restaurant talking. I called out to you, but you didn't respond, so I came over specifically to ask. If you're hungry and would like to dine, we can start a little earlier, since there aren't many guests checked in right now.\"\n\n\"No need, thank you,\" the old Taoist refused.\n\n\"Alright then, I won't disturb your rest.\" The attendant nodded with a smile.\n\nThe old Taoist closed the door, then called out to Zhou Ze and the others inside, \"Boss, the hotel attendant came to see if we were all sleepwalking, haha.\"\n\n\"Next time, let's not all go in together. We should leave at least one or two people behind to keep watch,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nXu Qinglang nodded. \"I look terrible right now. I'm going to wash my face and do some skincare. We'll figure out our next move tonight.\"\n\n\"Okay, let's rest for now,\" Zhou Ze agreed.\n\nThen, Zhou Ze got up from the living room and walked over to the hot spring pool. He pointed at it. \"Old Taoist, you found a human leg in here at the beginning, right?\"\n\n\"That's right. A woman's leg, I think. If it were a man's, it probably would have to be...\" the old Taoist said, casting a furtive glance toward the inside of the house.\n\nHe had, after all, genuinely made a mistake at first, thinking it was Old Xu trying to flirt with him.\n\n\"Drain the pool,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nThe old Taoist nodded. The hot spring pool had cooled down by now. Though the water was still warm, there was no longer any steam. The old Taoist went in barefoot, pulled the plug, and the water began to slowly drain away.\n\n\"The leg... it was probably real.\"\n\nZhou Ze lit a cigarette and said quietly:\n\n\"This whole thing seems a bit bigger than we thought. That family of three was just a trigger. Their heads were cut off, and yet there was once a leg in this hot spring pool.\"\n\nHe blew out a smoke ring.\n\n\"The reason this hot spring hotel could stay open after the incident with the family of three was that they died on their way down the mountain after checking out, not in an accident at the hotel.\n\n\"But it seems that's not the case. Old Xu said before that the family of three was fumbling around their hotel room looking for their missing heads. Now it seems someone dismembered a body here sometime in the past and left a leg, and even though the leg is gone now, the fact that we could see it in that state means it was once here.\"\n\n\"Boss, are you suspecting that the killer is one of the hotel's internal staff?\"\n\n\"It's not just that.\" Zhou Ze flicked his cigarette ash. \"I'm even starting to wonder if this is a hot spring resort, or a slaughterhouse.\"\n\nAs he spoke, Zhou Ze willed the fingernails on his left hand to grow long. A ball of black mist immediately condensed in his palm. Then, Zhou Ze plunged his nails into the edge of the hot spring pool.\n\nThis was Zhou Ze's old method for finding nearby lingering souls. He was just trying it now since he had no other leads.\n\nHe hadn't expected much,\n\nbut as soon as he tried, he discovered there really were black footprints here.\n\nA set of footprints led from the side of the hot spring pool all the way into the living room.\n\n*There really is something?*\n\nZhou Ze looked up and followed the trail of footprints.\n\nThe footprints took a turn in the living room and went straight into the bathroom.\n\nAt that moment, Xu Qinglang was in the bathroom washing his face with cleanser. He was now facing the mirror, applying skincare products to his face, carefully smoothing them in.\n\nAnd the footprints,\n\nafter reaching the bathroom washstand, began to travel upward. The thing must have climbed onto the washstand.\n\nAfter climbing onto the washstand,\n\nwhere did it go next?\n\nZhou Ze reached out and patted Xu Qinglang on the shoulder.\n\n\"What?\" Xu Qinglang asked, continuing to pat his face while looking in the mirror.\n\nZhou Ze lightly scraped the surface of the mirror with his fingernail.\n\nXu Qinglang stopped patting his face.\n\nBut his reflection in the mirror,\n\nwas still earnestly and meticulously patting its face,\n\nwith no intention of stopping at all.\n\n*Pat, pat, pat...*\n\n***\n**Footnotes:**\n¹ Wuliang Tianzun (無量天尊): A common Taoist honorific phrase, roughly meaning \"Immeasurable Heavenly Lord,\" used similarly to how \"Praise the Lord\" or \"Amen\" might be used.

    "content": "So, when you have nothing to do, don't always look in the mirror carelessly;\n\nThis habit is really bad.\n\nBecause you don't know,\n\nIf the person in the mirror is really your reflection, merely mechanically following your every move;\n\nOr,\n\nIf he's just treating you like a fool, playing with you, and secretly, silently gloating and snickering behind your back when he sees you still haven't discovered his existence.\n\nThe one in the mirror stopped patting his face after about seven or eight seconds. He stood in the mirror, at first, still wanting to continue pretending to be Xu Qinglang.\n\nBut then he thought,\n\nLooking at Zhou Ze and Xu Qinglang's current expressions, he also knew that it seemed a bit pointless to keep pretending.\n\nBefore, he was treating others like fools, applying skincare products with a man, *pa-pa* patting his face, finding it very amusing. But now, if he kept pretending, he'd be treating himself like a fool.\n\nHe silently retreated, his figure drawing further and further away, and growing smaller and smaller. He wanted to leave here.\n\nZhou Ze believed that even when police academies taught methods for apprehending and pursuing criminals, they certainly wouldn't teach how to catch a criminal who had hidden inside a mirror.\n\nBut now, he had this very problem.\n\nFirstly, smashing the mirror was impossible; the person inside probably wished he would do that. But what about getting into the mirror?\n\nZhou Ze reached out and tried; his hand couldn't penetrate. Obviously, this attempt also failed. Of course, Zhou Ze hadn't held much hope to begin with.\n\nIf just anyone could easily pass through a mirror, then the number of children who accidentally fell into mirrors and went missing each year would definitely be far greater than those who drowned swimming in rivers.\n\nThat *bī*¹ in the mirror ran further and further away, growing smaller and smaller. He even turned back with interest and made a \"throat-slitting\" gesture at Zhou Ze and the others. He was truly arrogant.\n\n\"Heavenly Apex, Boundless Void, Profound Heart Righteous Method!\"\n\nXu Qinglang formed a hand seal with both hands, and a protective heart mirror was slapped directly onto the mirror surface by him.\n\nIt must be said, whether in the action of forming the hand seal or the posture of taking out the protective heart mirror, Old Xu was perfect, exuding an air of mystique and gravitas typical of a metaphysics practitioner. But after the protective heart mirror was stuck on, the person in the mirror merely tilted his head, seemingly still smiling. Clearly, Old Xu's method was ineffective.\n\n\"Old Daoist, crotch!\" Zhou Ze shouted.\n\nOld Daoist subconsciously reached out to touch his crotch,\n\nAnd then,\n\nHe actually pulled out another talisman paper!\n\nMind you, Old Daoist wasn't wearing his daoist robe now, but a bathrobe! This also meant that Old Daoist had transferred the talisman paper over after changing clothes!\n\n\"By the command of the Grand Supreme Elder Lord, quickly as the law decrees! Western Buddha, hear my command!\"\n\nMuttering nonsensical incantations, Old Daoist directly stuck his talisman paper onto the mirror.\n\nThe talisman paper glowed red for a moment, and the image in the mirror twisted. The person inside seemed to let out a slight cry of pain, but he still didn't come out. Moreover, it seemed that due to the stimulation from the talisman paper, he, who originally wanted to stay put and show off, really began to prepare to escape.\n\n\"Anything else?\" Zhou Ze urged Old Daoist.\n\nI refuse to believe it. If ten or eight of these were stuck on the mirror, it'd be strange if that guy inside wasn't forced out.\n\nOld Daoist reached in and rummaged around again, then opened his hand. In his palm, besides a few black, curly hairs,\n\nThere was nothing else.\n\n\"Nope, Boss, I only brought one today.\"\n\nAt this moment, the person in the mirror was just a small black dot, almost disappearing.\n\nZhou Ze closed his eyes, spread his hands open, and his nails grew out completely. Layers of black mist began to rise from his palms. For Zhou Ze, there was only one method left to try now.\n\nFacing something irrational, it seemed one had to try an irrational method.\n\nWith Old Daoist and Xu Qinglang looking on as if he were an idiot, Zhou Ze clasped his hands in front of him and began to take a tug-of-war stance.\n\nIn fact, Zhou Ze himself hadn't grabbed anything, but he kept pulling backward, as if he really had something in his hands, and he was pulling quite strenuously.\n\nDid he have to be so exaggerated?\n\nDid he have to be so imaginative?\n\nOld Daoist's mouth twitched. He really wanted to tell his boss that this method was even less reliable, but soon Old Daoist's lips stiffened, because he saw that the guy in the mirror, who had originally been just a dot, was actually slowly moving back.\n\nOh my goodness!\n\nHe was actually pulled back by the boss!\n\nOld Daoist suddenly felt he couldn't understand this world anymore. This works too?\n\n\"Help me!\" Zhou Ze shouted.\n\nHelp you?\n\nXu Qinglang and Old Daoist were stunned for a moment, then also joined in, pretending to help Zhou Ze pull. Xu Qinglang felt like the ministers in 'The Emperor's New Clothes,' doing something very foolish. But the crucial point was that as he and Old Daoist joined in, the guy in the mirror actually started receding faster!\n\n\"If you believe in your heart that you can pull him back, then you can pull him back. He's in the mirror, but in reality, he's more in our eyes,\" Zhou Ze uttered a very philosophical statement.\n\nThe mirror's function is to reflect light, acting merely as a medium. Rather than saying there's something in the mirror, it's more accurate to say there's something in our eyes.\n\nOf course, this involves many philosophical arguments, and to delve into them would be too troublesome.\n\nAs they pulled and pulled, the person in the mirror slowly returned to the same size as Xu Qinglang when he had just applied the skincare product.\n\nHe's about to be pulled out,\n\nHe's about to come out,\n\nPull hard!\n\nA little harder!\n\nHe's almost out!\n\nOld Daoist cheered from the side, shouting work songs. Vaguely, he seemed to return to his days as a porter on the docks. But when he shouted his work songs, it sounded more like three grown men acting as midwives.\n\nFinally, a corner of the thing's clothes in the mirror was revealed.\n\nBut then,\n\nA crisp \"bang\" was heard, and this mirror actually shattered directly.\n\nThen a black shadow was seen drilling out from inside. Perhaps Zhou Ze and the others were too engrossed, as all three actually fell backward together, as if the rope in a tug-of-war competition had suddenly broken.\n\nThis made Zhou Ze somewhat exasperated. When he quickly stood up and realized he needed to grab the black shadow, he found that he had already lost the initiative.\n\nZhou Ze's nails merely hooked onto the opponent. After hearing a miserable shriek emanate from within the black shadow, the black shadow actually shrank again, breaking free from Zhou Ze's grasp.\n\nIt then drilled into another glass door in the bathroom.\n\nThis time, however, he seemed unable to fully drill inside; a part of him remained outside, like a blood leeches. This might have been due to his injury, affecting his performance.\n\nZhou Ze directly swept his nails across, and the glass door shattered instantly. The black shadow let out another miserable shriek, then fled again, like a wild rabbit, very fast.\n\n\"Don't let him escape! He can only hide inside reflective objects. You go look for him, I'll trap him first!\"\n\nZhou Ze plunged the nails of both hands into the ground simultaneously. Black qi instantly spread out, completely enveloping the entire small villa. Zhou Ze had done this before when facing the water python's attack, but that time was for self-preservation; this time, it was an active containment.\n\nMeanwhile, Old Daoist and Xu Qinglang rushed out of the bathroom and began searching for reflective objects to see if that thing was hidden inside.\n\nThe beginning of the matter was unbelievable, but the process of it was even more jaw-dropping. As for it directly turning into a game of hide-and-seek now, that was something no one had expected.\n\nActually, in the final analysis, it was because Old Daoist and Xu Qinglang were living people. Living people in this world abide by birth, aging, sickness, and death; they operate by science, reason, and discernible laws. Therefore, their perspectives were sometimes not as expansive as Zhou Ze's.\n\nFor someone who had been to Hell, nothing was unacceptable, and nothing was impossible.\n\nThe search process was troublesome and cumbersome, because there were too many reflective objects here. Checking them one by one, and also guarding against the opponent changing location—even though Zhou Ze had already confined the area to this small villa, truly pinpointing that thing was not a simple task.\n\nOld Daoist searched around, found nothing, and had no leads. He felt like he was going crazy, his mind filled with glass, wishing he could turn into glass himself.\n\nXu Qinglang searched around too, and found nothing. They also felt embarrassed to ask Zhou Ze if he had truly trapped that thing. What if the thing wasn't in the villa and had already escaped?\n\n\"Right, the hot spring!\"\n\nOld Daoist ran to the edge of the hot spring. The water in the hot spring pool had been drained, but there were still several puddles of accumulated water, which could also reflect light and serve as mirrors!\n\nOld Daoist jumped into the hot spring basin, searching puddle by puddle, but still found nothing.\n\nFeeling somewhat drained, Old Daoist simply sat down at the bottom of the hot spring basin.\n\nCan't find it,\n\nThat thing can drill into mirrors; Heaven knows where else he ran off to. Amitabha, Immeasurable Heavenly Venerable, merciful Lord, please manifest your divine power and let this poor Daoist find him.\n\nZhou Ze in the bathroom was about to collapse, constantly shouting from inside the bathroom, asking if they had found it.\n\nThis put even more pressure on Old Daoist.\n\nDamn it, if only I could call the police to help find him, Old Daoist mused wildly to himself. Then he suddenly froze, and pulled his phone out of his pocket.\n\nA phone screen is also a mirror, it can also reflect light!\n\nAnd it had been on him all along, the easiest \"lamp-under-black\"² scenario!\n\nOld Daoist immediately pressed the phone screen, and the screen lit up. Originally, Old Daoist's screensaver was the classic photo of Marilyn Monroe's skirt blowing up. But now, a patch of black shadow appeared under Marilyn Monroe's skirt on the screen, like a layer of mosaic had been applied, and it was still wriggling.\n\nOld Daoist was so happy that a bubble even appeared from his nose.\n\nLooking very excited,\n\nHe immediately reached out to grab that \"mosaic,\" muttering excitedly:\n\n\"Amitabha, this poor Daoist has finally found you, hehehe!\"\n\n---\n¹ *bī (逼)*: A colloquial, somewhat vulgar Chinese term, often used to refer to someone acting arrogantly or annoyingly, similar to \"jerk\" or \"asshole.\" Here, it adds to the character's audaciousness.\n² *lamp-under-black (燈下黑)*: A Chinese idiom meaning that the most obvious place or person is often overlooked, similar to \"the darkest place is under the lamp.\"",

    "content": "\"Amitabha, this poor Daoist has finally found you, hehehe!\"\n\nAfter saying this, the Old Daoist began to rub his hand vigorously across the screen. This thing had been injured by Boss Zhou before, and now even though it had slipped into the mirror, it wasn't as nimble as it used to be. The Boss had previously been able to shatter the mirror and force it out, and the Old Daoist figured he could do it too.\n\nBut as he was rubbing, the Old Daoist suddenly froze. He replayed what he had just said in his mind, and suddenly a chill ran down his back. He subconsciously swallowed.\n\n*No way...*\n\n*This has to be a coincidence.*\n\n*Yes, it's just because I heard those words from the phone earlier, so they left an impression in my mind, and I just blurted them out.*\n\n*Yes.*\n\n*That must be it.*\n\nThere was another possibility, but the Old Daoist didn't dare to think about it. He truly didn't dare.\n\nAs he rubbed and rubbed, a layer of something resembling the grimy black sludge on a person who hasn't bathed in ages began to roll up. The Old Daoist pinched it between two fingers and then yanked it outward with all his might.\n\n\"I found it!\"\n\nAt the same time, having recovered from his shock, the Old Daoist finally remembered to call for help.\n\nXu Qinglang immediately ran over. Seeing the Old Daoist pulling something out of the phone, he instantly understood and stood guard nearby, terrified the thing would escape again.\n\nZhou Ze finally pulled his fingernails out of the ground and let out a long sigh. He used to read those cultivation novels and watch TV dramas where people would raise a hand and turn their enemies to ash, causing mountains to crumble and rivers to flow backward. Masters of the Dou Zong rank were truly terrifying...¹\n\nBut when it was his turn, he realized the gap between fantasy and reality was vast indeed. Just this short while had already made his back a little sore from the effort.\n\nThe Old Daoist pulled the thing out, pressing it tightly between his hands. In truth, you couldn't feel its presence; his hands were even clamped perfectly together, as if there was nothing inside at all.\n\nBut there was definitely a sensation stimulating you—a wet, slippery, slightly cold feeling that constantly told you that there was, in fact, something in your palms.\n\n\"Boss, for you!\"\n\nSeeing Zhou Ze approach, the Old Daoist immediately got up and handed this hot potato to him.\n\nZhou Ze reached out and took it. It was like a black ball—no, now it resembled a black rag. But to be safe, Zhou Ze directly pierced his fingernail through its center, like skewering a kebab. This thing was simply too good at running and hiding.\n\nIt seemed that any soul-like entity was suppressed by Zhou Ze's fingernails. After being skewered by him, the creature began to \"spin\" and \"leap\" nonstop.\n\nIt appeared to be in great agony.\n\n\"What are you...\"\n\nBefore Zhou Ze could even finish his first question,\n\nthere was a sound like a balloon popping.\n\nThe black thing impaled on his fingertip actually exploded, turning into wisps of faint smoke.\n\n\"...\" The Old Daoist.\n\n\"...\" Xu Qinglang.\n\nThe Old Daoist had a million \"FMLs\" he didn't know if he should say, but a strong desire for survival made him swallow his words. The Old Daoist had already achieved a deep understanding of the Way of Following Your Gut. He immediately said:\n\n\"Boss, this fellow had a stiff backbone. It would rather die than submit.\"\n\nHe wasn't about to blame Zhou Ze for playing with it until it broke, meaning all their hard work had been for nothing, without a single question being answered.\n\nXu Qinglang took a deep breath. He wanted to curse someone out, but he couldn't be bothered anymore.\n\n\"My bad.\" Zhou Ze was a bit embarrassed. Everyone had spent so much energy catching this thing, only for it to be lost in his hands. \"I didn't expect it to be so fragile.\"\n\nThe three returned to the living room. The atmosphere was a bit heavy. They had thought a turning point had appeared, a breakthrough seemed imminent, but with that one little:\n\n\"Pop.\"\n\nThe whole affair was back to square one.\n\n\"Boss, at least we've confirmed one thing: there's definitely something fishy about this hotel!\"\n\nThe Old Daoist said this with great earnestness and solemnity, not at all feeling like he had just stated the obvious.\n\n\"Should we rest now, or go for another soak in the bath?\" Xu Qinglang asked.\n\n\"Let's rest first. It's almost eight now. We'll go for another soak around one or two in the morning,\" Zhou Ze said, checking the time.\n\nThe three didn't go back to their rooms to rest, instead making do on the sofa and tatami mat in the living room. Actually, Zhou Ze wanted to go back to his room to sleep, but Xu Qinglang and the Old Daoist were clearly unwilling. The Old Daoist was shamelessly brazen as always and insisted on sticking with the boss. Although Xu Qinglang said he didn't want to, his body was very honest.\n\nNext to Zhou Ze, if anything happened, at least there was someone who could take it head-on. If he were alone, he would often panic and fumble.\n\nThe Old Daoist didn't mention the matter of his earlier words, because he felt it was probably a coincidence, and he was a little uneasy about it.\n\nAround eleven o'clock, the Old Daoist was woken up by his bladder. He didn't dare go to the bathroom. For one, the bathroom had been genuinely haunted today, and the Old Daoist was terrified that while he was relieving himself, that family of three would suddenly appear on the floor looking for their heads. That would scare him into impotence.\n\nFor two, far too many horror stories and movies featured accidents happening during a piss or a crap. To go off alone knowing there was danger nearby, insisting on some sort of decorum at a critical moment, often ended up getting yourself killed.\n\nSo, the Old Daoist simply reached out, grabbed an empty mineral water bottle from the coffee table, and prepared to take care of business right there in the living room.\n\nJust as the Old Daoist undid his belt and prepared to turn on the faucet, he saw Zhou Ze, on the sofa opposite him, watching him with open eyes.\n\nThe Old Daoist froze in fright, saying sheepishly, \"Boss, you're awake?\"\n\n\"I can't sleep,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nIt then dawned on the Old Daoist. Right, the Boss couldn't even sleep at night without Bai Yingying. How could he have forgotten?\n\nZhou Ze got up, lit a cigarette, and walked to the front of the living room, directly facing the bathroom. He pointed inside and said, \"I'll watch. You can go in and relieve yourself.\"\n\nMoved.\n\nIncredibly moved.\n\nA hundred, a thousand, ten thousand times moved!\n\nThe Old Daoist almost shed tears. The Boss had changed, he had really changed. He had become considerate of his subordinates, caring toward a lonely old man.\n\nAlthough it seemed a bit late to learn these things after living two lives, but... it was worth it!\n\nThe Boss was actually willing to watch over him while he took a piss at night!\n\nThe Old Daoist's inner monologue was rich and full. Of course, it was a thoughtless gesture on Zhou Ze's part, but for him, the impact was truly immense.\n\n\"Alright, Boss.\"\n\nThe Old Daoist immediately went into the bathroom.\n\nThe door was left open.\n\nStanding by the toilet, the Old Daoist could see Zhou Ze in the living room, and Zhou Ze could see him. What a sense of security!\n\nThis feeling was amazing!\n\n\"Boss lights the way, to illuminate the ghost's front door, letting the lost little ghost, find its way back home;\n\nBoss lights the way, to illuminate the ghost's whole future, with a little bit of light, to chill the ghost's soul...\"²\n\nThe Old Daoist was in a good mood, even humming a little tune. He unhurriedly took out his own \"faucet,\" found the most comfortable angle, and then began to build up pressure.\n\nWhen you get old,\n\nthe faucet inevitably gets rusty.\n\nSo the singing now was also to alleviate the awkwardness. Otherwise, if he stood by the toilet for a long time and the boss heard no splashing, wouldn't he get curious?\n\nJust then, Zhou Ze's phone rang. He looked down and saw it was that unknown number again.\n\nThe cause of this whole incident was, in fact, this unknown call. It was like a thread, constantly pulling him and the others to this hotel to investigate its affairs.\n\nAnd indeed, there was a problem with the hotel, but the feeling of being constantly led by the nose made Zhou Ze very uncomfortable and he disliked it immensely.\n\nBut regardless, Zhou Ze still answered the phone.\n\nImmediately after,\n\nthe somewhat tired-of-hearing words came from the phone:\n\n\"Save me... save me... I'm at General Mountain... save me... save me... I'm begging you... save me...\"\n\nIt seemed this was his only opening line.\n\nZhou Ze kind of wanted to curse him out. If this guy were in front of him, Zhou Ze would probably walk up and slap him.\n\nSeriously, could he just provide a tiny bit of useful information?\n\n\"I'm at General Mountain,\" Zhou Ze replied wearily.\n\nBut this time, it seemed different.\n\nBecause the voice on the other end of the phone,\n\nsuddenly seemed to understand how to communicate.\n\nHe actually changed his usual Sister Xianglin-style³ speech:\n\n\"Really... you came... you really came... really...\"\n\n\"Yes, I'm here. Where are you? How do I save you?\"\n\nZhou Ze paid a little more attention, a flicker of hope in his heart.\n\n\"Hehe... it's good that you're here... really good... so good... thank you for coming to save me... really... thank you... I'm grateful to you... very, very grateful to you...\"\n\nHe said a whole bunch of thank-yous,\n\nbut still not a single shred of useful information.\n\nZhou Ze interrupted the other party's incessant gratitude and said directly:\n\n\"Tell me something useful, or I'm leaving tomorrow morning.\"\n\n\"Something useful... ah... right... I'm sorry... my brain... has a bit of a problem...\"\n\n*We knew that a long time ago.*\n\n\"Oh... I remember... I remember... how you can save me... oh no... save us...\"\n\n\"Hurry up.\"\n\n\"That is... you take our place... take our place here to accept the punishment and suffering... then we... we can... escape this sea of suffering...\"\n\nZhou Ze's gaze sharpened.\n\nJust then,\n\nthe voice on the phone suddenly sped up:\n\n\"Unexpected, isn't it?\n\nSurprising, isn't it?\n\nHow about,\n\nI start you off with some red wine,\n\nto celebrate?\"\n\nRed wine?\n\nZhou Ze frowned slightly.\n\nAt that very moment,\n\nafter a long period of brewing, the Old Daoist finally released the floodgates,\n\nmaking a \"splish-splash\" sound.\n\nJust as most people's first action after taking a crap is to turn around and look at the poop they produced,\n\nthe Old Daoist also habitually glanced down at himself.\n\nThen the Old Daoist's face changed drastically.\n\nHe discovered that what he was peeing,\n\nwas blood.\n\nBright red blood!\n\n---\n¹ A reference to a popular Chinese web novel, *Battle Through the Heavens* (斗破苍穹). The line has become a meme to sarcastically describe something as overly powerful or dramatic.\n² The Old Daoist is singing a parody of the famous song \"The Stars Light the Way\" (星星點燈). He has replaced \"Stars\" (星星) with \"Boss\" (老闆) and altered the lyrics to be about ghosts.\n³ Sister Xianglin is a tragic character from a short story by Lu Xun, who became an icon in Chinese literature for endlessly and mournfully repeating her sad story to anyone who would listen.

    "content": "Suddenly, the feeling of the earth shaking and the mountains swaying washed over the surroundings. Zhou Ze instinctively lowered his center of gravity to keep from falling.\n\nAnd yet, he saw the old Daoist in the bathroom, still clutching the faucet and screaming.\n\nOn the living room sofa, Xu Qinglang remained in a deep sleep, seemingly completely unaware of anything amiss.\n\nZhou Ze had a sudden realization: it wasn't a real earthquake. It was because all the light and shadows around him had become severely distorted, creating the illusion of violent shaking.\n\nAt that moment, every reflective surface seemed to come alive. They grew active, proactively trying to mislead and influence you.\n\nIt was an utterly bizarre sensation, as if you were being rejected by your entire surroundings. They were no longer lifeless objects by your side, no longer tools for you to use and discard at will. Having gained consciousness, they began to instinctively reject you, to hate you.\n\nZhou Ze opened his mouth, wanting to shout Xu Qinglang awake, but when he called out, Xu Qinglang remained lying on the sofa, fast asleep, as if he hadn't heard a thing.\n\nNo matter how deeply he slept, he couldn't be *that* dead to the world.\n\n\"Old Daoist!\"\n\nZhou Ze called out to the old Daoist again.\n\nThe old Daoist was standing right there in the bathroom, still staring at the faucet and shouting. No matter how many times Zhou Ze called, he didn't turn around.\n\nGradually, Zhou Ze noticed the old Daoist's figure begin to distort. The body of Xu Qinglang, sleeping on the sofa, was twisting as well. It was as if he were in a hall of funhouse mirrors, where all the surrounding light was being bent, delivering an intensely painful visual assault.\n\nTaking a deep breath, Zhou Ze closed his eyes. He wasn't some rookie underworld emissary anymore. In the past half-year, he'd been through his fair share of storms. He knew that in a situation like this, the first thing to do was to find inner calm.\n\n*With a heart as pure as ice, one remains unshaken though the heavens collapse!*\n\nHowever, the moment Zhou Ze closed his eyes, he felt a sudden sense of weightlessness under his feet, as if in the next instant he would plummet into a deep abyss.\n\nIt was a feeling that often occurred during sleep—the sudden illusion of falling, causing your whole body to jolt instinctively as you wake up, only to find it was a false alarm.\n\nBut for Zhou Ze right now, this sensation was prolonged and was only growing more intense.\n\nZhou Ze had no choice but to open his eyes. The instant he did, beams of white light shot out from all around, as blinding as a car suddenly flashing its high beams at you at night.\n\nAfter a moment of dizziness and temporary blindness, Zhou Ze's vision cleared to find himself still standing in the living room.\n\nNothing around him had changed. It was as if everything that had just happened was a dismissible illusion, a fragile mirage. But soon, Zhou Ze realized something was wrong.\n\nThe sofa was still the same sofa, but Xu Qinglang was gone from it.\n\nThe bathroom was still the same bathroom, but the old Daoist who had been pissing blood was gone too.\n\nThe furnishings were all in place, nothing had changed, but... he was the only one left. All alone.\n\nZhou Ze took a deep breath. The lights were on, but they were clearly not bright enough—in fact, they were very, very dim, making everything seem gloomy and indistinct.\n\nHe walked into the bathroom. Through the cracked remnants of the mirror on the wall, Zhou Ze suddenly saw the figures of the old Daoist and Xu Qinglang.\n\nThe old Daoist was leaning against the wall, a look of terror on his face, a pool of blood beneath him. Xu Qinglang was beside him, checking on him and seemingly trying to comfort him.\n\nThey were in the mirror?\n\nZhou Ze was stunned for a moment. Then, he saw Xu Qinglang help the old Daoist out of the bathroom, and they disappeared from his sight.\n\n\"Hey! Can you hear me?\"\n\nZhou Ze shouted, but there was no response. He then backed out of the bathroom and walked into the living room. There was a large picture frame in the living room, holding an oil painting of the Eight Steeds. In its reflection, Zhou Ze saw the old Daoist sitting on the sofa in the living room while Xu Qinglang brought him a glass of water.\n\nNext, Xu Qinglang lit a paper talisman, let the ashes fall into the cup, and handed it to the old Daoist to drink.\n\nThe old Daoist grimaced in pain as he drank the talisman water in one gulp, then began panting heavily.\n\nZhou Ze couldn't hear their voices at all; he could only see their images and actions.\n\nIt wasn't until Zhou Ze saw himself in the reflected scene that his heart sank.\n\nThings…\n\n…had truly taken an unimaginable turn.\n\nThe \"him\" on the sofa was just lying there, motionless.\n\nXu Qinglang and the old Daoist would occasionally cast worried glances at the \"him\" on the sofa. Xu Qinglang even used a wet towel to wipe his face, but \"he\" showed no reaction.\n\n*Huuu…*\n\nHe understood.\n\nIt wasn't that they had somehow entered the mirror.\n\nIn fact,\n\nthe one who had truly entered the mirror…\n\nwas him!\n\nZhou Ze tried to scratch the mirror's surface with his fingernails. He instinctively wanted to break this thing and get out, but his nails, which were usually unstoppable, were now completely useless against this small mirror. It was as solid as diamond, so sturdy it was despair-inducing.\n\nAfter trying for a while, Zhou Ze gave up. He sat down on the sofa.\n\nOnly after settling down did Zhou Ze realize that while the furnishings in the room were indeed the same, the layout was actually reversed. After all, things in a mirror are the opposite of reality.\n\nHe reached out and felt around. His cigarettes were still there. He took one out, put it between his lips, and was surprised to find he could actually light it with a lighter. When he took a drag, it even had the real fragrance of tobacco.\n\nZhou Ze no longer knew what state he was in. His body was still in the real world outside the mirror, but everything here felt so real. It didn't feel like an out-of-body experience.\n\nZhou Ze had experienced being out of his body before; it was a very weak and bewildering feeling. He clearly didn't have that feeling now, which meant he hadn't been pulled in as just a soul.\n\nZhou Ze remembered how in the restaurant that afternoon, his nails had been useless against those \"departed souls.\" Did this mean that he was now in the same state as those \"departed souls\" dining in the restaurant?\n\nNot a soul,\n\nnot a physical body,\n\nsome kind of… bizarre, indescribable state?\n\nThis is…\n\nthe state of being inside a mirror?\n\nThat night, Zhou Ze mostly sat on the sofa, pondering how to get out, how to leave this place. He also tried opening the door to see what was outside, but he found that the main door, as well as the courtyard walls, were blocked by a layer of \"glass.\" He couldn't get out at all and could only move within this confined area.\n\nSo, he spent the night either sitting on the sofa contemplating his life or standing in front of the picture frame, watching the old Daoist and Xu Qinglang anxiously try all sorts of methods to wake him up.\n\nActually, Zhou Ze's biggest worry right now was whether Xu Qinglang and the old Daoist would take his body back to the bookstore in the city the next day.\n\nAlthough Zhou Ze was a very determined person, he really didn't want to be abandoned by his companions like this, even if they had no idea he was actually inside a mirror.\n\nZhou Ze even tried filling the hot spring pool with water and getting in to soak a few times, only to find that even submerging his head in the pool didn't allow him to leave this area. Every possible method Zhou Ze tried, he failed.\n\nIn short, the night was very long, so long that Zhou Ze felt a little suffocated.\n\nWhen a faint glimmer of sunlight shone from outside, Zhou Ze slowly raised his head.\n\nIt's dawn, isn't it?\n\n\"*Crack… crack…*\"\n\nIt sounded like something was breaking. Zhou Ze stood up, walked to the door, and reached out to open it. He found that a piece of the glass outside had shattered, large enough for a person to walk through normally.\n\nIt was like one of those tunnels for children to crawl through at an amusement park. Zhou Ze walked in, forced to follow the single available path forward, because all around him was a thin layer of glass. You could see the people outside, see the scenery outside, but you just couldn't get out.\n\nNo matter how much force you used, you couldn't break the glass in the slightest.\n\nWalking along, Zhou Ze saw a door. The door was open. Zhou Ze walked through it.\n\nAnd then,\n\neverything suddenly opened up.\n\nAfter all, having walked through a narrow glass corridor for over ten minutes, suddenly entering a wide-open area truly gave him the feeling of the fisherman who stumbled into the Peach Blossom Spring.[^1]\n\nHowever, what Zhou Ze had walked into was the restaurant.\n\nA buffet-style layout,\n\na familiar environment,\n\nit was the hotel's restaurant.\n\n\"Sir, your room key, please.\"\n\nA voice sounded beside Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze turned his head to look at her.\n\nIt was a waitress, but her mouth was above her eyes. Her entire facial structure was inverted, giving her a very frightening appearance.\n\nZhou Ze didn't move.\n\nThe waitress reached out and pulled a room key from his body on her own.\n\n\"Hello, I hope you enjoy your meal,\" the waitress said with a smile.\n\nThat smile was the most unsettling smile Zhou Ze had ever seen in his life. Not even Picasso could have painted such an effect.\n\nThere weren't many people in the restaurant, but after Zhou Ze sat down, more and more customers began to come in for breakfast. The scene was identical to yesterday's.\n\nExcept, yesterday Zhou Ze was an observer. This time, he was part of the game.\n\nHe didn't get any food, just sat down in the same spot as yesterday. If this was how things were, Zhou Ze wanted to hold out hope that Xu Qinglang and the old Daoist might also come over through the hot spring pool.\n\nHe didn't have to wait for Xu Qinglang and the old Daoist. Instead, the family of three arrived first. They also sat down in their spot from yesterday. The little girl sat down first, while her parents went to get food.\n\nAnd then,\n\nthe headless family of three stared blankly at the dazzling array of food before them.\n\n\"Hey, hello there. We meet again,\" Zhou Ze said, trying to find some humor in his grim situation.\n\nHowever,\n\nthe family of three, who had been impossible to communicate with before, suddenly turned their bodies in unison to face Zhou Ze.\n\nThey had no heads.\n\nLogically, they shouldn't be able to speak, just as they couldn't eat.\n\nBut they made a sound. A collective sound.\n\nThough it was only a single, simple word:\n\n\"Hi.\"\n\n------\n\nPS: Starting today, this Dragon will be participating in a \"Grassroots Online Writers\" charity event. I'll be going to a poverty-stricken county in the mountains for what will probably be over a week. I will do my best to ensure updates continue.\n\nOf course, if there are any unexpected circumstances that prevent timely updates, I will post a separate chapter to let everyone know in advance.\n\nDon't panic,\n\nHold on tight to this Dragon!\n\n[^1]: A reference to a famous Chinese fable, *The Peach Blossom Spring*, by Tao Yuanming.

    "content": "This \"Hi\" carried with it a tremendous sense of deadpan humor.\n\nPeople often assume that ghosts are filled with immense resentment and a kind of hysterical, deep-seated anguish. This is a common stereotype.\n\nZhou Ze used to think so too, until he became a ghost himself.\n\nHow different are ghosts and humans, really?\n\nWhen it comes to malice,\nHumans know the terror of ghosts, but ghosts know the venom in human hearts.\n\nIn other respects,\nGhosts come from humans. In many ways, both in personality and senses, they are actually deeply relatable to people.\n\nThe only difference, perhaps, is that ghosts, most of the time, have an extreme personality akin to that of a \"desperado\" or \"fugitive.\" They can rarely linger in the mortal realm for long. Even if, by some accident, they don't descend into Hell and the soul reapers haven't found them yet, residing among humans is more like hiding like rats in a sewer.\n\nHumans are afraid of ghosts, but in this world, there are far too many things that can harm and restrain them.\n\nFor example, the crotch of an old Taoist priest's pants.\n\nZhou Ze reached up to touch his head and yawned. The oppressive feeling from the previous night seemed to have dissipated quite a bit. For someone who had already walked the Yellow Springs Road,¹ there was nothing he couldn't let go of.\n\nOf course, he wanted to go back, to return to his body and his original life.\n\nBut since he hadn't found a way yet, there was no need to get too hung up or anxious about it.\n\n\"Now can you tell me who killed you?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nThe family of three was still looking at him.\n\nThen,\n\nSilence.\n\nThe feeling of being \"stared\" at by three headless people was really not good.\n\nEven Boss Zhou felt a little uncomfortable now.\n\n\"Clink...\"\n\nBeside Zhou Ze, the crisp sound of a spoon touching a plate rang out. Zhou Ze turned to see a girl with delicate features sitting next to him, as if preparing to dine.\n\nThe girl turned her head and glanced at Zhou Ze—oh no, she was actually looking at the family of three over there, giving them a slight nod.\n\nWell, then.\n\nZhou Ze felt a bit heartbroken and haggard.\n\nTurns out she was greeting someone over his shoulder, and he'd completely misunderstood. It was, indeed, rather awkward.\n\nThen,\n\nThe family of three sat up straight again, facing the food before them... in a daze.\n\nThe girl, for her part, began to eat in an unhurried manner. She ate with great elegance—not the kind that is prim or excessively demure. In fact, she ate quite quickly, but in a way that revealed a particular sort of temperament.\n\nAnd so, Zhou Ze just sat there, watching the girl eat.\n\nFortunately, the old priest and Old Xu were still frantic over Zhou Ze's unresponsiveness and hadn't thought to cross back over through the hot spring pool to check on him. Otherwise, if they had seen him staring intently at a girl eating as if he hadn't a care in the world, they might have literally worried themselves sick.\n\nThe girl finished her meal, drank the last bit of milk from her glass, wiped her mouth with a napkin, then rose, apparently ready to leave.\n\nZhou Ze also got up and followed her, like a perverted stalker.\n\nIt wasn't that Zhou Ze was taken with her or anything. In this environment and in his current state, Boss Zhou hadn't sunk so low as to throw all caution to the wind. It was because, in his eyes, this girl was very different from everyone else in the restaurant.\n\nThe other diners in the restaurant, although they could eat, their movements felt no different from that of the headless family.\n\nNumb,\n\nDeathly still,\n\nCarrying an air of musty, stagnant tedium.²\n\nBut this girl had an aura of life about her. It seemed that, like him, she possessed a higher degree of... freedom in this environment than the others.\n\nZhou Ze followed her out of the restaurant. To his surprise, he and she were walking down a glass passageway.\n\nIt was like a beehive, intricate and complex inside, with each bee having its own place.\n\nZhou Ze continued to follow behind the girl, the two of them walking slowly, one after the other.\n\nAs they walked, the girl stopped. It seemed she had only just now noticed Zhou Ze.\n\nThe girl turned around and smiled at Zhou Ze, a very innocent smile.\n\n\"Konnichiwa.\" (Hello)\n\nThe girl gave Zhou Ze a slight bow.\n\nA Japanese girl?\n\nZhou Ze’s first thought was of his own resident Spider-Man.\n\n\"Hello.\"\n\nZhou Ze replied.\n\nHe understood simple Japanese like that, but he responded in Chinese.\n\n\"Hello,\" the girl replied, also in Chinese.\n\nAfterward, the girl continued walking forward, and Zhou Ze continued to follow.\n\nThe brief exchange and greeting seemed like a trivial interlude, like a pebble tossed into a calm lake that sends out ripples before quickly returning to peace.\n\nThey walked all the way to the lawn by the room's entrance, where Zhou Ze saw the girl turn in another direction.\n\nSo,\n\nThey were neighbors.\n\nThe layout of this hot spring villa hotel was such that a single villa was divided in two for use, with guests sharing a common wall.\n\nThis explained why the girl and Zhou Ze's \"walking\" routes were the same. But here, they had to part ways. Zhou Ze tried to walk in the girl's direction but was blocked by a thin pane of glass.\n\nGiving up the struggle, Zhou Ze returned to his room.\n\nHe sat down in the living room, lit a cigarette, then stood up again and walked over to the picture frame to take a look. In the mirror, he was still lying on the sofa. The old priest was dozing off beside him, and Xu Qinglang was on the phone nearby, seemingly contacting someone.\n\nZhou Ze guessed he was contacting Bai Yingying at the bookstore, or maybe trying to reach the little loli. After all, his state in the real world—unresponsive no matter how much they called him—was truly baffling and difficult for Old Xu and the others to handle.\n\nThis feeling of being cared for wasn't bad. Of course, the feeling of peeping was also pretty good.\n\nZhou Ze stretched and flicked the ash from his cigarette. Just then, the sound of water filling the hot spring pool came from next door.\n\nThe courtyard was also divided in two, with each side having its own hot spring pool. The sound of the water filling was loud enough for the neighbor to hear.\n\nZhou Ze walked into the courtyard and sat down in a rattan chair.\n\nThere was nothing to be done about it. In the mirror world, you were lonely, like an imprisoned convict who could only go to the cafeteria at designated times along a specific route and then return to your cell.\n\nOf course, he could also peek at what Xu Qinglang and the others were doing in the real world through the mirror, but it wasn't like watching *that* kind of film where you could get by with just visuals and no sound. In this situation, he could only peep without being able to communicate. All he could do was stand by and worry helplessly, which was really boring and only served to make him more and more agitated.\n\nNow that he had a neighbor next door, listening to her movements was quite nice. Of course, if this neighbor had been a big, burly fatty, Zhou Ze probably wouldn't have been interested.\n\nThe water quickly filled up. Zhou Ze heard footsteps and even the rustling sound of clothes being taken off.\n\nOnly being able to hear, not see, was always a bit of a shame. And under the pretext of not missing a single clue, Boss Zhou simply moved the rattan chair to the base of the wall and stood on it.\n\nThe top of the wall was also blocked by a thin layer of glass, preventing you from crossing over, not even by a single step. But it couldn't stop you from looking. This thin layer of glass was more like a light censor mosaic, adding a hazy, blurry beauty to the image. It had more artistic... oh no, I mean research value, than the simple and crude alternative.\n\nZhou Ze held a cigarette in one hand and gripped the wall with the other, peering over.\n\nThe girl had already entered the hot spring pool. Then she began to sing. It was a sentimental Japanese song. Zhou Ze couldn't understand the lyrics, but it sounded quite nice, very pleasant to listen to.\n\nSlowly, Zhou Ze turned around, no longer looking, and leaned his back against the wall.\n\nFor some reason, Zhou Ze heard a sense of loneliness in the girl's song. Not the loneliness of a cheating wife, but the loneliness of being imprisoned here for a long time.\n\nZhou Ze even thought that perhaps the other people in the restaurant had started out just like him—wanting to get out, wanting to question things, wanting to do something—but had slowly been tormented into numbness by this day-in, day-out life of a prisoner, becoming just like that headless family.\n\nWould he,\n\none day, become like that too?\n\n\"Splash...\"\n\nThe girl finished her song and began to bathe, scrubbing herself with a washcloth. Zhou Ze could hear the splashing of water, and even the sound of the girl's breathing.\n\nBecause the distance was so close—both hot spring pools were built right against the wall—the girl and Zhou Ze were truly separated by only a single wall.\n\n\"What's your name?\" Zhou Ze spoke.\n\nA pervert who had just peeped on a girl bathing was now speaking brazenly, asking for her name.\n\n\"Tsukino Saori.\"\n\nThe girl answered.\n\nShe had actually been aware of Zhou Ze's peeping all along.\n\n\"And you?\" the girl asked.\n\n\"Xu Qinglang.\"\n\n\"That's a nice name,\" the girl said.\n\n\"Mm,\" Zhou Ze agreed.\n\n\"Did you die nearby too?\" the girl asked again.\n\n\"Die?\"\n\n\"Yes, die.\"\n\n\"Are you already dead?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Are you not dead yet?\" The girl seemed a little puzzled, then added, \"Or perhaps, Mr. Xu, you just haven't realized that you are, in fact, already dead?\"\n\n\"I died a long, long time ago,\" Zhou Ze replied. \"Can you tell me how you died?\"\n\n\"I'd rather not answer that question,\" the girl refused.\n\n\"But I really want to know. It's not like we have anything else to do right now, is it?\" Zhou Ze tempted.\n\n\"We can bathe,\" the girl said very seriously.\n\n\"Bathe?\"\n\n\"Yes, we can soak in the hot spring every day, bathe, and wash every part of our bodies until they're perfectly clean.\n\nA person should be clean. No matter when, no matter the situation, they must be clean, and they have to be clean.\"\n\nAs a man with a touch of mysophobia, hearing the girl's words, Zhou Ze actually felt a sense of resonance.\n\nThe girl truly stopped chatting with Zhou Ze. She began to diligently scrub her body, washing herself clean.\n\nZhou Ze felt she was washing herself a little too clean. He could clearly hear the sound of the bath towel rubbing hard against her skin. It must... hurt, right?\n\nAfter a moment,\n\nThe girl took the initiative to speak. \"Mr. Xu, could you do me a favor?\"\n\n\"Go on.\"\n\n\"One of my legs,\n\nit's in the pool on your side.\n\nCould you help me wash it,\n\nclean?\"\n\n---\n**Footnotes:**\n1.  **Yellow Springs Road (黃泉路):** In Chinese mythology, this is the path the dead walk to the underworld. The phrase implies he's already faced death.\n2.  **An air of musty, stagnant tedium (老太太裹腳布的氣息):** The literal translation is \"the air of an old lady's foot-binding cloth,\" an idiom used to describe something that is long, tedious, and unpleasant.\n\n---\n**Author's Note:**\nA small earthquake occurred in Sichuan, causing the original route to be impassable, so we have to take a detour. Because of this, Long has spent most of his time on a bus. Today, we visited and paid our respects at two elementary schools in Liangshan, then took a bus from the afternoon until night to get to the hotel. Therefore, this week's updates have to be written in whatever squeezed-out time I can find, as it's really impossible to type on a laptop on bumpy mountain roads.\n\nThis is the first chapter update, there will be a second one later.",

    "content": "The bookstore was as quiet as ever—of course, if the bookstore ever got lively, that would be the real ghost story.\n\nAfter receiving the call from Xu Qinglang, Bai Yingying immediately changed her clothes. As she was locking the shop door to leave, she saw Spider-Man sitting alone inside. She frowned slightly, then unlocked the door, walked back in, and said to the silent figure, \"Hey, the Boss is in trouble. You're coming with me to help him.\"\n\nSpider-Man looked up at Bai Yingying, then silently stood. He only listened to Zhou Ze, but that didn't mean he was completely devoid of intelligence.\n\nLeading him outside, Bai Yingying locked the shop door. Just then, a taxi pulled up. The little loli was sitting in the front passenger seat.\n\nAfter Bai Yingying and Spider-Man got into the back, the driver glanced at his passengers, smiled, and said, \"You guys are… what do you call it? Oh, cosplay enthusiasts, right?\"\n\nBai Yingying didn't answer.\n\nThe little loli didn't answer.\n\nThe Priest was even less likely to answer.\n\nThe driver was mortified.\n\nThen he suddenly felt a chill in the car. He looked down; the air conditioning wasn't on.\n\n\"Let's go, driver. General's Mountain,\" the little loli urged.\n\nShe was in a very bad mood. Zhou Ze was always causing or getting into trouble, and all she wanted was for him to quietly earn his merits and become an Inspector so she could be free.\n\nIn fact, she had always thought of Zhou Ze as a man who knew his own limits.¹ This view hadn't changed, from before he subdued her to after.\n\nBecause he was lazy, as lazy as a salted fish. But how could this particular salted fish get into so much trouble?\n\nFirst, the Yama's credentials, then the Lady in Green, followed by the Yin-Yang Registry, and then the Priest. And now, he'd gone to General's Mountain and gotten himself knocked \"unconscious.\"\n\nThe little loli took a deep breath. Having a constable like him was truly a pain.\n\n\"Is there a way to solve the Boss's problem?\" Bai Yingying asked the little loli.\n\nThe little loli gave a small smile. \"I just got the call. That noodle shop owner is just a hack when it comes to metaphysics. His description isn't likely to provide much valuable information. I have to see the scene for myself to draw any conclusions. But one thing is certain: a man like your boss, who can't even sleep without you and a freezer, wouldn't just fall into a deep, unshakable slumber.\n\nEspecially not with no external injuries.\"\n\nHearing this, Bai Yingying frowned slightly and said, \"No matter what, we have to wake the Boss up.\"\n\n\"I'll do my best,\" the little loli said with a pout.\n\n\"If the Boss doesn't wake up, you'll be buried with him.\"\n\nThe little loli's expression hardened. She said in a low voice, \"Threatening me at a time like this is meaningless.\"\n\nThe driver listened to the little girl and the young woman bickering. Although he couldn't understand what they were talking about, he found it rather interesting. He wanted to chime in, but since he wasn't part of the cosplay scene, it seemed hard to find common ground.\n\nHowever, the driver found his opening. \"Are you all going to General's Mountain for tourism? I heard there was just a murder case there.\"\n\nThe little loli was silent.\n\nBai Yingying was silent.\n\nThe Priest remained silent.\n\nThe driver felt even colder, so cold he almost didn't want to drive anymore, his feet starting to tremble.\n\nThis was only normal. You see, the driver had hit the jackpot today. He'd picked up three passengers: one was an underworld runner, one was a jiangshi, and one was also a corpse. How could he not be freezing?\n\nThe average taxi driver might consider himself unlucky to drive to a funeral home or cemetery at night and see a blurry white shadow in the distance. But this guy had hit the grand slam.\n\nPeak Ghost-Sighting Achievement for a Cabbie: Unlocked!\n\n\"Ah, General's Mountain, it's a great place. Do you know its origins?\" The driver had to keep talking; if he didn't, he'd freeze. He was already huffing warm air into his hands.\n\n\"What origins?\" Bai Yingying asked.\n\nPerhaps because Bai Yingying had initiated the conversation, she subconsciously reined in her malevolent aura. The driver suddenly felt the temperature rise. It wasn't Bai Yingying's fault; she only \"ying-ying-yings\"² for Zhou Ze. When facing others, she was truly ice-cold. And with her boss in trouble, Yingying wasn't in a good mood.\n\n\"Cao Ding, do you know of him?\" the driver asked.\n\n\"Who's that?\" Bai Yingying asked.\n\n\"A famous general who resisted the Wokou pirates. Of course, he can't be compared to Qi Jiguang, but he was still a badass. He was a local from our Tongcheng. During the Jiajing era of the Ming Dynasty, the Wokou were a huge problem, right? Our Tongcheng is at the mouth of the Yangtze River, so we got a lot of them. He led troops and repelled the Wokou several times, but at forty-four, he was killed in battle. A very heroic death.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Bai Yingying nodded.\n\nThe little loli, however, suddenly grew interested. \"What does General's Mountain have to do with Cao Ding?\"\n\n\"It was named after him! There's even a scenic spot on the mountain called Wokou Grave, built to commemorate him. Back then, the Wokou were burning, killing, and looting their way through. Cao Ding defeated them and was pursuing them towards General's Mountain when an accident occurred, and he was killed. The mountain didn't originally have this name, and Cao Ding's rank wasn't that high, but the people of Tongcheng were very grateful to him, so they started calling that mountain General's Mountain, and the name has stuck ever since.\"\n\nThe little loli licked her lips, lost in thought.\n\nAbout an hour later, the car finally arrived at the foot of General's Mountain. The little loli paid and got out first.\n\nWhen Bai Yingying got out, she saw the little loli standing with her hands behind her back, looking up towards the mountaintop like a little adult.\n\n\"See anything?\" Bai Yingying asked.\n\n\"The problem is that I don't see anything at all,\" the little loli said with a frown. \"That's what's so bizarre. Because that Xu guy said they saw ghosts in the hot spring hotel on the summit, and quite a few of them. But this place is completely calm, without the slightest trace of a baleful aura.\n\n\"I think your boss probably had the same question. There are obviously ghosts, yet it's perfectly tranquil.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Didn't you hear what the driver said? This is the place where a heroic soul died. He enjoys generations of incense offerings from the local people. In a place like this, even if evil spirits appear, they would be severely suppressed. Even you and I will be suppressed to some extent.\"\n\n\"Then what about the Boss?\"\n\n\"It probably won't be that bad. Although your boss is a ghost, he's not the kind to be directly targeted. Besides, it's been five hundred years since the Jiajing era. No matter how powerful a heroic soul is, it can't last that long. People are always forgetful.\"\n\n\"Let's go to the hotel and see how the Boss is doing first.\"\n\nBai Yingying started walking up the mountain as soon as she finished speaking.\n\nThe little loli followed behind her.\n\nThe Priest walked at the very end.\n\nHowever, after walking for a bit,\n\nThe Priest suddenly stopped. His originally somewhat stooped body slowly straightened, and a faint green light began to glow from behind the hood covering his eyes.\n\nThe little loli turned her head to look at the Priest, asking with some concern, \"He's not going to lose control, is he?\"\n\nBai Yingying shook her head firmly. \"Impossible. He's not who he used to be. You're not a jiangshi, so you don't understand the feeling we have.\n\n\"I can tell you with absolute certainty that in this life, he will never betray the Boss.\"\n\nThe Priest's gaze scanned the surroundings, as if he were searching for something, or as if something were calling to him.\n\nMeanwhile, Bai Yingying and the little loli sensed nothing at all.\n\n\"Is there something there?\" Bai Yingying asked the Priest.\n\nThe Priest looked bewildered. He spread his hands, as if he didn't know how to describe it. He hadn't spoken a single word since Zhou Ze brought him back to the bookstore.\n\nHis communication with Zhou Ze was simple, but with others, it was very difficult.\n\n\"What is it?\" Bai Yingying pressed.\n\nThe Priest remained茫然, but he still mechanically bent down and picked up two stones, one large and one small.\n\nHe placed the small stone on top of the large one.\n\nThen,\n\nThe Priest reached out and pinched the small stone on top.\n\n*Crack.*\n\nThe small stone instantly crumbled to dust.\n\nThe fragments trickled slowly from the Priest's fingertips.\n\nThen, he looked at Bai Yingying and the little loli, as if to see whether they understood.\n\n\"Oh…\"\n\nThe little loli opened her mouth and made a sound.\n\n\"What does it mean?\" Bai Yingying looked at the little loli.\n\n\"Oh… I didn't get it either,\" said the little loli.\n\n\"...\" Bai Yingying was speechless.\n\nThe Priest reached up and scratched his head,\n\nseemingly trying to figure out how to express himself.\n\n\"Forget it. Let's find your boss first.\"\n\nThe little loli didn't want to waste any more time. She turned and headed up the path. Bai Yingying glanced at the Priest, then followed.\n\nThe Priest dazedly continued to follow them from behind.\n\nThe Priest walked steadily, but each step he took left a footprint behind. At the same time, he unconsciously shook his head, like a bull shooing away a buzzing fly.\n\n…\n\n\"Hey, I've wiped this leg of yours clean. Not bad. I could play with these legs for a year.\"³\n\nZhou Ze held up the girl's leg and waved it towards the wall.\n\nPreviously, the old Taoist had pulled a leg out of the water while in the hot spring illusion. It was, in fact, the very same leg Zhou Ze now held.\n\n\"Do you want to play?\" the girl in the next cell asked.\n\n\"Sorry, I was just joking. We're all dead anyway, there's no joke too big to make.\"\n\n\"I'm asking you… do you want to play?\"\n\nThe woman pressed him again.\n\n\"No.\"\n\nZhou Ze looked at the leg in his hand and chose to refuse.\n\nThe very instant Zhou Ze refused,\n\nhot water began to surge into his side of the pool. Not hot spring water, but roiling, boiling blood.\n\nThe blood quickly filled the pool, like a pot of simmering Chengdu hot pot—spicy and scalding.\n\nEven more,\n\nthere were actually things inside, as if they were being cooked, tumbling over and over.\n\nThat was the other leg.\n\nThat was an arm.\n\nThat was a chest.\n\nThat was a neck.\n\nSegment after segment of a dismembered corpse churned endlessly within.\n\nShe was here.\n\nShe had leaped across the glass barrier.\n\nFrom next door, she had come to Zhou Ze's side!\n\nFrom within the blood, her head slowly floated to the surface, her limbs continuing to tumble around her.\n\nAt the same time,\n\nshe spoke:\n\n\"You won't play?\"\n\n***\n\n**Footnotes:**\n\n1.  **knew his own limits:** The original phrase is a modern slang term, `有B数` (yǒu B shù), a pun on the idiom `心里有数` (xīnlǐ yǒu shù), meaning \"to be aware of the situation\" or \"to know one's own place/limits.\" The \"B\" adds a vulgar, emphatic tone.\n2.  **ying-ying-yings:** The original text uses the onomatopoeia `嚶嚶嚶` (yīng yīng yīng), which represents a soft, cute whimper. It's also a pun on Bai Yingying's (白鶯鶯) name. The sentence implies she only shows this soft, vulnerable side to Zhou Ze.\n3.  **I could play with these legs for a year:** This is a direct translation of the Chinese internet slang `腿玩年` (tuǐ wán nián), which is a crude compliment about attractive legs.",

    "content": "\"Not playing?\"\n\nFacing the girl's question,\n\nZhou Ze was a little speechless.\n\nThis sort of thing was a matter of mutual consent, or a clean transaction of money for goods; he'd never heard of a forced sale before.\n\nYou're impressive,\n\nyou can cross boundaries,\n\nyou can come from next door into my courtyard,\n\nbut no matter how impressive you are,\n\nlet's take a million steps back,\n\nin your current shattered state, even if my refusal was just me playing hard to get, I couldn't bring myself to be willing now even if I wanted to.\n\nBoss Zhou rubbed his forehead, feeling a bit pained.\n\nBut the girl was clearly filled with immense rage. At this moment, the bloody water in the hot spring pool actually began to overflow. At the same time, the girl's originally severed body parts slowly began to reassemble themselves.\n\nAlright,\n\nthe body was assembled.\n\nIt could be used now.\n\nWas that the meaning?\n\nWith the lights off, isn't it all the same?\n\nAnd isn't the most common phrase just \"You're on my hair?\"\n\nChinese parents teach their children from a young age that it's wrong to be a picky eater. They should think more about all the peasant uncles in ancient times who toiled in the fields only to end up too poor to marry and die bachelors.\n\nBoss Zhou wanted to follow his heart. If following his heart could resolve the trouble before him, it was best to avoid resorting to violence. After all, from the woman's perspective, she had already been so forward; for a man to hedge for any reason would inevitably earn him contempt.\n\nBut looking at the reassembled girl, the once-severed parts were now joined by distinct, raised, bloody scars, surrounded by a dense web of crimson lines. It was a truly gruesome sight, like a silk scroll embroidered by a brute, giving the distinct impression of a pieced-together doll.\n\nSorry,\n\nI refuse.\n\nZhou Ze stood his ground, watching the girl approach him step by step. The nails on Zhou Ze's hands slowly grew longer.\n\nThen,\n\nthe woman drew near him.\n\nThe surrounding bloody water surged toward Zhou Ze in an instant, like boiling water, a truly grand display of force.\n\nZhou Ze spread his arms, his nails sweeping out to either side. The bloody water split apart at once, and the girl's body was simultaneously sliced in two. The poor girl was like a piece of clay; having just painstakingly reassembled herself, she was ruthlessly torn apart by Zhou Ze's cruel hand.\n\n*I can't do anything about this glass, but you think I can't do anything about you?*\n\nThe two halves of the girl began to squirm, as if about to fuse back together.\n\nWithout wasting words, Zhou Ze's nails sliced down again, like dicing vegetables, splitting the girl apart once more. Adhering to the principle that he wasn't a complete monster, Zhou Ze picked up the two halves of the girl's head and walked straight back into the living room.\n\nPerhaps,\n\nthe girl was also stunned.\n\nSuch a breathtaking entrance, such a sharp declaration,\n\nand in the end,\n\nshe had instead become like a dish that served itself up,\n\nonly to be literally chopped up by Zhou Ze.\n\nThe girl's head was placed on the coffee table by Zhou Ze. He lit a cigarette. To be honest, with Zhou Ze's current power and status, dealing with a minor female ghost could no longer give him the slightest thrill of satisfaction.\n\nBut there were some questions Zhou Ze needed to ask her. Most importantly,\n\nhow was he supposed to get out of this damn mirror world?\n\nAfter being placed together, the two halves of the girl's head began to slowly merge. Outside the living room, her body also began to re-form. The headless body wandered aimlessly outside the living room, as if wanting to come in, yet somewhat hesitant.\n\nOnce the girl's head had been restored, it sat upright on the coffee table, continuing to glare at Zhou Ze. But the fury in her eyes had diminished significantly, replaced by a kind of apprehension.\n\nAs the saying goes, a pitiful person must have a detestable side. The same is true for ghosts.\n\nBoss Zhou had seen his fair share of ghosts and heard all sorts of ghost stories. He had more or less guessed what the girl had gone through before her death.\n\nRaped,\n\ndismembered,\n\nand finally trapped here, becoming a lost soul in a mirror. That should be about right.\n\nHer frantic scrubbing of her own body was an attempt to gain some psychological suggestion and comfort from the act, to make herself feel that her body was still clean.\n\nA pitiable Japanese girl.\n\nThis kind of pity transcends national borders.\n\nBut ghosts are the product of such extremes. In fact, people who are too nonchalant in life don't qualify to linger in the mortal world as ghosts. Those who are lazy bums¹ their whole lives, all \"Buddha-like\"² and serene until they die, are all obediently queuing up on the Road to the Yellow Springs, marching forward.\n\nFrom the perspective of a Ghost Official, ghosts who can linger in the mortal world are basically all troublemakers, the kind of kids in class who disobey and love to talk back to the teacher.\n\nTherefore, when the girl projected her anger onto him, trying to reason with her was useless; she wouldn't listen at all.\n\nThe last time he encountered that avenging sea python, and in many other incidents, Zhou Ze had indeed met many lost souls with grievances and injustices. But if Zhou Ze didn't have his nails, if he weren't a Ghost Official, he probably wouldn't even have the right to pity them. He would have just become another victim of their rage.\n\n\"I didn't let them go. In fact, I don't even know why I was pulled into this place.\"\n\nZhou Ze blew a smoke ring at the girl and continued:\n\n\"I said I could help you get revenge, on the condition that you tell me the secrets of this place, and how to leave this godforsaken hellhole.\"\n\nThe girl continued to look at Zhou Ze with hatred. Zhou Ze paid her no mind and went on smoking.\n\nHe could wait.\n\nAbout a quarter of an hour later, the headless body of the woman outside slowly sat down. She wrapped her arms around her knees, her back against the floor-to-ceiling window outside the living room, looking incredibly lonely and forlorn.\n\nAnd in the girl's eyes, the furious gleam was gone, replaced by a stream of tears.\n\nZhou Ze pulled a tissue from the box on the coffee table and wiped them for her, comforting her at the same time:\n\n\"Don't cry, you won't look pretty if you smudge your face.\n\nI, Xu Qinglang,\n\nwould feel bad.\"\n\nThis is why, when you go out to do unsavory things, it's very necessary to give your good friend's name.\n\nFor example, when peeping on a girl bathing,\n\nfor example, after just having chopped a girl up like vegetables and now hypocritically wiping her tears,\n\nfor example, after finishing the \"Ice Water Tenderness\" service at a club and the technician hands you a feedback form to write a review and leave a signature,\n\nat times like these,\n\nleaving your own name is highly irrational.\n\n\"They... they've already left.\"\n\nThe girl choked out.\n\n\"How many?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Three. Three people.\"\n\n\"Oh.\" Zhou Ze nodded. \"Then how did they die?\"\n\nIf the girl was killed by those three, then how did those three die?\n\nIt couldn't be that the murdered girl immediately turned into a powerful ghost and successfully got her revenge, could it?\n\nIf she had succeeded in her revenge, she wouldn't still harbor such immense resentment.\n\n\"They were chosen by the devil.\" A trace of confusion flickered in the girl's eyes. \"They were chosen by the devil...\"\n\n\"You can be more specific. We're not writing poetry here,\" Zhou Ze reminded her.\n\n\"It was the devil, it was the devil, it was the devil!!!\"\n\n\"Alright, it was the devil, it was the devil.\" Zhou Ze was getting helpless. \"Anything else? It's best if you tell me everything that happened, from when you had your accident to everything you've encountered since, in detail.\"\n\nZhou Ze reached into his pocket, took out his Ghost Official ID, and waved it in front of the girl.\n\n\"You can think of me as the police.\"\n\nThe girl's gaze began to wander around the room.\n\nZhou Ze followed her gaze and asked, \"What is it?\"\n\n\"This place is shrouded by mirrors. And mirrors can not only reflect the present, they can also remember the past.\"\n\n\"How do we see it?\"\n\nTears continued to fall from the corners of the girl's eyes. Only this time, the teardrops evaporated in mid-air before they could land, creating a hazy halo of color and causing the surrounding glass to reflect an unusual light.\n\nIt was like sitting in a movie theater. Everything around them seemed to be covered by a layer of white dust, dyed with an unreal haziness.\n\nWhat surprised Zhou Ze the most was that he could still hear sounds. What the mirrors here had recorded was more than just images.\n\nOn the sofa in front of Zhou Ze sat a man with a crew cut, not yet thirty years old, smoking a cigarette with his feet propped up on the coffee table.\n\nThis was an image, a recording of something that had happened in the past.\n\nWith a loud *clang*,\n\nthe door was slammed shut.\n\nTwo more men walked in. These two looked younger, perhaps around twenty-five or twenty-six. They were carrying two large plastic bags. One wore a baseball cap, and the other had long hair with an artistic flair.\n\nThe man with the baseball cap and the long-haired man sat down across from the crew-cut man, placing their things beside them.\n\nBaseball Cap pointed at Crew Cut, who was moodily smoking by himself, and laughed to the long-haired man next to him:\n\n\"What did I say before? His team lost today, so he's definitely in a bad mood, sulking by himself, hahaha...\"\n\n\"Laugh your ass off! Laugh, laugh, all you know is how to laugh!\n\nWe could have beaten the Jiangsu team today, fuck!\n\nTheir home stadium in Jinling was just cursed today. We hit the post several times, and they just take a random swing and it goes in. It's pissing me off.\"\n\nCrew Cut pointed directly at Baseball Cap and cursed, clearly in a very bad mood.\n\n\"So your team lost a game, what's the big deal? Don't Real Madrid and Barcelona lose games too?\"\n\nBaseball Cap said dismissively. Then, he opened his bag. \"Come on, come on, let's start our party. I brought the drinks too.\"\n\nInside the bag was clothing, which Baseball Cap took out, handing one set to the crew-cut man in front of him.\n\nCrew Cut took the clothes, and all three began to change.\n\nThe three sets of clothes were Japanese military uniforms from World War II. Having been baptized by all sorts of anti-Japanese war dramas, the Chinese populace was all too familiar with this attire.\n\nCrew Cut adjusted his collar, looked at himself in the mirror, and seemed very satisfied. Then, as if he thought of something, he said directly:\n\n\"Dammit, you guys think,\n\nif the Japanese had killed more people in Jinling back then, killed all those stupid bastards, would my team have lost today?\n\nIt would've been best if they'd killed everyone in Jinling so that place wouldn't have a team anymore. Then I wouldn't be in such a foul mood today. I was supposed to be happy hanging out with you guys.\"\n\nThe long-haired man nodded and said:\n\n\"Exactly. If it weren't for those sneaky Americans back then, we'd have been Japanese citizens by now. Instead, we still have to be around these Chink³ bastards.\n\nJust thinking about going to school with them and now having to work with them makes me sick.\"\n\n***\n\n**Footnotes:**\n\n1.  **Lazy Bums (鹹魚/xiányú):** Literally \"salted fish,\" a popular Chinese internet slang for people who are lazy, unambitious, and lack drive.\n2.  **Buddha-like (佛系/fóxì):** Chinese internet slang describing a calm, detached, and easy-going attitude, unconcerned with outcomes.\n3.  **Chink (支那/Shina):** The original text uses a censored version of a highly offensive, racist slur for Chinese people.

    "content": "Zhou Ze stood to the side as if watching a stage play. The actors were lost in their roles, completely oblivious to any audience watching their performance.\n\nIn fact, they were indeed very self-absorbed.\n\nMusic began to play—a Japanese song with a strong rhythm.\n\nThen, the three men, dressed in Imperial Japanese Army uniforms, began to dance. They brandished what looked like replica samurai swords, probably ordered from some online store, and started to spin in circles to the beat, humming along as if they were celebrating at a cosplay event.\n\n\"What song is this?\" Zhou Ze asked the girl's head beside him. He really didn't understand much Japanese.\n\n\"It's called *Battōtai*,\" the girl answered. \"It's a kind of Japanese army anthem.\"\n\n\"Oh. I thought it was the theme song from some Ultraman show.\"\n\nThe three guys were having a blast. It was clear they were completely immersed in the moment, thoroughly lost in their roles.\n\nHonestly, it looked pretty moronic. These three weren't Japanese; they were genuine Chinese. One could tell from their accents and the content of their previous conversations.\n\nYet here they were, so focused and invested, as if performing some kind of solemn ceremony. It couldn't help but bring an idiom to mind—a monkey in a crown.\n\nLiking their manga, action films, songs, movie stars, and so on—none of that really matters. It's quite normal. Even having a favorable impression of a certain country is a personal freedom. But the words and actions of these three men clearly went beyond that kind of feeling.\n\nEspecially for them to say, over the loss of a soccer game, that they wished the Japanese had been more thorough in the Nanjing Massacre. That was an unforgivable crime.\n\nThat contempt for their own identity and longing for another nation's made Zhou Ze uncomfortable. He had been to Sanxiang Village, where the villagers, even after death, endured immense, gnawing hunger, yet they still guarded the \"military rations\" to their last.\n\nThe conduct of the dead and the living formed a stark, vivid contrast.\n\nJust then, Zhou Ze heard a woman's voice asking a question in Japanese.\n\nThe voice was a little familiar.\n\nZhou Ze looked at the girl's head.\n\n\"At the time... I thought the people next door were also Japanese, so I... I took the initiative to say hello,\" the girl said, gritting her teeth.\n\n\"Tsk, tsk.\" Zhou Ze shook his head. So she had walked right into it?\n\nUpon hearing a woman next door greet them in Japanese, the three men who were dancing and marching immediately stopped. They walked out to the living room to converse with her. They didn't speak Japanese, which was laughable—they desperately wanted to be Japanese but hadn't even bothered to learn the language.\n\nBut in the end, when the long-haired man opened the door, the girl was standing right there.\n\nFor the girl, it was likely the feeling of meeting a fellow countryman in a foreign land. After all, when you're in another country, finding out your neighbors are from your hometown often creates an uncontrollable urge to get closer.\n\nThe girl was invited to their party. She even performed a Japanese song for them. Although the three men couldn't understand the language, they perfectly embodied the expression \"deeply impressed despite not understanding a word.\"\n\nAfter that, they all started drinking.\n\nAnd then, the man with the buzz cut started getting handsy. The girl had been drinking, but she was still somewhat sober. She immediately stood up to refuse and said in Chinese that she was going back to her room.\n\nAs the scene progressed to this point, Zhou Ze turned his head and asked the girl's head, \"You must have realized they weren't Japanese by then, right?\"\n\n\"I thought they were just admirers of Japanese culture, so I...\"\n\nHearing this explanation, Zhou Ze found it rather interesting. Back when he had fought with the priest, the priest had mocked that what Chinese people loved most was hearing foreigners speak Chinese, from which they derived immense inner satisfaction.\n\nThe plot that followed was simple. The girl resisted; the men used force. All three of them. Because all three were drunk, the final scene was a mixture of the girl's muffled sobs and struggles after her mouth was gagged with a towel.\n\nWhen it was over, the girl lay on the floor, her eyes vacant, her body twisted. And the three men were like the Japanese soldiers of that era who were periodically issued tickets to comfort stations—they finished their business and clocked out.\n\nDuring that period, the Japanese set up many comfort stations wherever their army was stationed, forcing women from many countries to be brutalized within them. In the Japanese military camps, this was treated like a recreational activity, like going to the movies, with the number of \"tickets\" issued each month varying by military rank.\n\nAt this moment, Zhou Ze narrowed his eyes. It seemed the main event was about to begin.\n\nThe girl was ultimately dismembered.\n\nWere these three men trying to silence her?\n\nBut even if they wanted to silence her, they surely wouldn't have to resort to a method as extreme as dismemberment, would they?\n\nThe reason was simple: dismembering and disposing of a body in a hotel would make it very difficult to not leave a trace. If they just wanted to eliminate the problem, there was absolutely no need to do it in such a manner.\n\nZhou Ze continued watching from the side. In any case, the answer would reveal itself soon enough.\n\nThe three men seemed to sober up. Looking at the nearly semi-conscious Japanese girl on the floor, fear appeared on their faces.\n\nAnd it was true. Generally speaking, people who enjoy launching regional attacks online or being Japan-worshippers are, in their social lives, actually quite cowardly. They are usually insignificant small-fry, which is why they desperately hope to find a twisted form of satisfaction elsewhere for their own failed lives.\n\nThe three men were clearly panicking. The long-haired man even ran over and apologized profusely, hoping to get the girl's forgiveness so she wouldn't call the police.\n\nThe other two, the one with the buzz cut and the one in the duckbill cap, were also flustered.\n\nBut just then, on the floor beneath their feet, three shadows suddenly appeared. Their appearance was extremely bizarre; there had been no sign of them before. Then, they silently merged with the three men's shadows until they were one and the same.\n\nAnd in the three men's eyes, a bloody glint slowly emerged.\n\nWhat followed was the most brutal and difficult scene to watch.\n\nThe girl was dismembered. Her body was arranged like a sacrifice on the edge of the hot spring pool. Then, the three men actually knelt down facing the pool.\n\nThey began to chant some kind of incantation, or perhaps recite some sort of prayer. This time, it was in perfect, standard Japanese.\n\nThey've been possessed!\n\nAnd their bodies have been usurped!\n\nAs someone who had been resurrected in a borrowed body, Zhou Ze was quite familiar with this scene.\n\nUpon hearing the words the three men were chanting, the girl's head showed extreme agony. Her headless body ran from the courtyard into the living room and raised its hands to cover its ears.\n\nThe posture was very strange.\n\nThe headless corpse stood to the side, hands covering its ears, while its head was on the coffee table.\n\nOne could imagine that the sound of this Japanese scripture chanting was a form of extreme torment and torture for the girl.\n\n*Rustle...*\n\nThe surrounding scene began to distort,\n\nand then gradually dissipated.\n\nZhou Ze only remembered the final image. It was a ritual, as if to summon something. The bodies of the three men were slowly drained until they were human husks, finally turning into pus that seeped onto the cobblestones in the courtyard. The girl's body suffered the same fate, completely dissolving in the hot spring pool as if it were food boiled into nothing.\n\n***\n\nAfterward, Zhou Ze walked over to the girl and asked, \"When did you die?\"\n\n\"A year ago,\" the girl replied.\n\n\"And you've been here ever since?\" Zhou Ze asked again.\n\n\"Yes, after I died, I was here. And they were right next door. I couldn't get out. All I could do was watch the activities of subsequent guests through the mirrors. Later, I noticed more and more people in the restaurant. The souls of some of the people who died nearby would approach on their own and check in here, and they would dine in the restaurant at a fixed time.\"\n\n\"Then why didn't you go get your revenge on them before?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Because I couldn't cross over before. Now I can, because they've left. Some things... are about to awaken.\"\n\nZhou Ze was silent for a moment, then continued, \"What is that thing, exactly?\"\n\n\"I don't know. I really don't know,\" the girl replied.\n\n\"Then one last question. A while ago, did a family of three—parents with a girl about five years old—stay here?\"\n\n\"Yes, they stayed here.\" The girl looked at Zhou Ze, somewhat bewildered. \"When they were staying here, I heard those three men say that this family of three was the best sacrifice.\n\n\"Then, a few days later, I saw that family of three dining in the restaurant. They... no longer had their heads.\"\n\n\"Was it those three who killed them? But they were already dead, weren't they? Without physical bodies, just like you, sealed in the mirror and unable to get out.\n\n\"Also,\n\n\"What did those three want their heads for?\"\n\n\"It was probably to awaken themselves,\" the girl answered. \"I overheard many of their conversations. They always spoke in Japanese. They were desperate to regain their freedom, desperate to escape from one person's suppression.\"\n\n\"Suppression?\"\n\n\"Yes. They were different from me, and different from all the other souls that gathered here later. They had much greater freedom. If they wanted to, they could even enter my room at any time, but they weren't interested in that. They were always waiting for a chance, waiting for the right opportunity.\"\n\nZhou Ze sat down on the sofa.\n\nThis case, which had started with the murder of a family of three, had now dragged out far too many things.\n\nIt all began a year ago.\n\nThree Japan-worshipping morons held a party here, attracting a Japanese girl who was traveling in China from the room next door. Then the three morons got horny; after all, for people who dreamed of being Japanese, a Japanese girl who came knocking was truly hard to refuse.\n\nPerhaps their evil thoughts were sensed during the \"assault,\" or maybe their earlier act of wearing Japanese military uniforms and singing Japanese songs had an effect similar to a pen spirit game.\n\nIn any case, three Japanese ghosts who had been suppressed here by some unknown entity were summoned. They possessed the men, and at the same time, the poor Japanese girl was dismembered and offered as a sacrifice by her own countrymen.\n\nThose three wannabes also died. This was their first step toward freedom, moving from a state of suppression to being souls sealed in a mirror. It might seem like they were still trapped, but they likely had a bit more freedom than before.\n\nThey must have been waiting for the next round of sacrifices—the family of three. So, that family likely met a grim fate, allowing the ghosts to gain even more freedom.\n\nWhat angered Zhou Ze was that he himself was the key for those three Japanese ghosts to gain their next level of freedom.\n\nThat ghostly phone call was a lure to draw him here, to make him take the place of those three, allowing them to become \"completely free\"!\n\nHe was clearly the hunter, yet he had been trapped by what should have been his prey, and he had even walked right into it.\n\nBut where did these three Japanese ghosts come from?\n\nZhou Ze could sense that those three souls, whether in their methods or their skills, were not comparable to ordinary spirits. This wasn't him making excuses for falling into their trap; it was because a ritual like that was something he, an underworld emissary, didn't know how to perform. Zhou Ze even believed that the little loli, that veteran psychopomp, probably didn't know how either.\n\nThree souls, more professional than an underworld emissary?\n\n\"That's right,\" the girl said, as if suddenly remembering something. \"Over this past year, I often heard them curse someone. I don't know who that person is, but it's probably got a lot to do with why they were suppressed.\"\n\n\"What's that person's name?\" Zhou Ze asked, looking up.\n\n\"Cao Ding.\"",

    "content": "Zhou Ze was well aware of who Cao Ding was. After all, the little loli had come into this halfway, borrowing the body of the child Wang Rui. Where she was originally from or when she had died, Zhou Ze didn't know, nor could he be bothered to ask, but he figured she wasn't a local.\n\nAs for Bai Yingying, she was a sweet-but-simple girl who had been lying in a coffin for two hundred years. Her chats with Mrs. Bai were usually the kind of trivial talk best friends share. When have you ever seen a get-together between best friends turn into a rally for patriotism?\n\nTherefore, neither of them was an authentic Tongcheng local. But Zhou Ze had lived two lives, and in both, he was a man of Tongcheng. Cao Ding was a rather famous figure in Tongcheng. Of course, the most famous figure from Tongcheng was Zhang Jian, who had drafted the abdication edict for the Qing Emperor. After him, if you were to count them up, Cao Ding could probably rank in the top ten.\n\nAn anti-Wokou hero, though it seemed his official rank and fame weren't very high. Zhou Ze only knew this much; he had long forgotten the specifics. He just knew he was a figure from the mid-Ming Dynasty, a time when the Wokou¹ were at their most rampant. The coastal regions were plagued by them, and the official army was useless, often collapsing at the first contact with the Wokou. It wasn't until later, when generals like Qi Jiguang slowly rose to prominence, that the Wokou chaos was gradually quelled.\n\nThis meant that for a long period, the Ming army was basically at a \"battle power of five\"² level. It was a bit like the early stages of the later War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression, where the Japanese army advanced with overwhelming and unstoppable force. Therefore, any general who dared to swim against that tide was often the most commendable, because at that time, there was basically no hope of victory. That was a true case of \"though thousands may stand against me, I shall go forward.\"\n\nSince those three Japanese ghosts hated Cao Ding, Zhou Ze could only make a bold guess: could the identities of those three ghosts have been aged for 500 years as well?\n\nThis speculation was frightening, making Zhou Ze pause for careful consideration.\n\nMost importantly, the hero's spirit had been suppressing this pack of ghostlings here for so many years. He couldn't let it be that he fell for a trick and ended up releasing them. His crime would be immense. What if those three bastards, once released, caused some trouble in Tongcheng or the surrounding areas? Would the karma for all this end up on his head?\n\nBoss Zhou had never denied that he was a salted fish³ who was afraid of trouble. His daily mentality was truly one of \"less trouble is better than more,\" but he wasn't so far gone that he would accidentally open Pandora's box only to shrug, wash his hands of it, and go back to sleep.\n\n\"How do I get out?\"\n\nZhou Ze asked the most critical question. Of course, Zhou Ze knew that the Japanese girl in front of him probably didn't know how to get out either.\n\nThis place was like a special container, which Zhou Ze guessed was likely formed by the unique environment of General's Hill. Cao Ding's heroic spirit had suppressed this band of Wokou for five hundred years. It was originally a top-tier prison, but the vengeful souls of those Wokou, like the *Count of Monte Cristo*, had begun to stage a jailbreak.\n\nIt wasn't a one-shot escape, but a gradual increase of their freedom. It was like they were slowly moving themselves out from the deepest, most secure cells, all the way to the most loosely guarded cells on the prison's periphery.\n\nThis felt like a kind of compromise, which was what created this hodgepodge of a place. In this mirror world, the vengeful souls couldn't significantly interfere with the outside world. This was already the final layer of restraint.\n\nThe Japanese girl shook her head. She had already placed her head back on her neck.\n\nShe didn't know how to get out. If she did, she would have gone out for revenge herself long ago. Why would she have waited until now?\n\nZhou Ze felt a bit helpless. He took out his phone, which still had no signal. But Zhou Ze thought of something: since those three Japanese ghosts could call him from in here and play a \"ghost call\" prank, could he do the same?\n\nHe tried dialing Xu Qinglang's number. The phone on his end kept ringing; it was actually connecting.\n\nSlightly surprised, Zhou Ze walked over to the picture frame and looked at Xu Qinglang's situation inside.\n\nHis call was continuously going through, and he could hear the \"beep... beep...\" sound from his end, but from what he could see, Xu Qinglang had no intention of answering the phone.\n\nThe call went through, but there was no reaction on the other side?\n\nZhou Ze couldn't hear the sound from inside, so he didn't know if Xu Qinglang's phone was actually ringing, but most likely, the phone over there was not reacting.\n\nZhou Ze tried calling Bai Yingying and the little loli again. In both cases, the calls connected, but no one on the other end answered.\n\n..................\n\nWhile Zhou Ze was trying to make calls, Bai Yingying, the little loli, and the others had already entered the hotel and knocked on the door.\n\nThe one who opened the door was Xu Qinglang. His face was somewhat haggard, looking for all the world like a wife exhausted from caring for her bedridden husband.\n\nAnd indeed it was so. He still remembered that night when he was sleeping, only for the old Taoist to let out a bloodcurdling scream and pee blood, after which Zhou Ze collapsed on the floor, unconscious. From that moment until now, Xu Qinglang had been like an ant on a hot pan, not having a single moment of relief.\n\nBai Yingying immediately found the unconscious Boss lying on the sofa. She knelt directly by the sofa, took his hand, and continuously called for him to wake up, not to leave Yingying behind.\n\nSeeing this scene, the corners of everyone's mouths twitched involuntarily.\n\nCome on,\n\nZhou Ze wasn't dead yet.\n\nYou're being a little too dramatic, just like a concubine from an ancient great family who, after mourning at the funeral, would be packing her things to run away.\n\nThe little loli appeared much calmer. From her perspective, she seemed more concerned with whether Zhou Ze was currently conscious. If he was in a conscious coma, then her life was still in his hands. If it was a completely unconscious coma,\n\nthen if she killed him now, would she be free?\n\nOf course, the little loli was just thinking about it, much like how a man walking down the street might have a fleeting fantasy about the beautiful women of all shapes and sizes he sees. She wouldn't dare to do it, nor would she dare to gamble on it.\n\nFinally, the little loli walked over to Zhou Ze and began to check his condition.\n\nThe old Taoist stood to the side and began to recount in detail everything that had happened over the past few days.\n\n\"How is he?\" Bai Yingying asked the little loli.\n\n\"His soul is still here,\" the little loli said with a frown. \"But it's not complete.\"\n\n\"Not complete?\"\n\nThe little loli looked around the room, as if searching for something.\n\n\"Yes, it's not complete. That's why he can't wake up.\"\n\nHearing this, the old Taoist at the side said, \"I seem to remember in *The Investiture of the Gods* there was a villain who had a magic treasure that could snatch away a part of a person's soul.\"\n\nThe little loli paid no attention to the old Taoist's words, nor did she have the time to discuss *The Investiture of the Gods* with him. She began to walk around the room, and after seeing the shattered glass in the bathroom, her gaze fell more often on objects that could reflect.\n\nIn the end, the little loli even stood before the \"Eight Stallions\" painting in the living room, looking into the frame as if it were a mirror.\n\n............\n\nFrom Zhou Ze's perspective, it looked as if the little loli was now staring right at him, but she probably couldn't see inside. This was enough to show that the little loli's level and knowledge surpassed everyone else's around her.\n\nOld Xu and the old Taoist had been focused on how to wake the comatose Zhou Ze, never imagining that Zhou Ze was right beside them, merely trapped.\n\n\"Can she see you?\" the Japanese girl beside him asked.\n\n\"Give her some time, she should be able to figure it out.\" Zhou Ze continued to look at his phone. The awkward problem now was that even if they gave the little loli more time, even if she could confirm he was in the mirror,\n\nhow was he supposed to get out?\n\nThere had to be a way out, Zhou Ze believed. It was like facing a complex game, but you needed enough time to play it to completion, or at least have the experience of countless failures to feel your way through. However, Zhou Ze didn't have that much time right now. Keep in mind, those three Japanese ghosts had been here for a year, and more importantly, they might have been playing this game for five hundred years!\n\n\"Crack...\"\n\nThe sound of shattering glass came from outside the door.\n\nThe Japanese girl looked at Zhou Ze and said, \"It's mealtime.\"\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze.\n\n\"You're not going?\" the Japanese girl asked again.\n\n\"Are you very hungry? Or rather, do you get hungry?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"I just want to go for a walk.\"\n\nZhou Ze understood. For those inside the mirror, eating was like a prisoner's scheduled time to go outside for some fresh air and activity.\n\n\"I'm not in the moo—\"\n\nBefore Zhou Ze could finish his sentence,\n\na continuous \"crack... crack... crack...\" sound suddenly came from outside.\n\nZhou Ze immediately rushed to the doorway and opened the door.\n\nYes,\n\nwhat was supposed to be a glass corridor leading directly to the dining hall was now shattering. The surrounding glass began to break, one piece after another. More and more vengeful souls started to wander about aimlessly, as if they had lost their original restraints, becoming bewildered.\n\n\"What's going on?\" Zhou Ze asked the Japanese girl behind him.\n\n\"I don't know either.\" The Japanese girl also showed a look of surprise.\n\nZhou Ze rushed out the door. The glass all around, from far to near, continued to shatter. This gave Zhou Ze a very ominous feeling. He was now also a prisoner held here, and the glass could be understood as the iron bars of the prison. The iron bars were now continuously shattering and disappearing, which should have been a good thing for the prisoners, as they would regain their freedom.\n\nBut for Zhou Ze, it was different, because it meant the prohibitions and restraints of this place were fading away. The things that had been suppressed were now looking for a chance to escape.\n\nThe number of vengeful souls here began to increase. Due to the special nature of General's Hill, the souls of those who died nearby would subconsciously gather here, a bit like a treasure-collecting basin.\n\nAnd right now, this group of people began to move forward aimlessly, as if following some kind of guidance.\n\nZhou Ze walked among the crowd, desperately wanting to know the source of all this.\n\nFinally,\n\nZhou Ze saw a banner up ahead.\n\nAnd under the banner,\n\nlay three sets of black Japanese samurai armor. The armor was covered with numerous scars and signs of damage, yet it emanated a peculiar, chilling aura.\n\nThe banner emitted a black light, enveloping a circle. Any vengeful soul drawn over would be bound by black threads as soon as they entered this circle. And those three sets of armor, which had been lying there still and neatly folded,\n\ninside,\n\nbegan to slowly inflate...\n\n------\n\nMy apologies. I came back to the hotel after an interview last night and originally set an alarm to wake up and write after a couple of hours, but the alarm failed to wake the dragon, and I ended up sleeping straight through to the next morning...\n\n---\n**Footnotes:**\n\n1.  **Wokou (倭寇):** A term referring to pirates of predominantly Japanese origin who raided the coastlines of China and Korea from the 13th to the 16th centuries.\n2.  **Battle power of five (戰五渣):** A popular Chinese internet slang originating from a line in *Dragon Ball Z*.

    "content": "\"The wind's picked up outside.\"\n\nThe old Taoist walked over to the living room's floor-to-ceiling window and closed it. For some reason, the wind had suddenly grown stronger, making the trees and wicker chairs in the courtyard rustle.\n\nThe little loli, however, tore her gaze away from the *Eight Gallant Steeds Painting*, and even walked over to open the window the old Taoist had just closed. She stuck her head outside, and then walked back with an incredibly solemn expression on her face.\n\nLooking at Zhou Ze, still unconscious on the sofa, a murderous glint flashed in the little loli's eyes.\n\n\"What do you think you're doing!\"\n\nBai Yingying immediately snapped.\n\nThe little loli pointed at Zhou Ze and cursed, \"What the hell did that bastard unleash? He's trying to get me killed!\"\n\n\"What's wrong?\" Xu Qinglang asked.\n\n*Bang!*\n\nSuddenly, the door was blown open by the wind outside, and even the glass of the floor-to-ceiling window shattered, sending shards of broken glass flying everywhere in the living room.\n\nThe old Taoist and Xu Qinglang immediately ducked, covering their heads with their clothes for protection. Bai Yingying threw herself on top of Zhou Ze to protect her boss. The glass shards that flew at Bai Yingying were all deflected; the female jiangshi's physical resilience was truly formidable.\n\nThe little loli stood amidst the shower of glass shards. It had to be said, she looked quite stylish. Combined with her cold, loli expression, it really had the feel of a scene from a blockbuster movie.\n\nMeanwhile, Spider-Man had been sitting on a chair ever since he came in. He seemed long accustomed to this; back at the bookstore, after he finished cleaning, he would likewise find a spot to sit down and remain motionless. Even a live wire like the old Taoist couldn't get a rise out of him, finding the guy even less interesting than his own pet monkey.\n\nAnd now, the little loli was staring directly at Spider-Man.\n\nSpider-Man continued to sit, seemingly not the least bit uncomfortable under the little loli's gaze.\n\nThe little loli took a deep breath and said directly, \"Let's solve the problem here first.\"\n\nSpider-Man still didn't move.\n\nWhen customers used to visit the bookstore, they would see him sitting there so still that they'd mistake him for a sculpture, like one of those promotional models set up in a movie theater for a Spider-Man film release.\n\n\"I've been curious for a while now. What exactly is your reason for staying in Tongcheng? That guy's ashes were just an accidental discovery, right? Not the real reason you've been in Tongcheng for so long.\"\n\nSpider-Man remained unmoved.\n\n\"I've investigated. This hot spring resort on General's Mountain is an asset of the Xu family.\"\n\nAt the end of the day, this was still China. Tongcheng was a second-tier city, but in reality, it was just a small place. After all, just across the river lay the \"Magic City\" of Shanghai. As a result, there weren't many foreigners in Tongcheng; citizens would still stare curiously at foreigners on the street, unlike people in major cities who had long grown accustomed to blond hair, blue eyes, or dark skin.\n\nThe little loli knew that Zhou Ze had first met the priest at a funeral. At the time, the priest had been standing beside several women of the Xu family, almost like a family chaplain.\n\nAnd General's Mountain was an asset of the Xu family.\n\nAnd now, of all the rotten luck, the souls of those Wokou¹ ghosts, suppressed by the heroic spirit, were on the verge of rioting. Could this be a coincidence?\n\nSpider-Man remained as still as a mountain.\n\nThe wind grew stronger, accompanied by a sharp \"whoosh, whoosh, whoosh\" sound. To an ordinary person, it would just seem like a sudden change in weather before a storm. But even Xu Qinglang could tell that the wind was thick with malevolent energy—a sign that a great evil was about to emerge!\n\nThe little loli took a deep breath.\n\nShe was so pissed!\n\nWhy was it always that guy, Zhou Ze, who stirred up trouble, while she had to risk her life to clean up his mess?\n\nMoreover, this was a mess the little loli had to clean up, whether she wanted to or not. Because she was also a Ghost Emissary of Tongcheng, which meant she was responsible for handling all supernatural incidents within Tongcheng's borders. If a supernatural event affected too many innocent people and caused chaos, she would bear direct responsibility.\n\nIt was like disaster striking out of the blue. The little loli suddenly felt terribly wronged. Ever since she'd met this lazy bum,² she felt like she hadn't had a single day of peace.\n\n*Gurgle... gurgle... gurgle...*\n\nThe hot spring pool began to bubble. The tap wasn't on; water was flowing back out from the drain at the bottom. Then, the entire courtyard began to collapse. The cobblestone ground caved in, and even a large part of the living room went down with it.\n\nQuick on her feet, Bai Yingying hoisted her boss's body onto her back and dodged away, preventing him from tumbling down along with everything else.\n\nA pit had appeared within the resort. At the bottom of this pit lay a dilapidated plaque, riddled with bullet holes.\n\nIt was said that when the Japanese invaders entered Tongcheng back then, they learned of the Wako's Grave and the General's Temple here and came specifically to destroy them. The bullet holes on the plaque were likely from that time.\n\nIt was obvious this had been moved here intentionally, and the entire resort could even be described as an elaborate attempt to cover it up—one that only made it more conspicuous.\n\nBelow the plaque was a headless statue. The paint on it had long since peeled away. It depicted a man on horseback, holding a blade, conveying a sense of bleak desolation.\n\nBeside the statue of the man were three chests, also mostly rotted through. From what was visible inside, they seemed to contain things like suits of armor.\n\n*Voom! Voom! Voom!*\n\nA series of vibrations emanated from the chests below. Immediately after, a black shadow shot out and entered one of the chests. In an instant, the rotten chest exploded, and a suit of armor actually began to rise up on its own, assembling itself to the height of a person. But the pieces were all suspended in mid-air, with no one inside wearing them.\n\n\"Ooh...\"\n\nA timeworn voice emerged from within the armor.\n\nLike a person awakened after a long, long sleep.\n\n\"Hai...\"\n\n*Clang!*\n\nA rusty samurai sword materialized from some unknown corner below and instantly flew into the warrior's hand.\n\nThe warrior first looked down at the other two sets of armor at its feet, seemingly puzzled as to why its two companions hadn't awakened as well. Then, it looked at the statue behind it.\n\nFive hundred years ago, it was this man who had stopped them. But five hundred years later...\n\nIt was time to end this!\n\nThe little loli's eyes narrowed. Her mouth opened, and her tongue shot out, transforming into a whip that lashed viciously at the warrior.\n\nAs if it had eyes in the back of its head, the warrior slashed its samurai sword horizontally, blocking the tongue. At the same time, its body flickered, pulling back and dragging the little loli's tongue with it.\n\nThe little loli was pulled into the air like a kite, but she held on tight, refusing to let go. She knew she couldn't let that stone statue fall. Otherwise, the other two would be released, and they would be even less constrained.\n\nSome might ask, why not just destroy the statue before?\n\nBut in truth, destroying the statue earlier would have destroyed the three of them along with it, like digging up a plant before its fruit has ripened.\n\n\"Baka...\"\n\nThe warrior swung its sword horizontally. The little loli's body trembled, and she instinctively retracted her tongue, but she also jumped down into the pit. She had no choice; she had to stop it, had to face it head-on.\n\nBai Yingying snapped back to her senses and shouted to the old Taoist, \"Protect the boss.\"\n\nThen, she looked at Spider-Man sitting on the side. \"Come with me!\" With that, Bai Yingying leaped into the pit. And Spider-Man, who had been completely unresponsive to the little loli's cold words earlier, immediately stood up and jumped down with her.\n\nThe old Taoist looked at Xu Qinglang and said, \"I'll protect the boss. You go too.\"\n\n\"...\" Xu Qinglang was speechless.\n\nTaking a deep breath, Xu Qinglang took out his Heart-Protecting Mirror. But before he could even jump down, the little loli came flying back out, slamming hard into Xu Qinglang and sending them both tumbling backward.\n\nThe little loli quickly got to her feet. A trickle of blood escaped the corner of her mouth, but with a flick of her tongue, she licked it back in, then charged back into the fray.\n\nNext was Bai Yingying. She was struck directly by the samurai sword. Although it didn't cause any physical damage, the ghostly energy on the sword dissipated the malevolent aura on her body, causing Bai Yingying to stagger backward several steps.\n\nSpider-Man, on the other hand, was fighting the warrior to a standstill, trading blows evenly. The warrior kept making sounds of surprise and doubt.\n\nClearly, it recognized the priest, but it didn't understand why its own kinsman would turn against it now.\n\n...\n\nZhou Ze didn't know how critical the situation was back in reality. He didn't have the time to return to the room and watch the events outside through the mirror.\n\nRight now, he was in the middle of a stream of people, watching more and more lost souls walk into the circle marked by the banner, corralled like a series of batteries.\n\nBetween the banner and the armor, three figures in Japanese military uniforms were running in circles, holding samurai swords and singing Japanese military songs.\n\nThey were already dead but hadn't realized it yet. They still thought they were alive, living out their dream of having become Japanese.\n\nTheir actions were, in fact, attracting the nearby lost souls, drawing them ever closer.\n\nBehind the banner, a massive, shadowy figure could be faintly seen. It was a dignified man on horseback, but his image was constantly twisting and blurring.\n\n\"What is this, a demon that was sealed away?\" The Japanese girl found Zhou Ze and asked, standing beside him.\n\nShe felt no kinship with the warrior. After all, her own dismemberment as a sacrifice was thanks to these three sets of armor before her.\n\nIn her eyes, these things were not her kinsmen, but out-and-out demons.\n\n\"Yes,\" Zhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"Why were these demons able to break free?\" the Japanese girl asked.\n\nZhou Ze pointed to the three figures in Japanese military uniforms who were still jumping around nonstop,\n\nand said:\n\n\"Because the ones who unsealed them... were Chinese.\"\n\n***\n\n**Footnotes:**\n\n1.  **Wokou:** A term referring to pirates who raided the coastlines of China and Korea from the 13th to the 16th centuries.

    "content": "In truth, the samurai's combat strength wasn't that great. Of course, his movements and experience were indeed rich, so he could often gain the upper hand at the start of an exchange, but the damage from his attacks wasn't very severe.\n\nThe little loli could confidently hold her own against him. Bai Yingying, relying on her tough physique, could withstand the damage each time she was hit and quickly charge back into the fight. Spider-Man was also able to trade blows with him.\n\nHowever, the most crucial point was this: a soldier wears armor, but the armor is just a soldier's protection. Its only function is to nullify a portion of the damage. In fact, there were ways to bypass armor, or even attack a soldier directly through it.\n\nBut,\n\nthe samurai before them,\n\nhe had no flesh and blood,\n\nno existence.\n\nIt was as if a mass of empty air was supporting this suit of black samurai armor in battle. Therefore, every attack from Bai Yingying and the others could only land on the armor, and the effect was negligible.\n\nUnless they could instantly tear the armor apart or shatter it. But this suit of armor must have been no ordinary item five hundred years ago, and after five hundred years of nourishment, its hardness had long surpassed that of any normal armor. To shatter it directly was simply too difficult.\n\nBecause of this, even though the samurai was fighting one against three, he still didn't fall behind in the slightest.\n\n\"Seal him!\"\n\nThe little loli shouted to Bai Yingying and Spider-Man. For now, this was the only option; they had to settle for second best. If she hadn't been intentionally blocking from behind, this samurai would have likely already found a chance to destroy Cao Ding's statue.\n\nOne of them was already this tough to deal with. If two more appeared, the situation here would be completely reversed.\n\nBai Yingying nodded and charged forward again. This time, Spider-Man matched her speed, coordinating a pincer attack from a different direction.\n\nThe katana was flipped, its tip stabbing directly into Spider-Man's thigh before swiftly slicing upward. The entire motion was as smooth as flowing water, clean and decisive.\n\nA gash was nearly torn open across Spider-Man's body. He stumbled backward, finally collapsing into a sitting position on the ground. Spider-Man's suit was also cut open and fell away, revealing a wound from which foul-smelling pus oozed continuously—a shocking sight.\n\nBai Yingying's gaze hardened. For some reason, she sensed that the samurai's strength had suddenly surged compared to when they first engaged!\n\nThis feeling was quickly verified.\n\n\"Bang! Bang! Bang!\"\n\nThe samurai exchanged three punches with Bai Yingying. He himself stood firm, while she was forced back step after step. In the next moment, the samurai appeared behind Bai Yingying, his speed abnormally fast, and followed up with a horizontal slash.\n\n\"Screee!\"\n\nAn ear-piercing screech sounded as the blade made contact with Bai Yingying. She was sent flying, the malignant energy around her body dissipating nonstop. After hitting the ground, Bai Yingying couldn't get up quickly like before. She could only lie prone, her hands struggling to support her body, clearly in great pain.\n\nBeneath the helmet, a pair of crimson eyes seemed to watch it all. Then, the samurai began to accelerate again, charging directly toward the little loli's position.\n\nThe little loli was in an awkward spot. She could dodge, but Cao Ding's statue was right behind her. She hated this feeling of having no way to retreat; after all, not everyone has the courage or willingness to be a hero.\n\nBut at this moment, she still spread her hands, rose onto her tiptoes, and extended her tongue, from which a black vortex swirled out.\n\n\"Swish! Swish! Swish!\"\n\nWith every slash of the katana, the little loli's small body trembled, but she still didn't retreat.\n\nMost importantly,\n\nshe was suddenly stunned to discover that the samurai's power seemed to be on a roller coaster. It had started out flat, then suddenly spiked, defeating Spider-Man and Bai Yingying in an instant. But now, his power seemed to have dropped back down again.\n\n\"Boundless Heaven and Earth, Mystic Heart, True Law!\"\n\nSeizing the opportunity, Xu Qinglang appeared, holding his heart-guarding mirror. He knew that with his own strength, it would be difficult to play a significant role in a direct confrontation, so he had opted to wait for the right moment to strike.\n\nIt had to be said, Xu Qinglang's timing was truly excellent.\n\nThe heart-guarding mirror pressed directly against the armor, causing the samurai's body to tremble as if electrocuted. But immediately, the katana swung around on its own, aiming for Xu Qinglang.\n\nEven though Xu Qinglang was prepared and had immediately chosen to retreat after his successful strike, he was still grazed by the blade's energy. His body traced a graceful arc through the air, flying straight out of the pit. Fortunately, he landed on a sofa, or he might have been knocked unconscious or even killed by the fall.\n\nThe old Daoist immediately crawled over to check on Xu Qinglang. Seeing him unconscious, he started slapping his face.\n\n\"I'm not dead...\" Xu Qinglang said with difficulty.\n\n\"Damn it, this guy is a tough nut to crack. So many of you couldn't take him down.\"\n\nThe old Daoist peeked his head over the edge and looked down. He saw the little loli was still locked in a stalemate with the samurai. Once she was defeated, this whole round would truly be over.\n\n\"You... go down and help...\"\n\nXu Qinglang looked down at his own abdomen, where a wound had appeared. It was a really close call. If he had retreated just a fraction of a second later, he might have been sliced in half at the waist.\n\n\"Don't talk. Your injury is too serious for you to talk,\" the old Daoist said sternly.\n\nWhile using one hand to press on his wound to slow the bleeding, Xu Qinglang used his other hand to grip the old Daoist's arm tightly, glaring at him.\n\nThe old Daoist felt very uncomfortable under his gaze.\n\n*FFS,*\n\n*Don't you guys know my skill level?*\n\n*You want me to go?*\n\nThe old Daoist really didn't want to go up there.\n\n\"Do you know how to do spirit channeling?\" Xu Qinglang asked.\n\n\"Uh, I've dabbled in it before, but that was just to fool people.\" At a time like this, the old Daoist didn't mind exposing his own shortcomings.\n\nXu Qinglang took out a very small paper talisman from his jacket pocket, much, much smaller than the old Daoist's.\n\n\"Stick this on your forehead and try channeling a spirit to possess you!\"\n\n\"Will that work?\" The old Daoist was clearly skeptical.\n\nSimple tool, simple operation, simple process.\n\nWas channeling a spirit really this easy?\n\nIf so, would those charlatans on the street still need to trick people?\n\n\"The Yin energy is heavy here right now, and there are lots of ghosts. Just randomly invite one to possess you. You'll at least be more useful in a fight than you are now!\"\n\nAfter saying this, Xu Qinglang coughed heavily a few times, spitting up mouthfuls of blood.\n\nThe old Daoist's mouth hung open as if he was hesitating. The old Daoist was afraid of dying, truly afraid. And this simple method of spirit channeling—calling it \"spirit channeling\" was the nice way to put it; the blunt way was to just let a random nearby ghost possess his body and stimulate his potential. The side effects were surely terrifying.\n\nBut just then, the old Daoist clearly saw the little loli suddenly drop to one knee, blood trickling from the corner of her mouth. Clearly, she couldn't hold on much longer either.\n\nWhat the old Daoist knew even better was that once the little loli was defeated, regardless of whether the samurai broke the statue or not, their side was finished.\n\nAnd the one who could fight the best, the Boss,\n\nwas, of all times, still asleep!\n\nThe old Daoist instantly felt a sense of, \"The wind sighs, the river Yi runs cold.\"¹ But he still took the paper talisman Xu Qinglang handed him and stuck it on his forehead.\n\n\"I invite the great immortal to possess me!\"\n\nThe old Daoist didn't know the proper Daoist incantation for spirit channeling. Instead, he made a scene like a shamanistic dancer from the Northeast, hopping and jumping around, looking utterly ridiculous.\n\nSuddenly, the old Daoist's body trembled. He then propped his hands on his knees, his upper body drooping down.\n\nWhile painfully clutching the wound on his abdomen, Xu Qinglang looked at the old Daoist with a glimmer of hope. It couldn't be helped now. Having the old Daoist invite a minor ghost to possess him was a move of desperation. Any additional combat power was better than none; every little bit counts.²\n\nThat talisman wasn't a proper spirit-channeling talisman. It was actually the key to how Xu Qinglang had managed to enter Three Villages Village in the first place. The talisman's function was to suppress the Yang energy of a living person, covering the three lamps of their life force to allow a ghost to enter their body.\n\nThe old Daoist slowly raised his head. His gaze fell upon Xu Qinglang lying on the ground, and he said with a bitter smile:\n\n\"Damn, it didn't work. Is this humble Daoist's Yang energy too strong?\"\n\nXu Qinglang slumped his head to the side. He was in despair.\n\nWith the talisman still on his head, the old Daoist, exhausted from all the jumping, unconsciously reached a hand down toward his crotch, but unfortunately, the talismans there had been used long ago.\n\n\"ROAR!\"\n\nA roar from the soul erupted from within the samurai's armor.\n\nThe samurai then ignored the little loli's attack, taking the full brunt of it. With a downward chop, the little loli raised her hands and caught the katana between them. At the same time, her tongue shot out and pierced through the samurai's armor, but the samurai also kicked her brutally in the torso.\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nThe little loli was sent flying backward,\n\nsmashing heavily onto the ground.\n\nThe samurai's armor was severely damaged and continued to crack, clearly nearing its limit. But he still struggled to charge toward Cao Ding's statue.\n\n\"We're done for!\"\n\nThe old Daoist slapped his thigh. At this moment, his \"nothing to lose\" attitude kicked in. He grabbed a broken piece of concrete from nearby, leaped down into the pit, and rushed toward the samurai.\n\nThe old Daoist was putting his life on the line; he had no other choice.\n\nThe feeling was like in a siege battle, after all the regular soldiers have died, and only the old, the weak, women, and children are left to continue the fight.\n\nIt had to be said,\n\nthe old Daoist had a very accurate assessment of himself.\n\nAlthough the samurai had been severely wounded by the little loli, a centipede is not stiff even in death.³ He turned around, and the katana thrust horizontally. The old Daoist's body trembled with fear.\n\nBut just then, quick as a flash, the paper talisman on the old Daoist's forehead suddenly broke apart. At the same time, the old Daoist's entire demeanor changed abruptly. He instantly sidestepped, dodging the blade. At the same time, the old Daoist's palm pressed down on the spine of the katana, and its own momentum drove the blade into the ground. Then, with great decisiveness, the old Daoist closed the distance and slammed his shoulder hard into the samurai's helmet.\n\n\"Crack!\"\n\nWith a crisp sound,\n\nthe armor on the samurai's body shattered over a large area. His body swayed unsteadily and he began to retreat, like a plastic toy about to fall apart completely.\n\nBut the samurai paid no attention to his own injuries. That pair of crimson eyes, shining with a peculiar light, stared intently at the old Daoist.\n\nWithin that gaze was apprehension and gravity,\n\nand even,\n\nsomething called fear.\n\nThe old Daoist pulled the katana from the ground, flourished it with practiced skill, then raised it to point at the samurai. From his mouth came two words, hoarse yet powerful:\n\n\"Kill the Jap!\"\n\n***\n**Footnotes:**\n¹ A line from a famous classical poem, signifying a hero embarking on a perilous, likely one-way, mission.\n² The original phrase is `蚊子腿再小也是肉`, \"even a mosquito leg is still meat.\"\n³ The original phrase is `百足之蟲死而不僵`, a proverb meaning a powerful entity doesn't collapse easily even when dealt a fatal blow.",

    "content": "Zhou Ze chose not to recklessly enter the area encompassed by the flag, because he was not sure if the flag would have some special effect on him as well.\n\nHowever, this did not mean he was completely out of options.\n\nAt this very moment, Boss Zhou stood outside the circle, waving his fingernails and intimidating the lost souls that had been drawn over, scaring them away from entering the flag's range.\n\nThe three suits of armor were awakened and animated by the baleful energy provided by these entering souls. Cutting off the influx of these souls was tantamount to cutting off their power at the source.\n\nThe Japanese girl stood beside Zhou Ze. Her eyes were turning red, and various parts of her body began to distort as she emitted her own aura to help Zhou Ze intimidate the lost souls.\n\nIn truth, the vast majority of the lost souls here could only be called \"lost souls,\" not even \"ghosts,\" because they were supposed to have gone to hell. But after death, they were \"detained\" by the special magnetic field of General's Mountain and gathered here.\n\nThe Japanese girl, however, was a genuine, bona fide ghost with a deep-seated obsession with revenge. Because of this, she was able to maintain her own clarity in this environment.\n\nShe had no second thoughts just because the setup inside was of Japanese design. To her, her wonderful life had been destroyed by her \"own people.\" All she wanted now was revenge!\n\nZhou Ze actually felt pretty damn stupid, like an adult brandishing a knife to scare a bunch of kindergarteners into staying put. It was a classless thing to do, but it was the only thing Zhou Ze could do at the moment.\n\nZhou Ze didn't dare take the risk. If he charged straight in and was affected by that bizarre flag, things would get truly troublesome.\n\nHe knew that he was different from these lost souls. If they were individual batteries, then he was a nuclear power plant.\n\nZhou Ze also tried to open the Gate of Hell to collect all these lost souls, but likely because he was in a mirror world, the Gate of Hell wouldn't open. However, Zhou Ze could at least be certain of one thing: the real world outside must be in a state of chaos. He had no idea if Bai Yingying, the little girl, and the others could handle it.\n\nIn fact, if not for Zhou Ze's timely intervention, which had cut off the endless source of baleful energy for one of the awakened suits of armor, the situation outside might have already deteriorated to an extreme degree.\n\nThe earlier roller-coaster-like fluctuations in the samurai's power were also due to this very reason.\n\nWhile keeping an eye on the dazed lost souls in front of him, who were only instinctively trying to walk this way, Zhou Ze also paid attention to the situation behind him. He saw that the floating black suit of armor was already mostly in tatters and let out a long sigh of relief, figuring the situation outside probably wasn't completely out of control, right?\n\nHowever, at that very moment, the three men in Imperial Japanese Army uniforms, who had been singing and dancing around the flagpole to help attract the lost souls, charged toward Zhou Ze with swords in hand, shouting something.\n\nZhou Ze paid no mind to the swords in their hands. When the first man rushed over, he simply reached out and caught the man's sword hilt with his fingernails. With a lift, the man's own charging momentum caused him to stumble toward Zhou Ze. Zhou Ze directly seized his throat, his five fingernails sinking mercilessly into the man's neck!\n\n\"So you're that desperate to be a Jap devil,¹ are you?\" Zhou Ze said in a low, grim voice.\n\n\"Ahhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!\"\n\nThe man let out a blood-curdling scream. In that instant, he seemed to have regained a moment of clarity.\n\nHis basic survival instinct took over. He actually looked at Zhou Ze and pleaded:\n\n\"I'm not Japanese, I'm Chinese, I'm Chinese...\"\n\nZhou Ze showed no mercy. He snapped the man's neck, and at the same time, the black mist on his fingernails formed into the sharpest of \"blades\" and instantly shredded the man's soul!\n\nWhen dealing with scum like this, there was no need for any leniency. For their souls to be shattered, never to reincarnate, was the only fitting end for them.\n\nHowever, perhaps because Zhou Ze had killed one of their partners so simply and brutally, the other two men were struck with immense fear. They didn't dare to advance further or leave the area defined by the flag. Instead, they turned and walked directly to the two unawakened suits of armor and began to put them on.\n\n...\n\nThe old Daoist held the samurai sword.\n\nHis legs were slightly apart, his feet pointing outward.\n\nOriginally, he was actually quite handsome, with the ethereal, sage-like aura of an immortal. But now, he exuded a kind of simplicity and plainness.\n\nOne man,\n\nOne sword.\n\nFive hundred years ago, when the Wokou pirates² ravaged Tongcheng, when the defending soldiers had scattered and the garrison troops were useless, he had many times swum against the current, actively seeking out the areas where the Wokou were wreaking havoc.\n\nAt the age of forty-four, already old by ancient standards (people aged faster and had shorter lifespans in ancient times), upon hearing the alarm, he still mounted his horse without hesitation, took up his sword, and charged. That battle is recorded in detail in the local Tongcheng gazette. He charged in and out three times, leading the local villagers of Tongcheng to beat back the Wokou, and was killed himself during the pursuit.\n\nThere are many statues of Cao Ding in Tongcheng. If you look closely, you can see that the statue of Cao Ding is missing two fingers on its left hand.\n\nThe reason is that when he heard the Wokou were attacking, Cao Ding began to sharpen his sword. He personally tested the sharpness of the blade with his own fingers, and as a result, two of his fingers were sliced clean off. Cao Ding let out a great laugh, took up his sword, mounted his horse, and rode off to kill the pirates.\n\nAt that time, Cao Ding had long since left the army. His identity then was simply the owner of a local noodle shop in Tongcheng.\n\nThe old Daoist had never felt so exhilarated!\n\nFirst-person perspective!\n\nFirst-hand sensation!\n\nFront-row seat!\n\nAlthough his body was not under his own control, clearly guided by an external will, the old Daoist felt quite satisfied.\n\nHis only regret was probably that no one had the time to pull out a phone and take a video of him for posterity.\n\nIt's not easy to get a chance to look this cool!\n\nCao Ding was a man of few words, which displeased the old Daoist. *Say something! Give me more of a spotlight! If you're not going to make sand and stones fly and have a blood moon break through the clouds, at least help me make this cool moment more perfect, right?*\n\nOf course, this was just the old Daoist's own internal grumbling.\n\nIn reality, before Cao Ding died in battle back then, he had simply bandaged his injured fingers and shouted:\n\n\"Kill the pirates.\"\n\nUntil the moment he died, he said nothing else. But he used his entire life, and even pledged his next five hundred years, to continually practice those two words.\n\nThe old Daoist walked straight over. The samurai began to back away, but in the next moment, the old Daoist sped up. Who knew the old Daoist could run so fast.\n\nThe samurai had no choice but to engage. His presence had already weakened considerably, for he knew he was facing not just this old Daoist, but an existence that had instilled in him a sense of fear for five hundred years.\n\nOne slash.\n\nJust one slash.\n\nNo fancy moves.\n\nNot a shred of hesitation.\n\nEverything seemed so effortless, exuding a sense of ease that felt surprisingly, even unsatisfyingly, relaxed and free.\n\nThe samurai's helmet was pierced and exploded, shattering along with the armor that was already on the verge of collapse.\n\nThis slash was merely the final push that sent the samurai off the cliff. Bai Yingying, Xu Qinglang, and the little girl had already basically worn this samurai down to a spent force.\n\nBut,\n\nIt wasn't over yet.\n\nThe suits of armor that had been resting quietly in the rotten chests now slowly began to fill out, as if someone had put them on.\n\nThe old Daoist continued to walk that way, still moving quickly.\n\nThere are pirates.\n\nKill them.\n\nNo more words needed.\n\nThe two newly emerged samurai seemed not to have fully adapted to the situation yet, but they instinctively sensed the danger. One samurai immediately raised his sword and chopped down at the old Daoist.\n\n\"Clang!\"\n\nSword met sword.\n\nThe old Daoist's knee gave way, and he dropped to one knee on the ground.\n\nThe old Daoist felt a pang of embarrassment. He knew it was his old body that wasn't strong enough for the heroic soul to display its power; he was kind of dragging him down.\n\nBut in the instant he knelt, the samurai sword in his hand swept upward in an exceptionally fluid motion!\n\n\"Pfft...\"\n\nThe blade's edge bit deep into the armor, leaving an incredibly deep gash.\n\nThe old Daoist slapped the ground with one palm and shot back up. Then, bending his arm, he thrust the blade forward from behind. At the same time, he slammed his shoulder and then his thigh hard into the samurai, forcing it off balance for a moment.\n\n\"Screech...\"\n\nAn ear-piercing scraping sound was heard.\n\nThe old Daoist's samurai sword was already pressed against the samurai's neck. Of course, the samurai had no neck, but the blade's edge was wedged just under its helmet.\n\nEffortlessly,\n\nHe had seized control of the situation!\n\nHowever, at that moment, a face appeared under the helmet—a twisted, panicked face. At the same time, the face roared:\n\n\"I'm Chinese, I'm Chinese, I'm not Japanese, I'm not a Wokou pirate, not a Wokou, I'm Chinese! Don't kill me, I beg you, don't kill me, I'm Chinese!!!\"\n\nThe old Daoist felt a surge of anxiety!\n\nUnfortunately, the old Daoist had no control over his own body, at least not right now.\n\nGenerally speaking, in the old Daoist's view, heroic figures like this often have a high degree of moral purism. He was genuinely worried that Cao Ding, holding to the principle of not striking down his own countrymen, might hesitate or let the man go because of the Chinese soul inside.\n\nIn fact, the old Daoist could already sense that the consciousness controlling his body was growing weaker and weaker, and would likely have to leave in the next moment!\n\nThis was no time for hesitation, and certainly no time for soft-heartedness!\n\n*Bro,*\n\n*Big bro,*\n\n*Old senior,*\n\n*Don't get all principled now, for the love of God, don't be principled! Kill him, kill him!*\n\nFortunately,\n\nThe old Daoist's worries were unfounded. Truly, completely unfounded.\n\nThe moment the man revealed he was Chinese and began to plead,\n\nThe blade sliced right in,\n\nDirectly shattering the armor's helmet.\n\nIt was incredibly decisive,\n\nAnd utterly simple and brutal.\n\nThe man's pleas and cries were of absolutely no use at all.\n\nIt happened so fast that even the old Daoist found it a bit jarring.\n\nCao Ding glanced down at the shattered armor that had dissolved into a puddle at his feet.\n\nHe said in a low, grim voice:\n\n\"Back then, most of the Wokou pirates were our countrymen too.\"\n\n...\n\nPS: According to the *Veritable Records of the Jiajing Emperor*: \"Of the maritime threats in Jiangnan, Japanese pirates accounted for three-tenths, while Chinese rebels accounted for seven-tenths.\"\n\n***\n\n**Footnotes:**\n\n¹**Jap devil (鬼子, guǐzi):** A derogatory term for Japanese soldiers, originating from the Second Sino-Japanese War. It carries a strong, hateful connotation.\n\n²**Wokou pirates (倭寇, wōkòu):** Pirates who raided the coastlines of China and Korea from the 13th to the 16th centuries. While the term originally referred to Japanese pirates, later groups were composed of multinational crews that included many Chinese.",

    "content": "In fact, it is not that the old Taoist was possessed and then opened up Ren Du Erwei and then his magical power was greatly improved, which could kill the gods and Buddhas. Cao Gao's upper body actually stimulated the old Taoist's potential, but no matter how much it was stimulated, the old Taoist's potential could not be stimulated to a level that exceeded Bai Baobao and Xiao Fuli.\n\n\n\nThe reason why we can cut melons and vegetables to continuously solve the warriors is actually because Cao Gao killed them that year and also suppressed them for five hundred years. This is a kind of fear imprinted in the depths of the soul.\n\n\n\nIn front of Cao Tai, these three fierce warriors could only be the thin sage.\n\n\n\nThis is like Bai Bao Bao is very aloof when he is alone, but when facing the blood-stricken boss Zhou, he immediately becomes a \"climbing\" principle.\n\n\n\nCao Feng was very crisp and killed the second warrior. Now, there is only one left.\n\n\n\nAnd it can be seen that this samurai was obviously a little nervous. This fear is really not something that can be resisted by shouting \"Man is determined to be the sky.\"\n\n\n\nThis is a heavenly enemy, a slut that cannot be surpassed\n\n\n\nThe old Taoist felt relieved. Now, as long as he kills the last one, his pussy can be finished.\n\n\n\nCao Feng didn't waste time either, and he knew that he couldn't afford to delay, so he rushed up directly\n\n\n\nThe old Taoist was strong, as if he had a second spring. The warrior began to dodge and did not even dare to take the initiative to counterattack, but he did not have much effect. After ten moves, the warrior was dissatisfied and finally, Cao Gao found a loophole and kicked it and knelt down. Then, Cao Gao's knife edge was smoothly stretched out.\n\n\n\n  quick,\n\n\n\nKill him,\n\n\n\nKill him\n\n\n\nAfter chopping him, we can shout \"click\", and then go home to eat and collect clothes\n\n\n\nThe old Taoist shouted in his heart\n\n\n\n  However,\n\n\n\nAt this moment, a heavy sense of weakness came from the old Taoist body. This feeling of weakness was like comforting and worrying about more than ten mistakes in one night, and the sky began to turn around.\n\n\n\n\"Mom\"\n\n\n\nThe old Taoist thought it was not good.\n\n\n\nThen he retreated and fell to the ground, feeling tired directly, and the old Taoist fainted in an instant\n\n\n\nThe samurai sword fell to the ground, and the last knife did not cut it down.\n\n\n\nXu Qinglang, who was lying on the ground and was observing the situation, subconsciously spilling blood from the corner of his mouth.\n\n\n\nThis is so bloody. It obviously gave great hope, but there was a problem in the end.\n\n\n\nThe standard bloody movie routine really happened in front of you\n\n\n\nBai Baoyu stood up against the wall with a strong support. In fact, she was in a mess, and her bad air was raging. But she knew that this time was not the time for her to rest. No matter how bad the situation was, she would stand up.Little Li, who was covered in blood, was embedded in the wall. When she saw the old Taoist fall down, the corners of her mouth twitched. Her temper was not very good, so at this time, if it weren't for the fact that her body could not bear it, she really wanted to kill people.\n\n\n\nBut when I want to go, it seems that no one can kill me\n\n\n\n  Ji Cao Wu\n\n\n\nHe didn't have much BB, didn't talk much, and he didn't like some decent characters in brain-killing TV dramas who liked to go through the conversation before killing people. He had already decided quickly\n\n\n\n  The old Taoist\n\n\n\nHe seems to have nothing to destroy, he has done everything he can\n\n\n\nIn fact, among the following group of people, only the old Taoist is a pure person. Therefore, if Cao Feng wants to get married, he can only get married. He has already made his own contribution.\n\n\n\nFinally, Xiao Luoli felt that there was still someone who could kill him.\n\n\n\nIt's that ZZ,\n\n\n\nHe ran over and dug a hole.\n\n\n\nThen when everyone was working so hard to help him fill the pit, he lay there and slept soundly\n\n\n\nThis ZZ\n\n\n\nGripping her silver teeth, Xiao Luli walked out of the wall. Although her figure was very unstable and she couldn't stop shaking, she didn't have to choose.\n\n\n\nThere is no complimentary, no floral flowers, and no blood-red flags slamming behind\n\n\n\n Although he was doing a very upright thing, but he didn’t say anything or cheerleading. Xiao Luoli didn’t like this feeling and was also disgusted with this scene.\n\n\n\nThe spider was not dead, but he couldn't stand up. He was injured too seriously, but the huge incision that had appeared before had already begun to scab at this time.\n\n\n\nThe warrior was stunned for a long time. He seemed to have not come out of the desperate sentiment. With some confusion, he stood up tentatively.\n\n\n\n  then,\n\n\n\nHe saw the old Taoist who had fainted on the ground, and saw the opponent in front of him who was seriously injured and could not stop standing.\n\n\n\nHe wants to laugh very much.\n\n\n\n  happiness,\n\n\n\nIt's too sudden\n\n\n\nA desperate plot is coming here. This clip, this drama and this rhythm are suitable for opening the movie, rather than the end of the movie.\n\n\n\nAccording to the plot of the movie, a large part of the following content is that after this failure failed to stop the Demon, a group of new warriors were born and appeared, and the Demon was finally killed.\n\n\n\nIn fact, Xiao Luli herself knew that after a war here, she would die and die. After the Japanese samurai had been murdered for a while, there would be ghost messengers from all over the country, and even patrol patrol officers would come to visit her.\n\n\n\nThis Japanese samurai could not escape the fate of his death in the end\n\n\n\nChangshu breathed and took a deep breath. Xiao Luli opened her mouth, but she just stuck out her tongue and licked her slightly cracked lips.The samurai lifted up his samurai sword.\n\n\n\nHis armor stretched out,\n\n\n\nA wind shaves around,\n\n \n\nVery strong\n\n\n\nIt seems like he is making a loud and unrestrained smile\n\n\n\nAfter sacrificing two companions, he laughed the most\n\n\n\nAlthough there were many twists and turns in this process, and although I was still chasing Cao's slaughter, the situation was finally controlled by myself.\n\n\n\n\"Shadow\"\n\n\n\nThe warrior lifted up his samurai sword, and at first pointed to the old Taoist in front, then pointed to the white jean on one side, and finally pointed to the little jean on the other side.\n\n\n\nMany villains die because of the fact that the villains are stupid, but because wearing more and more when holding the coupon is a difficult to resist, allowing people to subconsciously immerse themselves in it.\n\n\n\nHowever, the warrior did not delay too much, and he first walked towards the old Taoist lying in front of him.\n\n\n\n  Pick up the knife,\n\n\n\n\"Click\"\n\n\n\nThe warrior was stunned for a moment.\n\n\n\nTurning over the head,\n\n\n\nLooking behind you,\n\n\n\nThe sculpture belonging to Cao's top suddenly fell down at this time\n\n\n\n\"Bang\"\n\n\n\nThe warrior was pressed down below, and the sculpture scattered huge soil. Inside, there were still Mars scattering everywhere. Not long after, the smoke also spread out.\n\n\n\nXiao Luoli stood there, then immediately rushed over, not caring about her own injuries\n\n\n\nWhite jeans also made a sound and rushed over with them.\n\n\n\nTwo women stood in front of the collapsed sculpture, watching the sculptures keep rising and falling, it was obvious that the warriors inside were desperately slamming the picture and getting trapped\n\n\n\nA sound of the soul comes from the bottom, but what comes with it is a more hot temperature\n\n\n\nThere is a way to make beggar chicken, which is to put the processed chicken stuffed into other ingredients under the extremely high temperature soil, and take it out after a certain period of time, and then open the soil. The chicken inside will be very delicious.\n\n\n\nAt this time, this last samurai was actually equivalent to that beggar\n\n\n\n\"What's going on?\"\n\n\n\nIt is obviously a bit difficult to understand.\n\n\n\n\"He is going to be crushed to death.\"\n\n\n\nA ghost warrior who just shouted the wind and rain was smashed to death.\n\n\n\nThis is like the villain boss who gave a lot of space in the movie and was choked to death because he didn't show up yet because he was eating a meal, which made people a little puzzled.\n\n\n\nXiao Luoli knelt on her knees and lowered her head to the collapsed sculpture in front of her. This is a way for a ghost to express her respect.\n\n\n\n\"Cao Feng, who burned the Dharma body, could have become the god of Lady Bai and Empress Qing. In fact, his merits and the incense he enjoyed in Tongcheng for generations were much higher than the previous two.\n\n\n\nBut he gave up all this, just to pull the dead soul of the warrior, and the souls of the warrior flew and scattered together, and even the opportunity to go to the ground to ask for an official body was lost.\"\n\n\n\nBai Baobao spoke for a moment, then knelt down with him\n\n\n\n  Up to the head,\n\n\n\nLying on the ground, watching Xu Qinglang look at the situation here, my heart was filled with regrets. The end of the hero was actually very touching\n\n\n\nLater,\n\n\n\nXu Qinglang looked at Zhou Ze, who was still unconscious beside him, and said helplessly:\n\n\n\n\"It's over, you're not awake yet.\"\n\n\n\nIn helpless,\n\n\n\nWith distorted and resentfulness, it seemed to turn into water droplets and flow out\n\n\n\n …………\n\n\n\n\"So, what's going on?\" The Japanese girl looked at Zhou Ze with some curiosity\n\n\n\nThe sculpture behind the scenes are burning, and the remaining set of armor and the flag are also burning, and the blazing flames will completely cover the front.\n\n\n\n\"It is burning your soul and merits\" Zhou Ze explained\n\n\n\nFive hundred years ago, Cao Feng died in the war. The people of Tongcheng built the Cao Gong Temple and built the Japanese trunk. Five hundred years of incense worship was the thought of the local people for him. Now, he has left all these things back, just to take away the demons that are about to unearthed and protect the place.\n\n\n\nZhou Ze thought that although he was a Tongcheng person, he might not be able to do this. If it weren't for the fact that he had a ghost identity, he would have chosen to protect himself from the beginning.\n\n\n\nIt is precisely because most people cannot do that people worship heroes more, and no matter how many gifts they receive, no matter how much incense and respect they receive, they are not worthy of.\n\n\n\nThe fire is still burning, and this white mirror world seems to be burned clean soon. After losing Cao Gao and losing these ghosts of the deceased Japanese who were pressed by the town, the strange places of the Junshan Mountain will no longer exist.\n\n\n\nZhou Ze thought he would be able to leave soon, and these dead souls gathered here would enter the ground by themselves later. They should have entered the ground by themselves, so whether this will help Zhou Ze or not is not considered a professional\n\n\n\n  oh,\n\n\n\nStill have professional performance,\n\n\n\nFor example, this Japanese girl standing beside her\n\n\n\nZhou Ze thought he had been soy sauce on this matter, but fortunately, he didn't get any rewards. At least he could give this girl to the ground and earn a little bit.\n\n\n\nThe glass around began to twist and swell, and the dead began to travel around. They were waiting for the restriction here to disappear, and then they went to Huangquan Road where they should go.\n\n\n\nWhen Zhou Ze thought of his about to see the group of friends outside, he was a little scared. This was because he wanted to investigate. As a result, he was caught in the lens and had nothing to do, and the helpers outside were probably busy.\n\n\n\nThis is not easy to explain\n\n\n\nTake out a smoke from his clothes and then take out the lighter. Zhou Ze saw that his smoke and lighter were a little distorted, and his palms were also blurred.This is a sign of going back soon.\n\n\n\nBut Zhou Ze still ordered smoke.\n\n\n\nLater, he took out his mobile phone habitually\n\n\n\n\"We can go out,\" the Japanese girl asked\n\n\n\n\"After you go out, I'll take you to the place you should go,\" said Zhou Ze. \"If you have a personal opinion, I can contact you later and give you a final explanation. Sorry, this is the limit I can do.\"\n\n\n\n\"I understand\" the girl is very understanding\n\n\n\nZhou Ze was very proud of his shoulders. In fact, there was one thing that Zhou Ze always was very strange. Why could that ghost call out in the lens and contact him, but he had no way to connect with him in the lens. It is hard to say that this thing is a single contact or can only contact the local ghost mess.\n\n\n\nBut isn't Xiao Luoli also a ghost\n\n\n\nThere is another thing. Since Cao Gao can burn the magic god and burn all these ghosts and monsters, why didn’t they burn at the beginning? It’s hard to say that at the beginning he still had the intention to preserve himself, and in the end he might lose control, he decided to sacrifice himself.\n\n\n\nOf course, Zhou Ze does not mean to have a heroic soul. He is also a human being, so it is normal to have such a thought.\n\n\n\n  According to the devil,\n\n\n\nZhou Ze clicked on the phone book,\n\n\n\nAt this time,\n\n\n\nThe mobile phone screen has begun to become blurred, and everything around is slowly blurring\n\n\n\nZhou Ze chose the unknown number and clicked it. He had already passed the phone number of others before, but no one answered the number. Zhou Ze never gave up the number.\n\n\n\n\"Dou……………………………………………”\n\n\n\nThe phone actually opened.\n\n\n\n\"Dou……………………………………………”\n\n\n\nI actually had the phone sound around me.\n\n\n\nZhou Ze put down his cell phone unexpectedly.\n\n\n\nLooking at the Japanese girl in front of her\n\n\n\nThe sound of the mobile phone,\n\n\n\nIt was transmitted from her\n\n\n\nThe girl was stunned for a moment.\n\n\n\nTurning over the head,\n\n\n\nLooking at Zhou Ze, he said in a daze:\n\n\n\n\"What sound\"\n\n\n\nZhou Ze looked at her and looked at her calmly. She was not wearing clothes. She had not worn clothes when she walked out of the hot spring pool before, and then she followed Zhou Ze from the room without wearing clothes. Therefore, there was no place on her body where she could let her have a mobile phone.\n\n\n\nHowever, the smile and confusion on the girl's face soon disappeared.\n\n\n\nShe stretched out her hand,\n\n\n\nPut it on your chest,\n\n\n\nThen he tore open the flesh on his chest.\n\n\n\nIn the rib cage, a small-headed mobile phone is embedded in it.\n\n\n\n\"Click click\"\n\n\n\nShe pulled off her two ribs and took out the phone inside.\n\n\n\nThen, with Zhou Ze's face, he put his phone close to his face.\n\n\n\nHe lowered his voice,\n\n\n\nHe said in a deep voice:\n\n\n\n\"Save me... Save me... I'm sending the military mountain... Save me...\"\n\n\n\nThe girl licked her lips, as if she was a joke and was seen through by an adult, looking a little shy.\n\n\n\nThen, her hand slapped her hand lightly in the position that was just torn open by herself, and she shouted in fear:\n\n\n\n\"What a shame,\n\n\n\nI just said that this old thing that is missing the finger is not that easy to deal with.\n\n\n\nAt the beginning, the priest was very disrespectful and said that he had been dead for five hundred years, so what threat could he have?\n\n\n\nWhat a pity,\n\n\n\nThe priest let me go for some reason, but he didn't come this time, otherwise I would really want to point at his nose and snail him, so that he could open his eyes:\n\n\n\nIf I followed me,\n\n\n\nMaybe I'm burned to death now.\"",

    "content": "Everyone was wounded, all of them covered in injuries.\n\nThe little loli sat on the ground, her eyes closed, occasionally kneading the sore spots on her body. This body of hers was rather delicate and truly needed more careful attention.\n\nThe Old Daoist and Spider-Man had been arduously carried up by Bai Yingying. The Old Daoist was still unconscious, his face pale, looking as if he'd overindulged in carnal pleasures.\n\nHis eye sockets were sunken and dark, his lips chapped and white. His body was weak, constantly breaking out in a cold sweat, and he would even twitch a few times now and then.\n\nOf course, no one would laugh at him right now. Among those present, Zhou Ze and the little loli were Underworld Emissaries, Bai Yingying was a jiangshi, Spider-Man was one of the living dead, and Xu Qinglang was a mystic cultivator. If they hadn't brought the Old Daoist along, even if Cao Ding had wanted to possess a body to help, there wouldn't have been a suitable vessel for him.\n\nBesides, the Old Daoist hadn't chickened out before Cao Ding's possession either; he'd grabbed a brick and charged in, which was manly enough.\n\nThe muscles on Spider-Man's body were constantly writhing, as if undergoing a process of self-regeneration, though it was very, very slow.\n\nBai Yingying looked at him, finding it somewhat amusing. The once fair and clean priest had ended up like this; it was, one had to admit, a deeply ironic turn of events.\n\nMoreover, according to the little loli, the priest had once been deeply involved in this whole affair. But then he'd gotten sidetracked and decided to go study his own boss's ashes, which resulted in him becoming what he was now.\n\nBai Yingying felt a lingering fear. If the priest had been here, whole and intact, perhaps even Cao Ding, despite sacrificing his all at the end, wouldn't have been able to prevent the resurrection of those vengeful souls.\n\nThis priest's ability to stir up trouble was simply too strong. It seemed he had been making trouble nonstop for many years. Then he made trouble for his own boss.\n\nAnd then,\n\nhe got himself killed.\n\nXu Qinglang leaned against the ruined sofa, coughing intermittently. He had already bandaged his own wounds; they weren't a major problem. The key issue was the excessive blood loss, which left him feeling weak.\n\nOf everyone present, the one who looked most unscathed was Boss Zhou, who had slept through the entire ordeal from start to finish.\n\nIrritably, Xu Qinglang stretched out his foot and gave Zhou Ze a light kick.\n\n\"Hey, it's all over. Isn't it about time you woke up?\"\n\nIf Zhou Ze had joined in earlier, perhaps they wouldn't have ended up in such a miserable state. Even Cao Ding wouldn't have had to be completely annihilated. He would have had a chance to use his merits and incense offerings to seek an official post in Hell, or to be reincarnated and ensure himself a happy, smooth-sailing next life.\n\nHe wouldn't have had to end up like this, his soul utterly scattered, everything reduced to nothing.\n\nIt wasn't that Xu Qinglang was blaming Zhou Ze. It's just that, you know, when a man can't perform at the crucial moment, when you desperately need and crave his prowess, but all he does is turn his head, snore away, and play dumb... it's always incredibly frustrating!\n\nThe little loli let out a long breath, exhaling a faint, blood-tinged wisp of air, but her body already felt much more relaxed. She was using a breathing technique to treat her internal injuries.\n\nOpening her eyes, she looked at the still-unconscious Zhou Ze.\n\nFinding it strange, the little loli reached out and touched his forehead.\n\nBai Yingying watched the little loli's every move, worried that she might take a desperate risk and seize the opportunity to kill her boss.\n\n\"He should be awake by now.\"\n\nThe little loli said.\n\nThen, she pointed to all the reflective surfaces in the room—mirrors, picture frames, even the ceramic tiles. Without exception, they were all covered in a dense web of cracks.\n\nThe barrier was broken.\n\nThe little loli had guessed before that Zhou Ze's consciousness was likely in the mirror world. Now that everything was over, he should have come back.\n\nBut then, the little loli suddenly let out a gasp and snatched back the hand she had placed on Zhou Ze's forehead. Opening her palm to look, she saw a mark, as if from a frostbite burn.\n\n\"What's going on?\" The little loli looked gravely at the still-unconscious Zhou Ze.\n\nAt that moment, Zhou Ze's face began to change. His skin started to shrivel, taking on a strange bronze hue. Two fangs slowly emerged from between his lips, and a frigid aura, even more terrifying than Bai Yingying's in battle, radiated from his body.\n\nThis was the first time the little loli had seen Zhou Ze in this state. Previously, she had only heard the Old Daoist joke about how unbelievably badass their boss was when he went into overdrive mode.\n\nNow, she believed him.\n\n\"Boss?\" Bai Yingying immediately leaned in, looking at Zhou Ze with concern.\n\n\"Could it be…\" Xu Qinglang murmured, frowning at the scene before him. \"Is he having a nightmare?\"\n\n***\n\nThe collapse within the mirror world was now unstoppable. Even the vengeful souls in the outer areas were beginning to fade away. They were returning to the real world, from where they would naturally proceed to Hell—their rightful destination, which had been delayed by this place's unique environment.\n\nThe girl faced Zhou Ze, a smile on her face. The initial panic and mindless rage were gone, replaced by a certain serenity.\n\n\"No matter what, I really must thank you.\"\n\nThe girl gave Zhou Ze a very serious bow. It was a matter of etiquette.\n\n\"Only by following you could I be one hundred percent certain of escaping this place.\"\n\nYes, the girl was telling the truth. She could have chosen to act together with the three Japanese warriors, but she worried something might go wrong—like that fellow who had suppressed her for five hundred years showing up.\n\nAnd indeed, that's exactly what had happened. That man had actually given up his own merits and incense offerings just to completely annihilate them!\n\nThat blaze was extinguished now, but the memory of it still filled the girl with fear.\n\nBy choosing to follow Zhou Ze, she had entered the game on the \"opposing\" side. If Zhou Ze won, she would be free. If Zhou Ze lost, she'd be free anyway. It was as if she'd placed bets on both sides of a war; regardless of the final outcome, she couldn't lose.\n\nThe girl held the phone in her hand, dangling it up and down.\n\nWhen people get old, they become spirits.¹ This is how people praise some wise elders, because they have lived long and experienced many great changes.\n\nAnd this woman had lived for five hundred years. Building on that foundation, it was only natural for her to use a little scheming and play a few tricks.\n\n\"I really didn't expect things to turn out this way,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nNow, Zhou Ze finally understood why Cao Ding hadn't chosen to simply and crudely annihilate all the ghost warriors attempting to resurrect at the very beginning.\n\nBecause Cao Ding knew,\n\nthere was still one person who hadn't entered the trap.\n\nBut in the end, he had no choice and was forced to leave one fish that slipped through the net, because this particular fish was far too cautious and careful.\n\nCao Ding had wanted to take care of all future troubles in one fell swoop,\n\nbut he hadn't succeeded.\n\n\"Do you want to see what I looked like before?\"\n\nThe girl swayed her hips.\n\nSoon,\n\na professional office lady's outfit appeared on her, looking intelligent and capable.\n\nNext, it changed into a dress, making her look coy and cute.\n\nAfter that, a graceful Hanfu, fresh and otherworldly.\n\nSlowly, it turned into a set of casual clothes, complete with white hotel slippers—the clothes she was wearing on the day of the incident, when she was assaulted by the three Japanophiles.\n\nFinally,\n\nthe clothes on her body began to melt, turning into black fabric that clung to her form. It was the attire of a kunoichi—her true attire, the clothes she was wearing when she died!\n\nOver five hundred years ago, she and her accomplices had just made landfall and fought their way through the city gates when they were repelled by Cao Ding leading the local townsfolk. She herself had been beheaded by Cao Ding's blade as he pursued her.\n\n\"I told you, mirrors can record images. They are very objective and very fair. They record what happened exactly as it was.\n\nBut it is precisely this fairness that creates the illusion that the images within are real.\n\nAnd the more real something appears, the greater the lies often hidden behind it.\"\n\nThe kunoichi tilted her head slightly, looking at Zhou Ze as if she were teasing a little boy.\n\n\"Feeling terrified? Feeling the humiliation of being played with in the palm of my hand?\"\n\nThe kunoichi stepped closer, moving a little nearer to Zhou Ze, continuing to taunt him:\n\n\"Did you never stop to think why those three just so happened to be gathered here?\n\nDid you never wonder why, next door, there just so happened to be a Japanese girl who heard Japanese music and proactively knocked to join the party, only to act uncharacteristically shy and resistant when trouble started?\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded and admitted, \"I was careless.\"\n\nFrom the very beginning of this whole affair, Zhou Ze had walked right into her scheme. Whether it was \"serving her sentence\" for her or his actions at the end, in truth, he had been completely outmaneuvered.\n\n\"Heh heh.\"\n\nThe kunoichi laughed, a very happy laugh. She continued:\n\n\"You know, seducing those three was rather amusing. But they were terrible in bed. It was over so fast, their bodies are so weak. I hadn't even gotten comfortable before a gentle squeeze was enough to make them burst their dams.\"\n\nThere were four ghosts in total.\n\nOne was responsible for the seduction.\n\nThree were responsible for the possession.\n\nThe division of labor was clear.\n\nThe execution was flawless.\n\nThat was how she was able to enter Zhou Ze's room from next door.\n\nOf course, her ability to remain composed even as Zhou Ze dismembered her, flawlessly playing the part of a female ghost desperate for revenge, was a true testament to her skill.\n\nZhou Ze's body was slowly changing.\n\nIn truth,\n\nthe transformation of his physical body in the real world was merely a pull triggered by his consciousness.\n\nHere in the mirror world,\n\nZhou Ze's skin had already turned a slow bronze, his flesh starting to shrivel. Deep within his eyes, a darkness like black flames flickered.\n\nThe kunoichi was somewhat startled—startled by Zhou Ze's transformation, and by the terrifying aura now radiating from him.\n\nBut she wasn't afraid.\n\nShe continued to laugh.\n\n\"It's too late. This place will shatter soon, and then I can just find any whole piece of mirror to leave. You won't find me, and you can't catch me.\n\nI'll be free!\"\n\nZhou Ze slowly lowered his head,\n\nas if he hadn't heard the girl's words at all.\n\nThe girl began to back away. The barrier here was on the verge of total collapse. She could leave now.\n\n\"Waking me… for what…\"\n\nThe girl froze. She turned back and saw that Zhou Ze was still looking down.\n\nHe wasn't talking to her?\n\nThen who was he talking to?\n\nThe girl was confused.\n\n\"Oh… I see…\"\n\nZhou Ze seemed to be talking to himself.\n\nIn fact,\n\nhe was indeed talking to himself.\n\nHe reached into his pocket,\n\nand took out a bronze ring.\n\n\"I see… Interesting… This thing… you don't know how to use it… right?\"\n\nHe was still talking to himself,\n\nbut the kunoichi felt a potent sense of crisis,\n\na sense of danger even more distinct than the one she'd felt when Zhou Ze had transformed and his aura had become so terrifying!\n\nShe began to race toward the periphery. She had to get out of here!\n\nCao Ding was dead.\n\nNo one could bind her anymore.\n\nFreedom,\n\nwas right in front of her!\n\n\"Ting…\"\n\nZhou Ze’s black fingernail lightly flicked the ring.\n\nThe ring let out a crisp sound.\n\nAnd then,\n\na curtain of blue light emanated from the ring,\n\ninstantly enveloping the entire space.\n\nThe kunoichi's body slammed heavily into the curtain of light and was thrown back.\n\nHer eyes were filled with terror and disbelief.\n\nThe barrier, which had clearly been shattered to pieces just moments ago,\n\nwas now somehow restored!\n\nNo,\n\nthat wasn't it.\n\nThe kunoichi realized,\n\nit was a new barrier, one that had been overlaid on this place!\n\nShe was trapped once more!\n\nZhou Ze slowly raised his head. His back was still somewhat stooped.\n\nHis arms hung down naturally, appearing elongated, his long fingernails looking as if they could scrape the ground at any moment.\n\nA sneer played on his lips.\n\nThe black flames in his eye sockets stared at the kunoichi before him with a hint of excitement.\n\nThe more he looked, the more he liked what he saw.\n\nAs if he were looking at a bottle…\n\nof 500-year-old cellar-aged wine…\n\n***\n¹Lit.

    "content": "Zhou Ze's body was still swaying slightly, like a doddering old man, or a drunkard, as if he might collapse at any moment.\n\nBut the terrifying aura emanating from him carried an intense, oppressive weight.\n\nThe female ninja tried to open the blue barrier of light. She wanted to leave this place. She and her three companions had gone to great lengths to destroy the ward left by Cao Ding, but reality was so cruel.\n\nShe had escaped her original cage with great difficulty, only to enter a larger, sturdier one.\n\nZhou Ze slowly walked over, his figure still wobbling slightly. As he drew closer, the expression on the female ninja's face grew more and more solemn.\n\nShe dared not take the initiative to attack Zhou Ze, just as a person who accidentally falls into a tiger's cage would instinctively try to climb out first, not foolishly fight the tiger.\n\nZhou Ze was the tiger in this cage, ready to devour anyone.\n\nPreviously, Zhou Ze had been thinking that letting the others from the bookstore fight desperately outside while he, the boss, just watched from the sidelines without even acting as a cheerleader, was indeed a bit hard to justify.\n\nNow,\n\nthis was quite good.\n\nZhou Ze even had to thank the woman before him for giving him a chance to do something, so he wouldn't be scorned by Xu Qinglang and the others when he left the mirror world.\n\n\"We can make a deal.\"\n\nEvery prey, before its death, will try every possible means to find a chance to escape, and the female ninja was no exception.\n\n\"Before you died... you were just an ordinary person...\"\n\nThe mockery on Zhou Ze's lips deepened.\n\nYes,\n\nfive hundred years ago, when you were killed by Cao Ding, you were just ordinary Wokou.¹ No matter how ferocious, you were ultimately ordinary people.\n\nSince you were an ordinary person, and you've been suppressed here for five hundred years, what could you possibly have that would interest me?\n\nThe female ninja's face took on a pleading expression.\n\nZhou Ze advanced step by step.\n\nJust then, the female ninja's figure vanished from her spot, reappearing in an instant behind Zhou Ze. In her hand was a black dagger, which she stabbed directly at the nape of Zhou Ze's neck.\n\nIt all happened in a flash.\n\n\"Thwump!\"\n\nThe dagger plunged in!\n\nThe female ninja's face lit up with joy.\n\nHer sneak attack had actually succeeded!\n\nWas he so arrogant as to think he had her cornered?\n\nThe female ninja wanted to laugh right then, but she restrained herself and prepared to twist the dagger to slice off Zhou Ze's entire head.\n\nBut all she heard was a grinding sound of muscle and sinew.\n\nNo matter how much strength she exerted, she couldn't budge the dagger in the slightest, because Zhou Ze's muscles and bones had clamped down on it, as if it were embedded in his very body.\n\nThe female ninja's eyes narrowed, and she immediately chose to retreat.\n\n\"Smack!\"\n\nBut a crisp sound rang out.\n\nZhou Ze turned his head.\n\nAnd then,\n\nthe female ninja felt herself flying through the air, the wind roaring in her ears—a speed that induced despair.\n\n\"Smash!\"\n\nWith one hand clutching the female ninja's neck, Zhou Ze slammed her into the ground, skidding for nearly a hundred meters!\n\n\"Urghh...\"\n\nA low groan escaped Zhou Ze's throat, like a prayer before a meal, thanking God for providing such a bountiful feast.\n\nThe female ninja's body trembled. This was not the trembling of facing an enemy. Even over five hundred years ago, when she, as a kunoichi, came to the coast of China with the others, she had never been afraid, whether facing Ming imperial soldiers or, finally, Cao Ding, in victory or defeat. What's more, she now possessed an additional five hundred years of mental experience.\n\nBut now, a fear truly born from the depths of her soul took hold, because she felt she wasn't facing a person, but a pressure from the food chain.\n\nIt was as if she was, by nature, his food. The oppressive feeling was like that of a lost zebra encountering a lion.\n\nZhou Ze's fingernails dug into the female ninja's neck as the surrounding black mist instantly compressed inward.\n\nThe sound of a juicer in operation filled the air, and in fact, that's precisely what it was.\n\nSimple,\n\nclean,\n\nbrutal.\n\nIt was astonishing,\n\nyet at the same time so horrifying one couldn't bear to look directly at it.\n\nA wisp of green smoke rose up. Zhou Ze tilted his head back and took a sharp breath in.\n\nThe green smoke entered his nostrils,\n\nbringing with it an immense pleasure,\n\nlike a pampered old madam smoking a hookah.\n\nHe smacked his lips,\n\nlicked them,\n\nand then his body gave a slight shudder.\n\nEverything,\n\nwas now comfortable.\n\nThe existence of a lost soul—even one that had existed for five hundred years and undergone special conditioning and coordination with the priest—in the eyes of the current Zhou Ze,\n\nwas nothing more than a puff of smoke.\n\nExhaling slowly,\n\nZhou Ze gradually sat down.\n\nHe raised a hand and placed it gently on his forehead,\n\nlike an old man after a hearty meal, preparing to bask in the sun and take a nap.\n\nAbout a quarter of an hour passed.\n\nZhou Ze lowered his hand.\n\nHis eyes still flickered with an eerie green light,\n\nbut the expression on his face was somewhat unusual.\n\nIt was confusion,\n\nbafflement,\n\nand panic.\n\nSuch emotions seemed unnatural on him. In the past, he had fought the Green-Clad Maiden and then the Japanese priest, and later, in the Lin family home, he had annihilated the problematic Ghost Emissary possessing his sister-in-law, followed by wiping out two more Ghost Emissaries in Yancheng.\n\nIt seemed that whenever he appeared, it usually meant that no matter the situation,\n\nit was time for the dust to settle.\n\nBut at this moment,\n\nhe was truly in disarray.\n\n\"How... can't I go back?\"\n\nZhou Ze muttered to himself, as if pondering the question. At this moment, he wasn't particularly good at thinking, like a sleepy person who wakes up mid-slumber, acting purely on hazy consciousness.\n\nGet out of bed,\n\nlook for the chamber pot,\n\nunfasten his trousers,\n\nturn on the faucet,\n\nand then lie back down to continue sleeping.\n\nIf someone were to ask him the next day, he probably wouldn't even be sure if he had gotten up to relieve himself.\n\nZhou Ze tilted his head up,\n\nhis eyes filled with terror.\n\nHe extended a finger,\n\npointed at the sky,\n\nthen clenched his fist and slammed it heavily onto the ground.\n\nHe understood.\n\n\"This time it's just my consciousness... my body isn't here... It's over... my body can't hold on...\"\n\n...\n\n\"So, your boss turns into this every time he 'goes all out'?\"\n\nThe little loli asked quizzically as she stared at Zhou Ze's body.\n\n\"Yeah, standard procedure. It's fine.\"\n\nBai Yingying seemed very calm. The boss always had some problems with his body after going all out and would be paralyzed for half a month. She was already used to it.\n\nBesides, Bai Yingying actually quite liked it when the boss was paralyzed, because she could take care of him in every way, including bathing him. That was when the boss was at his most adorable, and when he needed her the most.\n\n\"Ahem...\"\n\nXu Qinglang coughed beside them, taking out a wet towel to wipe the old Taoist's face. The old Taoist was still unconscious.\n\nThe little loli continued to size up Zhou Ze. Although she didn't know what was happening to Zhou Ze in his dream, the changes in his body were already enough to pique her interest.\n\nAfter a quarter of an hour, the little loli pointed at Zhou Ze's right arm and asked, \"Is this also normal?\"\n\n\"It's normal,\" Bai Yingying said without looking up.\n\nThe boss's body would develop many wounds; it was a sign of his body being overloaded.\n\n\"Are you sure?\"\n\nThe little loli pointed at the elbow of Zhou Ze's right arm.\n\nThe bone in that area was already exposed, the flesh split open. At the same time, the exposed white bone was actually starting to turn black—a sign of bodily decay, meaning the nutrients within the bone were rapidly draining away, soon to return to dust.\n\nHow did that song go again?\n\n\"To become spring mud, nurturing the great earth...\"\n\nThe little loli had no doubt that if Zhou Ze were thrown into the courtyard right now, an extremely lush patch of plants would grow there by the time they visited his grave next year.\n\nShe could even plant a loquat tree sapling there. Then, in the future, she could write in her diary:\n\n*There is a loquat tree in the courtyard, which I planted by hand in the year my Captain died. It is now as lush and shady as a canopy.*²\n\nShe glanced over and saw that Bai Yingying was acting as if it were nothing.\n\nThe little loli began to wonder if she was overthinking things.\n\nOr was Zhou Ze's life force just that formidable?\n\nIt sounded like this had happened often before.\n\nBut this was on the level of recovering even after being turned to fucking ash.\n\nEven though we're all ghosts,\n\nyou still have to follow some basic logic, right?\n\nSo, the little loli walked over to Bai Yingying, reached out her own delicate hand, grabbed Bai Yingying's face, and forced it towards the blackening bone on Zhou Ze's arm.\n\n\"I'll make one last stand. If he's recovered from this state before and went on living and jumping around, from now on I'll serve him tea, fetch his water, wash his feet, and warm his bed!\"\n\nIf he could recover from this,\n\nthen what was the big deal about swallowing her pride and accepting this kind of Captain, this kind of boss?\n\nBai Yingying suddenly froze, as if struck by lightning.\n\nThen her mouth fell open.\n\nShe subconsciously reached out and touched the boss's exposed bone.\n\n\"Crack!\"\n\nThe bone actually caved in.\n\n\"Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!\"\n\nBai Yingying began to scream.\n\nStartled by this, Xu Qinglang, who was still wiping the old Taoist's face, turned pale and spat out a mouthful of blood, spraying it all over the old Taoist's face.\n\nHe was literally scared enough to cough up blood!\n\nThe feeling of a jiangshi³ suddenly screaming right behind you was not something an ordinary person could handle.\n\n\"Boss, Boss!\"\n\nBai Yingying knelt beside Zhou Ze, screaming her lungs out, but she didn't dare touch him again, afraid that wherever she touched, another part of him would collapse.\n\nThe little loli let out a long sigh of relief.\n\nHer persistence had been right.\n\nThis was more like it. Even a Judge of Hell couldn't pull off a recovery from this.\n\nThen,\n\nthe little loli tilted her head, staring at Zhou Ze, her fingers lightly intertwined, feeling a little conflicted.\n\nShe was thinking,\n\nif Zhou Ze just kicked the bucket inexplicably in his sleep,\n\nit wouldn't be a loss for her.\n\nNot a loss, not a loss.\n\nTruly, not a loss.\n\n***\n**Footnotes:**\n1.  **Wokou:** Japanese pirates who raided the coasts of China and Korea from the 13th to 16th centuries.\n2.  **Loquat Tree:** A parody of a famous, melancholic line from the Ming Dynasty essay *Xiang Ji Xuan Zhi* by Gui Youguang.

    "content": "\"Boss, wake up, boss, wake up, boss.\"\n\n\n\nBai Baobao shouted anxiously from the side, hoping to wake up Zhou Ze. Of course, it turns out that this is just a pupil.\n\n\n\nXiao Luoli sat on the slumber, shaking her legs, silently not saying a word. Although she was quite expecting Zhou Ze to be so terrible, she was also worried that the overstimulation of the female gangster would be so irritated. Then she ran to fight with her.\n\n\n\nThe most important thing is that Zhou Ze is not dead yet and the matter is not settled yet. It is really hard to say what will happen.\n\n\n\nLower his head and looked at a piece of broken glass on the ground.\n\n\n\nMost importantly,\n\n\n\nXiao Luli can't be sure.\n\n\n\nEven Zhou Ze is in a coma, does he have the ability to cut off his soul blood?\n\n\n\nXu Qinglang also knelt beside him and checked Zhou Ze's situation. He was the first to wake up and immediately said, \"Niba\".\n\n\n\n\"Your dad\"\n\n\n\nXiao Luoli is unknown so\n\n\n\n\"Yes, mud, where is the monkey, where is the monkey?\"\n\n\n\nBai Bao Bao glanced around and realized that he had not brought the monkey over this time. The boss's current situation was not useful even if he was sent to the hospital. He had to have the hope of stopping the boss's body from continuing to become evil.\n\n\n\n\"Take the boss back\"\n\n\n\nWhite jeans made a decision\n\n\n\nTake the boss back to the bookstore and find a monkey\n\n\n\nXiao Luli immediately opened her mouth and said, \"Don't move him, you can't move him away, his consciousness is likely to be nearby.\"\n\n\n\nXiao Luoli said it was right. Even though she wanted Zhou Ze to be so stupid as soon as possible, she wouldn't dare to be too bold and courageous.\n\n\n\n\"Also, his current body state, how can you transfer him? Aren't you afraid that his body will fall apart,\" Xiao Luoli added\n\n\n\n\"What should I do?\"\n\n\n\nBai Bao was obviously a little panicked\n\n\n\n\"Wake up the old Taoist\" Xu Qinglang pointed to the unconscious old Taoist, \"He has a monkey phone call\"\n\n\n\nIf outsiders hear this, they will probably feel very disgusting.\n\n\n\nBut that's true.\n\n\n\nThe monkey in the book room has a telephone call\n\n\n\nAnd the person who is so bored that he buys mobile phones for monkeys is the old Taoist\n\n\n\nThe monkey can play music with his mobile phone and blue teeth in the book room without doing anything, and can help him take a mobile phone while he starts a live broadcast.\n\n\n\nBut except for the old Taoist, no one else in the bookstore would do anything to ask the monkey for a number to save it.\n\n\n\nXu Qinglang first groped the old Taoist body. He found his phone, but it had already been damaged in the battle just now. Finally, Xu Qinglang let out a long breath and pointed at the old Taoist:\n\n\n\n\"I must wake him up\"\n\n\n\nBai Bao Bao didn't say anything and directly stabbed his nails into the old Taoist's chest, and the cold chill instantly entered.\n\n\n\nThe old Taoist trembled and immediately opened his eyes.\n\n\n\n\"Hiss......I'm so sad\"\n\n\n\nThis is a way to stimulate the potential of life, but the old Taoist was just being brought to the ghost and had already stimulated the potential. This time, it came again. The old Taoist, who is already in his seventies, was really a little difficult to eat.\n\n\n\nAt this moment, the old Taoist woke up, but he just subconsciously hugged himself with both hands, trembling there, his lips were a little purple, which seemed to be incredible.\n\n\n\n\"I will use my pill to help you nourish your body and replenish your energy.\"\n\n\n\nBai Baobao said to the old Taoist very seriously. She knew how much harm the old Taoist had to stimulate and wake up at this time, but things had reached this point and she didn't have to choose.\n\n\n\nThe old Taoist kept vomiting white air in his mouth. He looked at the white jealous first, and then at the boss lying beside him.\n\n\n\n\"The boss has a problem with his body and needs the monkey's mud,\" said Bai Baobao\n\n\n\n The old Taoist point, “1…3…8………………………”\n\n\n\nThe old Taoist reported the monkey's phone number, and Xu Qinglang called the phone from the side, and soon answered the phone number:\n\n\n\n\"Squeak squeak...\" The monkey's voice was quite fast\n\n \n\n\"The boss has something to do. Come to the hot spring museum in Yunshan and come to find us.\" Xu Qinglang said withstood and feelings from Lie Lie.\n\n\n\nWhen changing to normal, Xu Qinglang would definitely think that his brain was kicked, and he would actually say this to a monkey and call the monkey.\n\n\n\n\"The monkey smashes...come......\"\n\n\n\nThe old Taoist trembled and shouted,\n\n\n\n\"Squeak squeak......squeak squeak......\"\n\n\n\nThe head of the mobile phone squeaked in series again, and then it was closed\n\n\n\nXu Qinglang looked at his phone, but was still a little disbelief and said, \"Can it come?\"\n\n\n\n\"It's clear\"\n\n\n\nThe old Taoist said that he was lying on the ground again. He felt very uncomfortable now. Even a tide of red appeared on his face, and his face turned red and shiny.\n\n\n\nXu Qinglang's pupils immediately shrank, and he shouted to the old Taoist, \"I'm sorry, you can't sleep now.\"\n\n\n\nYou are the rebirth of the strategist.\n\n\n\nXu Qinglang is really worried that Zhou Ze is not dead yet, the old Taoist is no longer the same\n\n\n\n\"Buzz\"\n\n\n\nBai Baobao spit out a white chilling pearl pill from his mouth, floating on the old Taoist's chest\n\n\n\nThe old Taoist sipped his breath\n\n\n\nI just felt a warm feeling flowing through my limbs and bones, which made me feel much more comfortable\n\n\n\nAt that moment, he closed his eyes and fell asleep again\n\n\n\nThe white jeans on the side continue to let their beads stay at the old Taoist’s chest to help them continue their lives. Her own skin begins to become haggard and squid. The original high school student is slowly getting older.\n\n\n\nXiao Luoli sat on the side, looking at the person in front of her who was helping her constantly, she was really speechlessAt that moment, she jumped off the sofa, and as soon as she took a step, Bai Baobao's originally weak eyes suddenly became arrogant.\n\n\n\n\"Don't think about good things\"\n\n\n\n\"You're coming again.\" Xiao Luli was proud of her voice, \"Why do you like to threaten me so much?\"\n\n\n\n\"The boss is dead, you will definitely be buried with you.\"\n\n\n\n\"You can't change a fresh vocabulary\"\n\n\n\nXiao Luoli raised her head,\n\n\n\nLooking at the sky,\n\n\n\n  Die, die,\n\n\n\nAll are dead,\n\n\n\nAfter death, this Tongcheng became much quieter and I could return to the previous life rhythm.\n\n\n\nThe feeling of giving people the feeling of being a cow and a horse as their subordinates,\n\n\n\nReally not very good\n\n\n\nBai Baobao reached out and took out a certificate from his pocket.\n\n\n\nXiao Luoli's originally casual eyes suddenly focused on this certificate, which was Zhou Ze's ghost messenger\n\n\n\n\"You can let go of any extravagant hope, such as the boss cannot crush your soul blood when he is in a coma\n\n\n\nI'm telling you very clearly now.\n\n\n\nIf the boss dies, I will give the boss to guard the tomb in the sun.\n\n\n\n  you,\n\n\n\nWe must go down as a maid and be buried with the boss.\"\n\n\n\n\"%￥#@@&&…*\"\n\n\n\nXiao Luli's heart is filled with countless grass and mud horses running through the trek\n\n\n\nWhy do women have to be difficult for women\n\n\n\nWhat are you going to do\n\n\n\n …………………\n\n\n\n  Hear your head,\n\n\n\n  Provision amount,\n\n\n\n  Fingering the green eyes between the quizzes, looking at the blue light curtain that was still flashing above\n\n\n\nIn fact, the ring has returned to Zhou Ze's body\n\n\n\nBut after the light curtain is opened, even if the ring is immediately withdrawn, it will continue to exist for a while.\n\n\n\nIn other words, just now, Zhou Ze re-set the boundary with a ring. While banning female ninjas, he also banned himself.\n\n\n\nIt’s hard to imagine what kind of appearance your body will become after a long time.\n\n\n\nIn the past, I just entered this state for a short time and ended automatically due to the body's insecurity. However, this time, my consciousness and the body were separated due to lens reasons, which led to the body's inability to directly affect Zhou Ze's consciousness. The final result would be that the body would be unable to bear the burden until it collapsed.\n\n\n\nZhou Ze's chest kept undulating.\n\n\n\nTime, every time you pass one more minute, the more dangerous you are\n\n\n\nBut he has no other choice, nor has he more room for conversion.\n\n\n\nYou can only sit like this,\n\n\n\nWaiting like this\n\n\n\nA layer of faint crystal light kept rising up on Zhou Ze's body. The reaction of consciousness affected the body, and the collapse of the body also affected the mind.\n\n\n\nA mirror separates everythingEven if Zhou Ze opened his connection with his body, he could not do it. The soul and body were not connected with each other, which was equivalent to the stone that was destined to sink to the bottom of the sea together and drowned together.\n\n\n\nThe final outcome is that we will finish playing together, and neither side can be spared\n\n\n\nThe blue light curtain is also constantly disappearing,\n\n\n\nBut Zhou Ze felt that he could not support the moment when the light curtain disappeared.\n\n\n\nThis pit,\n\n\n\nToo deep\n\n\n\n\"This time... I really want to kill myself......\"\n\n\n\nAt this moment,\n\n\n\nZhou Ze suddenly saw that a layer of black substance was actually exposed on his skin. They covered his body like dog plaster medicine.\n\n\n\n\"Low-end...............................\"\n\n\n\nZhou Ze subconsciously reached out and wanted to lift the thing that suddenly appeared on him.\n\n\n\nBut in the next moment,\n\n\n\nHe stopped,\n\n\n\nHe saw that after these black things covered his body,\n\n\n\nThe speed at which the crystals on my body are released,\n\n\n\nIt's obviously slowing down\n\n\n\n …………\n\n\n\n\"What are you doing?\" Bai Baozi leaned on the ground weakly, watching Xiao Luoli walk into the pile of sluice below and snatch it\n\n\n\n\"You really deserve to be piglet-porn\"\n\n\n\nXiao Lu Li cursed fiercely,\n\n\n\nThen the cracked armor was constantly picked out from the pile of stones. The second ghost warrior was blown by Cao's knife before, so the remaining armor of the helmet was still there. At the bottom of the sculpture, the last ghost warrior who was burned and died was melted except for the helmet.\n\n\n\nJust so happened that Xiao Luoli had everything cleaned up and bought a full set\n\n\n\nXiao Luli walked back with something in hand.\n\n\n\nPull down,\n\n\n\nPut the armor on Zhou Ze's body\n\n\n\n\"It's useful,\" Xu Qinglang asked\n\n\n\n\"Even a kitchen knife, it can be turned into a magic weapon if it is placed by a soul that is nourished for five hundred years.\" Xiao Luoli glanced at Xu Qinglang with disdain and continued to do her own thing.\n\n\n\n  soon,\n\n\n\nZhou Ze's body was covered with Japanese black samurai armor\n\n\n\n\"Crunch...crunch...crunch...crunch...\"\n\n\n\nThe cracked sound is still coming from time to time.\n\n\n\nXiao Luoli was very worried at first.\n\n\n\nBut after careful observation, I found that\n\n\n\nNow it’s not Zhou Ze’s body that is breaking, but this armor is slowly cracking, which means that this armor is helping Zhou Ze to separate the damage.\n\n\n\nWhat Xiao Luli didn't see is,\n\n\n\nZhou Ze's original flesh and blood part of the flesh and blood was in the slightest place.\n\n\n\n  As already slowly began a different fusion with this set of armor",

    "content": "Remember the popcorn vendors you could see everywhere on the streets a decade or so ago?\n\nWith their little stoves,\ntending a charcoal fire,\ncranking a handle,\na crisp \"crackle-crackle\" sound constantly emerging from the small cooker, accompanied by a faint, fragrant aroma.\n\nRight now, Zhou Ze was just like that.\n\nAfter the little loli had put the Japanese samurai armor on Zhou Ze, the armor and Zhou Ze's body wouldn't stop emitting that same \"crackling\" sound, like an egg being cracked into a hot, oiled wok.\n\nBai Yingying stood to the side, casting concerned glances from time to time. She was completely unconcerned that her own face was gradually aging; her attention was focused wholeheartedly on her boss.\n\nXu Qinglang lit a cigarette nearby, puffing away on it by himself.\n\nIt was like an ordinary family. If someone fell gravely ill, any family that valued their bonds would sell everything they owned to send them to the hospital for treatment. Regardless of whether the family would be ruined, at the very least, the family had to be whole.\n\nThat was how Xu Qinglang felt right now. No matter how badly everyone was hurt, no matter how great a price they paid, as long as everyone was all right in the end, it was still worth it.\n\n\"Girl, take your bead back. This old Taoist is fine now.\"\n\nThe Old Taoist had already slept for two hours and was awake. He opened his eyes to see the bead still rising and falling on his chest, then looked at Bai Yingying beside him, her hair now white. He felt a pang of heartache.\n\nSuch a good girl. Even though she was a jiangshi,¹ she was still very pretty. To become like this for a worn-out old man of seventy... what a waste.\n\nIt had to be said, although the Old Taoist was usually a bit of a scoundrel and was no stranger to petty thievery, very few people knew that he had been secretly funding students' educations. In the Daliang Mountains alone, he had sponsored over a hundred students.\n\nZhou Ze had once asked him why, despite having earned a good deal of money from his livestreams, he was still all alone, without even a house to his name.\n\nEven if livestreaming was a recent industry, Zhou Ze felt that with the Old Taoist's previous business of \"feudal superstition\" and his incredible gift of the gab, his ability to swindle money should have been considerable. He shouldn't have ended up so poorly.\n\nThis was the reason.\n\nThe Old Taoist had always felt that he came from a family of a Taoist lineage. From his ancestors down to the generation before him, although each was weaker than the last, they still had some measure of skill and ambition. But when it came to his generation, he had become a complete nobody. He could only rely on doing these good deeds, thinking that if he ever went to the underworld and met his ancestors, he would at least have one thing to speak of, so as not to completely disgrace them.\n\nSeeing that the Old Taoist was awake, Bai Yingying checked his condition. When she saw that his life was no longer in danger, she immediately retracted her core bead. But by now, her skin was wrinkled and her hair was stark white, giving her the look of Lian Nishang from *The Bride with White Hair*.\n\nThe little loli had been squatting nearby the whole time, watching Zhou Ze's condition. Although his injuries were still worsening, it was clear that the rate of deterioration had slowed down immensely compared to the beginning.\n\nStretching out her delicate hand, the little loli tried to pull back the armor for a look, only to discover with shock that Zhou Ze's torn flesh had actually fused with the armor.\n\nWas this a good thing or a bad thing?\n\nThe little loli wasn't sure.\n\nShe didn't dare say her discovery out loud, afraid of provoking this female jiangshi who was already half-mad with her desperate need to protect her master.\n\nThe Old Taoist struggled to sit up. He took the water from Xu Qinglang, drank a couple of mouthfuls, and then looked over at the boss.\n\nAnd just at that moment,\na piece of glass embedded in the wall above suddenly shattered.\n\nThen,\na terrifying aura suddenly descended!\n\nThe female jiangshi's body trembled.\nTerrified, she prostrated herself on the ground.\nThis was a suppression rooted in her bloodline, forcing her to submit.\n\nThe Spider-Man Priest on the side also snapped his eyes open, kneeling on the ground and trembling uncontrollably, heedless of his own injuries.\n\nThe little loli stood up, her face grave. She didn't dare to breathe, but cold sweat was already trickling down her forehead. This aura was too dreadful; it felt as if its owner could, with a mere thought, wrench her soul from her body and devour it.\n\nIn contrast, the Old Taoist and Xu Qinglang felt nothing, because their level wasn't high enough to perceive such subtleties.\n\nThe next moment,\nthat aura vanished.\n\nBai Yingying immediately crawled over to check on the boss.\n\nZhou Ze's eyelids fluttered slightly, and he slowly opened his eyes. The first thing he saw was a white-haired, haggard-looking Bai Yingying.\n\n\"Sigh.\"\n\nWith a sigh,\nZhou Ze closed his eyes again.\n\nFor one, his physical condition at that moment didn't permit him to talk much or do anything.\nFor another, saying too much right now would just be sentimental. Two lifetimes, a bachelor in both. Zhou Ze had never been good at handling this kind of situation.\n\nSo,\nhe continued to keep his eyes closed.\nMight as well play dead.\nIt was like a scumbag who, after sleeping with someone, blocks their contact info and pretends to have disappeared. This was a tech tree that men were born with unlocked; no one had to teach them.\n\n\"He's awake,\" the little loli said.\n\n\"Squeak squeak squeak...\"\n\nJust then,\nthe monkey's chirping sounded from outside. It had actually managed to find its way here!\n\nWhat an appallingly clever monkey!\n\n...\n\nIf, at first, Zhou Ze had been deliberately pretending to be asleep because he was too embarrassed to face Bai Yingying, Xu Qinglang, and the Old Taoist, then afterward, he had actually fallen unconscious again.\n\nThis time, his body had been too severely drained. Of course, the toll on his soul was not insignificant either.\n\nHe didn't know how long he was unconscious. It might have been about half a month.\n\nWhen Zhou Ze opened his eyes again, he found himself lying on the bed in the second-floor bedroom of the bookstore. Bai Yingying was using a wet towel to wipe his body.\n\nThe first thing he saw,\nwas still white hair.\n\nZhou Ze subconsciously raised his hand, his fingertips touching the ends of Bai Yingying's hair.\n\nBai Yingying's body shuddered. She turned her head, her eyes filled with pleasant surprise as she looked at Zhou Ze and called out, \"Boss, you're awake?\"\n\n\"Mhm.\"\n\nZhou Ze grunted in response.\n\n\"Want to sit up?\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\nBai Yingying used a pillow to prop him up, letting him lean against the windowsill as he sat up.\n\n\"Your face...\" Zhou Ze began.\n\nHearing this, a hint of dejection appeared on Bai Yingying's face. She seemed to think that her boss found her ugly and no longer as fresh and tender as a high school girl, and that he wouldn't want her anymore. She said anxiously:\n\n\"Don't worry, Boss, I'll hurry up and cultivate to get my essence back. I can wear a mask, or a veil, if you don't like it...\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head without saying anything. Once he had nursed himself back to health, he should have a way to help Bai Yingying replenish her lost essence.\n\nActually,\nin this matter, he was the one at fault. His compassion got the better of me. Why did I have to care about some *One Missed Call*² ghost?\n\nAlthough the outcome was perfect, during the process, it was undeniable that he had fallen into someone's trap, and in doing so, had put the people around him in danger and made them pay a great price.\n\nHe could have just been running a bookstore, serving as a ghost official, collecting a few minor ghosts, reading the newspaper, and drinking coffee, living a leisurely life. But he just didn't know how to cherish it, always wanting to be some great hero.\n\nZhou Ze laughed with some self-mockery, then said, \"Help me bathe.\"\n\n\"Yes, of course, Boss!\"\n\nEvery time Zhou Ze woke up from a state of paralysis, his first request was for her to help him bathe. The boss was a neat freak and couldn't stand the feeling of being dirty.\n\nBai Yingying was very happy, because she felt that Zhou Ze's willingness to let her continue bathing him meant he didn't despise her.\n\nShe was a naive and simple girl. Although, she wasn't truly that simple, but at least when she was with him, she really was like this.\n\nSometimes Zhou Ze would recall the footage he had recorded on the camera in the old bookstore, seeing a newly awakened Bai Yingying come downstairs and stir his cup of water with her tongue.\nThinking back on it now,\nhe felt that even then, she had a touch of mischievousness.\n\nPerhaps that's just how it is between people. When you've been with someone for a long time and gotten used to them, your perspective on things changes.\n\nZhou Ze seemed to have forgotten that when he first saw that scene in the security footage, he had been scared half to death.\n\nBai Yingying carried Zhou Ze downstairs and into the bathroom. The Old Taoist and Xu Qinglang weren't around. Bai Yingying said the Old Taoist had gone to get his driver's license, and Old Xu had gone back to his hometown again.\n\nZhou Ze remembered Old Xu mentioning last time that something had happened when his family moved their ancestral graves, but he had been busy with something at the time and hadn't asked for details, and Old Xu hadn't elaborated.\n\nAs for the Priest, he was diligently cleaning the place. His Spider-Man suit had been torn in the last battle, so the Old Taoist had bought him a few new outfits: Deadpool costumes.\n\nThe Old Taoist said that style suited him better, since they were both the kind of guys whose burnt flesh couldn't be seen in public.\n\nSitting on a small stool in the bathroom, Bai Yingying carefully lathered Zhou Ze with shower gel. There was a lot of rotten mud on Zhou Ze's body; it didn't take a genius to know what it was.\n\nBut that stuff worked wonders, especially for treating external wounds. No matter how much of a neat freak Zhou Ze was, he could only pinch his nose and accept it.\n\n\"When I've recovered, I'll help you recover,\" Zhou Ze said to Bai Yingying.\n\n\"Mhm, thank you, Boss.\" Bai Yingying continued to scrub his body, then said, \"Boss, we're out of shower gel. I'll go get some from outside.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\nBai Yingying left the bathroom.\n\nTurning his head slightly, Zhou Ze pushed himself to his feet. A cracking sound came from all his bones, a result of being bedridden for too long.\n\nLooking at his stubbled face in the mirror, Zhou Ze suddenly felt like he was looking at a stranger.\n\nHowever, it seemed a bit better this time than the previous few times. He wasn't sure if it was because he had been lying down for longer, but in any case, his external injuries had mostly healed by the time he woke up. Of course, his body was still very weak.\n\nSo weak that,\nZhou Ze's feet suddenly slipped,\nand his whole body went tumbling down.\nZhou Ze instinctively put out his arm to land first, trying to absorb the inertia.\n\n\"Hum!\"\n\nThe pain of landing wasn't as sharp as he expected.\n\nJust as Zhou Ze was feeling surprised,\nhe suddenly saw black armor appear on his arm, blocking the impact of his fall.\n\nZhou Ze slowly got back to his feet.\nHe reached out to touch the piece of armor that had suddenly appeared, realizing it was as if the thing had grown out of his arm. If he tried to tear it off, that part of him would likely become a bloody mess.\n\nZhou Ze looked back at his reflection in the mirror,\nthen silently took two steps back.\nHe raised his head slightly.\n\nThe next moment,\na suit of black Japanese samurai armor slowly emerged from various parts of Zhou Ze's body,\nenveloping his entire person.\n\nInside the enclosed bathroom,\nan eerie, yin wind immediately began to blow...\n\n***\n\n**Footnotes:**\n¹ ***Jiangshi:*** A type of reanimated corpse in Chinese folklore, sometimes translated as \"hopping vampire\" or \"zombie.\"\n² ***One Missed Call:*** A famous Japanese horror film.

    "content": "The main materials of this suit of armor were bamboo, leather, and some metal. It was black all over, exquisitely crafted, and a pleasure to look at.\n\nActually, compared to the armor of other countries from the same period, Japanese samurai armor couldn't be considered the best, whether in terms of defense or practicality. This was because, for a long time, the Japanese had closed their doors, playing their own village-chief level \"Warring States period\" on their home islands.\n\nBut setting aside a whole list of flaws,\n\nThe key thing was, it looked good.\n\nEven so, as Zhou Ze of this moment looked at his armor-clad reflection in the mirror, he felt none of the discomfort or anger one might expect from suddenly having this thing on his body. Instead, he felt that, putting aside its practicality and protective qualities, just having it suddenly manifest during a fight would make him look very \"cool and flashy.\"\n\nIf the Old Daoist were next to him, providing some classical BGM in a timely fashion, the effect would be even better.\n\nPerhaps due to the influence of modern Japanese cultural products, at least for Zhou Ze, he really didn't dislike this suit of armor.\n\nZhou Ze still remembered being in the orphanage as a child. After dinner, a large group of kids would gather on schedule in the living room, which had the school's only television, and everyone would sit on little stools waiting to watch cartoons.\n\nAt that time, VCRs and the later VCDs and DVDs were not yet widespread, so everyone basically watched whatever was on TV.\n\nFor a time, a Japanese anime called *Ronin Warriors*¹ was a huge hit all over the mainland, setting off a massive craze. Even by today's standards, the armor design and the use of some over-the-top BGM in that anime still didn't feel outdated or old-fashioned.\n\nHe reached out a hand,\n\nlifted a leg,\n\ntwisted his waist.\n\nEven though he was a bit weak right now, Zhou Ze persisted in striking a few poses in front of the mirror, with the air of an old man indulging in a fit of youthful abandon.\n\nOnce he'd had his fun, Zhou Ze closed his eyes. The armor swiftly vanished. He let out a long breath and sat down again, already drenched in sweat.\n\nJust then, Bai Yingying returned to the bathroom with the shower gel. Seeing Zhou Ze sweating again, she was confused but could only help him wash once more.\n\nEnjoying the services of his own maid, Boss Zhou, having showered and changed into clean clothes, was helped by Bai Yingying to his favorite spot on the sofa.\n\nOn the coffee table in front of him was a plate of candy, along with coffee and a newspaper.\n\nA leisurely afternoon should be spent being wasted.\n\nBoss Zhou quickly slipped back into his \"salted fish\"² role. Perhaps this was just his true nature. Moreover, after the last incident, Zhou Ze had begun to develop an instinctive aversion to any activity that required him to leave the bookstore.\n\nHis personality was a bit selfish, very much in the vein of \"I'll just be a salted fish, and who cares if the world floods after I'm gone.\"\n\nThe Old Daoist returned at this moment, his head covered in sweat. Seeing Zhou Ze leaning back on the sofa reading the newspaper, the Old Daoist chuckled excitedly. He immediately grabbed a bottle of cold beer, sidled over, and said:\n\n\"Boss, coming home and seeing you sitting here reading the paper like usual, it feels so good.\"\n\nThe Old Daoist's subtext,\n\nwas like that of a husband who, after a hard day's work, comes home to see his wife breastfeeding their child, and all his fatigue vanishes.\n\nAll in all, it sounded a bit strange.\n\nZhou Ze glanced at the Old Daoist. Seeing him full of spirit and walking with a sturdy gait, he suddenly felt a bit envious of this guy. After that incident, even with Bai Yingying's corpse core sustaining his life, it had only guaranteed that he wouldn't die. He hadn't expected the Old Daoist's life force to be so tenacious; how long had it been, and he was already recovered.\n\nA seventy-year-old man with such terrifying vitality, who could still get a morning erection and whose mind was always on *those* sorts of things, was truly the envy of others.\n\n\"How is your body?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nNo matter what, he still had to show some concern, even if Zhou Ze felt the Old Daoist would have no problem handling a threesome all night long.\n\n\"Great, I feel even stronger than before.\" The Old Daoist patted his own chest and sat down next to Zhou Ze. Then he reached out and quietly pointed at Bai Yingying, who was busy in the background, and whispered:\n\n\"Boss, can you solve Yingying's situation?\"\n\n\"I'll solve it once I've recovered.\"\n\n\"That's good. She's a pretty little gal.\" The Old Daoist smacked his lips, went to the bathroom, then came out and turned on the big TV, randomly flipping through channels.\n\n\"Yo, Boss, there's a match on today, you wanna watch?\"\n\n\"Not interested.\" Zhou Ze wasn't a sports fan.\n\n\"It's a Tongcheng Zhiyun match. Looks like they're playing a Super League team, must be the CFA Cup.\n\n\"A China League Two team versus a Chinese Super League team, oh, that's pretty rare. This humble Daoist will take a look.\"\n\nThe Old Daoist wasn't really a sports fan either, but he had some history with soccer teams. In his earlier years of wandering the country, he had been invited to the home stadiums of quite a few clubs to perform Daoist rituals, basically to consecrate the stadium and change its luck.\n\nIt was probably just that those few teams had been a bit unlucky, always hitting the goalpost or having all sorts of bad luck at their home games. Anyway, the Old Daoist was like a blind cat stumbling upon a dead mouse; or perhaps the players' mentality changed once they felt their home stadium had been consecrated and blessed, and their home record suddenly improved. The Old Daoist became very popular for this, and after making a name for himself, he was invited by several other clubs to perform rituals.\n\nTo be honest, not that many Chinese people are truly superstitious. Don't be fooled by the bustling incense in temples; most people are just there for the spectacle, praying to whatever they see, casting a wide net. And this can't really be considered superstition; before construction starts on a new building or filming begins on a TV show, people will often set up an altar and light some incense to ask for good fortune.\n\nHowever, the Old Daoist went a bit overboard a few years ago, starting a butterfly effect. If you hired a Daoist priest, I would hire a shaman or a monk. In short, one after another, they took the stage, with gods of all kinds coming to offer their blessings, fully showcasing the local cultural specialties of the various clubs. It was quite a scene.\n\nBut this was captured by fans and blew up online. The fans themselves were just joking about it, but it caught the attention of the higher-ups. The Football Association immediately issued a document, forbidding all clubs from engaging in such activities.\n\nFor this reason, the Old Daoist's stream of income was cut off, and he could only pivot to the live-streaming industry. But that's a story for another time.\n\n...\n\nXu Qinglang didn't drive back to his hometown; he took a rideshare both ways. When he was on his way back after handling his affairs, he noticed the driver seemed to be secretly sizing him up.\n\nAlright,\n\nXu Qinglang was already somewhat used to this kind of scrutiny, and somewhat immune to it. He was aware of his own looks and aura; it couldn't be helped.\n\nBut this driver seemed a little off. He would glance at his phone from time to time, then deliberately look at him again in the rearview mirror. Finally, the driver couldn't help but ask:\n\n\"Are you one of those 'cross-dressing big shots'?\"³\n\nXu Qinglang didn't understand what he meant at first.\n\nThe driver shook his head, looked at his phone screen again, and asked, \"Are you a man or a woman?\"\n\n\"A man.\"\n\nXu Qinglang then pointed at the driver and said, \"What are you looking at?\"\n\n\"Oh, nothing.\"\n\n\"Tell me what you're looking at,\" Xu Qinglang said firmly.\n\nNever mind the domineering aura of someone who owned more than twenty properties,\n\njust the temperament he had forged from all he had recently seen and experienced,\n\nwhen Xu Qinglang spoke now, it was as if he carried an oppressive aura like that of Wu Zetian.\n\nThe driver was probably young and didn't have the psychological fortitude of an old hand. Flustered, he actually pointed directly at his screen and said:\n\n\"We have a driver-side rating system for passengers that they can't see.\n\n\"I saw the comments here say you're very beautiful, and some people were guessing if you're a man or a woman. I actually took your ride request because I saw that comment and got interested. Your route is actually pretty far from mine.\"\n\n\"How boring.\"\n\nXu Qinglang shook his head disdainfully and closed his eyes.\n\nAbout twenty minutes later, the car arrived at the bookstore. Xu Qinglang got out and saw that there were quite a few people inside—and they were living people.\n\nPushing the door open, he went inside and saw Zhou Ze sitting at the counter.\n\n\"You're awake,\" Xu Qinglang greeted him.\n\n\"Yeah,\" Zhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"Why is it so lively?\" Xu Qinglang asked.\n\nZhou Ze pointed at the big TV screen and said, \"It started with the Old Daoist watching the soccer game. Then a lot of passersby saw it through the glass window and came in to watch together.\"\n\n\"Spend a hundred yuan just to come in and watch a soccer game?\" Xu Qinglang found it hard to understand.\n\nIn fact, Tongcheng hadn't had a professional soccer team for a long time, but since getting one two years ago, it had suddenly attracted a lot of fans. Even for a China League Two match, nearly ten thousand people would go to the stadium to watch, a level of enthusiasm that already surpassed some Super League teams.\n\n\"What the fuck, we're down two-nil! Dammit, I'm not watching this anymore!\"\n\nA heavily tattooed middle-aged man cursed a few times, then very reluctantly came to the counter to pay.\n\n\"This is a rip-off. I only had two bottles of Sprite, and you're charging me a hundred. The key thing is, we're already down by two goals in the first half. I really just paid to suffer.\"\n\nThe tattooed man thought for a moment, then put the hundred-yuan bill he was about to take out back in his pocket. He said to Zhou Ze:\n\n\"Boss, you have the nerve to take my money? I hang around here too, my nickname is Brother Qiang. If you have any trouble in the future, just give me a shout...\"\n\n\"No charge,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\nThe tattooed man grinned, then pointed a finger at Zhou Ze, indicating that he knew what was good for him. In reality, a proprietor who could open a shop on South Street was long past being someone a small-time, outwardly tough but inwardly weak hooligan could push around.\n\nThe tattooed man pulled out a cigarette, stuck it in his mouth, lit it, and swaggered out the bookstore door.\n\n\"The fool doesn't know life from death,\" Xu Qinglang sneered from the side.\n\nHe understood why Zhou Ze had suddenly been so kind as to not charge him. It definitely wasn't because he felt threatened.\n\nWhat a joke.\n\nA Hell's Emissary being threatened by a mortal thug? How could he even maintain his position?\n\nAnd given Boss Zhou's stingy, Grandet-like personality, would he ever turn his back on money?\n\nThe truth was, Xu Qinglang could also see it: the space between the tattooed hooligan's eyebrows was dark, and there was a faint black qi swirling around him. He had clearly attracted something unclean recently. If he didn't have someone with spiritual skills help him avert the disaster, he would, at best, fall seriously ill, and at worst, get into a car accident just walking down the street.\n\nMight as well not take a dying man's money. Maybe in a few days, he'd have to come back to the bookstore anyway. If he couldn't collect your money while you're alive, he could collect it after you're dead. Either way, Boss Zhou was sitting pretty.\n\nZhou Ze silently lit a cigarette.\n\nThe bookstore's exterior was all glass, so they could clearly see the tattooed man who had just walked out.\n\nThe tattooed man took a deep drag from his cigarette. As he walked out and was about to exhale,\n\na pregnant woman happened to walk past him.\n\nThe tattooed man looked at the woman's large belly, then immediately forced himself to swallow the mouthful of smoke. Anyone who smokes knows the acrid burn of swallowing a mouthful of smoke; it was like swallowing half a mouthful of wasabi.\n\nAfter the pregnant woman had passed,\n\nthe tattooed man bent over and dry-heaved repeatedly at the ground.\n\nBoss Zhou blew out a smoke ring. Xu Qinglang, beside him, had also seen the scene.\n\n\"Go and help him avert it,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nXu Qinglang nodded.\n\n---\n¹ *魔神壇鬥士* (Móshéntán Dòushì) is the Chinese title for the Japanese anime 鎧伝サムライトルーパー (Yoroiden Samurai Troopers), which was released in the West as *Ronin Warriors*.\n\n² \"Salted fish\" (鹹魚, xiányú) is a popular Chinese slang term for someone who is lazy, unmotivated, and lacks ambition, content to just lie around like a salted fish.\n\n³ \"Cross-dressing big shot\" (女裝大佬, nǚzhuāng dàlǎo) is internet slang for a man who is exceptionally skilled at cross-dressing and can convincingly pass as an attractive woman.",

    "content": "\"Hey, stop right there.\"\n\nXu Qinglang pushed open the bookstore door and called out to the tattooed man in front who had just finished coughing.\n\nThe tattooed man paused, turned sideways, the cigarette still dangling from his lips. He looked at Xu Qinglang, a lecherous amusement in his eyes, and said:\n\n\"Buddy, I was just thinking of saying, you're really good-looking. Did you get that done over in Thailand?\"\n\n\"...\" Xu Qinglang.\n\n\"What's up, pal? Don't tell me you came out to get that hundred yuan back. Let me tell you, your boss said it was on the house himself. Don't even think about getting it from me. When you're in business, you gotta have integrity, right?\"\n\nThe tattooed man had an air of being hot stuff.\n\n\"It's nothing. Just came out to wish you a good night.\"\n\nXu Qinglang casually shook his head, turned, and went back into the bookstore, not taking so much as a single cloud with him.¹\n\n*Good night?*\n\nThe tattooed man froze for a second, wondering if this guy had a thing for him.\n\n*I'm a very straight guy,* he thought.\n\n*But he is so pretty...*\n\n*Maybe bending a little once in a while is excusable?*\n\n*Isn't a real man supposed to be adaptable?*\n\nThe tattooed man kept adding drama to his own internal script, completely unaware that his smart mouth had just cost him a lifeline.\n\nSeeing Xu Qinglang return so quickly after going out, Zhou Ze asked, a bit surprised:\n\n\"What happened?\"\n\n\"Nothing.\" Xu Qinglang walked behind the bar and started mixing himself a cocktail. \"I can't be bothered to save him anymore.\"\n\n\"Oh.\"\n\nZhou Ze replied, and said no more.\n\nThey were neither friends nor family. If you liked the look of someone, you helped them out; it was a small effort.\n\nIf you didn't, you just turned a blind eye. There was nothing wrong with that.\n\nActually, the old Xu used to be a very positive-energy person. He had once tried to persuade Zhou Ze to help people, and Zhou Ze had found him annoying back then.\n\nNow, not only had Zhou Ze's influence turned Xu Qinglang's lifestyle into that of a salted fish,² but he had also become much more indifferent in this respect.\n\nPerhaps it was from seeing too many lost souls and their tragic stories. When you see too much of anything, you grow numb.\n\nIn the first half of the match, the Tongcheng Zhiyun team was already down by two goals. This caused more than half the audience here to leave. Most people were just here for the spectacle, supporting their hometown team out of instinct. But seeing them down by two at halftime, and with a lower-league team playing a Chinese Super League team at that, everyone felt it was hopeless and didn't want to watch anymore.\n\nHowever, two middle-aged men sitting next to Zhou Ze were watching with great interest. One, wearing a red shirt, sat there watching without saying a word from beginning to end.\n\nThe other was leaning on a cane, holding a briefcase, propped against the side of the bar.\n\nNeither of them was actually that old, probably in their forties.\n\n\"No hope now, no hope now.\"\n\nThe middle-aged man with the cane sighed with regret.\n\nTwo young men nearby shot him an annoyed glare. Clearly, they felt that while you could choose not to watch at a time like this, being a doomsayer here was just irritating.\n\nThe middle-aged man didn't get angry and continued to sip his cocktail. It was a 98-yuan cocktail. After coming in, he had specifically asked the price, feeling that ordering iced water wouldn't be getting his money's worth, but this would basically cover the minimum charge, so it wasn't a loss.\n\nIn truth, he was a man who lived a meticulous, budget-conscious life. For someone like him to willingly walk into a rip-off joint with a hundred-yuan minimum charge was quite unexpected.\n\nHe himself didn't know why. He'd been passing by on a sales run, happened to see the match playing inside, and, as if by some strange impulse, had walked in and sat down.\n\n\"They're only down by two, it's not that bad, is it?\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nBoss Zhou wasn't a soccer fan, but he'd watched the first half. The two teams were actually trading blows back and forth. The Tongcheng team just had bad luck, letting the Super League team score twice. In reality, the opportunities had been equal.\n\n\"It's different, it's different,\" the middle-aged man sipped his drink and explained like an expert commentator. \"Actually, it's inevitable that a Super League team will have some trouble adjusting when they play a China League Two team at first.\n\n\"Because according to the Football Association's regulations, China League Two can't have foreign players; it's all Chinese players. But the Super League has foreign players, and in recent years, more and more big-money tycoons have gotten into the Super League, buying stronger and stronger foreign players. They can even buy big-name stars in their prime.\n\n\"So, whether in matches or in training, Super League teams have a serious reliance on their foreign players. To suddenly play a match without them, they're actually a bit unused to it. Since the League Two team doesn't have foreign players, they play just like they always do, so their coordination is actually better.\n\n\"Therefore, the first half is key for an upset. But after one half, the Super League team can adjust to the rhythm of playing without foreign players. Plus, the Chinese players on a Super League team are a whole level above those in League Two to begin with. They often play better in the second half than the first.\n\n\"So here's the problem: in the first half, their best chance, this League Two team actually fell behind by two goals. They'll have even less of a chance in the second half. And this Super League team is the defending champion of last year's FA Cup; they won't be careless.\"\n\nThe middle-aged man delivered his analysis, only to receive a silent nod from Zhou Ze. Feeling a bit unsatisfied, he continued: \"Boss, trust me. There's no coming back from this. Look at these young guys, they're just getting worked up over nothing.\"\n\nZhou Ze remained noncommittal. Coincidentally, Xu Qinglang had just mixed a cocktail for himself, and Zhou Ze smoothly pushed it over to the middle-aged man.\n\nThe middle-aged man accepted it with a chuckle, not standing on ceremony.\n\nPerhaps he'd had a bit too much to drink, as the middle-aged man kept pounding his crippled leg with his hand.\n\n\"Were you an athlete before?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Ah, yes.\" The man's face took on a look of reminiscence. \"I used to play soccer, too. But I wasn't famous like Fan 'The General' or Hao 'The Cannon'.³ I was just a minor substitute on a small team. That team is gone now.\"\n\n\"What a pity.\"\n\n\"Nothing to pity. Just bad luck.\" The middle-aged man pointed at the glass and said, \"Boss, if you waive my bill, I'll tell you a secret from the soccer world.\"\n\n\"Consider it waived.\"\n\n\"You're a cool guy.\" The middle-aged man sighed. \"I just missed the good times. Back then, in the early 2000s, the soccer world was a mess, and dark too. Not like now. Now, you know, all these big bosses are getting into soccer, they've got more money than sense, and the pay is good. Damn, they can easily make several million, even tens of millions.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded, indicating he was listening.\n\nAt that moment, the second half began. The few remaining customers in the bookstore were still watching; most had already paid and left during halftime.\n\n\"It wasn't like that for us back then. It wasn't a matter of whether you wanted to or not. It was like that from top to bottom. Never mind the big shots at the top, even the club managers and head coaches were in on it. As a lowly player, what could you do?\n\n\"Back then, I actually wasn't good enough to play in the Jia-A League, but the general manager kept me on, paid my salary. I knew what the purpose was.\"\n\n\"Is that how your leg got crippled?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nThe middle-aged man nodded. \"Haha, Boss, don't get the wrong idea. I wasn't crippled for refusing to throw a match. I was just so damn frustrated.\n\n\"I remember this one match, we were playing a mid-to-lower-table team. These kinds of games are the easiest to fix, because we're both mid-to-lower-table, so any result seems normal. The outside world wouldn't find it too surprising. It's not like the matches for the championship or the Asian Champions League spots, with so many eyes on them.\n\n\"For that match, the bookie sent me a notice, told me to ensure a loss.\n\n\"Let me tell you, when bookies fix a match, they usually don't buy off too many people on a team. Maybe one here, one there, two at most. It's especially easy if you buy off someone on the defensive line. Letting a goal slip or giving one away is too easy. It's impossible for everyone from top to bottom to be the bookie's men. For one, it's too expensive, and for two, with more people involved, it's easy for word to leak and problems to arise.\n\n\"As luck would have it, in that match, our team's foreign player was playing too well, like he was on steroids. He scored two goals in the first ten minutes.\n\n\"Bookies usually don't dare to buy off foreign players. Foreign players get replaced all the time, and what if they go back to their own country and spill the beans to some media outlet?\n\n\"It's not like us local players, our roots and our circles are all in this country. It's easier for the bookies to control us, they don't have to worry about us causing trouble.\n\n\"That match, I kept letting players slip by and even gave away a penalty. Finally, in the eightieth-something minute, I let the other team score three, putting them in the lead. I was absolutely exhausted.\n\n\"Before the match ended, I, the defensive midfielder, just ran up to the front to play as a forward. I didn't want to defend anymore anyway.\n\n\"Who knew, by some bizarre coincidence, our defense kicked a long ball, and it somehow sailed past the other team's defensive line and landed right in front of me.\n\n\"I was completely stunned at that moment. But the ball is right in front of you, you can't just not kick it, right? That would look too fake. So I took a symbolic kick, intentionally scuffing it. The ball was really slow, the kind of shot a goalkeeper could stop with his foot.\n\n\"But damn it, the other team's goalkeeper seemed too nervous and actually fell over. And then, that shot—a shot my grandma could have saved—actually went in.\n\n\"When I saw that ball slowly roll over the goal line, I was filled with despair.\n\n\"After the match, the bookie's men found me and crippled my leg. Heh, I wasn't some star player. Of course, the star players back then threw matches too, didn't several of them go to jail? But if I had a bit of fame, they wouldn't have dared to do this to me. Who asked me to be just a minor substitute on a small team back then? This leg was the price. My goal cost the bookie tens of millions. Tens of millions back then was a lot of money.\"\n\nJust then, a cheer erupted from the young men in front.\n\nZhou Ze looked at the screen. The Tongcheng team had scored, pulling one back. The score was now 1-2.\n\n\"Yo, they managed to score one?\" the middle-aged man said, surprised.\n\nLess than three minutes later,\n\nAnother cheer,\n\nThey'd tied it!\n\nThe score was level!\n\nThe middle-aged man shot to his feet, a look of utter disbelief on his face.\n\n\"Is it a fixed match?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"No, it shouldn't be. It can't be. That Super League team wouldn't want to lose. It's backed by a major corporation; they wouldn't care about this little bit of gambling money.\"\n\nAt this point, the few young men in the bookstore were chanting, \"Go, go, one more goal,\" and so on.\n\nAnd then,\n\njust before the end of the match,\n\nthe Tongcheng team actually scored again, taking the lead. They held on and ultimately eliminated the Super League team that was two divisions above them, creating a miracle, a huge upset.\n\nThe middle-aged man pursed his lips, smiled at Zhou Ze, and then limped out of the bookstore on his cane.\n\nZhou Ze had waived his bill, so he didn't pay.\n\nThe match was over, and everyone else in the bookstore had left too. But the man in the red shirt was still sitting there. Throughout the entire game, he hadn't cheered or spoken, just sat there watching intently.\n\n\"Hey, it's time to hit the road.\" Zhou Ze reached out and patted the man's shoulder. \"Letting you watch a game for entertainment before you head to the Yellow Springs, I'm pretty good to you, aren't I?\"\n\nThe man in the red shirt paused, nodded, then looked at Zhou Ze. His lips quivered a few times before he said, \"The goalkeeper the cripple was talking about... that was me.\"\n\nHearing this, Zhou Ze was a little surprised.\n\n\"That year, I was working with another small-time bookie to counter-fix the match, a double-cross. At the start of the game, I let their foreign player score two goals. Who knew that guy was even better at throwing the game than I was, he managed to let them score enough to take back the lead.\n\n\"Heh,\n\n\"His last shot was just too slow and too soft. I had no choice. I could only pretend to fall over and let the ball go in.\"\n\n\"Were you guys playing a match or starring in *Infernal Affairs*?\"⁴ Zhou Ze was speechless. Then he asked, \"How did you die?\"\n\n\"Car accident.\" The man in the red shirt shook his head with a sense of helplessness. \"I'd been retired for over ten years. A little while ago, I was driving, and some elementary school kids were playing soccer by a flowerbed on the side of the road. A ball flew out and hit my car window. It startled me, and I jerked the steering wheel into the oncoming lane.\n\n\"And then there was an accident.\n\n\"It was actually a minor accident. The minibus coming the other way was driving really slow, very, very slow, not fast at all.\n\n\"I just bumped my head. When they took me to the hospital, there was nothing wrong at first.\n\n\"Then, the day before I was supposed to be discharged, I just died mysteriously in the hospital. The cause of death was something like a concussion.\n\n\"Tell me,\n\n\"isn't that hilarious?\"\n\n***\n\n**Footnotes:**\n\n1.

    "content": "Zhou Ze wasn't sure if reincarnation truly existed in this world, or if so-called karmic retribution was a real thing. But one thing was certain: those who did great evil and coveted ill-gotten wealth would eventually receive their due punishment:\n\n  At the very least,\n\n  they would die of old age.\n\n  He opened the Gate of Hell, reached out and grabbed the man in the red shirt, and tossed him right inside. One job completed.\n\n  Next, Zhou Ze slipped back into salted fish mode, lying on the sofa, holding a newspaper, drinking coffee. After the ordeal in the mirror world, Zhou Ze found this state to be the most enjoyable.\n\n  He maintained this posture until evening, when Xu Qinglang walked over and whispered to him, \"There's no money left in the store's account.\"\n\n  The bookstore's rent wasn't actually expensive, since it was leased from the Xu family, who had given them the green light when negotiating the price.\n\n  But the living expenses for everyone, plus utilities and so on, were no small sum. The coffee Boss Zhou was currently drinking was imported and pricey. The liquor Xu Qinglang served customers was cheap bar stuff, but what he drank himself wasn't cheap at all.\n\n  On top of that, the bookstore's business from the living was genuinely poor. One only needed to see that Zhou Ze hadn't ordered any new books to understand just how unsatisfactory the business was.\n\n  \"Go get some spirit money and burn it at the entrance. Burn a lot.\"\n\n  \"Okay.\"\n\n  Xu Qinglang went to get the spirit money. The Old Daoist, who had been playing with the monkey, saw this and immediately came over.\n\n  To the Old Daoist, there was no game in the world more fun than burning spirit money. It was more thrilling than playing a slot machine. Just crouch by the store entrance, burn some, and soon enough someone would come by and drop off money. It was pure bliss.\n\n  \"Grab some more,\" the Old Daoist muttered from the side.\n\n  \"This is enough,\" Xu Qinglang said, holding a stack.\n\n  \"The boss told you to burn a lot. What the hell are you being frugal for him for?\"\n\n  \"This is about right, otherwise it's too wasteful.\"\n\n  \"Is it your place to manage his household?\" The Old Daoist shook his head. \"If anyone's going to do it, it'd be Yingying.\"\n\n  Xu Qinglang thought about it and realized that seemed to be the case. He promptly took out another stack and handed it to the Old Daoist. Then, under the cover of night, Xu Qinglang and the Old Daoist each took a stack of money and lit it at the bookstore's entrance.\n\n  After they finished burning it, the Old Daoist squatted nearby, smoking a cigarette and waiting for the Renminbi to arrive.\n\n  In fact, the Old Daoist had stashed away quite a bit of spirit money himself. Sometimes they'd encounter ghosts with no money, and Zhou Ze couldn't be bothered with a few ghost notes, so he'd tip them to the Old Daoist.\n\n  The Old Daoist would hide them away with glee. Little by little, it had become a considerable sum.\n\n  Moreover, the Old Daoist had a dream: once he saved up enough ghost notes, he would tape them all together to make a suit, just like the fish-skin clothes of the Hezhe people, and wear it.\n\n  Damn, he would be a walking good-luck charm. The thought alone was exciting.\n\n  If he went to Macau wearing that suit, wouldn't he be invincible?\n\n  An electric scooter drove over from up the road. The Old Daoist and Xu Qinglang's gazes both turned toward it. They both thought, *this must be him*.\n\n  The person riding the electric scooter was wearing a blue delivery uniform and a helmet, clearly a delivery guy. The delivery guy didn't think much of it at first, but as he passed the bookstore, he suddenly saw a man and a woman squatting at the entrance, staring straight at him. His heart immediately tensed up. As it happened, there was a fire hydrant up ahead, and he drove his scooter right into it.\n\n  *Clang.*\n\n  A small box fell off, filled with takeout containers.\n\n  The delivery guy quickly got up, looking as guilty as a thief. He immediately righted his scooter, seemingly not even noticing the fallen item, and drove directly onto the road.\n\n  \"Beeep—\"\n\n  The sound of a car horn blared.\n\n  As the Old Daoist and Xu Qinglang watched,\n\n  the delivery guy smashed into the front of a bus like a hard-headed fool, and it was a head-on collision.\n\n  *Bang!*\n\n  The delivery guy was sent flying.\n\n  The electric scooter disintegrated on impact.\n\n  By a stroke of bad luck, his helmet even rolled right to the feet of the Old Daoist and Xu Qinglang, where it wobbled a few times.\n\n  This had gotten out of hand.\n\n  Xu Qinglang and the Old Daoist looked at each other, both seeing a hint of helplessness in the other's eyes.\n\n  \"I told you we should burn less,\" Xu Qinglang grumbled.\n\n  \"Crap, you were the one who grabbed it.\"\n\n  The Old Daoist retorted irritably, then got up and picked up the meal the delivery guy had just dropped. As soon as he held it, the Old Daoist felt something was wrong. He immediately pulled Xu Qinglang inside the bookstore.\n\n  \"What happened outside? A car crash?\" Zhou Ze had also been disturbed by the commotion.\n\n  The Old Daoist brought over the takeout containers, took a deep breath, and opened the first one in front of Zhou Ze. Inside was packed to the brim with money, and it was US dollars!\n\n  \"Well, I'll be.\"\n\n  The Old Daoist smacked his lips and quickly opened the other two boxes. They, too, were filled with US dollars.\n\n  \"We're rich, we're rich,\" the Old Daoist couldn't control his hands and immediately opened the last container. Then he cried out and jumped back. The last container held a bag of small blue pills.\n\n  It's over, it's over, this is the end. Pills!\n\n  Xu Qinglang stood to the side. He hadn't been very excited when he saw the US dollars; it was less than a hundred thousand, which was only a few hundred thousand RMB, not even enough for one of his apartments.\n\n  But when Xu Qinglang saw the blue pills, a look of surprise also appeared on his face.\n\n  \"Who dropped this?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n  \"A delivery guy,\" the Old Daoist answered.\n\n  \"Where is he now?\"\n\n  \"There. He's the one who got into the accident outside. The guy was sent flying.\" The Old Daoist pointed outside.\n\n  Zhou Ze stood up and walked to the entrance to look. A crowd of onlookers had already gathered at the scene of the accident, but through the gaps, he could see the delivery guy lying on the ground, bleeding profusely. It looked like he wasn't going to make it.\n\n  \"Get some more spirit money and burn it at the entrance. Let's not attract trouble,\" Zhou Ze instructed the Old Daoist.\n\n  \"You got it.\" The Old Daoist wiped the sweat from his forehead, immediately went to the drawer, took out a few ghost notes, and burned them at the entrance. This time it wasn't for wealth, but to avoid trouble.\n\n  Zhou Ze pointed at the US dollars on the table, signaling Xu Qinglang to put them away as household funds for the time being. Then he picked up the bag of blue pills and went to the bathroom.\n\n  *Whoosh...*\n\n  Zhou Ze poured the large bag of small blue pills directly into the toilet and flushed. The little pills went down the drain.\n\n  In truth, that bag of pills was probably worth more money, but Boss Zhou was unmoved. Just like the father and son from the steamed bun story the Old Daoist had told, if the living got involved with this stuff, it would damage one's spiritual merit and bring misfortune to one's descendants. Even ghosts wouldn't want to touch it.\n\n  After finishing, Zhou Ze clapped his hands and walked out.\n\n  The police and ambulance arrived quickly. The delivery guy's accident was severe, and he died on the spot. At first, not many police officers came, treating it as a routine traffic accident. But later, many more police arrived, and the atmosphere changed instantly.\n\n  Zhou Ze figured the police must have found out the delivery guy's true identity and started a major investigation. An officer even came to the bookstore to take a witness statement, and the Old Daoist handled the reception.\n\n  After it was done, the Old Daoist smiled and said, \"He really was a drug dealer. We served justice just by burning some ghost money at our own doorstep.\"\n\n  \"What about the things he left behind?\" Xu Qinglang asked.\n\n  \"We got lucky, or maybe the ghost money we burned afterward worked. The two security cameras over here had wiring problems today and happened to be out of commission. So we can use that US money ourselves.\"\n\n  Hearing this, Zhou Ze nodded. Money obtained from burning ghost notes was almost always ill-gotten gains, so he had no psychological burden using it himself.\n\n  \"Hey, Deadpool, come clean up.\"\n\n  The priest sitting nearby in a Deadpool costume stood up, took the mop from the Old Daoist's hands, and started cleaning.\n\n  The Old Daoist didn't stay idle either, beginning to arrange the tables and chairs and clear the coffee table.\n\n  Because the boss was a clean freak, this kind of cleaning had to be done once a day.\n\n  Zhou Ze went upstairs. Bai Yingying was already in the bedroom, sitting in a chair with headphones on, watching a movie.\n\n  Actually, Bai Yingying's appearance had mostly recovered lately, but that was only on the surface. The internal depletion could only be restored after Zhou Ze's body had recovered enough to help her.\n\n  But just sitting there, with her white hair cascading down and her feet propped up on the desk, she radiated a tranquil serenity that was a departure from her former liveliness.\n\n  Her little feet, in particular, kept gently flexing and stretching, as if they could steal one's soul.\n\n  A beautiful curve, a perfect arc.\n\n  Zhou Ze couldn't help but stand at the door and watch for a while longer. People always feel an impulse to appreciate beautiful things.\n\n  \"Boss, Boss, bad news, bad news!\"\n\n  The Old Daoist ran upstairs, holding something in his hand.\n\n  \"Boss?\"\n\n  Bai Yingying took off her headphones and walked over as well.\n\n  \"What's going on?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n  \"Boss, I found this under the chair, a card tucked inside a few ghost notes.\"\n\n  Usually, after sending a ghost to Hell, the \"passage fee\" left behind by the ghost would be on the floor or stuck to the underside of the chair the ghost had sat in. The Old Daoist always paid special attention to these spots when cleaning.\n\n  But this was the first time a small card was tucked inside the ghost notes. The card was black, not like the kind that gets slipped under a hotel door at night.\n\n  The card felt a little cold to the touch. Two lines of words were engraved on it:\n\n  \"Lost Town welcomes you, a new home for the departed.\"\n\n  Zhou Ze frowned slightly. *A new home for the departed?*\n\n  The proper home for the departed should be Hell. Where did this town suddenly come from?\n\n  \"Boss, they're stealing our business!\" the Old Daoist shouted directly.\n\n  Zhou Ze nodded.\n\n  Yes,\n\n  they were indeed stealing business.\n\n  \"No wonder not a single ghost came to the door while you were unconscious, Boss. I thought it was strange,\" Bai Yingying said.\n\n  Boss Zhou enjoyed lying around the bookstore, reading the paper, drinking coffee, and being a salted fish. But that was all predicated on the foundation of souls coming to his door every day to deliver business and ghost money. Now that someone was stealing his business, Boss Zhou was certainly not magnanimous enough to just smile and ignore it.\n\n  Moreover, according to the rules of the underworld, every region in the mortal realm has a corresponding ghost emissary in charge. In this region, the ghost emissary has a monopoly on the local soul delivery industry. And once a monopoly is established and one gets used to it, if any competition appears, the monopolist certainly won't think about improving their service to increase their competitiveness. Instead, they will instinctively choose to annex and suppress.\n\n  Just like Boss Zhou at this moment. He didn't even consider developing new activities at his bookstore to attract souls. He instinctively chose a more direct and brutal method.\n\n  \"Call Lin Ke. We're heading out at three in the morning.\"\n\n  Zhou Ze lit a cigarette. The little loli had to pull her weight in this matter, too. All this time, Zhou Ze had been eating the meat, and the little loli drinking the soup next to him had also gained performance merits. This new competitor was essentially smashing both their businesses.\n\n  \"Go out and have a talk with them?\" the Old Daoist asked.\n\n  Zhou Ze looked at the Old Daoist and smiled.\n\n  He said:\n\n  \"Waste them.\"\n\n  Anything that gets in the way of my salted fish life...\n\n  is heresy,\n\n  and must be resolutely crushed!\n\n  Those who hinder my life as a salted fish...\n\n  die",

After all, he held her soul blood, so he didn’t need to play any “caring for his subordinate” games. Besides, ever since they’d met, the Little Loli had treated him as a disposable item to be used up and destroyed, so there was no need to play at being sentimental.\n\nWhen he needed her, he’d call her over and use her ruthlessly.\n\nToss her aside when he was done, and they’d each go their own way. The next time he needed her, another phone call, and she’d have to come running.\n\nDid Boss Zhou really not know that the Little Loli had long been hoping he’d die?\n\nIf she wanted to hope, then let her. A man who’d already died once wasn’t really bothered by such taboos.\n\n***\n\nStepping out of the bookstore, Zhou Ze was somewhat surprised to find that a new private kitchen had opened up right next door. It was called “Wang Fu Ju Private Kitchen,” and he figured it must have opened during the half-month he was unconscious.\n\nAn old man happened to be standing at the entrance. He had a bald head, wore white clothes, and was younger than the Old Daoist, probably only in his fifties. He looked like the sort of old men and women who do Tai Chi in the morning.\n\nAt three in the morning, he was actually still sitting at the entrance to his shop in a rattan chair with a pot of tea, drinking by himself.\n\n“Yo, you must be Boss Zhou, right? You’re back!”\n\nThe old man was overly familiar and recognized Zhou Ze. He had likely gotten familiar with the others in the bookstore while Zhou Ze was unconscious, but had always known the shop had a mysterious, rarely seen boss.\n\nOf course, he didn’t know that the boss had been in the shop the whole time, just unconscious.\n\nZhou Ze was a bit surprised. Opening a private kitchen in a place as expensive as South Avenue was in itself a statement of prestige. Many private kitchens were very proud, making it clear they’ll only serve a set number of tables per day, and they’ll even take holidays off. You want to eat here? Fine, wait. Get in line.\n\nBut this owner was a bit too enthusiastic toward him, even solicitous.\n\nSoon enough, though, Zhou Ze figured it out. In this owner’s eyes, a guy who would open a bookstore that was guaranteed to lose money in such a prime, expensive location had to have a powerful background.\n\nHe was either a fool or a big shot with more money than he knew what to do with, simply indulging in a passion project.\n\nAfter seeing Zhou Ze, the owner ruled out the first possibility, because Zhou Ze clearly didn’t look like a fool.\n\nThe man offered him a business card and a cigarette. Zhou Ze waved his hand to decline, indicating he understood. The owner, taking the hint, said to come by for a meal sometime and then left.\n\n“That restaurant owner seems like a nice guy.”\n\nXu Qinglang, having changed his clothes, walked out just then.\n\nZhou Ze was noncommittal.\n\n“You seem a bit unhappy with him?”\n\n“Heh, you wake up from a nap and find a new ‘Old Wang next door,’¹ you think you’d be happy?”\n\nXu Qinglang yawned.\n\n“But you should be pretty happy. Private kitchen owners are supposed to have their specialties and whatnot. Haven’t you gone over to exchange pointers?” Zhou Ze asked.\n\n“The cooking fumes are bad for the skin. I didn’t go,” Xu Qinglang replied.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head, sighing internally at the decline of public morals and the loss of ancient virtues. The diligent, hard-working Xu Qinglang who once ran a noodle shop had long since vanished into the breeze of memory.\n\nBut then again, it seemed Xu Qinglang had become like this after meeting him. Could this also be a case of being colored by one’s companions?\n\nThinking more carefully, he himself had been a very diligent and hardworking person in his past life. How was it that after dying once, he was like a punctured ball, completely deflated?\n\n***\n\nThe Little Loli arrived, still carrying her schoolbag, and stood pouting on the other side of the road. Under the dim yellow streetlights at the intersection in the dead of night, the sudden appearance of such a lovely young girl brought not a pleasant surprise, but a fright.\n\nXu Qinglang drove, Zhou Ze sat in the front passenger seat, and the Little Loli got in the back, still pouting.\n\nIt was best for Yingying to rest right now, and the Old Daoist was watching the store, so Zhou Ze just roped in Xu Qinglang to be the driver.\n\nHaving learned from the hot spring hotel incident, Zhou Ze was more cautious. There was no need to drag a big group along for everything. He didn't want them to get into an accident when he himself didn't die; he'd feel bad about it.\n\nThe card had no address, but when Zhou Ze ran his fingernail over it, he could sense a location. The departed souls didn’t need to look; they could sense it too.\n\nZhou Ze gave directions while Xu Qinglang drove. About twenty minutes later, the car arrived at a small town on the outskirts of Gangzha District.\n\nAfter getting out of the car, they saw ridges of farmland ahead, with wheat seedlings stretching out in a vast expanse, dotted with a few houses.\n\nThis was the location; it had to be right.\n\nZhou Ze turned around, planning to get the Little Loli out to help him look, only to find her sitting in the back seat doing homework.\n\n*Knock, knock, knock…*\n\nZhou Ze reached out and knocked on the car window.\n\nHe really wanted to ask, *Are you here for comic relief?*\n\nThe Little Loli snapped her notebook shut with an annoyed air.\n\n“Her homework load is pretty heavy,” she said. “I just happened to wake up, so I thought I’d help her finish this week’s assignments. It’ll make things easier for her.”\n\nZhou Ze’s gaze narrowed. He was reminded of the female ghost emissary who had previously possessed his sister-in-law. She must have had the same problem: the host’s thoughts had influenced her own, causing her to become somewhat mentally unstable.\n\nIt seemed to be a common ailment: any ghost emissary who chose to inhabit a living person’s body would be affected?\n\nBut Zhou Ze didn’t say anything more. He was here to crash a party today, and he didn’t have the leisure to discuss life philosophies with the Little Loli.\n\nPushing open the car door, the Little Loli stretched, took a deep breath, and then said:\n\n“I don’t feel anything.”\n\n“How have your sales been lately?” Zhou Ze asked.\n\n“Terrible,” the Little Loli replied.\n\nZhou Ze took out the black card and studied it carefully for a while longer, then looked around again. “Is it because we all have bodies that we can’t find the place?”\n\n“Or maybe they sensed us coming and hid themselves in advance?” The Little Loli shrugged, taking the card from Zhou Ze's hand. She continued, “It’s like those little escort cards they slip under hotel room doors. They change locations and phone numbers after a while, too. To avoid the vice squad, you know.”\n\nZhou Ze thought the Little Loli had a point, but he was unwilling to return empty-handed. For all he knew, the moment he left, that little town would open for business again.\n\nIf that happened, how could he lie around his bookstore day and night in leisurely comfort if he couldn’t even see a single ghost?\n\nOn a small scale, this would affect his future quality of life.\n\nOn a large scale, this was a loss of the Underworld’s state-owned assets.\n\n“You guys don’t feel anything?”\n\nXu Qinglang asked, turning around.\n\nOnly then did Zhou Ze notice that Xu Qinglang had a paper talisman stuck to his forehead. He had worn the same one when he entered Sanxiang Village, and also when the Old Daoist had him possessed by a ghost.\n\nIt was the simplest kind of talisman, one that anyone with a bit of skill could draw.\n\nIt was like health supplements.\n\nSupplements that actually make you healthier and alleviate illnesses are incredibly hard to come by, one in a thousand.\n\nBut the kind that just makes you feel a little full with no real benefits or drawbacks are easy to make; most on the market are like this.\n\nAs for the kind that can make you sick, cause problems, or even make you kick the bucket, that’s even simpler.\n\nThis talisman was for living people, meant to lower their yang energy. It belonged to the last category of supplements.\n\n“What did you see?” Zhou Ze asked curiously.\n\nXu Qinglang pointed ahead. Zhou Ze followed his gaze and saw a grave mound. It wasn't very conspicuous, and there were many small, colorful flags stuck in front of it.\n\nChildren who grew up in the countryside would be familiar with this; many kids like to pull out the little flags from gravesites and wave them around as toys.\n\n“What’s there?”\n\nZhou Ze asked Xu Qinglang, while also glancing at the Little Loli, who looked just as confused as he was.\n\nThis shouldn’t be happening.\n\nXu Qinglang was just a dabbler at best. How could he see a trick that two ghost emissaries had missed?\n\nThe Little Loli seemed to understand something. She immediately closed her eyes. Zhou Ze felt the aura of the Little Loli beside him suddenly weaken, to the point where she seemed frail and sickly. When she opened her eyes again, she looked in that direction and said:\n\n“Found it. It’s right there.”\n\n“How did you do that?” Zhou Ze asked.\n\n“Lower your aura. That place is where lonely souls and wandering ghosts gather. You and I are both borrowing living bodies, so our yang energy is naturally strong. You have to lower your own aura to blend into their environment.\n\n“Close your eyes and imagine the feeling of being sick. In short, you just have to keep giving yourself the psychological suggestion that you’re tired, you’re weak, you’re about to die.”\n\nHearing this, Zhou Ze closed his eyes and kept recalling that feeling in his mind. Slowly, he seemed to find the threshold. When he opened his eyes again,\n\nhis perception of the grave mound had changed.\n\nThe once simple and unremarkable grave mound now looked like a memorial archway. It had the feel of an ancient brothel, even decorated with lanterns and colorful banners. At the entrance, a short little man dressed in the clothes of an ancient pimp was greeting and seeing off guests.\n\nThe three of them took the initiative and walked over.\n\nAt first, the pimp didn’t notice them. It was perhaps just as the Little Loli had said: ghosts have their circle and people have theirs. Even though a ghost emissary can see ghosts, it doesn’t mean they belong to that circle. That’s why the pimp couldn't see Zhou Ze before, just as Zhou Ze hadn’t seen anything unusual about the grave mound.\n\n“Yo, sirs, come in, please come in!”\n\nThe pimp bowed low as he served them, making his already short stature seem even smaller.\n\nZhou Ze nodded and was the first to enter. The threshold was a bit low, and he had to stoop to get in. Once inside, the space suddenly opened up.\n\nWell now,\n\nThere were dancers,\n\nopera singers,\n\nacrobats performing.\n\nThe place was brightly lit,\nfilled with the chatter of women,\nand bustling with excitement.\n\nTruly, without comparison, there is no suffering.\n\nZhou Ze felt that if he were a ghost, he would also choose to come here to hang out and indulge himself, rather than go to the boring bookstore for a half-hearted cold platter prepared by Xu Qinglang, only to be slapped into the Gate of Hell by Zhou Ze.\n\n“Yo, sir, come on up! Come and play, come and play!”\n\n“That’s right, sir, come on! Come upstairs, we’ll take good care of you!”\n\nZhou Ze looked up at the second floor to his right and saw many women in bright red dresses on the balcony, waving their fans and calling out to him.\n\nThe makeup on these women's faces was as thick as the style favored by the Japanese—ghastly white faces paired with bright red little mouths, a truly horrifying sight.\n\n“Hahahaha…”\n\nA hearty laugh came from upstairs. Immediately after, Zhou Ze saw a portly, blindfolded man playing hide-and-seek with a group of young ladies. He accidentally stumbled onto the balcony, grabbed a woman who had just been waving at Zhou Ze, and kissed her directly.\n\nThe sight made Zhou Ze’s teeth ache.\n\nA thick, greasy layer of rouge was left on the man’s lips.\n\nBut Zhou Ze soon realized something was off.\n\nThe man was bald.\n\nAnd not just bald—his head was covered in scabby sores.\n\n“Scabby-Headed Monk!”\n\nZhou Ze yelled out directly.\n\n“Who… who called me?”\n\nThe Scabby-Headed Monk immediately tore off his blindfold and spotted Zhou Ze standing below.\n\nHe instantly shivered in fright and shouted:\n\n“Vice raid! The cops are here for a vice raid!”\n\n***\n¹`隔壁老王` (gébì Lǎo Wáng), or “Old Wang next door,” is a popular Chinese meme referring to a neighbor who is cuckolding a man, i.e., sleeping with his wife.

    "content": "Zhou Ze had never imagined he'd run into the Scabby-headed Monk here of all places.\n\nThe monk had once shown up at his shop, rambling on and on about ideals and aspirations, and Zhou Ze had eventually humored him until he left. He never expected him to appear here.\n\nAs he recalled, the monk's philosophy was that all beings were equal, that both humans and ghosts had the right to remain where they pleased, and that Ghost Emissaries needed to respect human rights—oh, no, *ghost* rights—and couldn't forcibly send ghosts to Hell.\n\nTo Zhou Ze at the time, the monk had sounded like a classic case of chuunibyou,¹ like one of those people poisoned by magazines like *Reader* and *Digest*,² his head filled with thoughts of how united, tough, and resilient Japanese children were, how orderly they were in a crisis, how advanced foreign countries were, how backward their own country was, and so on—completely out of touch with reality.\n\nNow, the Scabby-headed Monk's loud cry of \"Vice raid!\" instantly sent the street into an uproar.\n\nIndeed, given Zhou Ze's status, he could certainly be considered an officer of the Underworld. And this place was, indeed, a place that couldn't see the light of day. To put it nicely, it was a small town for the departed, but in the eyes of the Underworld orthodoxy, it was an illegal shantytown of unregistered entities, a target that needed to be decisively dealt with.\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nEvery household began to shut its doors and windows. The street performers and loiterers all ducked into the alleyways. Even the heavily made-up young ladies who had just been calling for Zhou Ze to come up and play from the second floor vanished from sight.\n\n\"Whoa.\"\n\nXu Qinglang walked over. He had been engrossed in watching a variety show just a moment ago; now there was nothing left to see.\n\n\"Where's Lin Ke?\" Zhou Ze asked Xu Qinglang.\n\nThe three of them had entered one by one when the street was bustling. Now the street was completely empty, yet he only saw Xu Qinglang and not the little loli.\n\n\"No idea. Probably hiding somewhere doing her homework.\"\n\nThat actually seemed like a real possibility.\n\nThe little loli was clearly not normal anymore, or rather, she was trending toward not being normal.\n\nThe thought of that Hell Girl, who upon their first meeting had opened her mouth, stuck out her tongue, and chanted, \"Order in the Underworld, the Yellow Springs can be crossed,\" now actually thinking about doing elementary school homework…\n\nThe whole vibe was so damn WTF.³\n\nZhou Ze had never been in a vice raid himself, though he'd had to bail out a few colleagues. It used to be you could pay five thousand yuan, find a guarantor to write a letter, and get the person out. But he'd heard the policy had changed: get caught with a prostitute, and if you were married, they were required to notify your spouse.\n\nWell, regardless, this den of filth had to be cleaned out. Crucially, it was affecting his business, and that was absolutely not allowed.\n\n\"Kick the door in,\" Zhou Ze said to Xu Qinglang.\n\nXu Qinglang really wanted to ask, \"Why don't you do it?\" but decided it wasn't worth arguing about. He walked up, reached out, and tapped on the door as gently as a neighbor stopping by for a chat.\n\nThe corner of Zhou Ze's mouth twitched.\n\nHe had told Xu Qinglang to *kick* the door.\n\nBut Xu Qinglang's action, if paired with the line, \"Mama, open up! It's me, I'm home!\"…\n\n...would have been a perfect fit.\n\nZhou Ze strode over and kicked the door himself.\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nThe door shattered instantly, as if it were made of paper.\n\nIn truth, most things here were one part real and nine parts fake, just like the meal Lady Bai had served him and Xu Qinglang.\n\nAlthough the door couldn't take a kick, the effect was spectacular. Walking behind him, Xu Qinglang felt that this was the perfect moment to take a video of Zhou Ze. If the Underworld had an official newspaper, he could even submit it.\n\nThe headline would be: *In 2018, under the correct leadership of the Underworld and with the direct guidance of the Ten Yama Kings, our county's officers, led by Constable Zhou Ze, have resolutely implemented the spirit of Kṣitigarbha Bodhisattva's meeting on the current anti-vice and anti-piracy campaign. With the purification of the ghost-catching market as our primary mission, we have focused on key tasks, further strengthened daily supervision, and steadfastly promoted the sustained and effective implementation of this crackdown, thereby protecting the business order of our city's \"Midnight Bookstore\"; we have forged a solid line of defense for the maintenance of our city's cultural security and created a favorable social and cultural environment for our city's economic development.*\n\nThe thought was amusing enough that Xu Qinglang actually covered his mouth and chuckled behind him.\n\nHe truly wasn't nervous. With Boss Zhou here, he felt a sense of security and wasn't flustered at all. The last time at the hot spring resort, Boss Zhou had been unconscious; otherwise, things probably wouldn't have been so difficult.\n\nUpon entering, they found themselves in a large hall with several spaces sectioned off by screens. The decor and layout were all antique and elegant. Looking up and around, Zhou Ze saw a line of young ladies standing along the inner railing of the second floor, staring blankly down at them.\n\nThe young ladies' sudden prim and proper demeanor was actually a bit unsettling for Zhou Ze, and the atmosphere grew much more oppressive.\n\nMoreover, these ladies were swaying back and forth unceasingly, as if silently singing and bobbing their heads. Their synchronized movements only added to the grim and murderous feeling in the air.\n\nXu Qinglang followed Zhou Ze inside, but upon entering, he sensed that the atmosphere was a bit off. He shamelessly took a step back and, after a moment's thought, retreated all the way back outside the door.\n\nWhat the hell kind of vice raid looked like this? This was clearly a Feast at Hong Gate.⁴\n\n\"Hey, sir, won't you please come inside?\"\n\nThe short panderer reached out and gave Xu Qinglang a gentle push on the back. Xu Qinglang felt an icy chill run down his spine, followed by a wave of dizziness. In the next instant, he found himself standing right in front of Zhou Ze.\n\nThe panderer stood at the door, smiled, turned, and closed it. He was just short of yelling, \"Shut the door and beat the dog!\"\n\nTo be honest, no matter the trade, when encountering a competitor, few would just show up and start smashing the place. Usually, they'd first try to get a sense of the other party's background and connections.\n\nBut Boss Zhou couldn't wait, and he didn't want to. This matter had touched his reverse scale.⁵\n\nAnd another thing…\n\nBoss Zhou had gotten a little cocky.\n\nNow, he had his armor.\n\nAnd he could go into Musou mode.⁶\n\nHe didn't even take the little loli seriously anymore, let alone anyone else.\n\n\"My, my, a guest has arrived. Calm down, calm down.\"\n\nThe Scabby-headed Monk descended from the second floor. The panderer brought him a chair, and he sat down without any ceremony, not bothering to offer one to Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Is this your doing?\"\n\nSeeing as the Scabby-headed Monk had been playing a blindfolded game of hide-and-seek on the second floor earlier, he really had been up to some \"ghostly\" business.\n\n\"Oh, you flatter me, venerable sir. This humble monk is just here to have some fun, to join the excitement. I am but a passerby in this mortal world. No matter the time or place, I am only a traveler, merely changing my method of cultivation.\"\n\nThe Scabby-headed Monk denied it.\n\n\"Then there must be someone in charge here, right?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nAt the same time, Zhou Ze's patience was slowly wearing thin.\n\nHe was here to wreck the place to begin with.\n\nThere was no need to talk reason.\n\nWhen his most vital interests were being violated, there was no need for reason.\n\n\"Is the Ghost Emissary really conducting a vice raid?\"\n\nThe Scabby-headed Monk rubbed his head, looking very troubled.\n\n\"Unfortunately, the person in charge isn't here. This humble monk is just watching the place for him. How about this, Emissary, can we take a rain check? When he returns, I'll have him come find you. If that doesn't work, I'll persuade him to move somewhere else after a while?\"\n\n\"After a while?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Surely the Emissary isn't unwilling to grant even a little bit of time?\"\n\n\"Grant?\"\n\nZhou Ze shot back, then took a step forward, and another.\n\n*You want to talk to me about granting extensions?*\n\nIf you didn't count the soul of that soccer player drawn in by the match and the bitter plaintiff…\n\n...according to Bai Yingying, the bookstore had been without business for the entire half-month he was unconscious!\n\nWhy the hell did I move the bookstore to South Avenue? Wasn't it so I could enjoy a greater flow of human and ghost traffic, so I could lie around comfortably at home and wait for ghosts to come to me?\n\nNow the ghosts are all gone. How am I supposed to lie around?\n\nThe thought of no longer being able to be a salted fish loafing in the bookstore, of having to run around chasing ghosts instead…\n\n...really pissed Zhou Ze off.\n\n\"Sir, please, calm your anger. Let this lowly one arrange a few skilled girls for you. I guarantee they'll serve you until you're completely satisfied.\"\n\nThe panderer took the initiative to step forward and speak, intending to give Zhou Ze a way to back down gracefully.\n\nBut he had severely underestimated the importance Boss Zhou placed on this matter.\n\nA single day's extension…\n\n...was impossible!\n\n\"嗡!\" (Omm!)\n\nZhou Ze raised his hand and slapped it down on the panderer's head. Simultaneously, his fingernails grew long and stabbed downward.\n\nThe panderer's expression changed drastically.\n\nBut then his small head suddenly retracted, and his body, like a hedgehog's, sprouted black quills. It was like an emergency reflex; the quills on his body bristled and shot directly at Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Clink... clink... clink...\"\n\nZhou Ze's body was instantly covered in armor. The black quills shattered upon impact, some even dissipating into puffs of green smoke.\n\n\"You're quite the troublemaker.\"\n\nZhou Ze said, looking down at the panderer with his head retracted.\n\nThen he kicked out.\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nThe panderer was sent flying like a rubber ball. As he flew through the air, Zhou Ze extended his hand, and black qi emanated from his five fingertips, wrapping around the panderer and pulling him back.\n\nLike passing the ball to himself seven seconds in the future.\n\nThe panderer let out a shriek.\n\nClearly, he knew his end was near. This aggressive emissary seemed to have no intention of letting him off or holding back.\n\nSeeing this, the Scabby-headed Monk immediately stood up.\n\nHe pressed his palms together:\n\n\"Amitābha. Where it is possible to let people off, one should let them off. Emissary Zhou, listen to my advice. Spare me a little face and let him go for now. You and I are people of status. Why lower ourselves to bicker with these small fries?\"\n\n\"Splat!\"\n\nA crisp sound echoed.\n\nLike a watermelon hitting the ground.\n\nClear,\n\nLoud,\n\nSizzling.\n\nA pool of crimson liquid dripped from Zhou Ze's palm.\n\nAnd below,\n\nwas a puddle of meat paste.\n\nCurled into a ball, with barbs sticking out,\n\nit was clearly a hedgehog.\n\nNow, it was dead as dead could be.\n\nZhou Ze lifted his head.\n\nClad in his black armor, he looked much more menacing, especially with the runes on the armor constantly shifting, which added an aura of mystery.\n\nHe looked at the Scabby-headed Monk before him,\n\nand asked with a puzzled expression:\n\n\"What were you just saying?\n\nFace?\"\n\n***\n\n**Footnotes:**\n\n1.  **Chuunibyou (中二病):** A Japanese term, literally \"middle school second-year syndrome,\" used to describe teenagers who have grandiose delusions, fantasize about having secret knowledge or special powers, and act overly dramatic.\n2.  ***Reader* and *Digest* (《讀者》《文摘》):** Two very popular magazines in China, similar in style to the American *Reader's Digest*.

    "content": "Monk Wutou touched his head with some pains, then put down his arms slowly, crossed his hands slowly, and said at the same time:\n\n\n\n\"Zhoushi's agent, the sect is very big, I know;\n\n\n\nBut here is the sun. No matter how long your Yin Shi’s hands are, you can’t imagine the wind here.\n\n\n\nAnd,\n\n\n\nThe monk is not silent yet.”\n\n\n\nThe monk's arms suddenly lifted up, and two talismans appeared in his palm. The talisman was purple. At this time, some snakes were flowing inside.\n\n\n\nWhen Monk Wentou first entered the bookstore, he mocked the old Taoist, pointing out that he and the old Taoist were not the same person, because in his opinion, the old Taoist was nothing but a charlatan who was eating and drinking, and he was a real Taoist existence.\n\n\n\n\"Haoshi……………………………………………………………………………………”\n\n\n\nThe row of young ladies standing on the second floor, which was densely packed with voices, made this sound in their mouths. For a while, the first floor actually caused a gaze to rise.\n\n\n\nA monk,\n\n\n\nCooperating with a group of ghosts,\n\n\n\nThis combination has a bit of a difference.\n\n\n\nBut in reality, it actually added some sense of fighting on the main stage to the monk Fengtou.\n\n\n\n\"I don't care about the living things, but the ghost things are mine. You, a monk, have crossed the boundaries.\"\n\n\n\n\"Let's see, whoever dies and lives, I really think that if you take the Ghost Crew, there will be no enemy in the world. The world is big, but it is not just a city.\"\n\n\n\nThe monk Fengtou rushed up directly. His head was not tall, but his thighs were very thick. This short-legged tiger could be as good as the sky when running.\n\n\n\n\"Haoshi…………………………………………………………”\n\n\n\nZhou Ze is preparing to move past the same way.\n\n\n\nAt this time, a black silk spit out from a young lady's mouth, and it fell down in an instant, lying on his armor. Then, the originally soft wire suddenly exerted force together. In that moment, Zhou Ze was like a treasure lying trapped by a spider net.\n\n\n\nSubconsciously trying to slap, I felt like I was trapped in a quagmire and could not extricate myself\n\n\n\nAnd the monk Fengtou is approaching, and Zhou Ze can even hear the \"sizzling\" sound from the other party's palm talisman paper\n\n\n\nClose your eyes,\n\n\n\nThere is no way out,\n\n\n\nZhou Ze can only choose which state to enter.\n\n\n\nAlthough my body is not very good now and I have not completely recovered, Zhou Cheng felt that solving the trouble in front of me was impossible. At worst, he could be in a coma for another half a month.\n\n\n\n\"Buzz\"\n\n\n\nJust as Zhou Ze just closed his eyes, a long tongue suddenly extended from the second floor, sucking it hard like a whip.\n\n\n\n\"Fucking sex......\"\n\n\n\nIt seems that every young lady was slapped hard on the face\n\n\n\nAll the wires lying on Zhou Ze's armor should also be sounded and Zhou Ze regained his freedom.\n\n\n\nXiao Luoli's figure appeared in the second floor, holding a book \"Collection of Third-Year Mathematics Questions\" in her handShe actually secretly found a place to do an industrial business\n\n\n\nXiao Luoli rubbed her eyes, yawned, stretched out her tongue and licked her lips, then held her hand on the column, looking at Zhou Ze below, she was so stupid and cute that she was a little girl who stayed up late to work and couldn't help but feel sleepy.\n\n\n\nWhen Monk Wutou came to Zhou Ze, Zhou Ze's fingernails were inserted directly\n\n\n\n\"Puff\"\n\n\n\nThe monk Fengtou's two palms were penetrated by Zhou Ze's ten fingers.\n\n\n\nBut in the sky,\n\n\n\nThe snake on the talisman seemed to have been taken to a living machine and directly penetrated into Zhou Ze's body. Zhou Ze only felt that his whole body was paralyzed and he knelt down subconsciously.\n\n\n\nEven though the monk Fengtou was holding his palms through, he remained standing, with a mocking smile on the corner of his mouth\n\n\n\n\"The monk said………”\n\n\n\nNext moment,\n\n\n\nZhou Ze raised his head, and his fingernails grew longer\n\n\n\n\"Puff\"\n\n\n\nIt sounds like the sound of cloth being torn apart,\n\n\n\nThe monk's two palms exploded directly,\n\n\n\n\"Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh\n\n\n\nThe monk Huotao kept retreating. After losing his hands, he looked so inconsistent, especially his arms that looked like a popsicle, which looked very abrupt.\n\n\n\nZhou Ze took a few deep breaths.\n\n\n\nHe was a little tired.\n\n\n\nBecause Xiao Luoli's previous help, he still didn't choose to enter that state. If he can't get angry, he won't get angry. Who likes to be in a coma without having sex?\n\n\n\n  Stand up a little reluctantly, there were many pit marks on the armor, like scars left after being burned by fire\n\n\n\nIn fact, if you didn’t have this armor, the talisman of the monk Mian was probably going to be killed by Zhou Ze. That thing is really a huge nemesis for ghosts.\n\n\n\nThe monk Lintou held his hands behind his body, with the head facing upwards, and he was still paying attention to maintaining his pride at this time.\n\n\n\nZhou Ze felt a little strange because when he met in the bookstore last time, although Monk Wentou seemed a little second in his opinion, he still had the aura of a monk. Why is this person here not only jumping around when playing with women fighting\n\n\n\nThis is not something that celebrities like to play with.\n\n\n\nThe contrast between people before and after the goods is really hard to figure out\n\n\n\n\"Hao!...\"\n\n\n\nThe ladies on the second floor seem to want to make trouble\n\n\n\nXiao Luli's mouth opened again after her head;\n\n\n\nThe long tongue was merciless this time, and directly pierced them one after another like candied haws, while the back snake danced and rolled in the second floor space.\n\n\n\nThe young ladies on their tongues also rotated and jumped together, and closed their eyes.In this way, it looks like a child who has not yet lost his heart and found a novel game, but soon she got into a slut and slammed her tongue. The girls on it fell down one by one, smashed on the ground, piled up together, like a paper man, or like a gas-filled doll that was released.\n\n\n\n Chang sighed,\n\n\n\nXiao Luoli stuck out her tongue, as if she was a little sore. Then she picked up the automatic pencil, turned on the topic, and urged:\n\n\n\n\"You continue, I'll do an acting career\"\n\n\n\nAfter not seeing it for half a month, Zhou Ze discovered that Xiao Luli seemed to have returned to the cold and arrogant feeling she used to be, and her style of acting was also unrestrained.\n\n\n\nIt’s like she was reading books in her bookstore at the beginning. When she was tired, she ran to the next door to take away the soul of Xu Qinglang’s father. She looked at Xu Qinglang lying on the ground and cried bitterly, then slapped her hand and went back to read the books next door.\n\n\n\nMaybe it is because her injuries have completely recovered.\n\n\n\nBut your soul blood is still in my hands.\n\n\n\nI'm very upset about your arrogance.\n\n\n\nAre you the boss or I the boss\n\n\n\nZhou Ze wanted to let Xiao Luli come down to fight with great enthusiasm, but he also felt that the child said he wanted to write an adult to beat her, and it seemed that it was a bit unsuitable for her.\n\n\n\nMonk Wutou was not idle at this time. He bit his tongue and spit out a mouthful of blood, but started chanting mantras in his mouth.\n\n \n\nFor a while, the sound of the Buddhist sacred sound was as if a converging light hit him from behind, carrying an inviolable breath of the sacred sacred\n\n\n\nThis light made Zhou Ze a little uncomfortable.\n\n\n\nMany times, Zhou Ze forgot that he was actually a ghost, but instead thought he was a human being. It was not until this moment that he clearly felt that the different paths of human beings and ghosts\n\n\n\nIn this world, there are really many things that naturally restrain ghosts.\n\n\n\nFortunately, Xu Qinglang was not idle at this time. He was very straightforward and did not take talismans or protectors, because he knew that his things were all against ghosts. Similarly, no matter how cool the monk's Buddha light poss was, it could only have some effect on Zhou Ze. It was not very effective for Xu Qinglang, and it could even be said that it was not.\n\n\n\nTherefore, Xu Qinglang used the most direct method to directly punch him\n\n\n\nMaybe he can fight. Although he looks like a woman, he is a hooligan when he is young. If he had not been ordered by the police chief to change his evil spirits, he might have been a very non-mainstream gangster now, and his fist skills are actually good.\n\n\n\nThe monk Wentou has not read a few sentences in the essay, but he has been pursuing Xu Qinglang for several punches.\n\n\n\nThis is a bit bullying.\n\n\n\nThe monk Wentou was indeed higher than Xu Qinglang, but many of his magic gates were used to deal with monsters and ghosts. Xu Qinglang was a human being, so what he learned in his life became the Dragon-slaughtering skill, and he could not use it at all.\n\n\n\nIn addition, the monk's hands were torn apart by Zhou Ze, so he was beaten so hard that he had no temper at all.Xu Qinglang was getting worse and worse, and he simply overturned the monk to the ground, and then he sat on him with a golden sword and went back to slap him.\n\n\n\n\"Fucking sex\"\n\n\n\nZhou Ze slowly took back the armor on his body.\n\n\n\nHe remembered that Xu Qinglang used to say that he was like a fight between a woman and only knew how to catch a slap.\n\n\n\nNow look at the way Xu Qinglang fights,\n\n\n\n  号\n\n\n\nLike those young ladies, the monk Lintou was beaten to the point where he began to lose his breath.\n\n\n\nIn the end,\n\n\n\nAs he twitched, the monk Qingtou became a paper man. The man painted the image of the monk Qingtou, with the seven words \"Hate, Anger, Ignorance, Hate, Love, Desire,\" written on it.\n\n\n\nXiao Luli walked down the building, looked at the paper on the ground, and said, \"This is not the true body of the monk. It should be the substitute left behind. It is a really good way to leave behind the things that broke the precepts on her body, and she only has pure purity and Buddha nature.\"\n\n\n\nZhou Ze pointed at the head, and it can be said that the monk Kuangtou responded in a different way.\n\n\n\nBut, what exactly exists here\n\n\n\nOr say...secret\n\n\n\nZhou Ze walked forward and tried to push the screen in front of him. He found that the screen was fake and painted on the wall.\n\n\n\n\"The space here seems to be very large, but it is actually very small, including the rooms on the second floor, and the doors and windows are all painted,\" said Xiao Lin.\n\n\n\nZhou Ze took two steps back.\n\n\n\nThen he stabbed forward and kicked the screen with one foot\n\n\n\n\"Bang\"\n\n\n\nThe screen was broken,\n\n\n\nEven the wall collapsed along with it.\n\n\n\n Front,\n\n\n\nIt is a very dark space.\n\n\n\nThere are dozens of people who are dressed in different ages standing alone, shaking constantly. They are the souls of the dead, which is the career loss of boss Zhou during this period.\n\n\n\nAnd under the foot of the dead soul, several flowers bloomed scatteredly\n\n\n\nThe petals are graceful,\n\n\n\nThe flower stamen is encouraging,\n\n\n\nThe fragrance of flowers sniffs,\n\n\n\nHua Zhitingting\n\n\n\n\"What kind of flower is this? It's so beautiful. I haven't seen it before\n\n\n\nToday is not 520\n\n\n\nIt’s just right to go back and give it to someone, it’s not a waste of time, right?”\n\n\n\nXu Qinglang pointed to the flower in front and asked\n\n\n\nThen he didn't get a response.\n\n\n\nTurning over and looking behind him,\n\n\n\nXu Qinglang discovered that Zhou Ze and Xiao Luli both looked at him with a fool's eyes\n\n\n\n\"What's the amount?\" Xu Qinglang asked in confusion\n\n\n\nXiao Luli pointed to the flower in front of her and looked at Xu Qinglang.\n\n\n\nOpened:\n\n\n\n\"The flowers bloom on the other side of the river are no longer shore, and the soul falls and forgets the river. The watch is in the river.\n\n\n\nThis is……………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………",

    "content": "The Red Spider Lily, blooming along the Yellow Springs Road, exudes a unique, faint fragrance. It is a companion for the dead on their journey home, one of the few splashes of color in the Underworld.\n\nIt is a product unique to the Underworld. This is different from the saying, \"An orange grown south of the Huai River is an orange; grown north, it becomes a bitter orange.\"¹ This thing simply cannot grow in the world of the living.\n\nNow, it had been transplanted here. Although this was a special space and a unique environment, it was, after all, still in the mortal realm.\n\nOf course, compared to the \"wildflowers\" by the roadside, Boss Zhou was more interested in the batch of his \"performance\" up ahead.\n\nHowever, when Zhou Ze walked over to check on the condition of the lost souls, he found their forms to be very faint and their eyes dull, as if they were in a trance.\n\nLost souls have a shelf life. This shelf life is not measured in time. For example, a soul that becomes a vengeful ghost, even if it finally fulfills its lingering obsession, can only dissipate with the wind, having lost the chance to re-enter Hell and be reincarnated.\n\nAnd though the souls here had not become vengeful ghosts, they had long since lost their consciousness and thoughts. All that remained were simple balls of spiritual energy, no longer qualifying as true souls at all.\n\nHell wouldn't even take \"ghosts\" like these. Even if Zhou Ze forcibly sent them down, he wouldn't get a single point of performance credit.\n\nThis gave Boss Zhou a bit of a toothache. All that beautiful performance, wasted just like that.\n\nThe little loli stood to the side, bent down, and observed them carefully before speaking:\n\n\"This is normal. The Red Spider Lily is a special species that grows by absorbing the qi of the dead. Of course it can grow along the Yellow Springs Road; after all, so many of the dead walk that road every moment of every day. Even if each person dropped just one hair, it would be enough to nourish all those lilies.\n\n\"It's different here. The few Red Spider Lilies that have sprouted here were sustained entirely by these few dozen souls, day and night. Like human-shaped juicers, they've long been squeezed dry.\n\n\"If it weren't for the existence of this special space, they would have turned to ash the instant they were exposed to sunlight again.\"\n\n\"Who's behind this?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"I don't know, but a person or organization capable of something on this scale isn't someone we can touch. The only thing we can do is report this to our superiors.\"\n\nThe little loli reached out, wanting to pat Zhou Ze's shoulder, but she was too short to reach. It wasn't like before, when Zhou Ze was just a toy in her hands that she could make him pick her up so she could pat him. She seemed a little awkward.\n\nZhou Ze reached out and patted the little loli on the head.\n\nAfter that killing head-pat,\n\nThe little loli bit her lip.\n\nThis petty man never missed a chance to get back at her for what she'd done to him in the past, repeatedly reminding her that their positions had long since reversed.\n\n\"Leaving your sentences half-finished isn't a good habit,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Reporting this situation to the higher-ups will also earn a certain reward. This reward will be converted into performance credit. All in all, it should be no less than the performance from sending these dozens of souls to Hell.\"\n\n\"You should have said so earlier,\" Zhou Ze's mood instantly brightened.\n\nHowever, Zhou Ze quickly remembered something else and asked, \"Then you guys didn't report what happened in Rongcheng last time?\"\n\nThat guy from Rongcheng was still alive, and living quite vibrantly at that. Last time, he even slept for a while in his bookstore and shook out a floor full of Ghost Emissary credentials right in front of him. And there was no follow-up to that?\n\n\"His situation is a bit special. At the time, there were disagreements among the higher-ups on how to handle it, and no specific operational orders were given. We acted on our own based on privately received instructions we pieced together. So, when the mission failed, it failed. As long as he doesn't continue to stir up trouble, the matter will probably be put on the back burner,\" the little loli said.\n\n\"Oh, I see.\"\n\nZhou Ze reached out and patted the little loli's head again, ignoring her pouting lips. He even flicked her little mouth with his finger, as if teasing his own niece.\n\nThough, to be honest, the little loli was indeed of his niece's generation.\n\n\"So the Underworld Bureaucracy also has its power struggles? It's not monolithic?\"\n\nZhou Ze had originally thought the Underworld Bureaucracy was like a computer.\n\nThe little loli took a deep breath. She looked at Zhou Ze and suddenly felt like laughing, because she knew whose Ghost Emissary credentials Zhou Ze held. The original owner of those credentials, wasn't he the one who got screwed over by Kṣitigarbha Bodhisattva back in the day, losing even his own Mount Tai Prefecture and ending up with an extremely desolate fate?\n\n\"How much difference do you think there is between people and ghosts?\"\n\nThe little loli didn't specifically mention the Lord of Mount Tai. Some things, some schemes, were the handiwork of great figures. Even though the Lord of Mount Tai had long since fallen, the arrangements he left behind were not something a minor Ghost Emissary like her could comment on recklessly.\n\n\"So, we're leaving? What about these Red Spider Lilies? Do we collect them?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Send them to Hell. These things are ornamental flowers in Hell, but if they spread into the human world, they'll become something more terrifying than poppies. Their effect on the living is even more horrific.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded. He first walked back to his original spot and pointed at the hedgehog at his feet.\n\n\"Does this count as a demon beast?\"\n\nThis was the first time Zhou Ze had seen a monster. In the past year, he had mostly seen ghosts; he'd barely seen any demons. But this monster's debut was pretty lame, about the same as the monster foot soldiers from *Calabash Brothers* he watched as a child—no combat power to speak of.\n\n\"That's not a demon beast. You'll understand when we dig up this grave in a bit,\" the little loli shook her head.\n\nAfterward, the three of them left the brothel together, returning the way they came. As Zhou Ze walked out, he bent over again, then closed his eyes to adjust and calm himself. When he opened his eyes again, the memorial archway with hanging lanterns he had entered earlier had completely vanished, leaving only a burial mound.\n\nXu Qinglang also removed the paper talisman from his forehead and patted his own head. Apparently, wearing the talisman had quite a few side effects, a bit like having a cold and fever.\n\n\"Old Xu, I'll have to trouble you.\" Zhou Ze reached out and patted Xu Qinglang's shoulder. \"You seem to have tools in your car. Why don't you start digging?\"\n\n\"Why is it always me who has to dig up someone's grave...\"\n\nXu Qinglang instinctively wanted to refuse, but then he saw that Zhou Ze was a sick man, and the little loli had taken out her workbook. All right, then. Xu Qinglang stopped wasting words, took a multi-functional entrenching tool from his car, and started digging.\n\nThe reason he had it in his car was actually for self-defense. Carrying a knife could get it confiscated during a security check, so he kept this instead. It came in handy now.\n\nIn reality, he didn't have to dig for long. Because the inside was hollow, Xu Qinglang had only been digging for a short while when the ground beneath collapsed, revealing a pit of about twenty square meters.\n\n\"This must be the area we were in before. Actually, in that small town, only the brothel was accessible. The other shops on the street were all fake. You could look at them, but you couldn't enter. Even in that brothel, you could only stand in the open area on the first floor. The rooms upstairs for 'business' were just painted on,\" the little loli explained from the side.\n\nNumerous paper talismans were stuck to the walls of the pit, along with shadow puppets pasted here and there. They had different forms but were all lifelike. These were the street performers and hawkers, and of course, they included the young ladies and the bald-headed monk.\n\nZhou Ze jumped down into the pit. Following his memory of the location, he bent down, took the shovel, and started digging. Soon, several crimson things emerged, looking like pomegranates. Red juice even flowed out from within.\n\nThe scent was very fragrant.\n\n\"These are the Red Spider Lilies?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Yes, Red Spider Lilies,\" the little loli nodded. \"But in a normal, mortal environment, this is what they look like.\"\n\nXu Qinglang also wanted to come closer for a look, but as soon as he smelled a little of the fragrance, his expression changed drastically. He immediately sat down cross-legged and began chanting something, looking as though he had to calm his mind at all costs.\n\nSeeing his face instantly flush so red it looked like you could squeeze water out of it was proof of just how terrifying the effect of the Red Spider Lily was on ordinary people.\n\nEven poppies planted in the ground had to be processed to be turned into drugs, undergoing a series of transformations and operations. But not the Red Spider Lily. Just leaving it here, an ordinary person couldn't stand even a whiff of its scent.\n\nAnd Xu Qinglang had already been on guard, yet he still had to brace himself so sternly to resist it.\n\nZhou Ze dug around a bit more and found a few more bulbs. He also found the corpse of a dead hedgehog. This must have been the one he had killed earlier, though it had probably been dead for a long time—it was already dried like cured meat.\n\nThere was a paper talisman stuck to the hedgehog's body. Zhou Ze reached out and tore it off.\n\n\"You just asked me if this was a demon beast. I said it wasn't. This is just a type of essence spirit, created by placing an underworld soul talisman on an animal's corpse. It's much lower-grade than even a corpse spirit.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded. He didn't choose to burn all these Red Spider Lilies. Instead, he took off his shirt and wrapped all the things up in it.\n\n\"What are you doing?\" The little loli frowned.\n\n\"How about this? I'll take these things and wait somewhere with no people. You two go back and find me some well-sealed jars. This stuff is useful to me,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Don't play with fire,\" the little loli warned him, her expression grave.\n\n\"You know, just now I smelled this stuff and suddenly felt an appetite, a desire to eat something. It works much better than any plum juice or blueberry juice. It would be a real shame to burn this. I'll process it myself and use it as an appetizer before my meals.\"\n\nFor someone who had long since entered a state of lazy, salted-fish living, the problem of sleeping could be solved by hugging Bai Yingying. But the problem of eating... even the plum juice was really hard to drink.\n\nWith this stuff, he should be able to taste delicious food again. Zhou Ze felt that no matter how dangerous it was, he had to keep it.\n\n\"You... you...\"\n\nOn the side, Xu Qinglang's mantra of purity seemed unable to resist the hallucinatory effects of the scent.\n\nHe slowly stood up, pointed at Zhou Ze, his face flushed and full of amorousness, and as if scolding, yet also panting delicately, said:\n\n\"Don't you... want my... juice... anymore...\"\n\nIt seemed Old Xu was really deeply poisoned.\n\n\"Snap him out of it. Hearing that is so disgusting, I'm going to puke.\"\n\nZhou Ze pointed at the little loli.\n\nThe little loli stepped forward, her tongue shot out, and whipped Xu Qinglang across the neck. As if struck by lightning, Xu Qinglang passed out immediately. But even unconscious, his body continued to twitch, as if he were still doing something in his dreams.\n\nAfter dealing with Xu Qinglang, the little loli continued to stare at Zhou Ze with a sullen face.\n\n\"Don't bother warning me again. It's useless. To the people, food is heaven,\"² Zhou Ze said, quite domineeringly.\n\nThe little loli shook her head,\n\nand said:\n\n\"After you've prepared it, can you share some with me?\"\n\n---\n¹A famous Chinese saying from the *Yanzi Chunqiu*. It means that a person or thing's fundamental nature can be changed by its environment.\n²A very famous Chinese proverb (民以食為天 - mín yǐ shí wéi tiān), meaning that food is the most essential thing for the people, or food is the first necessity of life.",
