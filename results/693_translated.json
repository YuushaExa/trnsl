    "content": "Summer of 2010.\n\nIt was very hot, comparable to Tokyo.\n\nIn a dormitory building at Jiangcheng University, Donghua Province.\n\n\"Brother Qi, stop sleeping! Your phone has been ringing for ages. I reckon someone important is trying to reach you.\"\n\nGuo Qi was sound asleep when he suddenly felt someone vigorously pulling at his blanket.\n\nWho is this, so annoying!\n\nWait, didn't I rent a one-bedroom apartment? How can there be other people?\n\nHis body jolted, and Guo Qi instantly woke up, sitting up from the bed.\n\nUnfamiliar surroundings, looking like a university dormitory. In front of him, a shirtless, burly man was still pulling at his blanket.\n\nWhere is this?\n\nHow did I get here?\n\nWhat does this brother want to do?\n\n...\n\nCountless questions popped into his mind. Guo Qi rubbed his forehead, feeling a headache.\n\nHe must have drunk too much last night. He hadn't seen his old classmates in years, and they really went wild, ordering six cases of beer alone.\n\n\"Brother Qi, what's wrong? Are you not feeling well?\" The burly man walked over and gently shook Guo Qi's shoulder.\n\nThat shake wasn't a big deal, but suddenly, a flood of information surged into his mind.\n\nAfter an unknown period, Guo Qi gradually recovered from his dazed state, and a fact slowly solidified in his mind.\n\nI, Guo Qi, have transmigrated.\n\nTransmigrated to a world that was broadly similar to his previous one but also had many differences.\n\nHe had also transformed from an obscure, unremarkable company clerk to an enrolled student at Jiangzhou University.\n\nAlthough Jiang University's ranking in the country wasn't great, it was considered a well-known institution in Donghua Province, and its graduates had quite good employment prospects within the province.\n\nHowever, the original Guo Qi seemed to be a bit unprofessional.\n\nHe had acted in a somewhat famous TV series called \"Little Dragon God\" when he was young, making him a semi-child star. Unfortunately, his subsequent few dramas received mediocre responses, and he gradually faded out of the entertainment industry.\n\nBut the dream of becoming a celebrity never died in Guo Qi's heart.\n\nIf acting didn't work, he would pursue a singer-songwriter path.\n\nAfter enrolling in Jiang University, the original Guo Qi poured almost all his energy into music.\n\nExcept for taking exams, he barely attended classes. He spent most of his time recording works and the rest performing at bars to earn living expenses.\n\nThe style of Chinese music in this world was rather impoverished.\n\nTo cater to popular taste, the original Guo Qi chose a pop style leaning towards R&B, mixed with some campus elements. Led by the Four Little Heavenly Kings of Chinese music, this was also the most crowded genre for mainstream singers, hence the intense competition.\n\nGuo Qi, who lacked personal distinctiveness, despite putting in a lot of effort, received little response for his music. Just last night, the original Guo Qi received another rejection letter from a record company.\n\nLost and disheartened, he drank excessively at the bar.\n\n...\n\n\"Brother Qi, what exactly happened? If you're really not feeling well, I'll go with you to the campus hospital,\" the burly man asked with concern.\n\nWith the original owner's memories, Guo Qi recognized him this time.\n\nThe burly man was his roommate, Wang Cheng, a loyal and warm-hearted man from the Northeast. He often helped everyone in the dorm.\n\n\"No need, Brother Cheng, I might have just drunk too much last night.\"\n\n\"Alright then. Check your phone quickly, someone kept calling. There's a Wanten campus recruitment fair this afternoon. I'm going to find Xingzhou and the others.\"\n\nWang Cheng casually put on some clothes, grabbed his resume, and left.\n\nThe dorm was suddenly left with only Guo Qi.\n\n\"Slap.\"\n\nSeeing no one else around, Guo Qi couldn't resist slapping himself twice.\n\nHiss...\n\nMy cheek hurts.\n\nLooks like it's really not a dream!\n\nEncountering such a good thing as transmigration, what should I do next?\n\nGuo Qi was still deep in thought when his phone by the bed buzzed twice; someone had sent a message.\n\nIt was Yang Dali, the owner of the bar where he sang.\n\n...\n\n[Guo Qi, what's wrong with your phone? Why can't I reach you?]\n\n[Are you still coming? Do you want the 300 yuan for tonight's performance or not?]\n\n[If you delay the bar's business, just you wait!]\n\n...\n\nHis tone was so arrogant?\n\nIsn't it just 300 yuan?\n\nI'll transfer it back to you right now!\n\nGuo Qi rubbed his fingers, clicked [Transfer Red Packet], and entered [300].\n\nWith a \"beep,\" the system prompted transfer failed.\n\n[Insufficient bank card balance (if it's a credit card, the credit limit is insufficient, please verify and try again)]\n\nHe switched cards, the prompt remained.\n\nHe switched from Wi-Fi to mobile data, the prompt remained.\n\nHmm, it seems it's not a signal issue.\n\nIs this guy really that poor, he doesn't even have 300 yuan!\n\nGuo Qi: \"...\"\n\nHe silently deleted the unsent [Keep your stinking money, don't bother me], and replaced it with a docile and obedient [Sorry, Mr. Yang, I'll be there on time tonight].\n\nJust then, a transparent light screen suddenly appeared in front of Guo Qi, with lines of text displayed on it.\n\nIn his mind, a clear, ethereal female alto voice was broadcasting simultaneously.\n\n[Ding, system bound successfully...]\n\n[Host: Guo Qi]\n\n[Reputation Conversion System successfully activated, click to view more information]\n\n\"Hmm?\"\n\nGuo Qi was startled at first, then fell into ecstasy.\n\nJust like the protagonists in those web novels, transmigrators always have a golden finger bonus, from which they reach the peak of their lives.\n\n\"Phew,\" Guo Qi let out a long breath, his fingers trembling slightly from excitement as he clicked on the page, starting to view more information.\n\n[System Instructions]\n\n1. The host must not disclose the existence of the system in any way.\n\n2. To encourage the host to perform corresponding actions, at each settlement period, the change in the host's reputation will be converted into currency according to the conversion ratio and charged to the host's account.\n\nAmong them, the surplus conversion ratio is the proportion of the host's reputation value increase in each settlement period converted into currency.\n\nThe loss conversion ratio is the proportion of the host's reputation value decrease in each settlement period converted into currency.\n\n3. As the host's level increases, this system will automatically unlock an upgraded version.\n\n...\n\nAfter a quick glance, Guo Qi was immediately drawn to the content of the second clause.\n\nWhat does that mean?\n\nEvery time the settlement happens, the change in my reputation will be converted into my personal wealth?\n\nHe clicked [I have read and agree to the terms], and the system automatically proceeded to the next step.\n\n[Conversion ratio, randomly confirming]\n\nThen two dial-like templates appeared on the page, representing surplus and loss respectively. The pointers spun for a long time and finally stopped at Guo Qi's anticipation.\n\n[Ding dong]\n\n[Surplus conversion ratio confirmed as 0.1]\n\n[Loss conversion ratio confirmed as 100]\n\nFollowing the system prompt, Guo Qi saw that his personal information on the page indeed changed accordingly.\n\n[Personal Information]\n\nName: Guo Qi\n\nCurrent Reputation: 25601\n\nLevel: V1\n\nSurplus Conversion Ratio: 0.1\n\nLoss Conversion Ratio: 100\n\nCurrent Settlement Cycle: 7 days\n\nAs if worried that Guo Qi might not fully understand, the system this time proactively provided explanatory notes.\n\n[Host's current reputation value (actual number of fans) 25601. The current settlement cycle is 7 days. The system will monitor the host's reputation value changes in real-time after 7 days and convert it into the host's personal wealth according to the conversion ratio.]\n\n[To ensure the sustainability of this research data, when the host's reputation is cleared, the system will automatically replenish the reputation value to 5000.]\n\n\"This system is quite interesting.\" Such a conscientious system deeply moved Guo Qi.\n\nAccording to the system, regardless of whether his reputation increased or decreased, Guo Qi would ultimately earn money; it was simply a matter of earning more or less.\n\nIt just depended on how to operate to maximize profit.\n\nIf he went the route of gaining followers, Guo Qi concluded internally, it was five words: thankless, strenuous work.\n\nAfter all, the original Guo Qi had worked himself to death for several years and only accumulated a total of 25,601 followers, and most of them were on Xinchao Weibo.\n\nThese people were attracted by his high-颜值 (good-looking) photos; there were very few fans who truly appreciated Guo Qi's musical talent.\n\nEven if he was lucky and attracted another ten thousand-plus fans with his looks, if the conversion rate was 1, it would only be a mere 1,000-plus yuan.\n\nBut if he went the route of losing followers...\n\nThat would be a different story!\n\nHe'd just need to curse people on Weibo, post vulgar information, and preferably post some forbidden words to get his account blocked by the authorities. Wouldn't that lead to countless lost followers in minutes?\n\nThen multiply that by the tempting 100 loss conversion ratio; if all 20,000 fans dropped, that would be 2 million!!!\n\nThinking of this, Guo Qi's heart rate quickened.\n\nHe smiled happily."

    "content": "【Beep! Important Notification】\n\nAs if sensing Guo Qi’s inner thoughts, a notification suddenly popped up on the system page.\n\nAfter clicking to view it, Guo Qi instantly realized that things weren't as simple as he had initially thought.\n\nTo lose fans, you still had to follow the basic rules!\n\n【The host must engage in entertainment activities that conform to normal behavioral logic and are reasonable and legal.】\n\n【If the host exhibits any of the following behaviors, the system will refuse to provide financial rewards and terminate its cooperation with the host:】\n\nSurplus Category:\n1. Purchasing followers from secondary market channels through agreed-upon transactions.\n2. Deceiving, tricking, or misleading followers through the extensive release of false information or elaborate inducements.\n3. Through...\n... (Click to view the remaining 107 prohibited behaviors)\n\nLoss Category:\n1. Maliciously violating platform rules and relevant laws and regulations, leading to account suspension.\n2. Maliciously insulting others and provoking disturbances, or planning and creating illegal incidents that result in the host being restricted or even banned.\n3. Deliberately engaging in anti-social or anti-human activities.\n4. Inducing or actively calling for fans to unfollow, etc.\n... (Click to view the remaining 198 prohibited behaviors)\n\nSure enough, the system was not to be trifled with.\n\nGuo Qi clicked on the holographic screen and carefully studied these prohibited clauses, eliminating all the fan-losing behaviors he had imagined earlier.\n\nIn summary, gaining fans had to be reasonable, and losing fans also had to be reasonable. You could have subjective intent, but you couldn't directly resort to crooked means.\n\nNo wonder the loss conversion ratio was so much higher than the surplus conversion ratio; for most people, losing fans reasonably was actually more difficult than gaining them.\n\nHowever, Guo Qi didn't care much about this.\n\nIn his previous life, to pass the time, he had watched almost all mainstream variety shows and, along with them, read a good deal of celebrity gossip.\n\nHaving seen many popular celebrities completely fall from grace due to a series of \"wacky maneuvers,\" if he planned carefully and drew some lessons, there would always be some \"wacky maneuvers\" he could use.\n\nAt that time, why worry about not succeeding in his great endeavor?\n\nAfter a few moments of thought, several general ideas had already begun to take shape.\n\nGuo Qi nodded slightly, feeling confident.\n\nLosing fans, what's so hard about that?\n\nEverything was under control.\n\n...\n\nThe thought of raking in 2 million yuan from a massive loss of 20,000 fans in 7 days filled Guo Qi with motivation.\n\nWithout further ado, Guo Qi got out of bed, turned on his computer, and began searching for various relevant information, especially tech and entertainment news.\n\nLed by the Fruit Phone, various new smart devices had emerged, and tech startups were flourishing.\n\nApps like food delivery, ride-hailing, e-commerce, and live streaming were all rapidly developing.\n\nThe technological level was similar, and various software and hardware had already appeared; some industries, like chip IoT, were even more advanced.\n\nThe entertainment industry was originally a bit behind, with music and film styles and forms being more barren.\n\nBut thanks to this wave of technological innovation and advanced industrial IoT technology, major music and film platforms and companies had jointly created a creative assistance platform even more advanced and convenient than in his previous life—the Creator Assistance Platform, known in the industry as CAPO.\n\nThe emergence of CAPO strengthened industry copyright awareness and greatly facilitated the work of entertainment industry creators.\n\nMany newcomers didn't even need professional recording equipment; relying on the recording tools and paid materials provided by CAPO, they could create beautiful music and even exciting short films.\n\nThe original Guo Qi, as an ordinary university student, could produce musical works solely from the money he earned busking, and it was precisely through the CAPO platform.\n\nIn the past two years, music and film works have exploded on various platforms, and various new talents have begun to enter the public eye.\n\nThe entertainment industry was developing rapidly, and the derivative entertainment culture was quickly approaching the level of his previous life.\n\nFan culture, chart battles, and fan wars had already frequently become entertainment headlines.\n\n\"It seems that those advanced fan-losing experiences from my previous life can all be put to good use,\" Guo Qi felt more at ease.\n\nUnconsciously, it was already noon, and a rumbling stomach led Guo Qi to decide to go find food.\n\nAs a key university, Jiang University's student cafeteria was naturally top-notch.\n\nThe three-story independent building could accommodate tens of thousands of people dining simultaneously. The materials and decor were simple and elegant, and coupled with the Ministry of Education's university dining subsidies, the cafeteria's prices were excellent value for money.\n\nTherefore, every day at mealtime, the restaurant was filled with Jiang University students queuing to eat, many of whom were beautiful junior students, drawing frequent glances from male students.\n\nAlong the way, Guo Qi was trying hard to figure out how to quickly lose fans.\n\nTo be honest, there were quite a few options.\n\nHis current total fan count was 25,601, with Trendy Weibo accounting for 17,288, and a small portion remaining on the CAPO music platform.\n\nFor the users on the music platform, he could try releasing a few niche and avant-garde songs. As long as they were made as unpleasant to listen to as possible, he wouldn't have to worry about people not unfollowing.\n\nIf it weren't for the system's regulations, Guo Qi would even want to directly release noise, which could inflict tons of mental damage.\n\nWeibo fans were the primary targets in the initial phase. Since they were looks-based fans, Guo Qi planned to take a few ugly selfies, which should have some effect.\n\n...\n\nLost in his fan-losing schemes, Guo Qi was completely oblivious that, even without much effort to dress up, his handsome appearance still made him a sight for many junior female students.\n\n\"Look, that's Senior Guo Qi.\"\n\n\"He has such a good foundation; I thought it was makeup, but he's so handsome in person without even dressing up.\"\n\n\"I heard his music is great too; Senior is going to be a celebrity in the future.\"\n\n\"He must have signed with a music company; such an excellent senior.\"\n\nGuo Qi, holding his tray, was still looking for an empty seat in the cafeteria when he heard the junior female students nearby discussing him in low voices, and he couldn't help but be startled.\n\n\"That's too exaggerated, am I really that handsome?\"\n\nHe instinctively pulled out his phone and for the first time, meticulously examined his current appearance.\n\n\"Hmm, it's true.\"\n\nThis young man was something else; his looks were indeed impressive, no wonder he was chosen as a child actor when he was young.\n\nA slender, pale, oval face, deep, sculpted features, and a somewhat mixed-race charm that made it difficult for people to resist.\n\nIn the entertainment industry, which was full of handsome men and beautiful women, he might just be considered normal, but among ordinary people, especially on a university campus where most boys hadn't yet developed their aesthetic style, he truly stood out from the crowd.\n\nWhile Guo Qi was admiring himself, a junior female student who had finished her meal nearby, her face slightly flushed, quickly cleared her dishes and, leaving behind a shy \"Senior, you can sit here, I'm done eating,\" ran off bashfully.\n\n\"Hey, classmate, didn't you just say I could sit there?\"\n\nSeeing the seat snatched by a handsome guy like that, the ordinary, unattractive guy standing nearby with his tray angrily shouted at the departing figure of the blushing girl.\n\nThis world was always so cruel to unattractive men.\n\n\"This won't do!\"\n\nGuo Qi sat down with a frown, eating while pondering. The junior female students' reactions made him realize a very serious problem.\n\nA big obstacle on the road to losing fans.\n\nIt seems I'm a bit too handsome?\n\nAs a handsome guy, even if he intentionally took some funny,丑-扮 photos (ugly-扮 means deliberately making oneself look ugly), they could easily be perceived by blindly ignorant looks-based fans as cute, interesting, and without any idol burden.\n\nJust like an unattractive man, no matter how carefully he dresses up and picks the right angle, he'll still be said to be an ugly person causing trouble.\n\nUnder the system's supervision, he couldn't fake it or intentionally use fake pictures of others.\n\nSo the question is,\n\nHow can I become uglier?\n\nHow can I scare away those looks-based fans on Weibo?"

    "content": "Hmm...\n\nThat's a good question.\n\nOn the way back to the dorm after eating, Guo Qi thought for a long time but couldn't come up with a good idea. He simply looked down and started browsing the news.\n\nHis serious, focused, and studious demeanor once again drew exclamations from a junior schoolgirl.\n\n...\n\n\"This seems a bit interesting.\"\n\nAfter reading a System Technology Entertainment report, Guo Qi was drawn to a melodramatic news headline: \"Cosmetics or Disguise? Man Sues Bride for Fraud Two Days After Marriage.\"\n\nFrom the title, he could roughly gather the outline of the incident. Guo Qi was already used to such news, but this time, he suddenly had an inspiration.\n\n\"If that's the case, things will be much easier.\"\n\n\"Intentionally making myself look ugly might not have a great effect. I can try a 'pulling the rug out from under them' approach: make some bare-faced videos to let these 'face fans' know that the so-called high颜值 are just illusions created by makeup and beauty filters!\"\n\n\"Psychology also has similar descriptions: the behavior people find hardest to accept is being deceived. Fans who feel deceived will definitely get angry and unfollow.\"\n\n\"It's settled!\"\n\n...\n\nThe performance at Bruce Bar wasn't until 8 PM, so there was plenty of time.\n\nThe grand project of losing followers couldn't wait.\n\nGuo Qi returned to his dorm and immediately began taking comparison photos of his bare face versus his made-up face.\n\nTo make sure his fans were completely disheartened, he deliberately applied several layers of dim, lifeless light to his bare-faced photos and intentionally made his skin look rough and red.\n\nAfter a few comparison photos, it had the desired effect.\n\nBut something was still missing.\n\nIt wasn't until he opened his phone to upload the photos that Guo Qi suddenly realized.\n\nIt was the impact!\n\nPhotos are static; even two comparison photos aren't captivating enough. But in video form, there would be a stronger sense of immersion and engagement, and the before-and-after contrast of the makeup would create a greater impact.\n\nAlthough video work would be more demanding, for the sake of better follower loss, a little hardship was acceptable.\n\nGuo Qi deleted the pictures he was editing and began planning the video script for recording.\n\nFirst, he needed to film a segment of himself looking handsome and cool after being meticulously groomed.\n\nThen, he would remove the disguise layer by layer.\n\nFirst, how he looked without beauty filters.\n\nThen, how he looked after removing makeup.\n\nFinally, just his ordinary bare face... No, what if his bare face was still a bit handsome?\n\nAh, then he would add some more \"dead light\" to make the whole person look sallow and rough, very listless.\n\nSince the original owner frequently used the CAPO platform to produce audio-visual works, Guo Qi was quite familiar with the platform's operations. He even specifically used several paid special effects to make the entire video more realistic and natural.\n\nAfter almost two hours of work, the video was finally done.\n\nHe clicked the play button.\n\n\"Hello everyone, I'm your Xiao Qi. Many fans have left messages asking why there are so many handsome guys on Weibo, but they never meet any in real life.\"\n\n\"So, I'm going to personally demonstrate how handsome men and beautiful women online reveal their true selves.\"\n\n\"First, let's turn off the beauty filter... then turn off the regular filter... then remove some makeup, don't panic...\"\n\n\"Holy crap!!! Who is this ugly person? Oh, it's me. Everyone, this is...\"\n\n...\n\nGuo Qi tapped his fingers on the table, watching the video carefully several times. He was very satisfied with the overall effect.\n\nThis powerful impact, this meticulously designed commentary, would undoubtedly cause enormous psychological damage to the \"face fans\" once uploaded.\n\nAfter all, which \"face fan\" would follow a man who wasn't handsome?\n\nHe chose a pretentious title, \"Do You Still Love Me Like This?\", left the content description empty, and to prevent new traffic from coming in, Guo Qi simply didn't select any topic tags.\n\nEverything was in order, and Guo Qi confidently pressed the upload button.\n\nA minute later, the video appeared on his homepage timeline.\n\nCurrently, Guo Qi had 17,288 followers on Weibo, and some had set him as a special follow, so it wasn't long before comments started appearing below the video.\n\n\"Eye-watering, so this is the real Xiao Qi!\"\n\n\"Men are all big phonies, can I still believe in this world?\"\n\n\"Keep it up, Xiao Qi, I might be busy with work in the future, so I can't chat with you anymore.\"\n\n\"Am I the only one who thinks the blogger's bare face isn't bad?\"\n\n\"Xiao Qi, you're really honest.\"\n\n\"No more words, unfollow.\"\n\n...\n\nLooking at the stream of negative reviews below, and seeing his Weibo follower count visibly decline, it had already dropped to 17,209.\n\nIn just half a day, a full 70-plus people had chosen to unfollow.\n\nIn monetary terms, that was more than 7,000 yuan!\n\nThe effect was truly immediate.\n\nGuo Qi couldn't help but smile, completely reassured.\n\n...\n\n\"Creak.\"\n\nThe dorm door opened, and Wang Cheng and Sun Xingzhou walked in, laughing. Liu Yu, who was behind them, seemed a bit unhappy.\n\n\"Oh, Qi Ge, you're awake. Were you okay after drinking too much last night?\"\n\nSun Xingzhou greeted him, then plopped down on the edge of Guo Qi's bed, pointing at Wang Cheng and laughing, \"It's so funny, I have to tell you, when we were eating just now, Cheng Ge did something big again.\"\n\nGuo Qi heard that and knew Wang Cheng had fallen into his old habits again.\n\nHe was a warm-hearted person, incredibly loyal to his friends, but sometimes a bit lacking in emotional intelligence, almost like a one-track mind.\n\nBecause of this, he often made a fool of himself.\n\nIn his freshman year, Wang Cheng became famous for successfully calling someone to smash open a locker after locking his keys inside.\n\nNot long after, their dorm went to get hot water. Wang Cheng tried multiple faucets in a row, but no water came out. After a long check, they found that this guy had been pressing his ID card onto the sensor, mistaking it for a water card.\n\nFrom then on, the nickname \"Cheng Ge\" spread like wildfire.\n\nIn his junior year, because of his honest, reliable, and warm-hearted nature, Wang Cheng briefly had a girlfriend.\n\nOne day, a few months later, because the girl suggested watching a movie, they were delayed and returned to find the dorm already locked. The girl subtly implied, \"What should we do? It seems we're forced to get a hotel room. Cheng Ge, don't take advantage of me.\"\n\nCheng Ge patted his chest and霸气地 told his girlfriend, \"Don't worry, a man should shield a woman from wind and rain. I can handle a small matter like this!\"\n\nThen, under the girl's mysterious and fantastical gaze, he walked over and \"bang-bang\" knocked on the dorm auntie's door...\n\nMy Cheng Ge truly was such a straightforward person.\n\nSeeing Liu Yu's helpless expression, Guo Qi generally understood. He gestured with his chin and asked, \"Xingzhou, what did Cheng Ge do to Liu Yu?\"\n\n\"Hahaha, just now, the three of us were eating in the cafeteria. Liu Yu took a liking to a girl queuing next to us and went to hit on her. He pretended he forgot his meal card and asked to swipe her card, then WeChat transfer the money to her.\"\n\nSun Xingzhou described it vividly: \"Actually, this kid just wanted her WeChat ID. The girl, either genuinely naive or a little interested in Liu Yu, nodded and agreed.\"\n\n\"Just then, my Cheng Ge leaped forward and pulled Liu Yu... hahaha... he pulled him away!\"\n\n\"Cheng Ge is seriously the worst, holy crap!\"\n\nLiu Yu, watching Sun Xingzhou laugh so hard, his mood also lightened a bit, he laughed and cursed, \"The key is, while pulling me, that guy kept saying, 'Yu Ge, the brothers are all here, why bother an outsider? This meal's on me!'\"\n\n\"Do I lack this meal?! What I lack is a girlfriend!\"\n\nThe others burst into laughter.\n\nWang Cheng, on the side, scratched his head, embarrassed, and said, \"Oh, it's just a girlfriend. Next time, Qi Ge will get you one. Come on, brothers are all here, let's play some games.\"\n\nEveryone responded, and the dorm was instantly filled with the pleasant sound of keyboards clacking, occasionally mixed with a few phrases.\n\n\"Initiate attack!\"\n\n\"Holy crap, ambush!\"\n\n\"Defend high ground!\"\n\n\"Steady, we can win!\"\n\n..."

    "content": "Among the four players, Liu Yu was the strongest, a true \"jungle carry dad.\"\n\nSun Xingzhou and Guo Qi were mid-to-high tier players, occasionally able to carry a game if they got enough resources. Wang Cheng, on the other hand, was the type who thought he was carrying, but was actually a team-wipe initiator.\n\nWhat's more, he had no concept of item builds. He always went with the system's recommended items. Even if the opposing team had no magic users, Wang Cheng would still buy a Null-Magic Mantle and Mercury's Treads.\n\nAccording to a universal gaming principle, the worst player is always the one who talks the most.\n\nSeeing their Nexus explode into a brilliant fireworks display once again, Wang Cheng was the first to sigh.\n\n\"Ugh, brothers, you need to practice more and keep up with my tempo. Don't always lag behind in damage when I go in.\"\n\n\"Cheng Ge, you're trying to pick off five enemies by yourself. We'd have to eat sh*t to keep up.\"\n\n\"Yeah, Cheng Ge's damage was 3.9% this round. If there had been any positioning mistakes, the damage wouldn't be this low, right?\"\n\nWang Cheng: \"????\"\n\nWas my positioning *too* perfect?!\n\n...\n\nGaming sessions are always fun but short.\n\nIt was already past six o'clock, and the performance at Bruce's Bar was about to begin.\n\nAlthough the bar owner's attitude wasn't the best, considering his somewhat shy wallet at the moment, Guo Qi shut down his computer, slung his guitar over his back, and headed towards the bar street.\n\nJiangda University is located in a bustling area of Jiangzhou City, with the Dalan River, Jiangzhou's mother river, winding alongside it.\n\nThe city's well-known bar street is just across the river from Jiangda University.\n\nDue to several university campuses in the surrounding area, plus literary tourists who come specifically for it, the bar street is always bustling with people and business is booming.\n\nSimilar to other bar streets, the liveliest spots are usually the few dance-club-like \"noisy bars\" on the main street. Dazzling, cheap lights combined with ear-splitting beat-dropping music allow the hormones on the dance floor to be freely unleashed.\n\nBruce's Bar is a quiet bar tucked away in a corner next to one of these noisy bars.\n\nThe owner, Yang Dali, was a literary backpacker in his youth. He had long hair and wore long robes, sleeping with women from various literary holy sites across the country with his clothes flowing in the breeze. When he got too old to roam, he returned to Jiangzhou and took over this small bar.\n\nTo be fair, Yang Dali's personality was actually quite good.\n\nAlthough his message to Guo Qi today wasn't very polite, that was because it was only halfway through the month, and the original Guo Qi had already stood him, Old Yang, up five times, claiming he was in a bad mood after being rejected by a record company.\n\nIf it weren't for this kid bringing his own fans, attracting many regular customers, why would Old Yang bother with him so much?\n\nHe would have told Guo Qi to scram ages ago.\n\nToday was Bruce's Bar's Friday Frenzy Night, with an 80% discount on all drinks for a limited time. Even so, Bruce's occupancy rate wasn't high, only about half full.\n\nYang Dali shook his head. After confirming on the phone that Guo Qi was on his way, he turned and walked behind the bar.\n\nNearly half of the customers were young women. Yang Dali recognized these familiar faces; they were probably students from nearby universities, fans of Guo Qi.\n\nSome were fans of his looks, but most were fans of his music.\n\nAt 8 PM,\n\nGuo Qi kept his word and arrived at Bruce's on time. The equipment was already set up in the middle of the stage.\n\nAlthough the original owner had rich stage performance experience, for the current Guo Qi, it was like \"a young woman getting into a sedan chair for the first time\"—it was his first time. Fortunately, the performance experience in his memory prevented him from getting stage fright. Guo Qi had also tried singing a few notes on the way.\n\nHmm, his skill was still there.\n\n\"Hello everyone, good evening, I'm Xiao Qi. I hope you'll enjoy my music, thank you.\"\n\nWith a simple opening to warm up the crowd, his magnetic voice immediately livened up the atmosphere.\n\nClearing his throat a few times, Guo Qi strummed his guitar.\n\nA gentle song began, an original work by Guo Qi called \"The Vanished Person.\"\n\nLyrics / Guo Qi\nMusic / Guo Qi\n\nThe person who once accompanied me\nGradually disappeared into that dusk\nThe person who vanished from my life\nI thought we'd never meet again\n\nI never properly thanked you\nFor at least giving me such companionship\nSuch warmth\n...\n...\n\nTo be honest, both the lyrics and music had a lot of room for improvement. Fortunately, the audience wasn't picky, and the response was still very enthusiastic.\n\nThe current Guo Qi didn't like this kind of song, but since he was being paid (300 per show was a decent wage), he patiently continued to sing with deep emotion.\n\nHe sang several songs in a row, including covers of famous compositions and his own original works, and the bar's atmosphere grew livelier and livelier.\n\nAs the performance neared its end, Guo Qi began his final song of the night, also an original, and the one his fans cheered for the most: \"Summer Rice Fragrance.\"\n\nThis song had some elements of borrowing, but its overall quality and completeness were relatively high. Besides female fans, some male fans also followed Guo Qi because of this song.\n\nThe light R&B style melody made one feel as if they could smell the scent of rice fields, the aroma of rice stalks, the taste of tomatoes: walking hand-in-hand with a partner by the rice fields, a blue sky with wisps of white clouds overhead, and a fragrant breeze blowing in their faces...\n\nFollowing the guitar melody, several people in the audience even hummed along.\n\nYang Dali, who was also the part-time lighting technician, was possessed by some spirit at this moment, creating the most perfectly timed stage lighting of his life. The light shone on Guo Qi's face, making him look like a sculpture carved from jade.\n\nSomeone in the audience pulled out their phone to capture this rare moment.\n\nA few bolder, more uninhibited girls also ran onto the stage with their drinks and glow sticks.\n\nThe glow sticks were covered in messages of support for Guo Qi.\n\n\"To our best Xiao Qi!\"\n\"Love you, Xiao Qi, we'll always support you on CAPO!\"\n\"'Summer Rice Fragrance' will definitely be a hit this year!\"\n...\n\n\"This song is so good, what's your CAPO ID? Your Weibo?\" a girl in the audience shouted loudly.\n\nHearing this, Guo Qi's expression changed instantly. Before he could think of how to refuse,\n\nThe enthusiastic fan who had just come on stage with drinks began to promote him: \"Everyone, quickly search for: Xiao Qi the Dream Chaser, please support him!\"\n\nBefore she even finished speaking, several people in the audience looked down at their phones, seemingly searching to follow him.\n\nHoly sh*t!!!\n\nKnowing his fans meant well, Guo Qi cursed inwardly, but kept a smiling face.\n\nHe took off his guitar and bowed in thanks: \"Thank you for your support, I'm Xiao Qi, please keep supporting me.\"\n\nWalking to the bar's backstage, Guo Qi couldn't help but frown.\n\nThis was a hidden danger!\n\nHe had thought the bar's audience were just regular tourists, but it turned out some were his fans. Being just fans of his looks would be one thing, but some were even fans of his music.\n\nAlthough the number wasn't large, 1 person is 100 *kuai*, 100 people is 10,000 *kuai*. If they recommended him to their relatives and friends, the loss would only be greater.\n\nLooking at the audience's reaction, some fans had already made glow sticks for him. This worry was not superfluous.\n\nIn fact, it was very necessary!\n\nGuo Qi was a cautious person.\n\nBetter to kill a thousand innocents than let one guilty person escape.\n\nAccording to the contract, besides Friday nights, Guo Qi also had to perform at Bruce's on Sunday nights.\n\n\"Summer Rice Fragrance\" absolutely could not be sung again; he had to change the setlist!\n\nComposing new original songs on the fly wasn't realistic. It would be more reliable to find a few songs from his past life's memory to cover.\n\nBut which one to cover?\n\nGuo Qi naturally wouldn't bring out those highly popular classic songs from his previous life, as classics are classics and could easily become popular again.\n\nTo lose fans, it would be best to sing a song that the performer could enjoy by themselves, with a niche style that wouldn't be widely accepted, preferably with a bit of a comedic or satirical element.\n\nLike various \"divine songs\"*.\n\n\"Mouse Loves Rice\"?\n\"All Things Grow\"?\n\nNo, the risk was still not low.\n\nGuo Qi shook his head, dismissing the few songs that flashed through his mind. After all, at certain stages, these songs had accurately hit the public's musical demand, thus leading trends.\n\nWhat if they hit the mark again this time?\n\nHe needed to think of something more reliable...\n\nGuo Qi pondered for a long time, and then a song suddenly popped into his mind.\n\n\"That's the one!\"\n\nGuo Qi slapped his thigh, exclaiming excitedly.\n\nHe was full of confidence that once this song was performed, not only would he not gain new fans, but even his existing music fans would likely be lost.\n\n---\n* Divine songs: Refers to songs that are incredibly popular, often to the point of being overplayed or having a somewhat cheesy quality, yet they become cultural phenomena."

    "content": "After settling on the songs, Guo Qi quickly ran to the bar to give Old Yang a heads-up.\n\nOld Yang was never particular about music styles. Although the song titles didn't sound like anything \"proper,\" seeing Guo Qi's confident look, he agreed.\n\nMeanwhile, in a quiet corner of the pub, two attractive young women sat opposite each other.\n\nOne was quite young, appearing to be a university student, while the other, dressed in a black short-sleeved T-shirt, looked sharp and capable, clearly a professional.\n\n\"Yunduo, is this the singer you wanted me to see?\"\n\nThe younger woman, named Yunduo, nodded. \"Yes, Guo Qi is one of our school's Top Ten Campus Singers. His stage presence is really good, isn't it? And he's handsome too. Gu Tang, what do you think?\"\n\n\"He looks alright, and his singing is alright, but...\"\n\nGu Tang shook her head. \"I'm not optimistic about him. He's too ordinary, nothing special. That last song was decent, but it seemed to have some elements of imitation.\"\n\n\"Oh, really?\" Jia Yunduo felt a bit sorry for Guo Qi. She knew Gu Tang was always very opinionated, but she couldn't help but try to persuade her a little more.\n\n\"Maybe he wasn't quite in his element yet. Guo Qi will be performing again on Sunday. If you have time, Gu Tang, could you give him another chance?\"\n\n\"Hmm, we'll see about Sunday.\"\n\nGu Tang gently swirled her wine glass and drained half of it.\n\n...\n\nFortunately, the pub was very close to Jiang University, and it was nearly 11 PM when he returned to his dorm. His roommates were all still awake, fiercely battling it out on their computers.\n\n\"Qi Ge, come join us for some gaming,\" Wang Cheng enthusiastically invited.\n\n\"My throat isn't feeling well; I'll skip the battle today.\"\n\nGuo Qi flopped onto his bed and pulled out his phone to check the Weibo situation.\n\nDamn!\n\nLooking at the data, Guo Qi couldn't help but exclaim in delight!\n\nExcellent results!\n\nAn immediate victory!\n\nIn just half a day, this Weibo post had racked up 50,000 views, with over 200 comments, most of which were negative.\n\n\"May everyone who likes this get rich next year.\"\n\n\"Please don't like; last time I posted something cheeky, my Weibo buzzed for two months...\"\n\n\"Heh, handsome guys and beautiful girls are all fake.\"\n\n\"Why must the blogger shatter my illusions?\"\n\n\"Give me back my handsome Xiao Qi.\"\n\n\"Life truly is full of ordinary people.\"\n\n...\n\nHe checked his follower count; it had dropped to 16,126, a loss of 1,162 followers. Considering he gained a few followers at the pub tonight, the actual number of followers lost from the video would be even higher.\n\nConverting that into system rewards, it was nearly 120,000 yuan!\n\nWhat was it like to earn 120,000 yuan in a single day?\n\nGuo Qi was greatly encouraged.\n\nThe power of money was immense.\n\nThe next day was Saturday. Guo Qi, who usually slept until noon, woke up early to check the progress of his Weibo follower loss.\n\nAfter a day of fermentation, the new Weibo views had slowed down, finally settling around 80,000, and the follower loss effect had also greatly diminished.\n\nA total of 1,386 followers were lost,\n\nleaving 15,902.\n\nThese \"nail-house\" followers were quite stubborn.\n\nGuo Qi meticulously checked the backend data and found that the actual follower loss from the video was indeed greater than 1,386, but strangely, over 100 people had actually followed him because of this video.\n\nWhat, did some people really have such unique aesthetic tastes that they preferred to follow \"ugly\" people?\n\nHowever, these people were ultimately a minority, and compared to the number of followers lost, the new additions were completely negligible.\n\nThough Guo Qi was cautious, he didn't dwell on this.\n\nThe effect of the previous video was gradually weakening. He needed to strike while the iron was hot and release several more similar videos to maintain continuous pressure on the \"face-value\" fans.\n\nWhile the last video was good, there was still room for improvement.\n\nFor example, contextualization.\n\nA simple comparison between makeup and bare face, though impactful enough, lacked a sense of immersion.\n\nIf user-frequently encountered scenarios were introduced, such as blind dates or meeting online friends in person, it would create a stronger sense of immersion for the audience.\n\nFor instance, if you get cheated on by your girlfriend, and if your friend gets cheated on by his girlfriend, your internal feelings are vastly different.\n\nIn the former, you just want to kill the third party; in the latter, you can offer comforting platitudes.\n\nTherefore, it's necessary to describe the \"evil deeds\" caused by \"catfishing\" in a contextualized way, making more fans feel the same way and thus generating anger.\n\nAnother issue was the lack of a persona.\n\nAlthough the last video exposed his bare face, it didn't reveal any other personal characteristics, making it difficult to evoke greater disgust from fans.\n\nImagine, if the Guo Qi in the video was not only a catfish but also disrespectful to women, wouldn't it provoke even greater outrage?\n\nTo prevent the system from classifying it as intentional self-slander, Guo Qi planned to add a disclaimer in the video, \"[Content is purely fictional and creative],\" so that all personas would be part of the video plot, and the system couldn't say anything.\n\nAfter reviewing the previous video, Guo Qi immediately started working on the new content in CAPO.\n\nThis time, he planned a more detailed script and even invited his roommates for friendly cameos.\n\nFirst, the video length was set to 2 minutes, ensuring most people would have the patience to watch it.\n\nSecond, the plot had to be melodramatic, making people feel like the screenwriter was crazy or their intelligence was being insulted; in short, something that would absolutely never happen in real life.\n\nFinally, the plot's ending had to have a twist, preferably one that aroused negative emotions and definitely did not make the audience feel satisfied.\n\nWhat if they felt satisfied and then liked and followed him? Wouldn't that be a huge loss?\n\nThis time, the workload was greater. Even with CAPO's help, Guo Qi spent almost an entire day on it.\n\nBy the time the final product was ready, it was nearly 6 PM.\n\n\"Phew, I'm exhausted.\"\n\nHe let out a long breath and eagerly clicked play to view the final result.\n\nThe video went something like this:\n\nGirl A (played by Liu Yu) waited shyly by the roadside for her online boyfriend, whose photo showed a handsome and attractive boy (Guo Qi's handsome photo from Weibo).\n\nAs she waited, Girl B (played by Sun Xingzhou) cycled past, riding a bicycle (played by Wang Cheng), and asked, \"Hi, are you Guowei VC?\"\n\nGirl A panicked, quickly asking, \"I am. Are you 'White Horse Is Not a Horse'? How can you be a girl?\"\n\nGirl B stopped her bike and smiled. At Wang Cheng's request, the bicycle was given a close-up.\n\nGirl B said, \"Don't misunderstand, I'm here for my brother. He finally found someone, so I came to see if he could win a fight if it came to that.\"\n\nGirl A held out the handsome photo on her phone, asking doubtfully, \"Your brother is so handsome, why would anyone hit him?\"\n\nGirl B glanced at it, surprised, \"Holy cow, who the heck is this?\"\n\nThen, to the sound of background music, Guo Qi made a grand entrance.\n\nWith CAPO's materials and filter effects, he transformed himself into an ordinary-looking, dark-skinned ugly man—Xiao Qi.\n\nGirl A covered her mouth in surprise, \"Holy cow, who the heck are you?\"\n\nTo add to the melodramatic feel, the ending featured Guo Qi's voice-over, made with a voice changer.\n\n\"My name is Xiao Qi. I never thought my online relationship would actually succeed. Girl A told me that even though I'm ugly, the way I open the Ferrari door is really handsome, and she found love.\"\n\n...\n\n\"Hmm, not bad.\"\n\nMore impressive than the last video.\n\nThe ending also subtly satirized certain gold-digging phenomena, which would surely disgust many \"green teas.\"\n\nGuo Qi was very satisfied.\n\nHe edited a pretentious title, \"[Miss, online dating? My photos are super sweet],\" again choosing no topic tags and no video description.\n\nHe clicked upload, then closed the Weibo backend, and Guo Qi got up to find something to eat.\n\nAfter a busy day, he was now ravenous.\n\n...\n\n10:30 PM.\n\nA thousand miles away in Jingzhou, at the Xinchao Weibo office building, the short video project department had just concluded its departmental meeting.\n\nThe rapid rise of Tomato Net and Paipai Show had ignited the enthusiasm of major internet companies and capital for video communities.\n\nAs a leader in the media field, Xinchao Weibo was not to be outdone and quickly took action, launching a video community module.\n\n\"Over the next year, we will continuously invest one billion yuan to encourage high-quality content creators to create on our Xinchao Weibo platform.\"\n\nYang Yuan, the head of the short video project and one of the group's VPs, had just formally stated at the meeting that five channels, including lifestyle and entertainment, would be prioritized and given traffic entry points.\n\nAs the channel editor for the short video department's lifestyle and entertainment channel, Zhou Bai felt a great sense of responsibility and had an unusually abundant passion for his work.\n\nHowever, every company had its own genes. Tomato Net became popular through anime new series and \"guichu\"<sup>1</sup> editing, while Paipai Show became popular by performing classic film and television clips. These two had a natural user base for video creation.\n\nXinchao Weibo, on the other hand, started with text and image jokes. Apart from celebrities, most popular bloggers and influential accounts were experts in text and images, and video creators were relatively rare.\n\nMore guidance and excavation were needed.\n\nZhou Bai logged into the backend and started checking data.\n\nThese past two days, he had been heavily promoting the topic #YouKnowNothingAboutOnlineDating#, and he needed to constantly monitor its progress.\n\n---\n<sup>1</sup> Guichu (鬼畜): A type of Chinese internet meme video that involves re-editing, looping, and manipulating existing footage, often with comedic or satirical intent, similar to YouTube Poop."

    "content": "The whole thing started with a sensational news report.\n\n\"Cosmetic Surgery or Disguise? Groom Sues Bride for Fraud Day After Wedding\"\n\nThis was originally just a typical 'epic fail' news story, perhaps the first time someone had sued over such a thing, or maybe people were just too bored.\n\nAnyway, this news went viral.\n\nMedia outlets reported on it one after another, and the topic seized the top spots on Weibo's trending list and the Hot Zone of Tomato.com.\n\nIt wasn't until the leaders received regulatory messages and used algorithms to reduce some of the topic's heat that the public's discussion enthusiasm was suppressed.\n\nAlthough the news's direct popularity decreased, netizens' enthusiasm remained high.\n\nDriven by video communities like Tomato.com and Coffee Showcase, the popularity of news-related衍生 topics quickly surged, attracting many participants.\n\nTomato.com's hottest topics of the day included two related to this: \"Watch My Seventy-Two Transformations\" and \"Grand Online Dating Meetup Scene.\"\n\nThe former encouraged various makeup artists to show off their different makeup videos, while the latter encouraged people to share their various online dating experiences, many of which were 'epic fails.'\n\nCoffee Showcase's top performance chart today was \"What Do I Really Look Like?\"\n\nThis mainly featured netizens editing videos of celebrities' fluctuating appearances at different events, with some internet celebrities also seizing the opportunity to join in.\n\nAs the leading social media platform, Trendy Weibo naturally couldn't fall behind. Zhou Bai also mobilized his colleagues to work together, placing the topic \"You Know Nothing About Online Dating\" as a recommended topic on the homepage.\n\nFrom the perspective of netizen participation, this topic was quite successful. The angle was very precise, not limited to just beauty or entertainment fields.\n\nEveryone followed the topic, using their wit and wisdom to contribute many popular memes and jokes.\n\n@IsAMuleOrAHorseLetItOutAndSee: [Online Dating Taboos] First, never date someone who doesn't show their real face; second, if you do date, never show your face.\n\n@LittleRiceBall: Choose me for online dating, no exes in the whole network, won't admit it if there are, I can cheat on you, but if you cheat on me, my mother dies, 365 fake photos, I can be whatever you like.\n\n@BigGuJuJi: Don't online date casually, you'll never know who's on the other side of the screen, it could be... your dad!\n\n@DreamChasingYouthLittleFireDragon: What Online Dating Taught Me Those Years [Long Graphic Article]\n\n@IAmCutePureAh: I really was deceived by an online dating partner, back then I still...\n\n...\n\nThe topic's readership quickly broke ten million, with several thousand participants.\n\nHowever, video content was scarce.\n\n\"Sigh, Trendy Weibo's video 'genes' are still too weak right now,\" Zhou Bai sighed, continuing to browse the backend data.\n\nThe bosses had already chosen to focus first on the lifestyle and entertainment channel, and Zhou Bai decided to use this topic to further guide video creation.\n\nSearching for the keyword \"online dating,\" a cheesy title piqued Zhou Bai's interest.\n\n[Hey sister, online date? I'm super sweet]\n\nThe blogger had over ten thousand followers and should have some content creation experience. The video was only two minutes long, so it wouldn't take much time.\n\nZhou Bai clicked on the video.\n\nThe opening showed a girl waiting for her online lover to arrive. Due to what seemed like limited budget, this girl was actually played by a burly man.\n\nLooking further, even the bicycle was played by a person.\n\n\"This is too perfunctory for the audience, isn't it?\" Zhou Bai couldn't help but complain.\n\nHowever, considering the theme, this 'silly and perfunctory' style actually fit perfectly.\n\nHe continued watching.\n\nWhen the character \"Little B\" in the video said, \"Holy crap, who the hell is this?\"\n\nZhou Bai couldn't help but laugh out loud.\n\nThe ending was also very clever, not only adding humor through a twist but also satirizing the money-worshipping phenomenon in online dating.\n\nAfter checking the blogger's data, Zhou Bai found it strange: the video quality was good, so why were the statistics so dismal?\n\nEspecially the follower count, which was rapidly declining.\n\nYesterday, it lost over 1,300, and tonight, just after it was released, while there were 10+ new followers, the overall count still dropped by over 100.\n\nWhat was the reason for this?\n\nIf this problem wasn't identified, it could very likely dampen this blogger's enthusiasm for video creation!\n\nThinking this, Zhou Bai became serious.\n\nAfter nearly an hour, repeatedly comparing the homepage content and follower tags of accounts at the same level, he finally had an answer.\n\nFrom the follower demographic tags, the blogger was losing entertainment-oriented followers, meaning 'visual appeal' fans or 'talent' fans who focused more on the blogger's looks and skills.\n\nThe new followers in the past two days, however, had 'lifestyle comedy' tags, focusing more on the blogger's content and plot.\n\nPerhaps due to limited video creation experience, this blogger, named \"Dream-Chasing Xiao Qi,\" made many common beginner mistakes when uploading the new video: no video description and no topic tags selected.\n\nThis led to the original followers being unable to accept the 'no-makeup' effect, while fans who would like this type of plot content were not recommended to the video by the system.\n\nThis resulted in the loss of followers.\n\nThe user reviews for the blogger also confirmed this judgment, and Zhou Bai breathed a sigh of relief.\n\nA video painstakingly created leading to a significant loss of followers must have made this blogger anxious, which is why he quickly added a second part.\n\nBut if the direction was wrong, no amount of effort would help.\n\nIf he hadn't come across it, this video might still not have had a good effect.\n\nNormally, channel editors cannot arbitrarily use their authority to influence account traffic. However, as a hot topic host, Zhou Bai had the right to decorate pages and set pinned content, requiring only a backend record.\n\nCurrently, there wasn't much high-quality video content under the \"You Know Nothing About Online Dating\" topic, and this video was very much in line with the theme, so...\n\nWithout hesitation, Zhou Bai set Guo Qi's video as a pinned post and thoughtfully added several topic flow tags to the video.\n\nIn a short while, \"Whoosh!\"\n\nThe traffic within the topic surged in.\n\nDue to the matching audience, the video's comment count and share count rapidly increased, with a significant proportion converting into Guo Qi's followers.\n\nZhou Bai picked up his health pot and brewed a cup of coffee. Imagining the blogger's reaction upon seeing the backend data, his heart swelled with a sense of accomplishment.\n\n\"The fragrance always stays in the hand that gives the rose.\"\n\n...\n\nThe next day.\n\nGuo Qi woke up leisurely in bed, checked the time, it was already almost ten.\n\nThe sleepiness hadn't completely faded, and Guo Qi decided to doze off for a little while longer to recharge his energy. Making videos all day yesterday was a huge drain on his energy.\n\nTonight at Bruce's Bar, he would be starting new songs, and he needed to seriously prepare for practice to achieve the best possible fan-repelling effect.\n\nAs for the subsequent impact of repelling fans, Guo Qi wasn't too concerned.\n\nAccording to the current trend of losing followers, after the system settled, Guo Qi would have at least hundreds of thousands in cash. Even if the bar didn't terminate his contract, Guo Qi didn't plan to continue performing there.\n\nBy then, he would find a beautiful place, enjoy a comfortable vacation, and then use his transmigration advantage to invest his money and become a happy rich idler.\n\nThinking this, Guo Qi happily woke up his phone screen.\n\nThe screen full of Weibo notifications made his heart skip a beat, and a bad premonition arose in his mind.\n\n\"Stay calm, don't panic. It's probably just too many unfollow notifications because the video was too effective.\"\n\nGuo Qi comforted himself and clicked into the Weibo backend.\n\n...\n\n\"@Dream-ChasingXiaoQi, your Weibo post [Online date, hey sister...] has been recommended as a pinned topic by the topic moderator.\"\n\n@Contrarian1103, and 15 others liked your Weibo.\n\n@TwoMonkeysOnATree, and 8 others commented on your Weibo.\n\n@FieryFieryHotpot, and 39 others followed you.\n\n@StarryEyes, and 168 others liked your Weibo.\n\n@SmokeFireStarTrace, and 34 others reposted your Weibo.\n\n...\n\n\"Holy crap?\"\n\n\"What happened?\"\n\nGuo Qi was a bit dizzy.\n\nHe rubbed his eyes, making sure he wasn't mistaken.\n\nHe had specifically checked last night before going to bed; his followers had already dropped to just over 15,000.\n\nHow did it surge by 2,000 overnight? It was now 17,156, and the numbers were still climbing.\n\n\"It seems to have gone viral?\"\n\nLooking at the continuously rising follower count in the backend, Guo Qi was very confused."

    "content": "Things had gone completely beyond Guo Qi’s expectations.\n\nHe quickly skimmed through his Weibo messages and finally found the root cause.\n\nIt was all because he’d been so absorbed in shooting videos recently that he hadn’t paid much attention to Weibo’s trending topics.\n\nThe melodramatic news story that had inspired his video—\"Plastic Surgery or Impersonation? Young Man Sues New Bride for Fraud on Second Day of Marriage\"—had become so popular that it even sparked the trending topic of the past two days.\n\nAnd his luck was quite something; simply because his video centered on the theme of “online dating catfish,” the super topic host had pinned it to the top.\n\nNo wonder his Weibo views had already surpassed 200,000 overnight.\n\nMoreover, unlike the previous two days, the viewing audience was no longer just appearance-obsessed fans; it was the general public, interested in video content.\n\nAs a result, the video’s ratings quickly climbed.\n\nThe comments section was no longer filled with the wails of appearance-obsessed fans; instead, it was replaced by encouragement and support from everyone.\n\n@Xiaodouzi: Blogger, you’re so talented, hahaha\n\n@GirlsLikeMe: Keep filming, little brother, craving a sequel\n\n@CityLights: Very fun to watch, reposting to support\n\n…\n\nEven some appearance-obsessed fans who had initially planned to unfollow after seeing the bare-faced video had defected and switched allegiances, turning from appearance-obsessed fans into video fans, due to the video’s popularity.\n\nThe comments section was abuzz, with many demanding a sequel.\n\nGuo Qi couldn’t help but fall into deep thought.\n\nAm I going to lead the trend of shooting web dramas on Weibo in this world?\n\nPerhaps,\n\nI should shift my mindset and pursue gaining followers instead of losing them?\n\n“No, no, no, how can I think like that?”\n\nAs soon as this terrifying thought appeared, Guo Qi quickly shook his head, nipping it in the bud.\n\nThis sudden popularity was merely accidental, a result of hitting on the right theme. If the theme hadn’t fit, if the super topic hadn’t been pinned, there definitely wouldn’t have been such a good response.\n\nAs the saying goes: *Watering flowers with care, they don’t bloom; planting willows without intent, they grow into shade.*\n\nLeaving aside the huge cost of shooting a web drama, even if he were to shoot a series of short videos, could he accurately hit the netizens’ interest points?\n\nHonestly, the probability of failure was far greater than the probability of success.\n\nEven if it really became popular again,\n\nAccording to the system’s conversion rules, the surplus conversion ratio was only 0.1, meaning a gain of 100,000 followers would only yield 10,000 yuan. However, the loss conversion ratio was as high as 100, meaning losing 100,000 yuan only required losing 1,000 followers.\n\nClearly, the strategy of losing followers was still the most correct path.\n\nIt’s just a pinned topic, right? Based on experience, the heat of a Weibo topic usually fades in two days. It’s estimated it will only bring another two or three thousand followers at most, not causing any major stir.\n\nThinking this, Guo Qi calmed down a little.\n\nHe already had a countermeasure in mind.\n\nMost new followers were coming for the video’s continuation; as long as he delayed updating a sequel, many would unfollow themselves.\n\nWith Weibo’s popularity currently high, any slight movement could attract new fan interaction.\n\nTo avoid any unexpected incidents, Guo Qi decided to keep Weibo inactive for now. He would wait for the buzz to die down before dealing with these lovely little fans.\n\nDidn’t the CAPO platform have over 8,000 followers?\n\nHe would switch battlegrounds first, using the release of a new song to exhaust his fan goodwill on CAPO.\n\nJust one song was enough to tell the world: I, Guo Qi, not only lack talent, but my musical taste is also incredibly vulgar, and I simply cannot sing the tunes you love.\n\nThe song that made him so confident was none other than “My Skateboard Shoes,” which he had thought of on a whim the day before yesterday.\n\nAs a popular hit song across the country, Guo Qi had been tormented by it for a long time in his previous life, so he had a profound impression of it.\n\nIt was included in Joseph Han Pang Mailang’s 2012 album, *Old Metal*, and became thoroughly popular two years later. It was named one of the “2014 Top 20 Golden Songs” at the first Independent Music Review.\n\nYou might not know the name of this song, but when you hear the line “friction, friction,” you will definitely recall a desperate “friction on this smooth ground” in your mind.\n\nGuo Qi had carefully considered his choice of this song.\n\nUnlike the meticulously designed hit song “Little Apple,” which revolved around audience musical preferences, “My Skateboard Shoes” became popular in his previous life due to a nationwide curiosity.\n\nAlthough the song was defined by Joseph Han Pang Mailang as “folk, punk, electronic, dance,” the actual melody was very simple, the rap was not standard, many words didn’t match the rhythm, and even the Mandarin pronunciation was very awkward.\n\nTherefore, after its initial creation, it was ignored.\n\nThis should have been the song’s original fate.\n\nThe extremely ordinary appearance and the utterly unmusical work, combined with the singer’s self-proclaimed high-end persona, created a huge contrasting cuteness, which attracted the attention of some curious individuals.\n\nIn 2014, a cover artist from Bilibili’s *Guichu* section produced an edited MV video. The unique lyrics and singing style gradually attracted more UP hosts to participate and eventually became a nationwide hit.\n\nIn other words, the explosion of “Skateboard Shoes” was not only accidental but also closely related to the music environment at the time. Even though it was once a hit song, divorced from its original soil, it had no possibility of becoming popular again.\n\nMost people’s first reaction upon hearing this song should be: “Is this even music?”\n\nLooking back at past music reviews, many people still found its popularity incomprehensible.\n\nThis world had no Bilibili, only a similar platform called Tomato.com.\n\nAs long as he was careful with Tomato.com and nipped any budding signs in the bud, Guo Qi was confident that this song would never become popular.\n\nThe more a person had a certain level of music appreciation, the harder it would be for them to accept this kind of unconventional musical style initially.\n\nClearly, the fans on CAPO would not be its target audience.\n\nImagine a young white-collar worker who prefers pop music suddenly hearing a cheesy song with off-beat rhythm; their first thought would likely be, “Is this artist insane?”\n\nGuo Qi had intended to record it quickly and publish it on the CAPO platform.\n\nBut to be safe, he decided to perform it at the Blues Bar first to gauge the audience’s reaction.\n\n…\n\n8 PM, Blues Bar.\n\nAfter logging into his Weibo backend again, Guo Qi’s despair finally eased a little.\n\nIt slowed down,\n\nIt finally slowed down!\n\nWho would have thought that a mere pinned topic would have such an intoxicating effect!\n\nFrom morning until now, views had surged by another 500,000, reaching a total of over 700,000. This brought in over 5,000 new followers, double what he had anticipated.\n\nGuo Qi’s Weibo followers had now surpassed 20,000.\n\nFortunately, the fan growth momentum had slowed down for now; from seven to eight o’clock, it had only increased by less than 100.\n\nHe could relax a little.\n\n“Checked, ready to go on stage, Xiao Qi.” Old Yang had someone adjust the equipment and came over to call him.\n\n“OK.”\n\nGuo Qi made a gesture, emerged from the immense grief of gaining followers, and walked onto the stage with his guitar.\n\nHis conventional performance, sometimes covers, sometimes originals, drew waves of cheers from the audience below.\n\nAs it neared the end, Guo Qi strummed his guitar hard, then, with a solemn expression, spoke into the microphone: “I’m sorry.”\n\nSwish swish swish,\n\nHearing this inexplicable apology, several pairs of eyes in the audience looked over.\n\n“I’m sorry,” Guo Qi paused, then continued, “You might be wondering why I suddenly apologized.”\n\n“Because I lied to everyone.”\n\n“All this time, I’ve actually been making music that the market likes, not music that I like. Because I was worried that the market wouldn’t accept my style.”\n\nThis confession was Guo Qi’s careful arrangement, designed to explain the drastic change in his musical style and indirectly distance himself from popular songs like “Summer Rice Fragrance.”\n\nHe controlled his tone, continuing sincerely, “The next song is the real me. Thank you for your support and tolerance. For this song, I just want to say, if you love, please love deeply; if you don’t, please leave decisively.”\n\n…\n\nAfter hearing this confession, the audience suddenly fell silent.\n\nOh, was the singer about to drop a bombshell?\n\nAmidst the anticipation, someone started it, and then everyone began to applaud.\n\n“Clap clap clap”\n\n“Pat pat pat”\n\nAmidst the applause, Guo Qi held the microphone and quietly began to sing.\n\n“‘My Skateboard Shoes,’ dedicated to everyone.”"

    "content": "\"Mr. Wu, this is Guo Qi. Xiao Guo is very talented, with quite a few fans on Weibo and CAPO.\"\n\nWu You closed his eyes and nodded, listening to Chen Xiangyang's introduction.\n\nIt was the proper demeanor of an industry bigwig.\n\nHe had seen Guo Qi's profile.\n\nIt left a rather deep impression.\n\nOver twenty thousand fans on Weibo, and under thirty thousand on CAPO, adding up to over forty thousand.\n\nTo be honest, this data wasn't outstanding for a newcomer.\n\nMany trainees and artists from large companies possessed this level of influence. Some even had millions of fans before their debut, like exceptional prodigies.\n\nWu You knew in his heart: merely based on this data, it wasn't enough to indicate that a trainee artist had great potential.\n\nTherefore, when he first received the consultant invitation from Pineapple Entertainment, Wu You actually refused.\n\nIt wasn't that the price offered by Pineapple Entertainment wasn't tempting, but he felt unconfident about the job of an agent consultant.\n\nAlthough the industry in Jiangzhou now called him a golden agent, having successfully promoted two girl groups, COLA7 and sweetgirls, his resume looked quite impressive.\n\nHowever, the embarrassing truth was that Wu You himself had no idea why the groups succeeded.\n\nBecause he was a complete slacker.\n\nHe had gotten to where he was today entirely by luck.\n\nWu You's career as an agent began at Starlight Culture.\n\nStarlight Culture was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Starlight Media, a local media giant.\n\nA few years ago, personal computers had already reached thousands of households, and the concept of the internet was emerging. The entertainment industry also embraced the \"internet +\" concept. Based on this situation, the company decided to invest further in internet entertainment, attempting to secure a foothold.\n\nBecause it primarily focused on the \"internet entertainment\" concept, Starlight Culture's attempt was also very internet-oriented.\n\nFirst came the online auditions, a very novel concept that attracted many applicants.\n\nAfter multiple rounds of selection, seven members skilled in singing and dancing were chosen by the company to form the girl group COLA7.\n\nAs the market response to the online auditions was positive, Starlight Culture was greatly encouraged and immediately organized an online nationwide audition for agents.\n\nThis was a very risky move.\n\nBecause the skill level of an agent had a significant impact on emerging idols.\n\nStars were like exquisitely packaged goods. How to sell them well and at the most suitable price tested the abilities of both the agent and the agency.\n\nIt could be said that a large part of a star's success was due to their agent. And an unreliable agent could easily lead to overall failure.\n\nAt that time, Wu You was still studying Marketing at Jiangzhou Normal University.\n\nHaving failed both his postgraduate and civil service exams, he was idle online, searching for job postings and submitting resumes everywhere.\n\nWhen he stumbled upon this online agent audition, he was immediately attracted by the cash prize and job offer for the winner.\n\nAlthough he didn't even have a celebrity agent qualification certificate, Wu You, in a moment of impulsive enthusiasm, used all his persuasive power to write a lengthy agent plan, stretching over ten thousand words.\n\nHis plan incorporated the 4C/4P theories, positioning theory, integrated marketing, and CCM theory...\n\nAfter a lot of extravagant talk, the youth girl group COLA7 would become the Chinese version of Girls' Generation through the power of the internet.\n\nRelying on his excellent theoretical knowledge and his wild boasting about the internet concept, Wu You successfully impressed the competition judges and became the contracted agent for COLA7.\n\nHe had no experience as an agent, nor any resources.\n\nWu You couldn't compete with other companies for the regular TV and radio promotions and commercial performance activities that new groups often participated in, only getting marginal resources.\n\nAs for resources like GG endorsements and TV variety shows, he couldn't even catch a glimpse of them.\n\nSeveral months passed, and the girl group's operations showed no improvement. Dissatisfaction began to brew within the group.\n\nIt was at this time, due to the lingering influence of the previous online auditions, that several online variety shows came knocking.\n\nAt that time, the concept of online variety shows was just emerging, unlike later when large video platforms would participate, ensuring viewership and exposure. Most online variety shows back then were attempts by film and television companies to gain influence through internet channels when they couldn't secure broadcast resources on satellite TV.\n\nAt that time, many industry insiders even labeled the internet with derogatory terms like \"grassroots\" or \"crude,\" questioning the effectiveness of online programs and not taking them seriously.\n\nBut for Wu You,\n\nEven a mosquito's leg was meat, and besides, he couldn't get any other meat.\n\nHe was very proactive in cooperating with online variety shows.\n\nHis enthusiasm also deeply touched the online variety show producers.\n\nIn an environment where he was constantly being given the cold shoulder, suddenly having someone warm up to him was such a heartwarming gesture!\n\nThus, more online variety shows came knocking.\n\n...\n\nHalf a year later,\n\nA legend suddenly circulated in the industry: \"COLA7 simultaneously launched 5 online variety shows.\"\n\nOnline variety shows quickly gained audience favor due to their more relaxed scope and flexible program progression.\n\nCOLA7 became famous overnight.\n\nAnd Wu You also became renowned in the industry for his \"unique insight.\" His courage to concentrate resources and bet big on online variety shows made many new agents' hearts pound.\n\n\"Xiao Wu, I truly didn't misjudge you.\"\n\nAt the celebration banquet, Zhang Wenshan, the president of Starlight Culture, excitedly patted Wu You's shoulder and exclaimed.\n\n\"To lower the bar to recruit talent without sticking to conventions, I insisted on this despite dissenting opinions, precisely to take this opportunity to absorb excellent talent from other professions into the agent ranks. You didn't disappoint my expectations!\"\n\nAnd so,\n\nHe was entrusted with a heavy responsibility by his boss, leading the agent team to manage the company's existing flagship group, \"sweetgirls.\"\n\nThis was a pop singing group.\n\nThey were also the company's artists who were the face of the company before COLA7.\n\nThere were only two members, Yang Tiantian and Zhou Xinyi.\n\nTheir early packaging strategy had always imitated Hong Kong and Taiwan styles. In the surrounding regions, sweetgirls had a modest reputation, but in the past six months, they had been stuck in a bottleneck, showing no improvement, and even signs of declining popularity.\n\nAs the \"online variety show guru\" in everyone's eyes, Wu You carried the deep expectations of the company and the group members.\n\nThey hoped he could use the internet to elevate the group to a higher level.\n\nWu You was completely bewildered by this.\n\nFacing their expectant gazes, he almost blurted out the truth several times.\n\nFortunately, sweetgirls had a certain level of popularity this time. Unlike COLA7, they weren't lacking commercial performance invitations.\n\nSo, he aimed for no mistakes rather than seeking achievements.\n\nWu You started to handle various matters like performance notifications, following the previous blueprint.\n\nSince the promotional effect of online variety shows had already been proven, these shows quickly became a red ocean for major artists, just like satellite TV variety shows. Entering at this point offered no further benefits.\n\nSeveral months passed in a flash, and the group's popularity showed no improvement.\n\nIt even continued to decline.\n\nQuestions began to circulate within the company.\n\n...\n\n\"Can Wu You do it this time?\"\n\n\"I doubt it. Last time was probably just a fluke.\"\n\n...\n\nOne day after lunch, Wu You suddenly received an email invitation.\n\n\"Trendy Weibo Star Account Invitation Letter\"\n\nWu You stroked his hair.\n\nHe usually liked to browse news, so he had some impression of this Trendy Weibo.\n\nInspired by the global popularity of the overseas platform \"Tweeter,\" major Chinese companies had entered the Weibo battlefield.\n\nThe more powerful ones were Tencent Group's Tencent Weibo, Netease Group's Netease Weibo, and game company's Kaixin Weibo...\n\nThis Trendy Weibo was a startup company, starting relatively late, and its development wasn't fast.\n\nTencent and Netease's Weibo users had already exceeded fifty million, while Trendy had just broken ten million. User coverage was very low.\n\nOpening the invitation letter, Wu You's interest was piqued by the content.\n\nTo attract celebrities to join, Trendy Weibo offered full-site traffic exposure to the first 500 celebrities who joined, and also provided cash incentives to celebrity agents.\n\nThis was good!\n\nThere was also a cash reward... oh no, and full-site traffic exposure?\n\nWu You perked up and quickly filled out the registration information on the webpage.\n\nLater, at the annual meeting, Wu You learned that the total number of celebrities invited to join this invitation event was less than 150.\n\nHowever, relying solely on these 150 celebrities,\n\nTrendy Weibo successfully converted their fans into Weibo users, and registration numbers surged.\n\nWith this operation, Trendy Weibo quickly secured a new round of financing, and then invited more celebrities who had been on the fence.\n\nSoon, Trendy Weibo quickly became a top player by attracting celebrities and, in a few years, became the undisputed leader in the Weibo field.\n\nAnd sweetgirls, who had joined early, also gained a lot of traffic exposure support on Weibo due to their early entry advantage.\n\nWu You had succeeded again.\n\nThe title of \"Golden Agent\" once again resonated throughout Jiangzhou."
