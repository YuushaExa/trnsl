    "content": "The little loli didn’t go far. She just found a large wine jar from a nearby house. At first, Zhou Ze was worried about whether the jar could be properly sealed, but then it was time to witness a miracle.\n\nThe little loli took a new, blank notebook from her schoolbag, tore out the pages one by one, and signaled for Zhou Ze to put the Equinox Flowers inside first. Then she took the paper, licked it with her own tongue to wet it with saliva, and stuck it onto the jar. She went all the way around, then clapped her hands and took a bottle of mineral water from the car, gulping it down with a \"glug, glug, glug.\" It looked like she was replenishing the fluids she had just used.\n\nAlright, so Zhou Ze knew the little loli's tongue could stretch very, very long, but he never thought the saliva on that long tongue would have such an effect. Since the little loli said the seal was absolutely fine, Zhou Ze didn't give it another thought.\n\nOn the way back, Zhou Ze was the one driving because Xu Qinglang was still unconscious, lying stretched out across the back seat. He was lost in some beautiful dream, like a drunkard. Of course, this was the result of the little loli knocking him out. If he were awake right now, who knew what kind of cringe-worthy things he might do.\n\nFor a living person, the effect of this thing truly surpassed all known psychoactive drugs in the world; they weren't even in the same league.\n\nHowever, Zhou Ze was very careful on the drive back. He was lucky he didn't run into any traffic police, or getting busted for driving without a license would have been a real joke.\n\nHe dropped the little loli home first, pulling up outside the residential complex where Wang Ke lived.\n\nThe little loli sat in the passenger seat. After the car stopped, she didn't get out right away. Instead, she looked at the wine jar by Zhou Ze's feet again and licked her lips with her long tongue.\n\n\"I'm curious, how did you manage to eat before?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"This is why most of us ghost emissaries find a host. We spend most of our time sleeping while the host goes about their business. Two souls coexist in one body, so the host isn't affected when it comes to eating and sleeping.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded. He understood. Because he was a stowaway, even though he'd become a ghost emissary by a stroke of luck, the original owner of this body was long gone. So he was both the tenant and the current master. Naturally, he couldn't just go to sleep and let another soul in this body handle eating, sleeping, and goofing off.\n\n\"Then you shouldn't need this either,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nThe little loli glanced at Zhou Ze.\n\nShe said very seriously,\n\n\"I was alive once, too.\"\n\n\"I know.\"\n\nAll ghosts were once human.\n\n\"So, I also lived a normal life. I ate food.\"\n\n\"Oh, I get it.\"\n\n\"So, I get cravings too, and I want to try what it's like to eat something while I'm awake!\" the little loli blurted out in one breath. Then she propped her hands on her chest, sitting there with her cheeks puffed out in a huff.\n\n\"Alright, when I'm done making it, I'll save a portion for you. You can come pick it up from the bookstore whenever you're free.\"\n\nZhou Ze reached out and gave her another one of his head pats.\n\nThis time, the little loli didn't resist.\n\n\"Say hi to your dad for me.\" Zhou Ze waved at the little loli, watching her walk into the complex. Truth be told, it had been a long time since he'd contacted Wang Ke.\n\nLast time, Wang Ke had introduced that client to him, who turned out to be the Sea God's woman. Of course, Wang Ke definitely had no direct connection to that matter.\n\nSo, Zhou Ze discovered he really was a rather unfeeling and disloyal person. He and his childhood friend had completely lost touch after they started working, leading to their distant relationship even after they reconnected. And then there was Dr. Lin and his family, whom Zhou Ze couldn't be bothered to think much about either.\n\nBuddha says, one must self-reflect.\n\nZhou Ze smiled. Self-reflection was too boring. It was much more enjoyable to go back and start tinkering with this stuff. The thought that he would soon be able to eat slowly and methodically instead of wolfing down his food made life feel full of hope.\n\nZhou Ze had also asked the little loli that since she could go down to Hell anytime, why didn't she just pop down to pick some flowers when she had nothing better to do. The little loli had given him a look that said *I'm looking at an idiot*.\n\nHow many pairs of eyes were watching the Yellow Springs Road?\n\nA tiny little ghost emissary runs down just to pick an Equinox Flower and run back up?\n\nDid she have a death wish?\n\nWhen he got back to the bookstore, the old Taoist was sitting at the entrance, smoking. Zhou Ze signaled for him to come over and help carry Xu Qinglang inside.\n\n\"Yo, what happened to him?\" the old Taoist asked as he hoisted Xu Qinglang up.\n\n\"He's drunk,\" Zhou Ze answered.\n\n\"Drunk? But he doesn't smell like alcohol,\" the old Taoist said, a bit puzzled. But he didn't ask any more questions and carried Xu Qinglang straight upstairs.\n\nZhou Ze carried the wine jar into the bookstore. Seeing that Bai Yingying wasn't on the first floor, he didn't ask Deadpool for help either, deciding to carry the wine jar up to the second floor himself.\n\nHe pushed open his bedroom door with his foot,\njust in time to run into Bai Yingying walking out.\nHer face was flushed, incredibly excited, and she was screaming hysterically:\n\n\"AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\"\n\nThe scream damn near made Boss Zhou drop the wine jar in his hands.\n\nBoss Zhou swore,\nif the wine jar had broken,\nand the Equinox Flowers inside were ruined,\nhe would have, without a moment's hesitation, skewered the female jiangshi in front of him a hundred times! A hundred times!\n\n\"AHHHH!!!!\"\n\nSeeing Zhou Ze was back,\nBai Yingying excitedly rushed over, threw her arms around him, and planted a kiss on his cheek.\n\n\"AHHHH, WE'RE THE CHAMPIONS, BOSS!\nRNG WON THE CHAMPIONSHIP!!!!\"\n\nBai Yingying was as happy as a hundred-pound silly deer.\n\n\"The chicken dinner game?\" Zhou Ze asked tentatively.\n\nHonestly, in his past life as a surgeon, Boss Zhou had been busy as hell. Any free time he had was spent studying the latest medical equipment and classic cases. To climb the ladder and achieve his life's ambitions, he had constantly whipped himself onward like a spinning top. Who had the time to play games?\n\nIn this life, having already died once, he understood the true meaning of a lazy, slow-paced life even better, and he had little interest in playing games.\n\nSo when it came to any champions,\nor what this RNG was,\nBoss Zhou was truly clueless.\n\n\"It's League of Legends, you know, LoL,\" Bai Yingying explained.\n\n\"Oh. As long as you're happy.\"\n\nZhou Ze motioned for Bai Yingying to move aside. He should have just asked Deadpool for help. Why did this internet-addicted girl seem so unreliable now?\n\nBut then, watching the white-haired Bai Yingying celebrating so joyfully,\nZhou Ze suddenly felt that dotingly watching her be happy was a kind of happiness in itself.\n\nPerhaps because his body was still weak and hadn't fully recovered from the fight, Zhou Ze slept for a long time, not waking up until almost noon. As usual, Bai Yingying waited for the boss to wake up before getting out of bed with him.\n\nAfter washing up, Zhou Ze went downstairs, planning to ask the old Taoist to take some money and buy some lab equipment or sealed containers. He wanted to juice the Equinox Flowers and preserve them, and putting them back in the wine jar wouldn't be appropriate.\n\nThe old Taoist was serving customers. That fellow Xu Qinglang still hadn't woken up. Bai Yingying had to follow Zhou Ze downstairs, and Deadpool only knew how to sit motionless in a corner, so the old Taoist was the only one left to handle the clientele.\n\nThe old Taoist had actually managed to mix coffee and cocktails that looked the part, at least enough to satisfy the customers.\n\nZhou Ze frowned slightly. His favorite window seat was occupied by two young women.\n\nThis made Zhou Ze reconsider Xu Qinglang's suggestion to raise the minimum charge to a thousand yuan. That way, they could avoid having so many living people come in to spend money.\n\nOf course, since they were here, they were customers. Zhou Ze could only choose another sofa to lean back on. At the same time, he gave the old Taoist a few instructions. The old Taoist acknowledged and went out to buy the things.\n\nBoss Zhou picked up his newspaper, sipped his tea, and re-entered his salted fish mode.\n\nThe bookstore was a little noisy. There were two tables of customers. One was the pair of young women, and the other was two young mothers. The mothers had two children, a boy and a girl, who were running around the bookstore, making a bit of a racket.\n\nThe two children even ran over to where Deadpool was sitting. The boy pointed at Deadpool and explained to the girl beside him which superhero he was and what special powers he had, probably mistaking the motionless Deadpool for a statue. After all, Deadpool didn't breathe and had no heartbeat.\n\nTheir voices were a bit loud, so loud that Zhou Ze almost felt like ordering Deadpool to take off his mask and grant the two kids' wish.\n\nOn second thought,\nhe let it go.\nThere was no need to get angry with children.\n\nZhou Ze simply took out his phone and started scrolling through the news.\n\nJust then, the two children's mothers seemed to notice their kids' ruckus. They stood up and told their children to be quieter and not to disturb others. The two kids were quite obedient; they really did stop talking and started looking for comic books to read.\n\n\"Brother, come here. I have Doraemon over here,\" the little girl called out softly to the boy, holding a comic book.\n\nHearing her, the boy immediately started running over from the other side.\n\nBut at that moment,\none of the two women who had taken Zhou Ze's sun-soaking window seat suddenly stuck out her leg as the boy passed her.\n\nThe boy was tripped immediately.\n\n*Thud!*\n\nWith a sharp sound,\nthe boy fell flat on the floor.\nIt was a hard fall. His nose hit the ground, and it started bleeding right away.\n\n\"Waaaahhh...\"\n\nThe boy sat on the floor and burst into tears, looking at the stylishly dressed young woman beside him with aggrieved and frightened eyes.\n\n\"Oh my, little boy, why were you so careless? Did you get hurt? Let big sister have a look.\"\n\nThe woman who had just deliberately stuck her foot out to trip the boy immediately stood up with a concerned expression and helped him to his feet.\n\nThe little boy's mother heard the crying and immediately turned to look. She ran over and picked up her child.\n\n\"Oh, you're bleeding! I told you not to fool around, and you wouldn't listen. Look at this fall, you're bleeding now.\"\n\nThe mother began to scold her son.\n\nThe little boy raised his hand, crying, wanting to point at the woman in front of them. He knew she was the one who had tripped him.\n\n\"He's just a child, it's normal for kids to fall and trip. You should hurry and take him to the hospital,\" the woman and her friend immediately came over to console them.\n\nThe boy's mother had been busy chatting with her friend and hadn't seen the moment he fell. She nodded at the woman. \"Thank you, I'll go to the hospital.\"\n\nWith that,\nthe mother had her friend take her own daughter and leave the bookstore together.\nAs he was being carried by his mother, the little boy couldn't help but look back at the woman who had deliberately tripped him.\n\nAfter the mother and children had all left,\nthe two young women sat back down on the sofa.\nThe woman who had stuck her leg out sighed and said with a smile,\n\n\"So damn noisy. Some people have mothers but no upbringing. I hate these brats the most.\"\n\n\"Hehe, you were so quick with your foot just now.\"\n\n\"You think so? I'm just happy seeing a brat have some bad luck. Especially since he cut himself and got a bloody nose, I found it really satisfying, hehe.\"\n\n\"Me too, me too. Those two kids were so annoying. It's a shame he didn't fall to his death.\"\n\n\"Haha, you're so vicious.\"",

    "content": "Zhou Ze silently put down his phone and rubbed his eyes.\n\nDeadpool stood up, picked up a rag from beside him, and walked over to where the two girls were sitting. He bent down and began wiping up the bloodstains the little boy had dripped on the floor.\n\nDeadpool's job in the bookstore was simple: cleaning.\n\nHe didn't need a salary, didn't need room and board, wouldn't complain, wouldn't protest, and wouldn't talk too much. He just knew how to work hard.\n\n\"Oh my god, he's actually alive,\" one of the girls exclaimed.\n\nThey had noticed Deadpool earlier, but since he had been standing completely still, they and the two kids had assumed he was just a humanoid mannequin the bookstore had on display.\n\nDeadpool very professionally finished cleaning, stood up, and prepared to leave.\n\nBut Zhou Ze gestured for him to stay put for a moment.\n\nJust then, whether out of mischief or genuine interest, the two girls came over, wanting to take a picture with Deadpool. One was in charge of taking the photo while the other went up to pose with him.\n\nPerhaps, in their eyes, he was just an actor hired by the bookstore for promotion.\n\nBoss Zhou lit a cigarette, watching as the two girls took picture after picture with Deadpool. One of them, a bit overexcited, asked Deadpool if he could take off his mask for another photo.\n\nDeadpool didn't move. He looked at Zhou Ze, awaiting his order.\n\n\"Looks like your boss is really strict. Making you wear all that in this heat,\" one of the girls said, speaking up for Deadpool.\n\n\"Boss, let him take off his mask and take a picture with us. What if he's handsome?\" the other girl pleaded with Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze nodded, signaling that Deadpool could take off his mask.\n\nThen Deadpool took off his mask.\n\nWhat followed was several seconds of dead silence.\n\nThen:\n\n“AHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!”\n\nThe two girls screamed wildly and scrambled out of the bookstore. The one who had tripped the little boy even slammed into the glass door on her way out, her face starting to bleed as well.\n\nThe impact made even Zhou Ze, who was watching from the side, feel his teeth ache in sympathy. She had probably scarred her face for good.\n\nDeadpool was a little bewildered, but he showed no particular emotion.\n\nThe last time he’d been struck by the Ghost Samurai's blade, a huge gash had been left running down from his face, making his already terrifying appearance even more grotesque.\n\nRather than calling him a \"person\" now, it would be more accurate to call him a humanoid worm.\n\nZhou Ze wasn't sure why he kept him around. To have him clean? To save on a janitor's salary?\n\nOf course, it certainly wasn't for some bullshit reason like \"deep father-son affection.\"\n\nPerhaps he just felt it was a waste.\n\nNo matter what a scumbag the Priest had been in life, just look at the things he’d accomplished. He was really good at stirring up trouble!\n\nAnd to be able to stand up again even after death... this kind of thing, while seemingly useless now, felt like a real shame to just throw away like trash.\n\n\"Put it back on,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nIt wasn't just the two girls; even Boss Zhou, who had seen his fair share of things, found it hard on the eyes.\n\nDeadpool nodded and put his mask back on.\n\nZhou Ze subconsciously flicked the ash from his cigarette.\n\nSeeing Deadpool about to walk over with the rag again, he felt a bit embarrassed and stubbed out the cigarette on the floor with his shoe, then ordered, \"Go get two sheets of spirit money from the counter and burn them at the entrance.\"\n\n...\n\nThe Old Taoist knew people from all walks of life.¹ This life of his had really just been about getting by. He hadn't gotten a family, nor had he gotten any children. If you judged a person's success by traditional Chinese values, the Old Taoist was undoubtedly a classic example of a failure.\n\nBut he only sought to live freely and happily. He figured that since everyone has to walk the road to the underworld and take a leap on the Bridge of Helplessness² after death, he might as well live as spontaneously as possible while he was alive.\n\nHe had been in Tongcheng for over half a year and had already made quite a few shady friends.\n\nActually, what Zhou Ze wanted was a basic set of research equipment, the kind you’d find in a hospital or a high school chemistry lab. He needed to crudely purify and package the Shore-To-Shore Flowers into a form that was easy to carry and consume.\n\nThe Old Taoist didn't know the specifics of what Zhou Ze was planning. He only knew he had to carry out the boss's orders as perfectly as possible.\n\nAfter leaving the bookstore, he picked up his phone and called a friend he'd made in Tongcheng, saying he wanted a set of lab instruments for purification and asking if he could get his hands on them.\n\nThe man was silent for a moment, then said, \"Okay.\"\n\nThe two agreed to meet first at a coffee shop on South Street. After sitting down, the Old Taoist felt a bit foolish. He should have just arranged to meet at the bookstore; this place was only a street away, and now he’d wasted money on coffee.\n\nThe man arrived, sporting a bushy beard. He was what the Old Taoist considered a \"cousin.\" The Old Taoist had once been \"comforting a fallen woman,\" and just as he came out of the roll-up door, the man was standing there waiting.\n\nThe Old Taoist shared a cigarette with him. The two nodded, and then the man thanked the Old Taoist, saying that he had helped \"lubricate the path\" for him, making things easier.\n\nLater, the Old Taoist went again, but when the roll-up door opened, it was the man who came out.\n\nAfter these two experiences, they were practically cousins. They even added each other on WeChat, went out for barbecue together, and the Old Taoist learned that he was in the smuggling business—basically just a small-time hoodlum who’d gotten older.\n\n\"Hey, you look terrible,\" the Old Taoist said with some concern. \"You should go less often, take better care of your body. If your health collapses, who will they have to rely on?\"\n\nThe man with the bushy beard paused, nodded, and then said, \"That stuff, what do you need it for?\"\n\n\"My boss plans to use it to purify something. Anyway, the stuff he's making is not for ordinary people. If they touch it, there will be big problems,\" the Old Taoist said very seriously.\n\n\"That stuff... is it potent?\" the man with the bushy beard asked.\n\n\"Potent?\"\n\nThe Old Taoist thought for a moment. He'd been the one to carry Xu Qinglang back to his room last night. Although the boss said he was drunk, the Old Taoist could clearly tell that wasn't it. He immediately said, \"Extremely potent. Anyway, they get a great high just lying in bed. Damn, it's scary just watching.\"\n\nThe man with the bushy beard swallowed and continued to ask, \"So after you make it, where does it mainly flow to?\"\n\n\"Flow to?\"\n\nThe Old Taoist thought again. The things the boss made probably couldn't be used by ordinary people. It would likely only circulate among the little girl or Boss Liang's circle. He replied, \"It probably just circulates within their own circle.\"\n\n\"An existing market, then?\"\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\n\"I'm asking, does it only circulate in Tongcheng?\"\n\nThe Old Taoist remembered that Boss Liang was in Shanghai and added, \"It might be sent to Shanghai, too.\"\n\n\"It circulates to Shanghai as well?\" The expression on the bushy-bearded man's face grew more and more solemn. His tension was obvious.\n\n\"Hey, what's wrong with you?\"\n\n\"N-nothing...\"\n\nAs he spoke, the man with the bushy beard reached up, took a small earpiece out of his ear, and placed it on the table. Then he pressed his hands together apologetically and said, \"Sorry, brother. I just got busted by the cops for smuggling.\"\n\n\"This...\"\n\nThe Old Taoist was completely dumbfounded.\n\nThis,\n\nNo,\n\nWait, this...\n\nJust then, the customers at the next table stood up. One restrained the man with the bushy beard, while two others grabbed the Old Taoist's shoulders, pressing him down onto the sofa.\n\n\"Stay still!\"\n\nThe Old Taoist looked utterly wronged.\n\nThere's been a misunderstanding, Officer!\n\n\"Here's my ID. We now suspect you are involved in the production and sale of narcotics. Please cooperate with our investigation.\"\n\nSeveral more police officers walked in from outside. One of them took out his badge and flashed it in front of the Old Taoist.\n\n...\n\n\"Boss, where's the Old Taoist?\" Bai Yingying asked Zhou Ze after she had washed up and come out.\n\n\"He went out to buy something for me. I need to process those Shore-To-Shore Flowers we got yesterday,\" Zhou Ze replied. \"What's with this guy? It's been so long and he still isn't back with the stuff.\"\n\nBai Yingying nodded, but then her expression suddenly changed. She immediately walked over to the boss and said, \"Boss, there are a lot of people outside watching us.\"\n\n\"Huh?\" Boss Zhou hadn't yet snapped out of his lazy, newspaper-reading stupor.\n\n\"Those few pedestrians over there, the ones sitting on the steps looking at the newspaper and playing on their phones, and the two women waiting for the bus at the stop. They're all staring at our place,\" Bai Yingying said with conviction.\n\nBoss Zhou stood up and walked to the bookstore entrance to have a look.\n\nHe would never doubt Bai Yingying's judgment. In this respect, she was actually better than him. After all, when he wasn't powered up, there really wasn't much difference between him and an ordinary person.\n\nJust then, Xu Qinglang staggered down the stairs, dressed in loose, rumpled pajamas. He was rubbing his head and complaining, \"My head is killing me.\"\n\n\"Did you have a good dream last night?\" Zhou Ze turned his head to tease him.\n\n\"You really can't touch that Shore-To-Shore Flower,\" Xu Qinglang said, shaking his head. \"It's even worse than being drunk.\"\n\nOn the third floor of a building across the street, a surveillance officer looking through a high-powered telescope immediately relayed a message through his earpiece: \"Report. There is another woman in the bookstore. She has come downstairs. Suspected of having an improper relationship with the suspect, the shop owner.\"\n\nJust then, the little girl, who had just gotten out of school, got off the bus. Carrying a large schoolbag, she walked toward the bookstore.\n\nShe was in a good mood, even humming a song, looking the picture of innocence.\n\nThe thought that she could take some of that stuff Zhou Ze was making home for a midnight snack tonight felt wonderful. She had been craving it for a long time, wanting to experience the pleasure of eating again.\n\nShe pushed open the bookstore door, walked in, and for the very first time, greeted Zhou Ze with a smile. \"Constable, is that stuff ready yet?\"\n\nThe distant surveillance officer reported again:\n\n\"Report. Requesting permission to delay the forced entry plan. A female child has entered the bookstore. We suspect she may be taken hostage by the suspect.\"\n\n---\n**Footnotes:**\n\n1.  **People from all walks of life (三教九流, *sānjiào jiǔliú*):** An idiom that literally means \"the three religions and nine schools of thought,\" but is now used to describe people from every corner of society, often with a slightly shady or lower-class connotation.\n2.  **Bridge of Helplessness (奈何橋, *Nàihé Qiáo*):** In Chinese mythology, this is a bridge every soul must cross in the underworld before being reincarnated.

    "content": "\"So, what's your plan? The equipment still hasn't been bought?\"\n\n\"The old Daoist isn't back yet.\"\n\n\"That old coot is so slow. If you'd told me earlier, I would have gone and gotten you a set,\" the little loli said helplessly.\n\nIf you can't buy it, can't you just steal it?\n\nIt's not like it's high-tech equipment, anyway. Boss Zhou isn't planning on doing biochemical research here. Grabbing some stuff from a high school chemistry lab would be enough.\n\n\"So, you're planning to make it into something like a capsule?\" the little loli asked, pointing at the design sketch Zhou Ze had drawn. \"Do you know how?\"\n\n\"It's not very difficult. The important part is to purify it first, then compress it. It'd be best if we can crystallize it. Otherwise, it'll be inconvenient for us to carry and use. Plus, we need to eliminate its effects on ordinary people around us.\"\n\nThe little loli nodded. In any case, she didn't really get it but was impressed nonetheless. And since Zhou Ze patted his chest and promised it wasn't a highly difficult technical job and that he could do it himself as long as the equipment arrived, she was willing to wait a bit longer.\n\n\"Well, I'm off. What a disappointment. I thought we'd be able to go out for a late-night snack today.\"\n\n\"I have some plum juice. You can make do with that.\"\n\n\"That's just eating for the sake of eating. You don't enjoy the deliciousness of the food at all. I'm not interested. I'd rather just go to sleep and let Wang Rui eat and sleep on her own; it's easier.\"\n\nThe big one and the little one came down from the second floor.\n\nThen,\n\nZhou Ze froze,\n\nBecause a third of the first floor was actually occupied by customers.\n\nZhou Ze swore to the heavens,\n\nhis bookstore's occupancy rate had never been this high since it opened!\n\nCould it be that the living standards of Tongcheng's people had suddenly taken a leap, and the one-hundred-yuan minimum charge was really outdated?\n\nBut soon, Zhou Ze and the little loli both stopped in their tracks.\n\nAmong the seated customers, two or three of them gave Zhou Ze and the little loli a slight sense of pressure, as if those people carried some kind of invisible light that was, in short, a bit glaring.\n\nEither this group of people were desperate fugitives, or the type who belonged to gangs—and had seen and personally participated in fights and killings—or they had to be police.\n\nThe first possibility was unlikely. Boss Zhou didn't think he'd done anything worthy of this bunch of society types¹ making a special trip to sit here. And seeing how they were all pretending to drink and read while actually paying close attention to their surroundings, their profession was all but obvious.\n\n\"Did you break the law?\" the little loli asked Zhou Ze in a low voice.\n\n\"No,\" Zhou Ze whispered back.\n\nBoss Zhou considered his recent actions and felt they shouldn't have been enough to bring the police to his door. Even when he occasionally bent the rules, he'd have someone burn joss paper at the bookstore's entrance, and the trouble would pass.\n\nCould it be that those two girls he scared off this morning had powerful connections?\n\nHe thought about it again and felt it didn't make sense. First, it was unlikely those two girls had the courage to retaliate against him. Second, even if they were retaliating, there was no need for such a big production, right? Besides, he had the Death Knight burn joss paper afterward.\n\nBoss Zhou had always hated trouble the most.\n\n\"You go upstairs. Take the wine jar and leave first,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nThe little loli nodded and turned right around to go upstairs.\n\nZhou Ze then gave the Death Knight, who was sitting dumbly to the side, a look, signaling him to go up and leave with the little loli.\n\nBai Yingying was still serving everyone tea and drinks. Zhou Ze walked over and reclined in his usual spot, picking up the newspaper on the table and flipping through it casually.\n\nBai Yingying walked up to Zhou Ze carrying a coffee.\n\n\"Go upstairs, then leave,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"They are...\" Bai Yingying had long since noticed something was wrong. She had said before that someone was watching the place from outside, and now they had brazenly entered the shop pretending to be customers.\n\nBai Yingying's identification was arranged by Xu Qinglang. This identity couldn't withstand a background check.\n\nOnce Bai Yingying had also gone upstairs, Zhou Ze had no more worries.\n\nIn fact, for Zhou Ze, the things in the bookstore that couldn't see the light of day were, ironically, the people.\n\nFor example, Bai Yingying's identity. You can't very well explain to the police that this person is from the Xianfeng era of the Qing Dynasty, can you?\n\nOr the Death Knight. If they just opened his coat, how could you explain it?\n\nZhou Ze had originally worried that letting Bai Yingying and the others leave first might arouse the suspicion of the officers present, but it was clear he had overthought it. In fact, it was quite the opposite; the little loli and Bai Yingying going upstairs actually made the officers breathe a long sigh of relief, feeling only that the hostages Zhou Ze could have taken were no longer by his side.\n\nXu Qinglang served cocktails to the last table. As he passed by Zhou Ze, he curiously shot Zhou Ze a look, as if to say, *what the hell is going on?*\n\nZhou Ze shrugged.\n\n*How the hell should I know?*\n\n*I don't know either.*\n\nBut Boss Zhou immediately thought of something and reminded Xu Qinglang:\n\n\"Have them pay first.\"\n\nHearing this, Xu Qinglang thought it made a lot of sense. It was rare to have so many suckers come in. Better to settle the bill first. Most importantly, if this bunch of officers were to suddenly have a transformation, like Emperor Kangxi on a private inspection tour, it would be inconvenient to collect money then.\n\nOld Xu went to collect the money, table by table.\n\nThe police actually paid up, probably because they were too embarrassed to reveal their identities when it was time to pay.\n\nAfter Xu Qinglang finished collecting the money and put it in the cash register drawer,\n\nZhou Ze let out a long sigh of relief.\n\n*As long as the money's collected.*\n\n*Now then,*\n\n*you can begin your performance.*\n\nBut he waited and waited, and this group of police officers just continued to silently drink their coffee or beverages. No one stood up to walk over to Zhou Ze and reveal their identity.\n\nThis left Boss Zhou a bit helpless.\n\n*Are you going to do it or not? Just get it over with.*\n\nBoss Zhou stood up, walked to the bookstore entrance, and pushed open the door.\n\nEven at this moment, the police officers in the room still didn't stand up.\n\n*What the hell is going on?*\n\nZhou Ze was completely bewildered,\n\nand subconsciously took two steps forward.\n\nAnd just then, two passersby on either side of the bookstore door suddenly rushed forward. Each pressed a hand on Zhou Ze's shoulders, intending to restrain him.\n\nUnder the sudden stimulation, Zhou Ze almost lost control and let out his armor or claws. He could only take deep breaths continuously to calm himself down, cooperating with the two plainclothes officers' movements and even proactively putting his hands behind his back for them to handcuff him.\n\nThe two plainclothes officers were even stunned for a moment. In all their years on the force, this was the first time they had seen a criminal suspect be so cooperative.\n\nThis time, it really wasn't that Boss Zhou was a coward. The key thing was, he had to figure out what crime he had actually committed, right?\n\nSuch a huge operation, so many police officers visiting his shop—Boss Zhou was completely in the dark.\n\n\"We are the police. You are currently suspected of being involved in the criminal activity of manufacturing and trafficking drugs. Please cooperate with our work. We will be taking you back to the police station for investigation.\"\n\nA middle-aged police officer walked up to Zhou Ze and showed him his credentials.\n\nManufacturing drugs?\n\nTrafficking drugs?\n\nBoss Zhou was completely dumbfounded.\n\nBoss Zhou was put into a police car. Xu Qinglang, who was inside, was also brought under control and put into a police car. Bai Yingying, the little loli, and the Death Knight were not discovered, perhaps because the police didn't consider them suspects.\n\nOnce at the police station, they went through the motions in the interrogation room first. The questions the police asked left Zhou Ze not knowing whether to laugh or cry.\n\nHe personally opened a workshop to make drugs?\n\nNot only were they circulating in Tongcheng, but he was also preparing to break into the Shanghai market? And even use Shanghai as a springboard to radiate further out?\n\nBoss Zhou wanted to ask his own conscience:\n\n*Am I really that hardworking?*\n\nIt seemed the police were also searching his bookstore. Midway through the interrogation, someone called the interrogating officer. The officer then specifically asked Zhou Ze another question: why was there a freezer in his bedroom.\n\nAnd it was the kind of freezer that, at a glance, was clearly meant for dead bodies, the same model rented out at morgues.\n\nZhou Ze said that summer was here, the air conditioner wasn't powerful enough, so he used that thing for cooling.\n\nThe interrogating officer slammed his hand on the table and reprimanded Zhou Ze, telling him to correct his attitude, cooperate with the interrogation properly, and that leniency would be shown to those who confess, but severity to those who resist!\n\nBoss Zhou couldn't help but roll his eyes. He figured if he told the truth—that if he didn't have that high school girl (Bai Yingying) sleeping with him, he could only fall asleep by lying in the freezer—this officer would be even more convinced that he had an attitude problem, or was even deliberately mocking the police.\n\nAfter the interrogation ended, Zhou Ze was sent to the detention center, which was a temporary holding area within the police station. It seemed the police had a certain number of hours they could hold him. If they didn't have concrete evidence, Boss Zhou could get out when the time was up.\n\nAll in all,\n\nthe whole day had been very strange. He had been treated as a drug criminal for no reason at all. Of course, Zhou Ze was also a little relieved in his heart. That day the delivery guy fell at his door, he had taken the money but still flushed that bag of blue pills down the toilet instead of keeping it. Otherwise, if it had been found during the search, it would truly be a case of yellow mud in your crotch—shit even if it isn't.\n\nOf course, that incident was resolved because he had burned joss paper. Logically, he shouldn't have been implicated in any trouble because of it. So, Zhou Ze was still wondering, which part had gone wrong?\n\nThe holding cell was very small. Zhou Ze was temporarily locked in a room.\n\n\"Boss, Boss, you're in here too!\"\n\nJust as Zhou Ze was about to sit down, he heard the old Daoist's voice from behind the bars opposite him.\n\nZhou Ze followed the voice with his eyes, frowned, and said, \"How did you get in here too?\"\n\nThe old Daoist's face was wrinkled up like a chrysanthemum. He said:\n\n\"Boss, I have the worst luck. I went to buy the equipment for you, but it turns out the guy was a smuggler who had just been caught by the police. I went to buy that stuff, and after I described it, they thought I was preparing to make drugs.\n\nThen they arrested me, kept asking me about the specific process. I explained it was a misunderstanding, but they didn't believe me. They also asked who I was buying the equipment for, so I could only say it was for you. And they wouldn't let me call you to let you know.\"\n\nZhou Ze understood. So, the old Daoist was the one to blame for this mess.\n\n\"That stuff... couldn't you just buy it from a school or a lab supply store? Why did you look for a smuggler.\"\n\n\"Uh, wasn't I just thinking of buying some better equipment for you to use, Boss? I could tell that thing you brought yesterday was very precious, good stuff. And you value it so much. Of course this humble Daoist had to choose better equipment for you.\"\n\n\"Well, thank you so much.\"\n\n\"So what exactly is that thing?\" The old Daoist's curiosity was piqued. He wasn't taking it too seriously anyway. The innocent will be proven innocent; the misunderstanding would eventually be cleared up.\n\n\"I had Lin Ke move it. That thing can't be allowed to fall into the wrong hands, or there will be big trouble.\"\n\n\"From the underground?\" The old Daoist asked, pointing down.\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"Oh, this humble Daoist understands.\" The old Daoist had an epiphany. So it was something from Hell.\n\n\"Let's just wait. We'll probably be let out soon enough,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Yeah. After we get out, I'll go straight to a school to buy the equipment for you, Boss. Then you can continue your production,\" the old Daoist said.\n\n***\n\nInside the monitoring room,\n\nthe video and audio were being transmitted in sync.\n\nSeveral police officers stood there, watching and listening.\n\n\"Director Sun, you really have a way with things. Sure enough, if you put two criminal suspects together, they're bound to reveal some clues. I was worried they would collude on their stories,\" one officer said.\n\nOne of the older police officers took a deep breath, and with a hint of angry frustration, he slammed his palm on the table and barked:\n\n\"How are you people doing your job!\n\nYou let the criminal suspect transfer the drugs before closing the net! Have the search results from that bookstore come in yet? Did you find nothing, no evidence at all?\n\nAnd, our Tongcheng actually has an underground channel that can provide criminals with the raw materials for drug production, and we were completely unaware of it! This is a disgrace to the entire Tongcheng police force!\n\nAlso, did you just hear that? The suspect is banking on the fact that we can't pin anything on him. He's even planning to go back and continue making drugs after his detention time is up!\n\nInvestigate!\n\nInvestigate it thoroughly for me!\n\nGet to the bottom of this for me!\"\n\n---\n¹Lit. \"society people\" (社会人), a slang term for people involved in gangs or organized crime.",

    "content": "Boss Zhou had no idea just how deep the misunderstanding the police had of him had become. He didn't have any counter-surveillance skills or awareness either. In his previous life, he'd left the orphanage with a clean slate and worked his way up like a model worker, never once setting foot in a holding cell. In this life, however, he'd already been in twice. The first time was right after he had come back to life in this body, and it was Dr. Lin who had come to pick him up.\n\nHe remembered chatting with some guy next to him back then, saying how that woman was pretty good-looking, and so on and so forth…\n\nWhen the police led Dr. Lin over to Zhou Ze and said, \"Your wife is here to take you home,\"\n\nZhou Ze was left completely dumbfounded.\n\nHe sat down on the platform. It was a bit chilly underneath, but Zhou Ze wasn't bothered by the cold. It was then that Zhou Ze noticed that only the Old Taoist and he were locked up together; Old Xu wasn't being held here.\n\nIt truly was a ridiculous misfortune, and both its cause and progression had a farcical quality that left one not knowing whether to laugh or cry.\n\nJust then, the door to the holding cell opened, and two police officers pushed a food cart in. Each person detained inside got a boxed meal and a bottle of mineral water.\n\nThe quality of the meal wasn't half bad—two meat dishes and two vegetable dishes. The officers even asked if it was enough, adding that there was extra white rice available.\n\nThe Old Taoist specifically asked for two boxed meals and sat there eating with great relish.\n\nZhou Ze opened his meal box, picked up his chopsticks, and poked at the meat a few times. He really had no appetite.\n\nThe concoction made with the Red Spider Lily wasn't ready yet, and he hadn't brought any plum juice or anything. Under these circumstances, asking Zhou Ze to eat was really asking too much of him.\n\nAn officer nearby noticed this and said with a displeased look, \"So picky?\"\n\nZhou Ze glanced back at him but said nothing. He put down his chopsticks, opened the bottle of mineral water, and took a few sips.\n\nThe afternoon passed, uneventfully. The Old Taoist wanted to chat with his boss, afraid he might be bored, but seeing that the boss wasn't in the mood for conversation, he simply leaned against the bars and started snoring.\n\nGiven the Old Taoist's life experience, entering a holding cell was like coming home. It was a place he couldn't be more familiar with; he could eat well, drink well, and sleep soundly inside.\n\nThe old bros in here were great talkers, too. He really loved it in here.¹\n\nBoss Zhou, on the other hand, was sitting against the wall, spacing out. He wasn't depressed, much less lost; he was simply treating it as if the sofa from his bookstore had been moved to a new spot. Just a different kind of slacker experience.\n\nBut no matter how much of a slacker he was, by the time night fell, Boss Zhou couldn't sit still anymore. His sleep schedule had been very regular lately, and this was the time he should be sleeping. But without Bai Yingying beside him and no freezer here, he couldn't fall asleep.\n\nThe two officers in the distance had changed shifts. Of the two new ones, one was constantly patrolling while the other sat there, seemingly reading a book.\n\nThe Old Taoist was still sound asleep, apparently sleeping more soundly than he did at home.\n\nZhou Ze suddenly thought of the Count of Monte Cristo. He remembered that in the story, the Count escaped from prison by digging a tunnel. Although he didn't have any tools on him, couldn't he dig with his fingernails?\n\nBut instead of digging a tunnel, wouldn't it be easier to just pry the lock open with his fingernails?\n\nAnd those two policemen, he could probably…\n\nMy armor can stop bullets, right?\n\nJust as Boss Zhou's mind was wandering,\n\nHe suddenly heard the sound of scraping and clattering, \"Clang… clang…\"\n\nIt sounded like iron chains being dragged across the ground—somewhat crisp, yet also muffled.\n\nZhou Ze was a little surprised. They still use leg shackles these days?\n\nThat shouldn't be right.\n\nHe looked toward the entrance but saw no one being escorted in. Yet the \"clang, clang\" sound was incessant and getting closer.\n\nAnd the two policemen, as well as the other cellmates including the Old Taoist, showed no reaction whatsoever.\n\nZhou Ze opened his mouth and yawned. He understood. This was a sound that, perhaps, only he could hear.\n\nWhat a sound only he could hear represented didn't really need any further explanation.\n\nBut Zhou Ze found it strange. A police station of all places could have *that kind of thing*?\n\nHis middle school politics textbook had stated very clearly that the police were the state's armed instrument of violent authority, granted power by national law. They were the state apparatus, inviolable by gods or ghosts.\n\nThis was why Zhou Ze was unwilling to start a conflict and had willingly let himself be brought in for questioning to clarify the situation. Firstly, he didn't want to ruin the bookstore life he'd built. Secondly, getting into a direct conflict with the police was a very unwise thing to do, even for a Ghost Emissary.\n\nTherefore, Zhou Ze found it rather surprising that a \"dirty thing\" would appear here.\n\n\"Clang… clang…\"\n\nThe sound came from far to near, but its source never actually appeared. Zhou Ze felt like a first-timer who'd bought a ticket to a strip club, anxiously waiting for the performer on stage to hurry up and take off the two most important pieces of clothing.\n\nBut it just kept him itching, letting him get close but never letting him in, deliberately clawing at his heart.\n\nAt this point, Boss Zhou really felt the impulse to just snap the lock, push the door open, and go take a look in the corridor to see which audacious master was stirring up trouble here.\n\nA police officer walked over. Seeing Zhou Ze gripping the bars with both hands and staring toward the exit, he sighed and said:\n\n\"Confess and you'll be treated with leniency; resist and you'll be treated with severity. Just confess everything you're supposed to, and you can get out. At the very least, you can find some peace of mind, right?\"\n\nZhou Ze completely ignored him, continuing to stare at the exit.\n\n\"Hey, I'm talking to you. You're not that old, are you? About the same age as my son.\"\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze.\n\nThis time, Zhou Ze turned his head and looked at the police officer.\n\n\"Officer, you're really not cut out for this kind of counseling work.\"\n\n\"Heh, it's fine. We can just chat.\"\n\nThe officer actually sat down on the floor, sitting across the bars from Zhou Ze, looking like he was settling in for a heart-to-heart talk.\n\nBut Boss Zhou's attention was almost entirely captivated by the sound of chains in the corridor. He was in no mood to entertain this man right now.\n\nBesides, this officer wasn't being entirely honest. Zhou Ze had noticed him the moment he came on shift. He carried a thick aura of righteousness, and the national emblem on his police cap seemed to actually glow in Zhou Ze's eyes.\n\nA cop like that would be reduced to guard duty?\n\nZhou Ze wasn't naive enough to believe that any random guard in the station was a hidden master.\n\n\"Hey, let me level with you. I've heard about your case. I know you're married, you have your own family, so we didn't notify your wife about this. You might have been deceived. In fact, many people like you who manufacture drugs are just tools for the drug cartels. There's really no need to take the fall for them. As long as you can tell us the clues you know, piece by piece, you'll have a chance to redeem yourself.\"\n\nZhou Ze waved his hand impatiently.\n\n\"You've really got the wrong person. I didn't make drugs, nor have I ever touched that stuff. This is all just a small misunderstanding. I just wanted to buy a simple set of equipment to make orange-crystal-infused water for myself.\"\n\n\"Don't be so resistant, and don't be in such a hurry to deny it. Just calm down and think it over carefully,\" the officer continued to coax him.\n\nPerhaps, in his eyes, Zhou Ze was young, his record was simple, and he would be an easy person to break.\n\nBut he couldn't have known that Boss Zhou was someone who had already died once. Setting aside the fact that he hadn't done any of that bullshit, even if he had, with Boss Zhou's temperament, how could he be so easily broken by a few words?\n\n\"Think about it. We've already got our eyes on you this time. The evidence will be found sooner or later. The only way to keep a secret is to not do it in the first place. There are gods watching from just above, right? Besides, you know the harm drugs do to people. After doing so many wicked things, aren't you afraid of going to hell?\"\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze.\n\n\"We're just chatting, anyway. This isn't an interrogation, and it's not being recorded, so I can speak more freely,\" the officer said with a cough.\n\n\"Let me be honest with you,\" Zhou Ze said helplessly.\n\n\"Go on, I'm listening.\" The officer quietly made a hand signal, motioning for his colleague watching the monitor to pay attention, while he himself listened intently.\n\n\"This is really just a misunderstanding. You've checked my record, so you should know my wife's family is very rich. Also, you arrested that employee of mine from the bookstore, the one named Xu. You can check on him; he has over twenty properties in his name. These days, whether you're in retail, innovation, or whatever, what's a faster or more stable way to make money than real estate? Even that guy over there in the Taoist robe, he personally sponsors over a hundred students in mountainous regions. A single livestream of his can bring in hundreds of thousands. Are we so bored, being this well-off, that we'd go into manufacturing and dealing drugs?\"\n\nZhou Ze felt he had spoken from the heart.\n\nThe meaning was also very clear:\n\nNone of us are short on cash.\n\nEven the \"poorest\" of them, Boss Zhou, could get money if he shamelessly went to suck up to his father-in-law. Or even simpler, he could just trick Bai Yingying into giving him some of her burial goods to sell as antiques and live a life free from worry.\n\n\"Mmm...\"\n\nThe officer had clearly investigated their situations.\n\nAt this moment,\n\nAfter hearing Zhou Ze's words, he nodded, indicating that what he said was indeed very reasonable.\n\n\"See? We're all rich, we don't lack money. How could we be so damn bored that we'd go and do something illegal? You think our lives aren't comfortable enough? The logic doesn't add up.\"\n\nA rather playful look appeared on the officer's face as he said:\n\n\"That's not exactly the most rigorous logic, especially when it comes to you.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"For example... that bookstore you run near South University, it's been losing money this whole time, right? So, we can totally use that to re-establish your motive. For instance, a person who would open a guaranteed money-losing bookstore in a prime commercial area... it seems plausible that he'd also manufacture and deal drugs. Because maybe your starting point and your most basic motive were never about making money. Maybe it was just for the thrill, for the fun of it... Don't you think?\"\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze.\n\n---\n¹ A reference to a Chinese internet meme about enjoying prison life.",

    "content": "Zhou Ze suddenly felt this police uncle was making a lot of sense.\n\n  The logic was sound,\n\n  the reasoning clear,\n\n  the examples fitting,\n\n  and his points were irrefutable.\n\n  Damn it,\n\n  it got to the point where Boss Zhou himself started to wonder: was he *really* a drug dealer?\n\n  Otherwise, why would he be running this bookstore?\n\n  After renting the Xu family's shop on South Street,\n\n  why open a bookstore of all things?\n\n  Was it just because that idiot Xu Le opened a bookstore, so I had to open one too?\n\n  I could have opened a \"Magic Finger Paradise,\" an \"Azure Water Blue Sky,\" or a \"Heaven on Earth.\"¹\n\n  \"See? I was right, wasn't I?\"\n\n  Seeing Zhou Ze's expression, the police uncle thought he'd struck a nerve, so he pressed his advantage while the iron was hot:\n\n  \"Actually, I can understand the way you young people think. After all, things are different from my time.\n\n  My childhood was pretty tough. We had enough to eat, but eating meat at every meal was difficult. So back then, all I wanted was to be able to eat meat at every meal.\n\n  It's not like you guys. Your generation grew up when living conditions were much better, so you just want to stir things up and find something to do.\n\n  But………………\"\n\n  The police officer was still trying to do his ideological work,\n\n  but Zhou Ze suddenly heard a \"clank-clank\" sound right beside him.\n\n  He shot to his feet, his eyes scanning the surroundings, but he could only hear the sound; he couldn't \"see\" a thing.\n\n  This is impossible,\n\n  this is completely impossible!\n\n  There was a ghost that he couldn't \"see\"?\n\n  A ghost emissary unable to see a ghost was like a barber who only cut hair for bald people. Wasn't that just bullshit?\n\n  When the earnest police uncle saw Zhou Ze suddenly stand up, he thought he'd been moved by his words and had finally decided to confess. He got excited and stood up as well, but just as he was about to say something more, he saw Zhou Ze begin to pace back and forth inside the cell.\n\n  \"Clank-clank…………clank-clank…………\"\n\n  \"Hey, are you all right?\" The police uncle was stunned. He started to suspect Zhou Ze was having withdrawal symptoms, but hadn't the urine test come back clean?\n\n  But in reality, Zhou Ze was continuously changing his position, following the sound of the chains.\n\n  The sound of chains dragging on the floor was right beside him, right outside his cell. It was walking right here!\n\n  Finally, the sound of the chains \"walked\" toward the exit.\n\n  Zhou Ze immediately went to the lock, his hands instinctively grabbing the bars there.\n\n  But Zhou Ze managed to restrain himself. He chose not to use his own strength to force the lock and get out, but the feeling was incredibly frustrating.\n\n  My numbers,\n\n  they'd just strolled right past me,\n\n  and walked away!\n\n  It was like a beautiful woman stripping naked and dancing for you for an hour, only to say, \"Sorry, my aunt is visiting,\"² and then leave, leaving you a complete mess in the wind.\n\n  \"Hey, are you all right? Don't try to play dumb. I didn't see any history of mental illness in your file!\" The police uncle thought Zhou Ze was trying to pull some trick.\n\n  \"Your mo—\"\n\n  Zhou Ze almost blurted it out.\n\n  But he took a deep breath.\n\n  \"—ther. Is your mother in good health?\"\n\n  \"...\" said the police uncle.\n\n  \"Think it over. If you confess now, it'll count as a voluntary surrender. Seriously, you might even get credit for meritorious service.\" The police uncle took out his ID. \"My name is Zhang Yanfeng. When you've thought it through, tell me immediately.\"\n\n  The middle-aged officer sighed, went over to pick up his water cup for a drink, then turned and left the detention center with a sense of helplessness.\n\n  Zhou Ze stood where he was. No one noticed that on the inside of the iron bars, he had already carved deep \"gullies\" with his fingernails.\n\n  Then,\n\n  Zhou Ze simply sat back down.\n\n  \"Boss, you've been wronged.\"\n\n  The old Daoist across from him had woken up when the police uncle began his political education. Seeing Zhou Ze's reaction now, he thought his boss wanted to get out.\n\n  Zhou Ze shot the old Daoist an irritated glare.\n\n  When it came down to it, this whole mess was the old Daoist's fault. He himself was usually very clean in his dealings; for even the smallest matter that might lead to trouble, he would burn some nether money.\n\n  But this time,\n\n  the old Daoist had landed him in a big one.\n\n  \"Boss, we'll be out tomorrow. We didn't do a thing, and the cops can't find anything. You have to control yourself!³\"\n\n  The old Daoist was genuinely worried his boss would pick the lock and storm out of the police station.\n\n  That would mean the bookstore and all of their lives would be ruined.\n\n  \"Go to sleep.\"\n\n  Zhou Ze couldn't be bothered to say more. He leaned back against the bars, then asked:\n\n  \"By the way, Old Daoist, do you know anyone at the police station?\"\n\n  \"Huh?\" The old Daoist was momentarily baffled. \"Boss, you've taken a liking to this place too? Let this humble Daoist tell you, the food at the Tongcheng Detention Center is actually pretty good. The one in Rongcheng isn't bad either, being a big city and all. The most god-awful are the detention centers in some small towns. The food just doesn't taste as good as it does here...\"\n\n  \"You should probably shut up.\"\n\n  Zhou Ze had intended to find a chance to come back after this was all over to see if he could find the owner of the clanking chains, but the old Daoist had clearly gotten the wrong idea.\n\n  \"The detention center in Guangzhou is the worst. You know how humid it is in Guangzhou, tsk tsk, staying in the detention center there is truly miserable...\"\n\n  \"If you don't shut up, I'll pick the lock, come out, and strangle you first.\"\n\n  \"...\" said the old Daoist.\n\n  The old Daoist immediately shut up and chickened out.\n\n  Zhou Ze listened intently. He couldn't sleep anyway. But unfortunately, the sound of the chains didn't appear again, right up until dawn.\n\n  In the morning, a few police officers came over, unlocked the cell, and signaled for Zhou Ze to come out.\n\n  Zhou Ze and the old Daoist were taken back to an interrogation room. This time, however, they weren't asked much. They signed some papers, gave a statement, and were then told they could go.\n\n  The one-night tour of the detention center was over.\n\n  When Zhou Ze walked out, Xu Qinglang and the old Daoist were already waiting for him outside; they had been processed a bit faster than him.\n\n  Xu Qinglang handed Zhou Ze a cigarette he had just bought from a freshly opened pack.\n\n  Zhou Ze took the cigarette but didn't leave right away. Instead, he sat down on the edge of the flower bed in front of the police station.\n\n  \"They probably didn't find any evidence, so they had to let us out for now,\" Xu Qinglang said with a smile.\n\n  \"The way you say that makes it sound like we actually did something shady,\" Zhou Ze said, blowing a smoke ring.\n\n  \"Heh, as if our bookstore is short on shady business,\" Xu Qinglang retorted.\n\n  \"I'll call a car?\" The old Daoist took out his phone to hail a ride.\n\n  Now that they were out, they should naturally head back to the bookstore as soon as possible. The old Daoist wasn't worried about the bookstore's business—it had always been crap anyway—he was worried about his monkey.\n\n  The monkey was very smart and would never show itself if there were customers in the store.\n\n  When the plainclothes officers had come in yesterday, they naturally hadn't discovered the monkey. If they had, even if Boss Zhou wasn't making drugs, there would have been trouble. After all, that monkey was a pretty high-class breed, a nationally protected animal.\n\n  \"Wait.\"\n\n  Zhou Ze flicked his cigarette ash and glanced back at the police station.\n\n  He still hadn't figured out the matter of the chains from yesterday, and it was making him antsy.\n\n  The police station was a place that even a ghost emissary like Zhou Ze wasn't too keen on entering. Because of that, Zhou Ze had a feeling that what he had encountered yesterday might have been a big fish.\n\n  \"What's wrong, Old Zhou? Feeling a bit nostalgic, can't bear to leave?\" Xu Qinglang teased.\n\n  \"Let's go back first,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n  The old Daoist called a car, and soon a ride-share pulled up. The three of them got in.\n\n  Zhou Ze and Xu Qinglang sat in the back, while the old Daoist sat in the front passenger seat.\n\n  \"Are you guys police officers?\" the driver asked as he drove.\n\n  \"Suspects,\"\n\n  the old Daoist said bluntly.\n\n  \"...\" said the driver.\n\n  _s\"Hey, don't let your hands shake. 'Suspects' just means we're under suspicion, you know?\n\n  \"Though when I watch those legal shows, hearing criminals called 'criminal suspects' or 'suspects' always felt a bit roundabout. 'Criminal' is so much more direct. But now I think it's quite fitting. The three of us are the kind the police want to arrest but can't because they don't have enough evidence, get it?\"\n\n  the old Daoist explained.\n\n  But the driver's hands only trembled more.\n\n  \"Even if caught in the act of committing a crime, as long as they have not been convicted by a people's court, they are still considered a 'criminal suspect.' Understand?\" Xu Qinglang added, educating the old Daoist.\n\n  \"Yo, I get it. You're the expert,\" the old Daoist said with a chuckle.\n\n  The driver's face began to twitch.\n\n  It wasn't that the driver was a coward, but damn, the back-and-forth between these two was putting him under immense psychological pressure.\n\n  \"Right, Boss, should I go get that equipment for you this afternoon? The police are still watching us. It'd be a huge pain if they arrested us again on suspicion of drug manufacturing.\"\n\n  \"I'll figure out a way to take it out myself.\" Zhou Ze was also worried about that trouble, so he planned to take the wine urn and find a lab somewhere to do the extraction.\n\n  \"Right, we should move to a different location. I bet there will still be plainclothes officers watching our shop for a while,\" Xu Qinglang said.\n\n  The driver swallowed hard. He really wanted to pull over and kick these three out, but he didn't quite dare.\n\n  In his distraction, the Audi in front of them suddenly slammed on its brakes. The driver, caught off guard, didn't have time to brake and rear-ended it.\n\n  \"Bang!\"\n\n  The two cars collided.\n\n  Honestly, running into drivers who like to brake suddenly for no reason is a real pain in the ass. But generally speaking, in a rear-end collision, the car behind is usually at fault, because the driver's ed test says you must maintain a safe following distance. Then again, given the traffic congestion in most Chinese cities now, maintaining a strictly defined safe distance isn't always realistic.\n\n  \"How are you driving?!\" the old Daoist fumed. Getting into a car accident right after leaving the detention center—what bad luck.\n\n  Just then,\n\n  the door of the Audi in front opened.\n\n  The old Daoist gloated slightly, \"Well, look at that. The owner's coming to give you trouble.\"\n\n  But to everyone's surprise, after the male driver got out, he didn't come over to make trouble. Instead, he took off running, faster than a rabbit.\n\n  This left the four people in the car rather astonished. The driver sat in the car and called the traffic police. No matter what, it was best to have them handle it.\n\n  The old Daoist, however, opened his door first, got out, and walked to the front to take a look.\n\n  At that moment, the rear door of the car that had been hit was suddenly pushed open,\n\n  and a woman bound with ropes tumbled out of the car.\n\n  \"Yo, little sis, playing cosplay?\"\n\n  the old Daoist commented from the side.\n\n  The girl calmly sat on the ground and began to struggle out of the ropes. After freeing herself, she reached up and pulled the cloth gag out of her mouth.\n\n  \"Someone stole my car in the parking lot and kidnapped me. He ran off just now because of the collision,\" the girl said to the old Daoist.\n\n  \"Hahahahahahahaha………………\"\n\n  The old Daoist clutched his stomach, roaring with laughter.\n\n  \"Little sis, you're hilarious. That's not a very funny joke. Don't worry, even though you guys slammed on your brakes for no reason, the rear car is responsible in a collision. We're just passengers, not the owner, it's fine.\n\n  \"This story you've made up, even movies wouldn't dare to film it like this. Someone who steals your car also kidnaps you?\n\n  \"And you were only saved because we rear-ended your car?\n\n  \"Oh, little sis,\n\n  \"are you trying to make me laugh to death so you can inherit my Huabei debt?⁴\"\n\n  The girl tilted her head and looked at the old Daoist calmly.\n\n  The old Daoist's laughter slowly died down,\n\n  then, with a hint of doubt, he asked tentatively:\n\n  \"Damn it... are you for real?\"\n\n***\n\n¹These are names typical of massage parlors, KTVs, or nightclubs in China, often with suggestive undertones.\n\n²\"My aunt is visiting\" (来亲戚了, lái qīnqi le) is a common Chinese euphemism for a woman having her period.\n\n³The original is a well-known Chinese internet meme, `你要控鸡住你叽叽啊` (nǐ yào kòng jī zhù nǐ jī jī a), a humorous mispronunciation of `你要控制住你自己啊` (nǐ yào kòngzhì zhù nǐ zìjǐ a), meaning \"You have to control yourself.\" The mispronunciation sounds like \"You have to control your chicken/dick.\"\n\n⁴Huabei is a popular consumer credit service in China, similar to services like Afterpay or Klarna.

    "content": "The traffic police arrived, and so did the regular police. A kidnapping had occurred, after all. The plot was ridiculous, completely nonsensical—the kind that probably not even a Stephen Chow movie would dare to use, for fear of being blasted by the audience for being an insult to their intelligence and completely devoid of logic. But it had, in fact, genuinely happened.\n\nPerhaps when the news first started spreading on Weibo and Tieba, many would have blasted it with the saying, \"One picture to start, the rest is pure fabrication.\"\n\nBut when the facts were truly revealed, it was enough to make a great many people's glasses fall off in shock.\n\nSomewhat coincidentally, the \"guard\" who had given Zhou Ze a political lecture just last night was also here, looking for all the world like a police squad leader as he assigned tasks.\n\nHis name seemed to be Zhang Yanfeng; Zhou Ze had some recollection of it.\n\nThat made sense. A police officer who carried himself with such an aura of noble righteousness—how could he possibly be just a lowly guard?\n\nHe saw Zhou Ze too, and frowning deeply, he walked over.\n\nZhou Ze had just finished giving a simple statement. In truth, the case was already quite clear. The police had obtained video footage of the culprit and locked onto his identity; all that remained was the work of closing the net.\n\n\"We meet again.\" Zhang Yanfeng reached out and patted Zhou Ze's shoulder lightly.\n\nZhou Ze frowned slightly. He was a mysophobe and really disliked physical contact from people he wasn't familiar with.\n\nSo, when Officer Zhang removed his hand, Zhou Ze even deliberately reached up and brushed off his own shoulder.\n\n\".........\" Officer Zhang.\n\n\"Let me repeat, I wasn't making drugs,\" Zhou Ze reiterated, sounding a bit resigned.\n\nHe really hadn't done anything illegal or disorderly in his bookstore. Besides, Zhou Ze was a lazy person; if a problem could be solved by calling the police, he would absolutely never handle it himself. He had no interest in playing the part of some vigilante, meting out extrajudicial punishments.\n\nHe believed the People's Police were absolutely just and served the people. Moreover, with the convening of the 19th National Congress, the conduct of police personnel and their rules and regulations were constantly being improved and advanced, having already become a solid force and a powerful guarantee for the protection of the construction of Socialism with Chinese characteristics!\n\n\"Whether you did or not, we will continue to investigate,\" said Officer Zhang.\n\n\"But I quite liked the environment in the detention center,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nOfficer Zhang was taken aback for a moment, then said, \"Am I to understand this as some kind of provocation?\"\n\n\"No. It's like how a lot of artsy types say a trip to Tibet can purify the soul. I feel that a stay in a detention center can also calm a restless heart.\"\n\n\"Heh heh.\" Officer Zhang gave a smile that didn't reach his eyes.\n\nZhou Ze shrugged. It couldn't be helped. He could hardly say, *\"It seems there's a ghost in the station's detention center. How about I catch it for you, free of charge?\"* now, could he?\n\n\"I have your business card. I'll contact you in a while for a chat. I hope we can chat in the detention center,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"I'd be delighted.\"\n\nZhou Ze told Lao Dao to hail another cab. Whatever the case, they should head back first. He was exhausted and wanted to return to the bookstore to get some sleep.\n\nHowever, the area was a bit congested because of the incident, so the three of them would have to walk a ways before they could catch a cab.\n\nBoss Zhou yawned as he walked. Just then, a *shalla-lalla* sound rang in his ear.\n\nZhou Ze froze completely, stopping all movement, and just listened intently.\n\n*Shalla-lalla... shalla-lalla...*\n\nYes,\n\nit was the sound of those leg shackles dragging on the ground.\n\nVery close.\n\nVery, very close.\n\nRight beside him!\n\nIt came out?\n\nIt followed me out of the station?\n\nAnd in broad daylight!\n\nSo disrespectful, so brazen?\n\nBut, just like last night, Zhou Ze could still only hear the sound, but couldn't see anything physical. This feeling made Zhou Ze very uncomfortable, and it was something he wasn't used to.\n\nHuman fear stems from the unknown. This sort of invisible thing that you could only fill in with your imagination was the most torturous kind. It was like in a horror movie, where the scariest part isn't when the ghost jumps out to fight you, but the phase before it appears, when the main characters are walking through a gloomy setting accompanied by oppressive music.\n\n\"Stop.\"\n\nZhou Ze held out a hand, signaling for Lao Dao and Xu Qinglang to halt.\n\nLao Dao looked at Zhou Ze, bewildered. Xu Qinglang did the same.\n\nIf even Zhou Ze couldn't see the thing, they certainly couldn't.\n\nWhen Zhou Ze stopped,\n\nthe sound of the chains suddenly vanished as well, as if it had moved far away.\n\nBut in the back of his mind, Zhou Ze could imagine that a figure in leg shackles had just passed right by him.\n\nWhere was it going?\n\nWhat was it going to do?\n\nA lost soul that could still move about in a place like a police station—what kind of existence was this?\n\nBy now, Zhou Ze no longer had the mindset of catching a big fish; instead, he was beginning to worry if this thing would cause some kind of destruction to society, if it would harm the innocent.\n\nIt was the same principle that prevented the little loli from retreating when she faced the ghost samurai at the Hot Spring Villa. This was his duty. The Netherworld Bureau might not care about low-level Emissaries like them killing and earning extra cash on the side, but if they failed to do their primary job, the Bureau had its own special methods of punishment.\n\nGlancing around, Zhou Ze noticed a proctology hospital diagonally across the street.\n\nAlright then. Based on some instinct, places like hospitals and schools always seemed to be hotspots for ghosts, so Zhou Ze subconsciously headed for the hospital entrance.\n\nThis hospital wasn't large, just a single building, a small specialty hospital.\n\nReaching the hospital entrance, Zhou Ze sat down on the steps.\n\n\"Cover for me,\" Zhou Ze said to Lao Dao and Xu Qinglang beside him.\n\nThe two nodded. Although they didn't know what Zhou Ze planned to do, they still chose to cooperate.\n\nThe nail on Zhou Ze's right index finger grew long, as wisps of black qi began to swirl around it. Then, Zhou Ze touched his nail to the ceramic tiles on the ground, and the black qi merged into the floor.\n\nBut this time, no black footprints appeared on the ground. This was a trick Zhou Ze had used before with unfailing success. He couldn't pull off tricks like the little loli, such as soul projection or whatnot,\n\n*Biu*—\n\nand she's gone.\n\n*Biu*—\n\nand she's back again.\n\nBut he had his own methods for catching ghosts. However, to his surprise, not only was this ghost invisible to him, but even its footprints wouldn't appear.\n\nWhat on earth... was this thing?\n\nZhou Ze stood up and walked down the steps. The problem was now at an impasse: if he couldn't even find the thing, how could he possibly deal with it?\n\nHowever, just at that moment, the *shalla-lalla* sound rang out again.\n\nZhou Ze took a deep breath, his fists clenched. He was angry, truly angry. The other party was provoking and taunting him. It was completely disregarding him, an Emissary of the Netherworld!\n\nNo matter how minor a village official, he's still an official, right?¹\n\nAn impulse even rose in Boss Zhou's heart: screw it, he'd just go into 'Musou mode' and drag this pretentious bastard out, even if it meant being paralyzed for another half-month.\n\nBut then Zhou Ze worried that he might still find nothing even after turning into a zombie, which would mean being completely incapacitated for the next half-month.\n\n*Shalla-lalla... shalla-lalla...*\n\nThe sound continued.\n\nZhou Ze closed his eyes and began to listen quietly.\n\nTo the left. The sound was clearer from the left!\n\nOpening his eyes, he saw the entrance to the hospital building was to his left. Zhou Ze directly pushed past Lao Dao and Xu Qinglang in front of him and rushed inside.\n\n*Shalla-lalla... shalla-lalla... shalla-lalla...!!!!!!!!*\n\nAs if deliberately toying with Zhou Ze, the moment he started running in that direction, the sound of the chains grew urgent again, its frequency increasing, as if that fellow was also running right ahead of him.\n\nLao Dao and Xu Qinglang could only run along behind Zhou Ze. Although they had no idea what he was chasing, they just followed his lead.\n\nIn truth, Zhou Ze didn't know what he was chasing either.\n\nHe even began to wonder if what he was chasing was actually a ghost at all.\n\nIf it were a ghost, how could he possibly not see it? Could it be some kind of mountain spirit or wild demon? Was it using a special illusion to make itself invisible to him?\n\nBut it was wearing shackles and chains?\n\nThanks to his previous experience with that wanking monkey,² Zhou Ze maintained an extremely cautious attitude towards spirit-like creatures. Whatever the case, Boss Zhou wasn't about to foolishly rush in and fight for his life like last time.\n\nThe sound continued to quicken,\n\nechoing ceaselessly in Zhou Ze's ears,\n\nZhou Ze... Zhou Ze...\n\nZhou Ze was running out of steam.\n\nThis damn body of Xu Le's, its physical condition is so terrible!\n\nHe seemed to forget who it was that barely ate, spent all day lounging on the sofa reading the paper and drinking coffee, and couldn't even be bothered to take a single step outside the bookstore when there was nothing to do.\n\nHe ran and ran, and ended up in a dead-end alley. There was a wall ahead, and to the left of the wall, a restroom.\n\nZhou Ze gradually slowed his pace.\n\nLikewise,\n\nthe sound of the chains dragging also slowed. The other party must have also run into the dead end and was slowing down, probably thinking about where to go next.\n\nZhou Ze opened his arms and lunged forward. The movement made him look like a big idiot pretending a girl was hugging him, but it was the best method Zhou Ze could choose right now.\n\nNot the slightest sensation of contact. Nothing. Zhou Ze turned into the restroom.\n\nThe hospital restroom was actually in pretty good condition. It was specially cleaned by someone, and the floor tiles had just been mopped.\n\nThere were three squat-toilet stalls in this small restroom. Zhou Ze went to each one, opened the door, and even waved his hand around inside. Still nothing.\n\nDamn it,\n\nwhere the hell did that thing go!\n\nZhou Ze walked to the sink, turned on the tap to splash his face with water, and began to gasp for breath.\n\n\"Holy shit, Boss... you were in such a hurry to run all this way... just to use the toilet?\"\n\nLao Dao had also reached the restroom entrance by now, panting heavily with his hands on his hips.\n\nThen, Lao Dao even took out half a pack of tissues and offered them to Zhou Ze. \"Need this?\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't answer, continuing to splash his face.\n\n\"In that case, this humble Taoist will relieve himself first.\"\n\nLao Dao first felt around his crotch, pulled out a paper talisman, and stuck it on the sink's mirror. Then he walked over to the urinal, undid his belt, and began to let loose.\n\nNo one knew where he got this habit of hiding talismans in his crotch. According to Xu Qinglang's teasing explanation, Lao Dao had once gone for a 'grand healthcare' service³ and nearly had his yang energy sucked out by a female ghost. The crotch talisman was his last line of defense, just in case.\n\nZhou Ze wiped the water from his face with his sleeve and walked to the restroom entrance to wait for Lao Dao to finish up.\n\n\"What's going on?\" Xu Qinglang asked, standing at the entrance.\n\n\"I don't kn—\"\n\nZhou Ze began to answer, his gaze falling back on the restroom.\n\nBecause he had put some distance between himself and the sink's mirror,\n\nhis reflection had shrunk but was now more fully visible.\n\nIn the next moment,\n\nZhou Ze froze.\n\nIn the mirror—the one with Lao Dao's talisman stuck to it—\n\nhe saw with perfect clarity,\n\nwrapped around his own ankles,\n\nwas a rusted chain.\n\nIt was very long,\n\nand very thick...\n\n***\n**Footnotes:**\n¹ A common Chinese saying (`村官再小，它好歹也是個幹部不是？`) emphasizing that even a low-level position holds some authority.\n² Literal translation of `擼管猴子`, a likely reference to a previous encounter in the story.\n³ \"Grand healthcare\" (`大保健`) is a common euphemism for visiting a brothel or a massage parlor offering sexual services.",

    "content": "On the steps of the flowerbed in front of the hospital, Zhou Ze sat silently, his gaze fixed on the tops of his feet.\n\n  In truth,\n\n  You couldn't see anything at all right now, couldn't even feel it. But the image in the mirror from before had already explained everything.\n\n  This chain was shackled to his ankle, and the sound he had been hearing intermittently was, in fact, the noise caused by his own movements.\n\n  But there was one thing Zhou Ze didn't understand. Last night in the detention center, he had clearly heard the sound from the corridor outside first. This at least proved that the chain wasn't on his foot at that time.\n\n  That meant, in that brief moment when the sound of the chain suddenly appeared around him, someone, or rather something, had shackled it to his foot.\n\n  And he had been completely unaware. In fact, if the old Taoist hadn't casually stuck the talisman from his crotch onto the mirror while taking a leak, he might never have realized that the very chain he'd been desperately running around searching for...\n\n  was on his own body!\n\n  Taking a taxi back, he returned to the bookstore. Zhou Ze sat down behind the counter.\n\n  He was in no mood to take a shower and call Bai Yingying upstairs to his room to sleep with him,\n\n  no mood to mess around with any Spider Lily juice,\n\n  and certainly no mood to read the paper, drink coffee, and bask in the sun.\n\n  He would lower his head from time to time to look at his feet,\n\n  then raise his head again,\n\n  staring at the sky.\n\n  In short, he was utterly melancholic.\n\n  The old Taoist told Bai Yingying about the chain, and she was utterly astonished to hear it.\n\n  Moreover, because of the boss's silence, everyone in the bookstore fell silent as well.\n\n  The old Taoist locked the bookstore door. It wouldn't be convenient for any customers to come in at this time. As for ghosts, it made no difference to a ghost who wanted to get in whether the door was open or closed.\n\n  He poured himself a glass of water, got a handful of peanuts for the monkey, and looked at the boss, who was still staring at the floor. He suddenly felt a little like laughing.\n\n  This scene,\n\n  was a bit like \"The Emperor's New Clothes.\"\n\n  The boss says he has a chain on his foot,\n\n  invisible,\n\n  intangible.\n\n  Isn't that just a remake of \"The Emperor's New Clothes\"?\n\n  After returning to the bookstore, Zhou Ze got the talisman back from the old Taoist, found a mirror, and placed it on the floor in front of him. The mirror reflected his feet perfectly.\n\n  It also revealed a rusted chain.\n\n  It existed.\n\n  Truly, tangibly existed.\n\n  Undeniably existed.\n\n  The old Taoist had leaned in for a look at first. Xu Qinglang and Bai Yingying also came over to observe it, as if they were examining a new curiosity.\n\n  At least for now, it seemed the chain had no other harmful effects, aside from making you feel annoyed.\n\n  But as the man in question, Boss Zhou didn't see it that way. He didn't want his feet to be in shackles, even if he couldn't touch or see them normally. It was a weight on his mind.\n\n  And looking at the reflection in the talisman-adorned mirror, the filthy rust and the skin-crawling pits were even more unbearable for the fastidious Boss Zhou.\n\n  Honestly,\n\n  If the chain had been made of pure gold or sterling silver, or even had some kind of new-wave anti-design style, Boss Zhou might have felt a bit better about it. At least it wouldn't feel like he had thorns in his back.\n\n  \"Boss, could it be that because you were identified as a criminal, these shackles appeared on your feet?\n\n  Remember that suicidal teacher who wore the tall hat that said 'Human Face, Beast's Heart'?¹\n\n  You couldn't get his hat off either.\"\n\n  Bai Yingying speculated.\n\n  Xu Qinglang nodded beside her, seeming to agree that it was a real possibility.\n\n  Public opinion is a fearsome thing.\n\n  \"Impossible. That's not it.\"\n\n  Zhou Ze shook his head, rejecting the theory.\n\n  \"That teacher's case blew up on the internet, and public outrage was immense. This time, it was just a few police officers who suspected me. The scale is completely different. This shouldn't have happened.\"\n\n  That's right, because Zhou Ze could also confirm that the chain wasn't on him to begin with; it had approached from a distance.\n\n  The old Taoist leaned over and pointed at the small mirror in front of Zhou Ze. \"Boss, honestly, I think your iron chain is pretty cool. Think about it, when you go into berserk mode, that look...\"\n\n  As he spoke, the old Taoist let his arms hang limp, his expression vacant, and swayed back and forth a few times like a zombie. Then he pointed to his own feet and said:\n\n  \"If you added a chain to your feet right now, you'd look just like Iori Yagami in his Riot of the Blood state from the *King of Fighters* arcade games.\"\n\n  Saying this, the old Taoist propped up his arms,\n\n  striking a power-up pose.\n\n  Then, as if his inner child had been unleashed, or as if he were truly lost in the atmosphere of playing arcade games in the old days, he waved his arms back and forth, muttering:\n\n  \"Obscure... obscure... obscure...\"\n\n  Zhou Ze turned his head to look at the old Taoist, lost in his own world, and said:\n\n  \"Lao Dao, the bookstore floor...\"\n\n  \"Ah, the Deathly Attendant just swept it,\" the old Taoist immediately replied. Ever since the Deathly Attendant arrived, the old Taoist's workload had become much lighter.\n\n  \"Oh.\"\n\n  Zhou Ze nodded and continued:\n\n  \"Tongcheng is applying for the 'National Civilized City' title, isn't it? Go clean the street in front of our bookstore. It's our duty as citizens.\"\n\n  \"...\" said the old Taoist.\n\n  Seeing that Zhou Ze was staring at him and didn't seem to be joking, the old Taoist could only grab a broom and mop with a pained expression and head outside to clean.\n\n  Bai Yingying knelt beside Zhou Ze, massaging his calves back and forth. She pouted and asked, \"Boss, what do you think the reason is? Is someone trying to frame you?\"\n\n  \"I don't know. I'm in a fog myself right now, so I've decided to go back to the detention center and take another look.\"\n\n  With that, Zhou Ze took out the business card Zhang Yanfeng had given him last night and dialed the number on it.\n\n  The call was answered quickly.\n\n  A very deep voice came from the other end:\n\n  \"Hello, who is this?\"\n\n  \"The guy who was in the detention center yesterday,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\n  \"What do you want to talk about?\"\n\n  \"I want to go back in today. Is that possible?\"\n\n  \"You're willing to confess your crimes?\"\n\n  \"I have no crimes,\" Zhou Ze repeated.\n\n  \"Heh.\"\n\n  Zhou Ze patiently said, \"Let me be honest. I'm a writer. Being in the detention center last night gave me a lot of inspiration. I was hoping...\"\n\n  \"*Du... du... du...*\"\n\n  The other end had hung up.\n\n  Boss Zhou stared at his phone, a sudden sense of bewilderment washing over him.\n\n  Looking outside at the old Taoist huffing and puffing as he swept the street, he had the feeling that karma had come back to bite him surprisingly fast.\n\n  Zhou Ze had no choice but to dial the number again. The other party answered, but this time, he didn't speak first.\n\n  \"I want to go back to the detention center. I have my reasons, though I know this request is a bit un—\"\n\n  \"*Clang... clang... clatter... clatter...*\"\n\n  A rattling sound came from the other end of the line.\n\n  A familiar sound.\n\n  Because it was coming through the phone, the sound was slightly distorted, but Zhou Ze was certain it was coming from that end.\n\n  \"Go on,\" Zhang Yanfeng said, sounding as if he'd just lit a cigarette, prompting Zhou Ze when he fell silent.\n\n  \"Have you recently been experiencing insomnia, frequent dreams, fatigue and sweating, or pain in your back and legs?\"\n\n  \"Heh.\"\n\n  The person on the other end seemed ready to hang up again.\n\n  \"Have you dreamed of having shackles on your feet?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n  The other end went quiet.\n\n  He didn't hang up.\n\n  It seemed that sentence had struck a chord.\n\n  A moment later,\n\n  a response came from the other end of the line:\n\n  \"Come to the station and find me. I'm in my office.\"\n\n  ...\n\n  By the time Zhou Ze appeared in Zhang Yanfeng's office, it was already evening. Zhang Yanfeng was sitting behind his desk, eating a meal from the cafeteria, wolfing it down while reading a case file in front of him.\n\n  When Zhou Ze came in, he pushed the food and the file to the side and looked at him.\n\n  \"I want to hear about the shackle.\"\n\n  \"I feel that in this environment, in this place, and while you're wearing a police uniform, it's a bit inappropriate to talk to you about such feudal, superstitious things.\"\n\n  \"Fine. I'm off duty.\"\n\n  Fifteen minutes later, Zhang Yanfeng, now in plain clothes, walked out of the police station with Zhou Ze. The two went to a small park diagonally across from the station, found a bench, and sat down.\n\n  \"You can stop thinking of me as a police officer now. Just treat me like a normal person, and let's have a chat.\" Zhang Yanfeng even took the initiative to offer Zhou Ze a cigarette.\n\n  Their relationship had changed quickly.\n\n  Before,\n\n  Zhou Ze was behind iron bars, and he was outside.\n\n  But now,\n\n  they seemed to have become friends.\n\n  \"Cellmates,\" you could say.\n\n  Zhou Ze held a small mirror in his hand, the old Taoist's talisman still stuck to it. He placed the mirror on top of Zhang Yanfeng's feet.\n\n  The light from the park's lampposts wasn't very good; it was a bit dim.\n\n  But you could still vaguely make out the image in the mirror.\n\n  On Zhang Yanfeng's feet,\n\n  there was also a shackle, only this one wasn't as thick or as long as his own.\n\n  His was still thicker and longer.\n\n  Why did that sentiment sound so strange?\n\n  \"See it?\" Zhou Ze looked at Zhang Yanfeng.\n\n  The hand Zhang Yanfeng was using to hold his cigarette trembled slightly.\n\n  \"This is the first time I've seen it for real. Before, I only dreamed about having a chain on my feet, and I've had those dreams for over twenty years.\"\n\n  \"So, did you do something to feel guilty about in the past?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n  \"My conscience is clear. I've been worthy of the police uniform I wear every day, and worthy of the national emblem on my cap,\" Zhang Yanfeng said with resounding conviction. \"I've even slowly gotten used to these recurring dreams. In the dreams, I walk around the police station wearing shackles. I think of it more as a warning.\n\n  It constantly reminds me that my power comes from the people, from the country, so I must never cross the line. If I take one wrong step, these shackles will one day appear on me for real.\"\n\n  \"*Clap, clap, clap...*\"\n\n  Zhou Ze clapped softly beside him.\n\n  \"So, this must be a form of affirmation, like a medal for a hero? Only good people get this chain?\"\n\n  \"What do you mean by that?\" Zhang Yanfeng asked.\n\n  \"First, let's solve a lingering historical problem.\"\n\n  Saying this,\n\n  Zhou Ze aimed the mirror at his own feet.\n\n  A thick, long iron chain appeared in the mirror.\n\n  \"Now do you believe that I wasn't making drugs or breaking the law?\"\n\n  We're...\n\n  the same.\n\n***\n**Footnotes:**\n¹ \"Human Face, Beast's Heart\" (人面兽心) is a Chinese idiom meaning someone who looks human but is savage and cruel inside.",

    "content": "When you think you're the sole victim, you panic.\n\nYou start thinking the heavens are out to get you, that you've been abandoned and isolated by the entire world and all of society.\n\nBut when you discover there's another unlucky soul exactly like you right beside you, you feel a lot better. You think, maybe the heavens aren't so bad after all; at least they left you a companion.\n\nThis is human nature. Most people who grew up in the countryside probably heard their grandmother tell them not to play near ponds or rivers. She'd warn you that a child had drowned there and become a ghost, one that wanted to pull you down to be its substitute to die in its stead.\n\nIt's just a way to scare children away from dangerous areas, but it's these folksiest of sayings that often reflect something simple and profound.\n\nZhou Ze lit a cigarette.\n\nHe wasn't panicked anymore.\n\nNot panicked anymore.\n\nBefore, he was worried about whether this chain would have any future repercussions.\n\nBut seeing that this police officer beside him, a man with an aura of righteousness, also had one, he truly wasn't scared at all anymore, nor was he worried.\n\n\"What do you do?\" Zhang Yanfeng asked, exhaling a smoke ring.\n\n\"It's not convenient to tell you. Let me put it this way: my work and yours are both about striving for the construction of socialist modernization and working towards social harmony.\"\n\nZhang Yanfeng frowned.\n\n\"If you ever run into a difficult case in the future, you can come to the bookstore and have me take a look. That's all I can say. Knowing too much about some things might not be a good thing for you.\"\n\nZhou Ze reached out and patted Zhang Yanfeng's shoulder.\n\n\"Keep being a good cop. It's a good thing.\"\n\nAfter Zhou Ze withdrew his hand,\n\nZhang Yanfeng also reached out and patted his own shoulder in the same spot.\n\nThe two men looked at each other and smiled.\n\n\"I don't believe in things like ghosts and gods in this world. I never will.\"\n\n\"Keep holding onto that belief,\" Zhou Ze said with a long sigh. \"Just treat my visit tonight as a dream. We can get to the point now. Let's talk about this chain of yours. When did you start having that dream?\n\n\"Right, I think you mentioned it's been over twenty years?\"\n\nZhang Yanfeng nodded. \"Yes, over twenty years. My father was also a criminal investigator. Our family, you could say, is a police family. My son is currently at the police academy.\"\n\n\"That's incredible.\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't think this was nepotism. Who would be so bored as to use nepotism to get their whole family to become police officers, and criminal investigators at that?\n\n\"I remember that year. It was the year my father died in the line of duty.\"\n\nZhang Yanfeng spoke very calmly.\n\nZhou Ze also listened very calmly.\n\n\"Back then, I had only been on the job for two years. My father's death was a huge blow to me. To be honest, I was a bit demoralized, and a bit scared.\n\n\"Truly scared. I was afraid that one day, I would also die in the line of duty.\"\n\n\"Police officers are human too,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"But it's different, it's really different. I felt ashamed of my fear.\"\n\nZhang Yanfeng flicked his cigarette ash and continued:\n\n\"The first time I had that dream was also that year. I was up all night processing the files for a case and fell asleep in the office. That night, I had a very, very long dream. Even now, that dream is so vivid I can still remember every single image.\n\n\"I was standing in a cold hallway.\n\n\"I heard the sound of a chain dragging on the ground.\n\n\"That place was cold, so very cold. The most profound chill I've ever felt in my life was that time, and it was in a dream, heh.\"\n\nBoss Zhou cleaned out his ear. He cuddled the female zombie, Bai Yingying, to sleep every night.\n\nHe had long since become immune to the word \"cold.\"\n\nA normal person couldn't stand the yin energy radiating from Bai Yingying's body, but Zhou Ze savored it.\n\n\"I saw a person in white clothes walking from the distance. He walked very slowly, step by step.\n\n\"On his feet was a pair of shackles, locking his ankles. With every step he took, the chain on the ground would make a 'clank, clank' sound as it was dragged.\n\n\"That sound, for the next twenty-plus years, echoed endlessly in my dreams.\n\n\"He walked from the distance,\n\n\"passed right in front of me.\n\n\"I couldn't see his face clearly.\n\n\"His hair was a mess.\n\n\"But when he was right in front of me, I strangely didn't feel cold anymore. I even felt a kind of warmth.\n\n\"Then, he left. It was as if he hadn't seen me at all. He kept walking forward, all the way to the end of the hallway.\n\n\"Then,\n\n\"he disappeared.\n\n\"After that, I woke up.\n\n\"There was no drama, no twist. Actually, it was a very ordinary dream. But because it was so realistic, so real it felt like it had actually happened, I've always remembered it. I've remembered it for over twenty years.\n\n\"After that, whenever I dreamed, no matter what I was doing, no matter what kind of dream it was, I would have this shackle on my ankle.\n\n\"That shackle, the one that should have been on the man in white, appeared on me.\"\n\nZhang Yanfeng took a deep breath, then exhaled heavily.\n\n\"I once used my work connections to ask a psychologist, but his answer was less than satisfactory. Do you know what he said?\n\n\"He said I had a guilty conscience, that I was afraid. Afraid of when I'd be exposed, of when something would happen to me, ha ha...\"\n\nAt this, Zhang Yanfeng chuckled, then threw his cigarette butt on the ground and stomped on it forcefully.\n\n\"This old man has spent his entire life worthy of the national flag, worthy of the police emblem. You know, on the day of my father's funeral, he was buried in his police uniform, and draped over him was the national flag.\"¹\n\n\"I believe you.\"\n\nZhou Ze looked at Officer Zhang. To be honest, he reminded him of the police chief who had once bought a book at his store.\n\nIt was like on Weibo, when news of some city enforcement officer bullying or hitting an old woman gets tons of shares and comments, while news of firefighters or police officers dying in the line of duty gets very few.\n\nIn reality, the world is still full of good people; otherwise, society would have descended into chaos long ago.\n\nThe two sat in silence for about fifteen minutes before Zhou Ze broke the quiet again.\n\n\"I need to find a way to solve this.\"\n\nZhou Ze pointed at his foot, then stood up.\n\nAcross from this small park was the police station. Zhou Ze suddenly asked:\n\n\"When you had that dream twenty-some years ago, were you in this police station too?\"\n\n\"Yes, but the station wasn't this big back then. It was renovated and rebuilt about ten years ago.\"\n\n\"But the location didn't change, right?\"\n\n\"It didn't.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded. \"Can you draw?\"\n\n\"No,\" Officer Zhang answered bluntly. \"You want me to draw the scene from the dream?\"\n\n\"Yes. I'm hoping for a more direct visualization.\"\n\n\"The bureau has an expert in that area. I can call him over.\"\n\n\"Won't that disturb his rest?\"\n\nIt was getting late.\n\n\"Young people need to be tempered,\" Zhang Yanfeng replied.\n\nIn that moment,\n\nZhou Ze seemed to see a reflection of his past self, working those intern dogs to death.\n\nThey didn't go back to the police station. Zhou Ze had requested this; he felt strange discussing such ethereal matters inside a police station. Besides, he always felt a faint, suppressive pressure in that place.\n\nThey went to a coffee shop next to the station. The young police officer arrived with his laptop, his face covered in acne, looking very green. He first walked up to Zhang Yanfeng and greeted him:\n\n\"Captain Zhang.\"\n\nZhang Yanfeng nodded.\n\nThen the young officer looked at Zhou Ze and asked, \"And how should I address this gentleman?\"\n\n\"The suspect.\"\n\nZhou Ze introduced himself.\n\n\"...\" The young officer was speechless.\n\nZhang Yanfeng glanced at Zhou Ze, then gestured for the young officer to sit beside him.\n\nNext, the young officer opened his laptop and began to draw according to Zhang Yanfeng's description.\n\nThis was quite an eye-opener for Zhou Ze. Perhaps in many people's eyes, all police officers are master criminal investigators, but in reality, police forces, especially in recent years, have begun to incorporate more and more professionals from other fields.\n\nIt was just like that famous financial fraudster who was recruited by the FBI after being thrown in jail.\n\nWhile the young officer was busy,\n\nZhou Ze played on his phone nearby.\n\nAbout two hours later,\n\nZhang Yanfeng nodded, indicating it was more or less done. He then turned the laptop to face Zhou Ze and pointed at the screen.\n\n\"This is pretty much the scene.\"\n\nZhou Ze stared at the screen for a moment.\n\nA man in white, wearing shackles,\n\nwalking forward numbly.\n\nOn both sides were dark, shadowy things. Behind him was also a stretch of blackness.\n\nIt was an extremely narrow space.\n\nZhou Ze looked at Zhang Yanfeng and said, \"Can you recall any more details?\"\n\n\"What?\" Zhang Yanfeng didn't quite understand.\n\n\"Like here, and here.\"\n\nZhou Ze pointed to the sides of the image. \"These two sides are walls, but what is this black area behind them? If they're walls, why don't they just extend outwards?\"\n\n\"I don't know. But I remember that in my dream, the walls in that place were intermittent, not a continuous stretch.\"\n\n\"Right. So, based on Captain Zhang's description, I focused on rendering the contrast between light and shadow here,\" the young officer explained from the side. \"I was originally going to draw it all as extending walls, but Captain Zhang said it wasn't like that.\"\n\nFor some reason, Zhou Ze was very focused on the black shadows next to the walls, while he paid less attention to the man in the white clothes and shackles.\n\nZhou Ze looked up, thinking continuously.\n\nHe thought of the scene in the detention center, the sound of the chain approaching from afar, while he stood behind the bars, pacing back and forth, trying to find its source...\n\nSuddenly,\n\nas if he'd thought of something, Zhou Ze pointed directly at the dark areas on either side of the image and said:\n\n\"This isn't a wall. Could it be iron bars?\"\n\nAs he spoke, Zhou Ze gestured with his hands. \"Have you seen old movies? Those old-fashioned prisons, do you have an impression?\"\n\nThe young officer immediately turned the laptop back around and began to revise the drawing, while Zhang Yanfeng, beside him, fell into deep thought.\n\n\"Is it like this?\"\n\nSoon, the young officer pushed the laptop back towards Zhou Ze and Zhang Yanfeng.\n\nIn the picture,\n\nthe original dark, blurry areas had been changed to iron bars. The space behind them was still dark and indistinct, but with the addition of these bars, the entire image suddenly became clear and three-dimensional. Even the information it contained was instantly revealed.\n\nIn a narrow prison corridor,\n\na prisoner in a white prison uniform,\n\nwith shackles on his feet,\n\nwas walking forward numbly.\n\nOn either side of him were other prison cells, and perhaps, there were many eyes inside watching him.\n\nZhang Yanfeng immediately picked up his phone and called someone. Zhou Ze didn't know who, but Zhang Yanfeng's voice was clear, and he didn't try to hide his conversation from the two men present:\n\n\"Old Wang, it's me, Zhang Yanfeng. I need you to immediately look something up for me. The former location of our police station.\n\n\"Didn't you tell me before that the old station was built upon an older building? Help me check this, check what that place was, what it was used for in the past.\n\n\"What, you need a more specific request?\n\n\"Fine.\n\n\"Then check,\n\n\"in which era,\n\n\"was it ever,\n\n\"used as a prison?\"\n\n***\n\n¹ *This old man (老子, lǎozi)*: An arrogant, coarse way of referring to oneself, often used out of anger or defiance. It literally means \"old father.\"",

    "content": "\"Captain Zhang, what on earth are you investigating? A case of wrongful conviction? I can help you look into it in detail.\"\n\nThe young officer, Little Liu, seemed very eager.\n\n\"Little Liu, it's getting late. You should go home and rest. You still have to work tomorrow,\" Zhang Yanfeng said.\n\nThis matter originated from a dream of his; he couldn't possibly let more people know about it. And frankly, the implications weren't good.\n\n\"It's no problem, Captain Zhang. I'm not tired, I can...\"\n\n\"You're tired,\" Zhang Yanfeng reminded him.\n\n\"Oh, uh, right. I'm tired. Well then, Captain Zhang, I'll be going.\"\n\nThe young officer left with his notebook.\n\nZhou Ze sat to the side, silently lighting a cigarette. He could really see his past self in Zhang Yanfeng. Back then, Doctor Lin had admired him, but he hadn't felt a thing. He treated his subordinates with this same kind of attitude.\n\nOn a strange impulse, Zhou Ze asked, \"Is Officer Zhang still single?\"\n\nZhang Yanfeng nodded.\n\nHeh.\n\nJust like him.\n\nGetting back to business, Zhang Yanfeng's gaze turned serious as he tapped lightly on the tabletop.\n\n\"Actually, based on that scene, I instinctively felt it was a bit familiar, very similar to things in movies and literary works.\"\n\n\"I know what you mean. Chains, a prison uniform, walking step by step down a narrow corridor, surrounded by other cells, everyone looking on with either numb or furious eyes.\n\nIf you were to pull out your phone and play a song like *Tears Behind Iron Bars*¹ right now, it would really complete the atmosphere.\"\n\n\"You think so too?\"\n\nZhang Yanfeng's expression remained serious, but hidden beneath the solemnity was a sense of awkwardness and unease. Having been a police officer for most of his life, discussing such supernatural mumbo-jumbo with someone he'd previously considered a suspect felt extremely strange, full of a sense of dissonance.\n\nIn truth, Officer Zhang's mental fortitude was quite strong. An ordinary person experiencing something like this for the first time would likely be scared out of their wits, but he was still able to force himself to remain calm.\n\n\"If it were the heroic spirits of past martyrs, say, being escorted to the execution ground, that logic would indeed make a lot of sense. It appears often in movies and novels, and those martyrs are truly worthy of admiration.\"\n\nZhou Ze paused, blew out a smoke ring, then pointed a finger toward his own feet.\n\n\"But would a martyr's spirit be so damn bored that it would slap a chain on your foot and mine?\n\nIs this a complimentary souvenir?\n\nOr some kind of loving encouragement?\n\nAnd I'm a good person, you're a good person too—okay, describing it like that sounds a bit melodramatic, but we have to follow this line of reasoning for now.\n\nOn the premise that we're both good people, a martyr's heroic spirit puts shackles on us?\n\nIt doesn't add up. It just doesn't.\n\nIt's not like we're at a tourist spot or a temple where the locals forcibly sell you souvenirs, slapping one on you without a word.\"\n\nZhang Yanfeng nodded. Making an old detective analyze a ghost's mindset was indeed far beyond his professional scope, but in reality, the thought processes of people and ghosts were one and the same.\n\nIf it really were the heroic spirits of martyrs, they probably wouldn't be so bored, right?\n\nA blessing shouldn't come in the form of chains.\n\nZhang Yanfeng's phone rang again. He answered it, and after a moment, he said to Zhou Ze:\n\n\"The original site of our police station was a hospital. It had been a hospital since the Republican era. After the Liberation, it was abandoned for a while and used as a dormitory-style apartment building for resettled residents. Later, it was rebuilt into a police station on that foundation. Ten years ago, it was torn down and rebuilt again. We found no records of it ever being used as a prison.\"\n\nZhou Ze fell into deep thought. Generally speaking, lingering spirits and obsessions were tied to their original location. For instance, if a person died unjustly in a certain place, any resentful spirit that formed would certainly be active at that spot.\n\nMoreover, both Zhou Ze and Officer Zhang had been shackled inside this police station. This could be seen as circumstantial evidence that the initial trigger point was right here in the station.\n\n\"It was never a prison?\" Zhou Ze found this hard to understand. The situation in Zhang Yanfeng's dream had been described very clearly; that place should have been a prison.\n\n\"I'll head back and investigate more thoroughly. You know this kind of information isn't online; I have to go dig through the archives.\"\n\nZhang Yanfeng picked up his phone and the cigarettes from the table and departed. As he walked out of the coffee shop, he looked up and let out a long sigh.\n\nHe didn't dare to think too much about today's events, nor did he want to, and that included Zhou Ze himself.\n\nBut this matter still needed to be dealt with. After all, this chain had appeared intermittently in his dreams for over twenty years. He couldn't just give up this opportunity because of some mental hang-ups.\n\nTurning his head, he glanced at Zhou Ze, who was still sitting in the coffee shop. Zhang Yanfeng shook his head. He suddenly found the man inside terrifying. Yes, terrifying.\n\nThis was no longer a policeman's gaze upon a suspect, but the gaze of someone outside a door looking at the person inside. Their lives and the scenery around them were perhaps worlds apart.\n\nZhang Yanfeng wasn't sure if, once he delved deeper into this, he would be able to come back out that door again.\n\nShaking his head, he walked toward the police station.\n\n***\n\nZhou Ze, on the other hand, hailed a cab and, half an hour later, returned to the bookstore.\n\nThe bookstore was closed today. Closed during the day, and closed at night. The boss had run into some trouble, and the employees were worried about him, so they had no heart for work.\n\nThe feeling...\n\n...was like a middle schooler saying, \"The motherland isn't unified yet, how can I possibly focus on my studies?\"\n\nThat was their explanation.\n\nHowever:\n\nOld Daoist was live-streaming, and Monkey was holding his phone for him, ceaselessly thanking \"the boss\" for the virtual airplanes and rockets.\n\nXu Qinglang was lying behind the counter with a face mask on, humming contentedly along to a song.\n\nBai Yingying was upstairs playing PUBG. She had recently bought an account for the Korean server, where there were supposedly fewer cheaters, and was having a blast.\n\nEven the Death Knight, who always sat on the ground floor, had returned to his room to continue sitting.\n\nLooking at his employees, Boss Zhou felt a little disheartened. He hadn't slept in two days, so he went straight up to the second floor, back to his bedroom, and lay down on the bed.\n\nThe thought of a rusty iron chain wrapped around his ankle made him feel very uncomfortable, very ill at ease. He kept tossing and turning.\n\nBai Yingying tactfully ended her game and lay down on the bed as well, letting Zhou Ze rest his head on her lap.\n\nThen she began to gently massage his head.\n\nZhou Ze finally felt a wave of drowsiness. He slowly closed his eyes and drifted off to sleep.\n\n...\n\n*Drip...*\n\n*Drip...*\n\n*Drip...*\n\nIt was the sound of water.\n\nVery crisp.\n\nAnd very hollow.\n\nZhou Ze opened his eyes and found himself lying on the surface of water. The familiar pool, the familiar road in the distance, and on that road, the densely packed souls walking on tiptoe.\n\nHe was back here again?\n\nIt had been a long time since he'd had a dream,\n\nespecially after Bai Yingying started sleeping beside him. The quality of his sleep had indeed become much, much better than before.\n\nZhou Ze subconsciously glanced down into the pool. Revisiting an old place, one always wanted to see if that old nemesis was still around.\n\nThe water in the pool was clear, the kind of crystal clear that was truly, without a shred of exaggeration, transparent to the bottom. Looking down, he couldn't see the slightest trace of the faceless woman's existence.\n\nIt seemed she really had died in Rongcheng.\n\nZhou Ze let out a long sigh of relief.\n\nBut at that moment, he saw a shadow behind him in the water's reflection. He immediately turned around and found a woman standing less than a meter behind him, a woman whose hair completely covered her face.\n\n\"You're not dead?\"\n\nZhou Ze asked, somewhat puzzled.\n\nThe woman didn't answer, merely continuing to stand there.\n\n\"Where are you going?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nThe woman slowly raised her head. Although her eyes were hidden beneath her thick hair, Zhou Ze could feel that she was staring at him.\n\n\"That's a question I should be asking you... Where... are *you*... going?\"\n\n*Gurgle... Glug...*\n\nZhou Ze felt the water's surface beneath him, which had been as solid as ice, suddenly give way, and his entire body plunged into the pool.\n\nIn an instant,\n\nan immense sense of suffocation rushed in, as if countless hands were desperately covering his eyes, ears, mouth, and nose, causing him to lose all perception of the outside world.\n\nThe only impression left was her final question, still lingering in his ears.\n\n\"Hah...\"\n\nZhou Ze sat up reflexively. Had the dream ended?\n\nPerhaps because he was a \"ghost\" himself, he always dreamt his way back to Hell, but who was that woman from before, dressed like the faceless woman?\n\nListening to her voice, it didn't seem to be the faceless woman.\n\nZhou Ze didn't know the details of what had happened that day in Rongcheng. The little loli treated that day as taboo. She was unwilling to say much, and when Zhou Ze had tried to ask, the little loli's reaction was that she would rather die than recall the events of that night again, so Zhou Ze had let it go.\n\n\"Yingying...\"\n\nZhou Ze spoke,\n\nwanting to ask Yingying to pour him a glass of water.\n\nBut he froze.\n\nHe wasn't lying on the bed in his second-floor bedroom at the bookstore.\n\nHe was lying on a worn-out straw mat.\n\nBeside him, packed tightly together, were people in ragged clothes, either leaning against the wall or lying down. When he made a sound, the others looked at him.\n\nThe dream wasn't over.\n\nHe hadn't woken up yet.\n\nNo.\n\nWhen Zhou Ze looked up and saw the iron bars in front of him,\n\nhe finally realized,\n\nnot only was the dream not over,\n\nthis dream,\n\nhad only just begun.\n\n*Clang... Clang...*\n\nIn the distance,\n\ncame the sound of an iron chain dragging and scraping against the floor.\n\nIt was so familiar.\n\nZhang Yanfeng had said that ever since that one dream, he had a chain wrapped around his foot in every dream he'd had for over twenty years.\n\nZhou Ze subconsciously looked down.\n\nHe lifted the ragged cloth covering him.\n\nWhere's the chain?\n\nWhere is my chain?\n\nWhy don't I have a chain???\n\n***\n\n**Footnotes:**\n\n1.  *Tears Behind Iron Bars* (《鐵窗淚》): A very famous and melancholic Chinese song from the 1980s about the sorrow and regret of life in prison.

    "content": "Zhou Ze silently observed his surroundings. He knew this had to be a dream, but this time, he was finally experiencing what Zhang Yanfeng had described—real.\n\nYes,\n\nThis dream was incredibly real.\n\nEverything, absolutely everything, could be seen with perfect clarity.\n\nIts realism was in the details.\n\nTemperature,\n\nHumidity,\n\nLight.\n\nThere was none of the haziness of a dream; in fact, it was almost excessively sharp and clear. You could glance about casually, yet it felt as if you could clearly recall the exact number of bricks over there, right down to the patterns and scuff marks on their surfaces.\n\nCold, damp, oppressive. This place was like the deepest part of a nightmare, a corner within the abyss. The environmental factors were secondary; the most crucial element was the people sitting or lying in this cramped space.\n\nTheir expressions,\n\nTheir gazes,\n\nThat numbness, that listlessness,\n\nAdded the thickest layer of despair to this place.\n\nThe air was thick with a nauseating stench.\n\nYou couldn't even analyze the specific source of the odor; it was a mixture, an unimaginable, scalp-numbing concoction.\n\nThe reek of urine, the smell of pus, and all the other foul odors emanating from human bodies, including the stench of corpses, were all jumbled together.\n\nZhou Ze lowered his head.\n\nThis environment,\n\nIt truly made him uncomfortable. To stay for even a second was a form of torture.\n\nEven if this was a dream,\n\nHe wanted to wake up.\n\nTo hell with the clues,\n\nTo hell with the traces,\n\nTo hell with the truth.\n\n`Laozi`¹ isn't staying in this place, not even for a dream!\n\nBoss Zhou was being quite willful at this moment.\n\nHe closed his eyes and slowly imagined the feeling of rising up from underwater. It was a technique ordinary people could try if they were having a \"sleep paralysis\" dream or a \"lucid dream\" to speed up the waking process.\n\nAnd yet,\n\nA hand suddenly pressed down on Zhou Ze's forehead. The hand stank. The thick, pungent smell shot directly into Zhou Ze's nostrils, jolting his nerves.\n\n\"The fever... it's gone down.\"\n\nThe speaker was a middle-aged man with messy hair and two scars on his face.\n\nZhou Ze slowly opened his eyes, subconsciously reaching up to move the hand from his forehead. But he suddenly found that his body was incredibly weak, his strength depleted to an unimaginable degree.\n\nHis hand fell midway, and a wave of dizziness washed over him.\n\n\"It's okay, it's okay. The fever's gone down, it's not a big problem.\"\n\nThe man opened his arms and pulled Zhou Ze into his embrace.\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze.\n\nBoss Zhou now hated this damned reality.\n\nWhat's the point of making it so real?\n\nIs it interesting?\n\nThe skin-to-skin contact beyond the tattered clothes was now so distinct. The grease and accumulated filth on the man's body seemed to have its own lubricating effect.\n\nEvery detail, every point of contact,\n\nEven the moist heat of the man's breath on his face,\n\nCarried a despair that made one want to vomit!\n\n\"Are you still cold?\"\n\nThe man asked, his voice very gentle.\n\nZhou Ze paid attention to the man's accent. It had a hint of a Sichuan flavor; in any case, it wasn't the local Tongcheng accent.\n\nBoss Zhou really wanted to curse, but he wanted to end this awkward situation even more. He shook his head, tried to speak, but the words wouldn't come out. He was too tired; his throat couldn't produce a single sound.\n\n\"Clang... clang... clang...\"\n\nThe sound of chains rang out, growing closer and closer.\n\nThe people in the cell, who had been like a roomful of \"dried corpses,\" suddenly grew agitated. One by one, they scrambled up and surged toward the iron bars, gripping them with both hands to look outside.\n\nIt was like market day in a village, with everyone crowding around to watch the commotion.\n\n\"Clang... clang...\"\n\nCloser,\n\nVery close now.\n\nThe person in shackles was coming!\n\nZhou Ze desperately wanted to get up and see. This should be the scene Zhang Yanfeng saw in his dream, but it seemed that either he was seeing it more realistically than Zhang Yanfeng, or they were viewing it from completely different perspectives.\n\n*Get up.*\n\n*Get up for `Laozi`.*\n\nHe'd endured the stench.\n\nHe'd experienced this filthy place.\n\nHe'd even been hugged by a man.\n\nIf he didn't get up to see what was happening, Zhou Ze felt like all this suffering would be for nothing. It would be too great a loss.\n\nHe gave the man in front of him a meaningful look, signaling for him to help him up for a look.\n\n\"Your fever just broke. Lie down for a while, I'll go see.\"\n\nWith that, the man gently settled Boss Zhou on the ground. This area was padded with a thicker layer of straw, so it was softer than the other spots.\n\nBoss Zhou just lay there, staring at the cell ceiling.\n\nAnd now everyone in the entire cell,\n\nIncluding the man who had been with him just before,\n\nWas crowded by the iron bars, craning their necks to look outside,\n\nLike a group of rabid fans chasing a star.\n\nOnly Zhou Ze,\n\nAlone,\n\nLay there, completely still.\n\nZhou Ze felt like an idiot, like an extra in a movie. And this extra had no lines; he was playing a corpse. Worse, after the camera cut away, the damn director wouldn't even let him get up, forcing him to keep playing dead.\n\nNo one was talking.\n\nNo one was making a sound.\n\nDamn it.\n\nCan't watch the livestream,\n\nAnd can't even get audio?\n\nZhou Ze cursed again in his heart. He really wanted to just close his eyes right now and, with no one to interfere, shatter this dream so he could wake up.\n\nHe should be lying on Yingying's lap right now, sleeping sweetly. When he woke up, he could even have Yingying make him tea.\n\nWhy was he still lying in this place filthier than a latrine?\n\nBut Zhou Ze was also a little unwilling. He had already suffered, been taken advantage of—was he supposed to just come and go empty-handed?\n\nBesides, he remembered Zhang Yanfeng saying that he remembered the dream very clearly because it was so real, but he only had that dream once.\n\nSo,\n\nIt was very likely,\n\nThat Zhou Ze would only have this one chance too.\n\n*I'll endure.*\n\n*I'll keep enduring.*\n\nZhou Ze's mind began to recall his \"feigned death\" state after the car accident at the end of his previous life.\n\nThinking about being made up for a funeral and then pushed into the crematorium,\n\nNow,\n\nThis somehow didn't seem so unbearable.\n\nThe breathing of the onlookers grew louder and heavier.\n\nThere was an eagerness in their breaths, a craving.\n\nLike a pack of male gorillas in heat, snorting, just short of beating their chests and roaring \"Ooh ooh ooh ooh.\"\n\nDon't ask how Zhou Ze could deduce so much from the sound of their breathing.\n\nAfter all, what else could he study right now besides these subtle changes in sound?\n\n\"Clang... clang... clang...\"\n\nHere it comes.\n\nHere it comes.\n\nThe person dragging the chains,\n\nWas slowly walking over.\n\nAnd based on the sound, Zhou Ze could confirm that the person had reached the entrance of his cell.\n\nZhou Ze used all his strength to turn his head.\n\nHe had to see.\n\nHe had to take a look.\n\nHe must see!\n\nBut then,\n\nZhou Ze despaired.\n\nAll he could see at the bars was a wall of men's backs. They blocked the view completely, impenetrably.\n\nBoss Zhou couldn't even find a crack to peek through!\n\nFuck!\n\nZhou Ze roared endlessly in his mind.\n\n\"Clang... clang... clang...\"\n\nThe sound moved from near to far, slowly fading away.\n\nThe person,\n\nMust have walked off.\n\n*That's it? They're gone?*\n\n*Not even a word?*\n\n*Not even a shout of \"The gate for men to enter and exit is locked, but the hole for dogs to crawl through is still open?\"*²\n\nZhou Ze had discussed it with Zhang Yanfeng before. Based on the environment at the time, the person in shackles was likely a martyr, an unyielding revolutionary. Although there were some contradictions, the probability of that was very high.\n\nNow,\n\nZhou Ze could rule out his previous deduction.\n\nBecause after the person in shackles had walked away, Zhou Ze didn't see any sadness or anger in the other prisoners.\n\nOn the contrary,\n\nTheir faces were all filled with envy and longing.\n\nIt was as if they wished they were the one walking out in shackles.\n\nThis left Zhou Ze completely baffled. What on earth did this mean?\n\nThe man returned and reached out to tidy Zhou Ze's hair.\n\nHonestly,\n\nIf it were Xu Qinglang doing this to him,\n\nHe would at most feel a bit awkward, but not so repulsed. But having this greasy, unbelievably filthy fellow do it made the nausea Boss Zhou had just managed to suppress surge up again.\n\nThis place,\n\nHe really didn't want to stay here for another moment.\n\n\"Go back to sleep. When it's time to eat, I'll get your share for you.\"\n\nThe man said gently.\n\nBoss Zhou had absolutely no interest in eating. He couldn't stomach normal food, let alone the kind of slop these people were clearly fed, judging by the surroundings.\n\nIs the dream over yet?\n\nIs it finally over?\n\nZhou Ze was like someone at the movies who refuses to leave after the credits, waiting for the post-credits scene.\n\nBut after waiting for a while, it seemed there was no scene to be had.\n\nJust as Zhou Ze was about to really close his eyes and leave this dreamscape,\n\nSuddenly,\n\nZhou Ze felt a sharp, twisting pain in his abdomen, as if something were kicking his stomach.\n\n*Fuck,*\n\n*Did I eat something bad?*\n\n\"What's wrong? Does it hurt?\"\n\nThe man looked at Zhou Ze anxiously, then reached out and felt his stomach.\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze.\n\nJust then, a rustling sound came from outside. A wooden bucket was placed down. It was probably the food.\n\nThe man stood up and walked over there.\n\nThe mad rush he had expected didn't happen. It was as if everyone was exercising self-restraint, waiting for the man to scoop the first portion of food into a broken bowl, add some soup, and walk back. Only then did the others start to scramble for the rest.\n\n*Damn,*\n\n*A cell boss?*\n\nZhou Ze's bookstore had plenty of \"Domineering CEO Falls for Me\" books, which many young girls loved to read.\n\nIs this \"The Big Cell Boss Fell for Me\" now?\n\n\"Here, sit up first. Eat.\"\n\nThe man helped Zhou Ze up, propping him against the wall.\n\nZhou Ze sat up.\n\nHe looked down,\n\nAnd saw that his belly was hugely swollen.\n\n*Trapped gas?*\n\n*This severe?*\n\n\"It's been hard on you, and hard on the child in your belly,\" the man said apologetically.\n\n*The child... in my belly?*\n\n*Fuck,*\n\n*Is this a woman's body?*\n\n***\n\n¹`Laozi` (老子): Literally \"old master,\" an arrogant and domineering way of referring to oneself, similar to saying \"Your daddy\" or \"I, your father.\" It establishes a character's assertive or egotistical personality.\n\n²A famous line from a poem by Ye Ting, a Communist revolutionary general, written while he was imprisoned by the Nationalists.

    "content": "Zhou Ze found it difficult to describe his current feeling, except that everything was just so absurd. Perhaps it was because he had just entered this dream, or perhaps it was a kind of initial mental numbness from the role he’d been thrust into, but Zhou Ze had never truly questioned his gender.\n\nIt wasn't until now that he had a sense of sudden realization.\n\nOf course, \"sudden realization\" was a derogatory term here, at least for Boss Zhou. Most normal men would probably hope to never have such a day of \"sudden realization.\"\n\nFortunately, this embarrassment and turmoil didn't last long, because the \"gurgle... gurgle...\" sound soon started up again.\n\nAt first, Zhou Ze let out a long sigh of relief, thinking the dream was about to end.\n\nWhether passively or actively, he should be waking up and returning to the warm embrace of his big bed and the soft thighs of a high school girl.\n\nIt was like participating in a charity event under a scorching sun. Quitting felt wrong, but then someone from above suddenly announces the event is over. You might as well go with the flow, drop your things, and head inside to enjoy the air conditioning and a cup of ice-cold Fanta. You wouldn't be shouting, \"I can keep going, I'm fine!\"\n\nMost people would probably feel this way.\n\nBut soon, Zhou Ze realized there was something wrong with this gurgling. It wasn't coming from beside him, nor was it ringing in his ears—it was coming from inside his own stomach!\n\n\"Gurgle... gurgle...\"\n\nZhou Ze had been single in his past life, and he hadn't gotten Doctor Lin pregnant in this one. Logically, he didn't really know much about expectant mothers. But in reality, as a doctor in his previous life, he had dealt with many pregnant women in the emergency room, so he could be sure that a normal pregnant woman—no, even an abnormal pregnant woman's belly—would not make this kind of sound.\n\nAnd the gurgling grew louder and louder, like rolling thunder, and his belly was twitching and shaking.\n\nAt this moment, everyone else in the prison cell seemed to be frozen in time. Those scrambling for food, those eating—all of them were completely still. This included the man in front of Zhou Ze, who remained motionless in his feeding posture.\n\n\"Gurgle... gurgle...\"\n\nThe water was boiling.\n\nZhou Ze stared at his own belly.\n\nHe instinctively sensed something.\n\nFinally,\n\nA crack slowly appeared on his stomach. It was very slick, very smooth. The sensation was like a scalpel cutting across a belly on an operating table.\n\nZhou Ze felt no pain, but in the past, he was the one performing surgery on others, cutting open bellies to find lesions. This time, it was his turn to \"experience\" this feeling from a first-person perspective.\n\nIt seemed that VR technology was now being used by many to film first-person VR \"action-romance\" films for profit, and the market prospects were excellent. At this moment, Zhou Ze felt this might be a new business opportunity—for example, releasing a VR experience like this to let all young husbands experience it firsthand, so they could understand the hardships their wives endure during childbirth.\n\nOf course, men would definitely be unwilling to experience such a thing, but it could be marketed heavily to women.\n\nAlright,\n\nBoss Zhou's train of thought was diverging in a truly inappropriate way at a time like this. It was like making love or doing other painful things—you needed to distract yourself a little so as not to be so focused.\n\nAfter all, at this very moment, Boss Zhou's own belly was slowly splitting open.\n\nThen, a small, fair hand reached out from inside his stomach, much like the Monkey King bursting forth from the stone. You couldn't help but marvel at the miracle of life.\n\nHowever, in the next moment,\n\nA headless baby crawled out of Zhou Ze's stomach.\n\nBoss Zhou took a deep breath. He had prepared himself for anything, but the reality of the situation had still far exceeded his mental fortifications.\n\nEven the most brilliant director or screenwriter with a flair for the dark and grim,\n\nwould have a hard time filming a scene like this.\n\nIt twisted together ethics and the most primal horror.\n\nThe brilliance of new life and the shadow of death were perfectly fused in this moment.\n\nPerhaps out of professional habit, Zhou Ze noticed that the baby's neck area was very smooth, which meant that whoever had cut off the head was highly skilled.\n\n\"Goo... goo...\"\n\nNo head,\n\nyet it could still make sounds.\n\nA child's babbling, a sound that should have been crisp and delightful,\n\nbut at this moment, it served as the most terrifying and grim embellishment,\n\nno less effective than the low, somber music that often plays in cliché horror movies, and in fact, achieving an even more terrifying and intense effect.\n\n\"Drip... drip...\"\n\nThe baby was still covered in thick bodily fluids. As it crawled up Zhou Ze's stomach, those fluids dripped continuously onto Zhou Ze's body, a slimy feeling that was deeply unsettling.\n\nFinally, the baby crawled up to Zhou Ze's face.\n\nRight now, Zhou Ze really wanted to smoke a cigarette, then put on a nonchalant expression and say, \"Come, let's talk.\"\n\nBut right now, Zhou Ze couldn't even speak.\n\nIn the past, faced with such a scene, Boss Zhou would have unleashed his fingernails without a second thought!\n\nHe didn't care what celestial injustice you had suffered; making a clean freak like him endure this kind of torment meant you deserved to be torn to shreds, not even given the chance to go to hell.\n\nIf that didn't work, he'd just go on a rampage and see who had the last laugh.\n\nBut now, when you're at someone else's mercy, you have to bow your head. Boss Zhou could only half-close his eyes and watch the baby's next move.\n\n\"Goo... goo...\"\n\nThe baby slowly leaned back,\n\nits little bottom practically sitting on Zhou Ze's chest. It propped up its two small feet, as if deliberately showing Zhou Ze something.\n\nZhou Ze saw it.\n\nOn the baby's foot was a thread, a substance formed from condensed bodily fluids that had turned into something with the thick consistency of strong glue.\n\nBut from Zhou Ze's perspective,\n\nit looked as if the baby itself had a chain wrapped around its own little leg.\n\nIt was showing off this chain to him,\n\nand it was overjoyed.\n\n*Was it your doing?*\n\nZhou Ze asked in his mind.\n\nHe didn't know if the baby could hear him,\n\nbut it was the only method of communication Zhou Ze could try right now.\n\nEvidently, the baby couldn't hear. It was still endlessly showing off the \"chain\" on its leg, like a primary school student who got a perfect score and ran home to show off to their parents, hoping for praise.\n\nZhou Ze had never had a child, neither a legitimate one nor an illegitimate one. Boss Zhou had never had one in either of his lives. But ironically, the first time Zhou Ze experienced \"a father's love is like a mountain\" was in this environment, in this scene.\n\nHe simply closed his eyes. He couldn't speak and could barely move, but I can choose non-violent non-cooperation, can't I?\n\nBut the sensation on his stomach was so clear, including the disgusting slimy feeling of it dripping on him. Even if you couldn't see it, you couldn't stop your own mind from filling in the blanks, which was really not much different from watching with your eyes open.\n\nJust then,\n\na \"clang\" sound, like an iron gate opening, seemed to come from the distance.\n\nIt was like the crack of spring thunder that awakens all things,\n\nor like the dragon seal¹ that appears before a movie starts: a green screen, a dragon, and finally the words \"Screening Permit.\"\n\nIt meant the movie was about to begin,\n\nthe story was starting,\n\nand everyone should look forward to it.\n\nZhou Ze opened his eyes.\n\nHe saw the baby that had been making a fuss on his chest slowly turn around and begin to crawl back to where it had come from.\n\nThis was an even more bizarre scene than its emergence.\n\nA baby that had just crawled out of its mother's belly,\n\nwas now slowly crawling back into its mother's belly.\n\nIt was as if that scalpel-smooth incision also came with a zipper.\n\nHe unzipped it,\n\nhe came out,\n\nhe went back in,\n\nand he zipped it back up.\n\nYes, this was the feeling Zhou Ze had right now, watching the wound on his stomach slowly heal. For anyone else experiencing this violent collision of reality and illusion from a first-person perspective, their mind would have likely collapsed long ago.\n\nEven if someone like Zhang Yanfeng, that old police captain, were in Zhou Ze's position, it would probably be the same. No matter how outstanding a normal person is, they have a psychological breaking point, just like no matter how strong a person is, they'll still starve to death without food.\n\nFortunately, Boss Zhou's psychological defenses were indeed solid. Over the past year, he had seen far too many humans and ghosts. Plus, he had a little loli by his side who would occasionally stick out a long tongue from her cute and adorable face, a sudden change in style.\n\nBoss Zhou was a veteran.\n\nHe only found the scene disgusting.\n\nBut to say that these images and this first-person experience could scare Boss Zhou into insanity would be to seriously underestimate a Ghost Emissary. A living person could be scared to death by a ghost, but have you ever seen a Ghost Emissary scared to death by a ghost?\n\nThe previously frozen clamor finally returned. The prisoners in the cell began scrambling for food again.\n\n\"Here, eat.\"\n\nThe man gently brought the bowl to Zhou Ze's mouth.\n\nIt was as if a movie had been paused halfway through and was now resumed, the plot flowing smoothly once more.\n\nZhou Ze kept his mouth shut. He wouldn't eat.\n\n\"Eat a little, Xiufen.\"\n\nZhou Ze still kept his mouth shut.\n\n\"Clang... clang... clang...\"\n\nThe sound of iron chains came again.\n\nOnly this time the sound was louder, and the rhythm of them being dragged was faster. It didn't sound like someone was walking with them on, but rather like someone was pulling them by hand.\n\nIn an instant, the prisoners who had been scrambling for food all dropped their bowls and chopsticks and crowded toward the bars.\n\nIncluding the man who had just been feeding Zhou Ze; he also put down the bowl and rushed over.\n\nA man in a black uniform, carrying two sets of leg iron chains, walked down the corridor.\n\nPrisoners in all the cells along the way began to shout.\n\nThey were excited, they were agitated.\n\nThey,\n\nwere also desperate.\n\nEveryone extended their hands as far as they could, like begging beggars, hoping for a piece of the pie.\n\nThe man in the black uniform held the chains and turned to look around,\n\nseemingly enjoying this feeling of being surrounded and anticipated.\n\nThen,\n\nhe slowly approached the cell where Zhou Ze was,\n\ntook one of the two chains,\n\nand threw it directly into the cell.\n\nIn an instant,\n\nthe people in the cell became like a pack of wild dogs fighting over a single bone, and they actually started to brawl.\n\nThe man who had been feeding Zhou Ze before shouted:\n\n\"Give it to my wife! Give it to my wife!\n\nShe's pregnant!\n\nShe has a child in her belly!\"\n\nWhile shouting,\n\nhe too charged into the fray.\n\n***\n**Footnote:**\n1.  **Dragon Seal (龍標):** A reference to the green animated logo of the China Film Administration, which is shown before all films approved for public screening in mainland China.

    "content": "Many people have seen the sight of a pack of stray dogs and cats fighting over food on a small road. That kind of struggle, that kind of scramble—sparing no effort, stopping at nothing.\n\nBecause animals know that without food, they too face certain death.\n\nHumans have always proclaimed themselves a higher existence, the spirit of all creation.\n\nIt's like how some people from Tongcheng, when referred to as being from North Jiangsu, get as worked up as a cat whose tail has been stepped on, vehemently refuting that they're from Central Jiangsu, not North Jiangsu—which only makes them look more ridiculous.¹\n\nMany years ago, humanity also lived a life of eating raw meat and drinking blood, just like beasts. But now, people often label certain excessive actions as \"bestial deeds.\"\n\nHaving become civilized,\n\nhaving become enlightened,\n\nthey hastily try to sever ties with their former \"companions.\"\n\nJust as Zhou Ze was now watching this group of people fighting over the chain. They fought with abandon, with total commitment, a chaotic mess of flailing limbs. The already poor air in the cell was stirred up into clouds of dust, making it even worse.\n\nIn the end, one man stood up, holding the iron chain high. His face was bruised and battered, his body covered in contusions. The corner of his eyebrow was split open, with blood dripping ceaselessly.\n\nThis was the woman's man, the same man who had been feeding her so tenderly moments before.\n\nLike a lion that had gone out to hunt, bringing food back for his lioness, he had succeeded.\n\nThe man in the black uniform reached out and tapped the bars,\n\nsignaling that the chain now had an owner.\n\nThis forced the others, who were still itching to jump back into the fray, to back down.\n\nIn truth,\n\nwhen the food was first distributed, the other people in the cell had shown great restraint. They knew there was a pregnant woman in this prison.\n\nBut that didn't mean they would show any mercy in the subsequent fight for the chain. Eating a little later or a little less wasn't a huge problem. This iron chain, however, meant something more.\n\nThe man walked over to the woman with the chain,\n\nbent down,\n\nand fastened it around the woman's ankle.\n\n\"*Click*.\"\n\nIt locked.\n\nThen he looked up,\n\nat the woman.\n\nHe was smiling,\n\nsmiling very happily.\n\nThis smile, in Zhou Ze's eyes, was like that of an imbecile.\n\nAt the same time,\n\nhe was deeply confused.\n\nWhat on earth did this chain mean?\n\nWhy were these prisoners so fixated on it?\n\nBut there was one thing Zhou Ze could be sure of:\n\nthis chain was likely not such a wonderful thing.\n\nOtherwise, there wouldn't be a nightmare that still existed so many years later.\n\nThis dream was very clear, the details and logic were impossibly so. And yet, despite this, Zhou Ze felt that a layer of impenetrable fog still shrouded everything.\n\nIt shrouded the truth.\n\nSometimes, the more real something seems, the more likely it is to be fake.\n\nZhou Ze opened his mouth.\n\nHe wanted to say something, but the sound couldn't escape his throat, leaving only a hoarse murmur.\n\nThen,\n\nthe man helped the woman up. The men in black uniforms opened the cage. A few more men in black came over and took the woman from the man's arms.\n\nThe man instinctively tried to follow her out but was shoved back inside by two of the men in black.\n\nThe iron bars were then closed again. The man gripped the bars tightly with both hands, watching the woman, watching the woman's belly.\n\nHe was still happy.\n\nIncomparably happy.\n\nExceedingly happy.\n\nSo happy that Zhou Ze felt that, if he had the chance,\n\nhe'd want to go back and beat him to a pulp.\n\n\"*Scrape... scrape... scrape...*\"\n\nThe sound of the iron chain dragging on the ground.\n\nZhou Ze was walking too,\n\nbut because this body was too weak, men in black uniforms were supporting him on both sides.\n\nThe walk was cold and lonely.\n\nOnly the sound of the chain scraping on the ground was so sharp,\n\nso piercing.\n\nHowever,\n\nas they passed other cells,\n\nZhou Ze saw a scene similar to the one before.\n\nThe prisoners in the cells were all gathered at the iron bars, craning their necks to look at Zhou Ze, at this woman with the iron chain on her ankle.\n\nTheir eyes,\n\nwere filled with envy.\n\nThe kind of envy that made them wish they could take her place.\n\nUpon hearing the sound of the chain, they even revealed expressions of enjoyment.\n\nIs there something wrong with these people's heads?\n\nBoss Zhou was now sporting a look of complete and utter confusion???\n\nWalking.\n\nStill walking.\n\nWalking without stopping.\n\nThis corridor was very long, and Zhou Ze was walking very slowly.\n\nBut it was also obvious the two men in black beside him weren't using their full strength. If they wanted to, they could clearly drag this woman forward at high speed in minutes.\n\nAlthough this woman was pregnant, Zhou Ze knew it was a miracle she hadn't miscarried given the nutrition and living conditions. In reality, she was very thin, little more than skin and bones.\n\nFor her and her child to have held on this long,\n\nwas truly not easy.\n\nFrom Zhou Ze's perspective,\n\nthese men in black were deliberately walking this slowly.\n\nIt was like a procession.\n\nThey slowly accompanied the woman,\n\nas if escorting a champion to receive the attention and cheers of others, seemingly wanting to prolong the process intentionally.\n\nHowever, Zhou Ze had another question.\n\nIt seemed they were going in the wrong direction.\n\nBefore, the chain had been brought from the right side of his cell to the left, but this time he was being led from left to right. Zhou Ze had carefully noted this difference.\n\nNo matter how long the road,\n\nit must eventually have an end.\n\nAhead,\n\nan iron door appeared.\n\nThe door was opened,\n\nand Zhou Ze was pushed inside.\n\nIn there was a table,\n\nand on it was clean water and food.\n\nZhou Ze didn't move.\n\nFor Boss Zhou, eating food without any other condiments was nothing short of torture.\n\nBut in the next moment,\n\nan impulse surged within Zhou Ze's heart.\n\nZhou Ze began to reach out, desperately stuffing food and water into his mouth.\n\nZhou Ze knew this was just a dream, and he was experiencing it from a woman's perspective.\n\nSo,\n\nit wasn't him moving now,\n\nbut the woman's survival instinct compelling her to start eating, to eat desperately, because she wanted to live, because she had a child in her belly.\n\nShe knew clearly that her child needed nutrients.\n\nThe ravenous eating continued for a long time, but the woman seemed as if she could never get enough. However, the man in black beside her directly stopped her, interrupting her feeding.\n\nHaving once been a doctor, Zhou Ze knew that binge eating after a period of extreme food scarcity could easily be life-threatening.\n\nIn ancient prisons, there was a type of unofficial execution known as \"death by feasting.\"²\n\nIt involved keeping prisoners constantly hungry, giving them only small amounts of food so they wouldn't starve to death, but they could never dream of being full. Of course, this stage could be skipped, as getting a full meal in an ancient prison was a fantasy and an extravagance in itself.\n\nThen one day, a jailer would suddenly present you with a table of fine wine and good food and let you eat to your heart's content. After you'd eaten until your stomach was round and full, two jailers would come over, one on each side. One would grab your head and the other your feet, and they would lift you up to play a game of \"stretching exercises,\" alternately contracting and straightening you out.\n\nAfter doing this back and forth for a while, you'd be a goner.\n\nWith this method of death, the autopsy skills of ancient coroners would find nothing unusual. There would be no other wounds on the body. Jailers typically used this method to take bribes, helping people get revenge on others inside the prison.\n\nFull,\n\nher body felt as if it had regained some strength in an instant.\n\nA man in a black uniform came in holding a water hose.\n\nHe began spraying the woman with it.\n\nIcy cold water blasted her, spraying back and forth.\n\nThe woman lay on the ground,\n\nwhimpering ceaselessly.\n\nBoss Zhou became a drowned rat along with her; the feeling was truly not pleasant.\n\nAfterward,\n\nthe men in black brought a long white robe for the woman to change into. They then pushed the woman, still a bit damp but certainly much cleaner than before, back out the iron door.\n\n\"*Scrape... scrape... scrape...*\"\n\nThe chain continued to be dragged across the ground.\n\nThe path they had walked before, they had to walk it all over again.\n\nZhou Ze was starting to get confused.\n\nCould it be that fighting for the chain was all for a full meal and a bath?\n\nWas it the same principle as fighting for a meal ticket or a bath ticket?\n\nOn the way back, the people behind the iron bars on both sides still watched Zhou Ze with envious eyes.\n\nContinuing forward,\n\nthey reached the cell where Zhou Ze was held. The man who had fed her was also at the bars watching the woman. He was agitated, yet relieved, and overjoyed.\n\nThis reminded Zhou Ze of a song by Rene Liu:\n\n\"I love you so, so much, so I'm willing to let you go, to fly toward a place of greater happiness...\"\n\nZhou Ze kept walking, the chain still scraping against the ground.\n\nThe men in black didn't return him to his previous cell but continued walking forward.\n\nOn and on they walked, up a flight of stairs,\n\non and on they walked, and a carpet appeared,\n\non and on they walked,\n\nand another iron door appeared.\n\nThe door was opened.\n\nThere was light inside,\n\ngiving one the momentary illusion of having escaped to freedom.\n\nPeople who have never been in jail cannot comprehend the craving for freedom one feels when locked up, just as most people only truly realize how wonderful it is to be healthy and full of life when they fall ill.\n\nZhou Ze could clearly sense,\n\na feeling of excited joy rising in this woman.\n\nIt was very strong.\n\nHer body was even trembling uncontrollably.\n\nShe walked in voluntarily.\n\nThe chain continued to drag on the ground,\n\nmaking one last sound in this narrow space.\n\n\"*CLANG...*\"\n\nAfter she walked in,\n\nthe iron door was shut.\n\nAhead, the view was blocked by a white material, like the plastic sheeting farmers use to build greenhouses for out-of-season vegetables.\n\nAnd on both sides of the immediate area,\n\nwere things that looked like shower heads, with many small holes.\n\nIt looked like a public bathhouse, as if the previous wash hadn't been clean enough and she needed to be washed all over again.\n\nThe woman's excitement continued to build.\n\nShe was still slowly walking forward.\n\nBut after Zhou Ze saw the layout of the surroundings,\n\na terrifying shadow immediately fell over him.\n\nThe woman didn't know what this place was,\n\nbut he did!\n\nDamn it!\n\nGet out!\n\nI have to get out!\n\nThis wasn't some damn shower room at all!\n\nThis was purgatory!\n\nA true hell on earth!\n***\n¹A culturally specific reference to regional identity within China's Jiangsu province.

    "content": "The bookstore was closed, but the lights were on inside.\n\nNormally, a bookstore might occasionally be closed during the day, but it would definitely be open at night. But what could they do, when the boss had gone up to bed so early tonight?\n\nSince the boss was slacking off, his employees were naturally happy to slack off too. Most importantly, without the boss to handle things, they couldn't pack and ship orders for any customers who might show up, so why bother?\n\nThe Old Daoist and Xu Qinglang were sitting on the sofa, a glass of red wine for each of them on the coffee table between them.\n\nThe wine, a pricey bottle, had been charged to the bookstore's account. The whole bookshop was now permeated with an air of laziness and decadence, a trend of bad habits that had trickled down from the top.\n\nTo be honest,\n\nat first, everyone had been restrained in their daily indulgences. But after Boss Zhou's coffee and tea got more and more high-end, his subordinates naturally followed suit.\n\nAfter all,\n\nif the poorest person in the entire bookstore was enjoying such fancy things,\n\nwhy should a few people of considerable means live so frugally?\n\nThe little monkey was perched on the counter with a pile of peanuts in front of it, munching away happily by itself. It was neither annoying nor a troublemaker. If someone wanted to play, it would play along; if no one bothered it, it would play by itself. It was quite well-behaved.\n\nThe Old Daoist had even bought it a golden fillet and a kasaya, and even custom-ordered a golden-hooped rod from Taobao,¹ purely to satisfy his own mischievous tastes.\n\nJust imagine, raising the Great Sage Sun himself—it filled him with a sense of pride and satisfaction.\n\nThe boss had even told him that when he fought the monkey for three hundred rounds, the monkey's \"iron rod\" was truly terrifying.\n\nThe Old Daoist had believed him,\n\nbut he never suspected that the \"iron rod\" the boss mentioned wasn't the iron rod he was thinking of.\n\nThe monkey disliked the fillet and the rod, but it had a special fondness for the kasaya. When it had nothing to do, it would wrap the kasaya around itself like a cape, and surprisingly, it even managed to exude a hint of Buddhist nature.\n\nThe Old Daoist had been to Mount Emei, where the monkeys weren't afraid of people and would even approach tourists for food. If you were unlucky enough to run into one of the monkey \"hotheads,\" they'd even snatch your things if you didn't give them anything.\n\nAnd yet, even those monkeys were said to have \"Buddhist nature.\"\n\nBut comparing them to his own monkey... his was on another level entirely. It could use a phone, change songs, and even hail a Didi taxi.² The last time, the monkey had even hailed a cab by itself to go to General's Mountain to check on the boss.\n\nTsk tsk tsk.\n\nAnyway, in the Old Daoist's eyes, no matter how outstanding other people's children were, they were never as dear as his own.\n\nThe Old Daoist had often said that he had no children of his own in this life. Although he had sponsored many poor students, few of them ever called to wish him well during the holidays. On the contrary, when they were struggling financially, many would call to press him for tuition and living expenses, their words harsh, as if it were his crime that they couldn't escape the mountains without his money.\n\nThis monkey, the Old Daoist was raising it as his own grandson. After all, sometimes, an animal understands gratitude better than a person.\n\n\"Living like this... it's quite decadent.\"\n\nThe Old Daoist took a sip of red wine and squinted. He couldn't tell good wine from bad, so what he was actually savoring was how many RMB he was swallowing with each sip.\n\nThinking of the price, the flavor of the wine suddenly emerged.\n\nAfter swallowing the wine,\n\nthe Old Daoist stretched his old back, let out a soft sigh, and added:\n\n\"You think there are still plainclothes cops watching the bookstore?\"\n\n\"Don't know.\"\n\n\"Don't you know cultivation techniques?\"\n\n\"You know my skill level. Half-baked at best,\" Xu Qinglang said honestly. \"But you, your ancestors were once prominent. Ever think of picking up their cultivation techniques and practicing?\"\n\n\"Lost to the ages. What about you? Don't you want to practice more?\"\n\n\"Practice for what? Loafing around and getting by is pretty good right now. Watching some unusual scenery on the side while just playing my part.³ Honestly, his attitude is the most comfortable way to live. If he were really like that old boss of yours in Chengdu, we'd have our lives on the line every day.\n\nIt'd be exciting, sure,\n\nbut when I think about it, this is much more comfortable.\"\n\n\"Forget it, forget it. I'm going up to sleep.\"\n\nThe Old Daoist drained the last of his wine, gave Xu Qinglang a nod, and asked, \"You're not going to bed?\"\n\n\"They say moonlight is good for the skin. I'm moonbathing.\"\n\nXu Qinglang pointed to the face mask he was wearing,\n\nas if he were absorbing the moon's essence.\n\n\"Tch, you're nuts.\"\n\nThe Old Daoist yawned, called to the monkey, and started up the stairs. Just as he reached the second floor, both the Old Daoist and the monkey shivered.\n\n\"Hiss...\"\n\nDamn it.\n\nThey cranked the AC way too high, didn't they?\n\nWhy's it so cold?\n\nThe Old Daoist instinctively hugged his arms and walked onward. He stopped first at the boss's bedroom door, because white mist was constantly seeping out from the crack underneath.\n\nClearly,\n\nthis was the source.\n\n\"Knock, knock, knock...\"\n\nThe Old Daoist knocked.\n\n\"Boss, the AC's broken! It's way too powerful!\"\n\nThere was no response from inside.\n\nAt this point, the Old Daoist couldn't worry about formalities. He had to open the door himself; otherwise, he was genuinely worried he'd fall asleep and go into hibernation.\n\nThe door pushed open. The Old Daoist peeked his head inside and froze.\n\nOn the bed,\n\nwere a man and a woman.\n\nOf course,\n\nthe Old Daoist would occasionally fantasize about what might happen between the boss and Bai Yingying at night. Although he knew Yingying was a zombie and her \"water pipes\" were frozen, as an old pro, he knew there were many other ways to have fun. That was where the real atmosphere and amusement lay.\n\nThe posture on the bed,\n\nwas harmonious,\n\nmuch more so than the Old Daoist had imagined.\n\nThe boss was lying with his head in Yingying's lap.\n\nYingying was sitting up on the bed, her hands placed on the boss's face.\n\nEven with the Old Daoist's intrusion, neither of them moved a muscle, as if they were in such a deep sleep they hadn't noticed someone come in at all.\n\nWhite mist periodically rose from the boss's body,\n\nand most of it was being inhaled into Bai Yingying's nose.\n\nA small amount escaped, becoming the culprit for the plummeting temperature nearby.\n\nThis scene,\n\nit was a dead ringer for those late-night Hong Kong and Taiwanese movies he used to watch, where a fox spirit or female ghost would absorb a man's yang energy.\n\nThe Old Daoist hesitated.\n\nHe didn't know whether he should shout, \"Halt, female zombie! Release my boss!\"\n\nOr call out, \"Yo, Yingying, enjoying that? Don't suck the boss dry.\"\n\nThe Old Daoist didn't believe Yingying would intentionally absorb anything from the boss. He'd lived under the same roof with the female zombie for a long time. If she'd really had any ill intentions toward the boss, she wouldn't have risked her life to save him on General's Mountain.\n\nStepping a few paces closer, the Old Daoist could see more clearly.\n\nHe noticed that Yingying's once completely white hair had already turned halfway to black.\n\nTsk tsk.\n\nIs she healing?\n\nIs the boss helping Yingying replenish her vital energy?\n\nThe Old Daoist thought of the \"Jade Maiden Heart Sutra,\"⁴ thinking how strange the technique was, requiring them to be in bed to practice.\n\nLooking at the boss again,\n\nthe Old Daoist suddenly noticed the boss's expression was one of extreme pain,\n\nas if he were trapped in a nightmare, looking deeply distressed.\n\nDamn it.\n\nDid he suffer a cultivation deviation?\n\nThe Old Daoist gritted his teeth. Never mind. He picked up a nearby book and prodded the boss's chest with it, but the boss still didn't react.\n\nThe Old Daoist then slapped the book down on the boss's chest.\n\n*Smack!*\n\nThe sound was loud.\n\nThe boss still didn't wake up, but Bai Yingying's eyes suddenly snapped open.\n\nThe female zombie's eyes were filled with an icy coldness, her true nature revealed in an instant. She was, after all, a zombie, a creature forsaken by heaven, earth, humanity, and the gods. Her usual innocence and cheerfulness were reserved for Zhou Ze alone.\n\nRight now, she looked like someone with a terrible temper upon waking, her gaze sweeping over the Old Daoist.\n\nThe Old Daoist sucked in a cold breath,\n\nfeeling the surrounding temperature plummet even further.\n\n\"Yingying, it's me! It's this humble Daoist...\"\n\nthe Old Daoist said, shivering.\n\nBai Yingying's face was expressionless.\n\nShe stared hard at the Old Daoist,\n\nthen looked down at Zhou Ze in her arms.\n\nThen,\n\nshe seemed to notice the change in her own hair color. As if realizing something, she immediately got off the bed and knelt beside it.\n\n\"Boss, Yingying didn't do it on purpose. Yingying doesn't know what happened, I just suddenly fell asleep.\n\nYingying really didn't mean to absorb the boss's baleful qi, I really didn't.\"\n\nYingying knelt on the floor, her expression incredibly sincere and anxious, like a child who had done something wrong, awaiting punishment from an adult.\n\nEr...\n\nThe Old Daoist wondered,\n\nshould I kneel too, just to fit the scene?\n\nBut it doesn't seem to have anything to do with me.\n\nJust then,\n\nZhou Ze, whose \"sleep\" state had been interrupted by Bai Yingying getting off the bed,\n\ngave a slight shudder.\n\nAnd then,\n\nslowly, he opened his eyes.\n\nWithin those pupils was a blood-red color that could drive a person mad, filled with a chilling hysteria.\n\nHoly crap!\n\nThe Old Daoist's legs went weak with fear, and he knelt right down.\n\nThe boss looked terrifying.\n\nZhou Ze slowly sat up.\n\nThe images from his dream seemed not to have fully dispersed yet.\n\nHe had the distinct feeling of, \"Was the dream a floating life, or was this floating life a dream?\"\n\nAt first, Zhou Ze didn't look at the kneeling Old Daoist and Bai Yingying.\n\nInstead, he closed his eyes.\n\nWhen he opened them again a moment later,\n\nthe blood-red color in his eyes had slowly faded, replaced by clarity.\n\nThat dream...\n\nhad ended at its most critical, and most despairing, moment.\n\nZhou Ze felt a little disappointed, but also a little relieved.\n\nHe turned his head to look at Bai Yingying, still kneeling on the floor. Noticing the change in her hair color, he asked:\n\n\"I recall saying that after my body recovered, I would help you restore yourself.\"\n\n\"Boss...\"\n\nSeeing Zhou Ze misunderstand that she had intentionally absorbed his baleful qi, Bai Yingying lowered her head even further and explained:\n\n\"Boss, it was while Yingying was massaging you...\n\nThe baleful qi came out of your body on its own.\n\nAfter Yingying took a few breaths of it, I got drunk, and then I don't remember what happened after that.\"\n\nAt that moment, the Old Daoist spoke up to defend Yingying:\n\n\"That's right, Boss! You can't blame Yingying for this!\n\nYou were just overflowing with your own essence!\n\nA wet dr—\"\n\nAt this point,\n\nthe Old Daoist bit his lip.\n\nHe lowered his head,\n\nand gave himself a slap.\n\nMy...\n\nstupid mouth...\n\n***\n**Footnotes:**\n1.  **Golden fillet, kasaya, golden-hooped rod, Great Sage Sun:** These are all references to Sun Wukong, the Monkey King from the classic Chinese novel *Journey to the West*. **Taobao** is a massive Chinese online shopping website, similar to Amazon or eBay.\n2.  **Didi taxi:** Didi Chuxing is the largest ride-hailing company in China, equivalent to Uber.\n3.  **Playing my part (打醬油, dǎ jiàngyóu):** Literally \"to buy soy sauce,\" this is popular slang for being an uninvolved bystander or just going through the motions.\n4.  **Jade Maiden Heart Sutra (玉女心經):** A fictional martial arts technique from Jin Yong's novel *The Return of the Condor Heroes*, famously practiced by a man and a woman together.",

    "content": "After a shower, Zhou Ze changed his clothes and sat down on the sofa downstairs. It was now the dead of night, still a long way from dawn, but Zhou Ze had lost all desire to sleep.\n\nAny normal person, after having a dream like that, would probably find it hard to fall back asleep anytime soon.\n\nBai Yingying made a coffee for Zhou Ze and brought it to him, then stood by his side, looking as helpless and lost as a child who had done something wrong.\n\nZhou Ze waved a hand, signaling that it was fine and she could go up to rest or play games. But Bai Yingying was still unwilling to leave. In her eyes, whether intentional or not, she had indeed absorbed baleful aura from Zhou Ze, and her boss's body clearly hadn't yet fully recovered.\n\nIt was like a man already gravely ill indulging in nightly revelry—truly courting death.\n\nTaking a sip of coffee, Zhou Ze lit a cigarette. To be honest, he also found it a bit strange why he would spontaneously emit a baleful aura in his dream. He believed Bai Yingying hadn't intended to harm him or been impatient; in fact, Bai Yingying was quite satisfied with her \"White-Haired Demoness\" look and had recently started playing with an ancient style of dress, which gave her a unique charm.\n\nThis matter could only be considered a thorn in his side. If he couldn't figure it out, he could only set it aside for now. After all, there were more important things to handle and resolve.\n\nHalf an hour later, a police car pulled up in front of the bookstore.\n\nXu Niangniang, who was still next door \"absorbing the essence of the sun and moon,\" saw the police arrive and immediately got up and went upstairs, unwilling to remain downstairs.\n\nHe had complained that the air in the detention center was bad and he hadn't slept well. That one night in the detention center had been a great blow to his skin.\n\nThe one who came in was Zhang Yanfeng. Zhou Ze had sent him a message.\n\nZhang Yanfeng held a file folder in his hand. His gaze first fell on Bai Yingying, and he asked with some confusion:\n\n\"Who is she?\"\n\nThe last time the police had come to the bookstore, Zhou Ze had made Bai Yingying and the others leave first, so Zhang Yanfeng didn't know her. And no matter how powerful the police information system was, it was impossible for it to contain Bai Yingying's information.\n\n\"My niece,\" Zhou Ze said dismissively.\n\nZhang Yanfeng didn't press the issue and sat down across from Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Coffee or tea?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nZhang Yanfeng rubbed his somewhat weary face, smelled the rich aroma of the coffee in front of Zhou Ze, and said, \"Coffee, please.\"\n\nBai Yingying went to make the coffee. Zhou Ze turned his head and called out:\n\n\"Get the Nescafé instant.\"\n\n\"...\" said Zhang Yanfeng.\n\nThe coffee was served. Zhang Yanfeng, straightforward enough, drank it in one go. Then he pointed at the file folder on the table and said, \"Don't you want to see?\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. \"There probably isn't any useful information.\"\n\n\"Heh heh.\"\n\nZhang Yanfeng chuckled, lit a cigarette as well, and asked:\n\n\"Why did you call me here?\"\n\n\"Because I just fell asleep.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"And then, I had a dream.\"\n\nZhou Ze stretched.\n\nThe scenes in the dream were too dreadful to recall.\n\nOf course, compared to the sealed space he entered at the end, even the experience of the \"cross-dressing pregnant woman's perspective\" was nothing worth mentioning.\n\n\"What kind of dream?\" Zhang Yanfeng's expression grew serious.\n\nIn this world, he and Zhou Ze were the only two people with chains tied to their legs. If he could have the dream, then Zhou Ze naturally could too.\n\n\"That place, it shouldn't be a hospital.\" Zhou Ze coughed and continued, \"There, it should have once been a secret underground concentration camp, a bit like the Nazis' Auschwitz.\"\n\nZhang Yanfeng's eyes narrowed. \"A concentration camp?\"\n\n\"Yes. My dream should have overlapping parts with yours; I also dreamed of that prison.\n\n\"But perhaps for different reasons, my dream was more realistic than yours, with far more detail.\n\n\"There, many prisoners were held, and every cell was filled to the brim.\"\n\nAs he spoke, Zhou Ze pointed to the invisible iron chain on his foot and continued:\n\n\"This chain was something thrown out by the prison administration. It doesn't seem to symbolize bondage. At least, to those prisoners, it seemed to represent something wonderful, a vessel for a different kind of beautiful sentiment.\"\n\nZhou Ze thought again of the man in the dream who had helped the woman snatch the iron chain.\n\nWhen the woman walked out with the chain on her ankle, he stood behind the iron bars, his eyes filled with blessings and beautiful expectations.\n\nBut he probably never knew what kind of place the woman with the chain on her ankle ended up walking into.\n\nThis formed an extremely stark contradiction, because Zhou Ze felt that his analysis of the final environment in the dream couldn't have been wrong.\n\nInformation about the Nazis' Auschwitz was really not hard to find. Many people connected to it had written memoirs. There was a passage Zhou Ze had read back in school that left a deep impression: many Jews, upon entering that room, thought it was a place for them to shower, but what came out of those small holes wasn't warm water, but poison gas.\n\nZhang Yanfeng was silent. He didn't know how to respond.\n\n\"I imagine this file doesn't mention any of this, right?\" Zhou Ze gestured toward the folder on the coffee table.\n\nZhang Yanfeng shook his head.\n\n\"That prison should be located deep underground,\" Zhou Ze said in a low voice. \"And judging from the clothing people wore at the time and the guard uniforms I saw, it should be from the Republican era. Since it's not recorded in this file, I think, is it possible that this prison is still underground, completely undiscovered?\"\n\n\"So, what are you getting at? You want me to go to my superior and apply to tear down the police station and start digging?\n\n\"On the grounds that I had a dream?\" Zhang Yanfeng retorted.\n\n\"There's always a way, isn't there?\" Zhou Ze took another sip of coffee. \"After all, the aggrieved parties have come knocking right at our feet.\"\n\n\"I can't do it, and it's impossible to do it for such a reason,\" Zhang Yanfeng said very seriously.\n\n\"Actually, it's not that difficult. We just need to find a tiny shred of evidence,\" Zhou Ze analyzed.\n\n\"The department is planning to level out an area for an underground garage soon,\" Zhang Yanfeng said.\n\n\"I understand.\" Zhou Ze nodded, indicating he got the message. But Boss Zhou continued lazily, \"I'll have someone pull some strings.\"\n\nIf they could use this opportunity to get the construction team to dig a little deeper, they might uncover some clues. Then, as long as they could confirm the potential existence of a special structure below, the normal excavation and construction could proceed openly.\n\n\"Anything else?\" Zhang Yanfeng asked, looking like he was about to leave.\n\n\"My problems, you can't help with.\"\n\nZhou Ze smiled. For instance, why he would \"overflow with essence\" while dreaming, to the point where the emitted baleful aura was thick enough to make Bai Yingying pass out drunk.\n\n\"Then I'll be going.\" Zhang Yanfeng stood up and picked up the file folder from the coffee table.\n\n\"Oh, right, Captain Zhang,\" Zhou Ze called out.\n\n\"What is it?\" Zhang Yanfeng turned back to look at Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Were there any soldiers in your family's history?\" Zhou Ze organized his words as best he could. \"From your grandfather's or great-grandfather's generation?\"\n\n\"What do you mean by that?\"\n\n\"Just asking. It's possible that one of the victims in there might be a relative of yours. You know, blood ties can very likely become a kind of bond.\n\n\"And this kind of bond can sometimes even transcend the distance between life and death.\"\n\nZhou Ze thought of the old man he had killed back at the Confucian Temple. The old man had served the temple for many years, all to pray for blessings for his descendants.\n\n\"I'm not sure about that. I'll have to ask.\"\n\n\"Including those who went missing under special circumstances,\" Zhou Ze added.\n\n\"You're saying I have an elder in that prison. But if it's my elder, why would they put a chain on me, their descendant?\" Zhang Yanfeng asked.\n\n\"But to them, the chain is a symbol of something wonderful. What if your elder liked you and decided to put this on you?\n\n\"Like giving you a piece of candy or a longevity lock.¹\"\n\nZhang Yanfeng was silent for a moment, then left.\n\nZhou Ze propped up his feet, continuing to lie on his side on the sofa, lost in another line of thought.\n\nIf Zhang Yanfeng's case could be explained by the possibility that one of his relatives had died in that prison, and so the chain ended up on him...\n\nThen what about himself?\n\nWas it simply because he was an underworld emissary, and he just happened to be in the vicinity of the police station, so he got shackled?\n\nReally, was that all it was?\n\nAs he thought, Zhou Ze suddenly felt a tightness in his chest. He stood up, pushed open the bookstore door, and walked out onto the street in the dead of night.\n\nThe air was filled with a faint humidity, and a sparse rain was beginning to fall.\n\nOh, so it was about to rain. No wonder it felt so stuffy.\n\nZhou Ze continued to stand in the rain and lit another cigarette.\n\nThe rain began to fall harder, changing from a drizzle to a downpour.\n\nZhou Ze raised a hand to cover his head. Having just showered, he decided to head back inside the bookstore.\n\nHowever, as he lifted his foot, his body staggered, and he nearly fell over.\n\nHis foot was so heavy, as if it were locked to something, completely unable to lift.\n\nZhou Ze looked down, somewhat stunned, only to see, to his horror, that a shackle was locked around his ankle.\n\nHow... how could this be?\n\n...\n\nThe old Taoist sniffled and walked downstairs. He had just napped for a bit but had caught a bit of a cold. He came down to pour a cup of hot water to warm himself up. It was just that the boss and the others had made the second floor too \"cool\"; the chilling effect hadn't completely dissipated yet.\n\nHe had even heard Xu Qinglang sneeze on his way up earlier, clearly a bit unable to handle the lingering aftereffects of this natural, man-made refrigeration.\n\n\"Well now.\"\n\nThe old Taoist sipped his hot water slowly as he looked at Bai Yingying, who was sitting on the sofa.\n\n\"The boss fell asleep again?\"\n\nBai Yingying nodded, reaching out to gently stroke the boss's face. \"He fell asleep right after that policeman left. The boss must be really tired.\"\n\n\"Heh heh heh, how could he not be tired? He's been practically squeezed dry by you.\"\n\n***\n\n¹A longevity lock is a traditional Chinese pendant, often made of silver or jade, given to children as a talisman to protect them and wish them a long, healthy life.",

    "content": "The rain keeps falling,\n\n\n\nThe atmosphere is not harmonious.\n\n\n\nZhou Ze silently found that the street where he was standing was slowly shrinking, and the ground under his feet was also becoming blurred.\n\n\n\nWherever the visual line is reaching, it is constantly being compressed.\n\n\n\nThe dream has gradually formed a replica of the dream.\n\n\n\nOh no,\n\n\n\nIn fact, it cannot be said to be a copy, it can only be said to be,\n\n\n\nA kind of extension\n\n\n\nBack to the head,\n\n\n\nI found out that behind me was no longer a bookstore, but a closed iron door\n\n\n\nLooking up, the rain is missing. Instead, the unknown liquid drips down from the dense and delicate holes on the wall.\n\n\n\nThat one again\n\n\n\nI'm back in my dreams\n\n\n\nBack to the last end,\n\n\n\nBack to the pause position of the nightmare,\n\n\n\nAnd after the button is pressed,\n\n\n\nIt seems that it just gives you a little rest time in the middle of the day.\n\n\n\nWhat you should bear next,\n\n\n\nWhat you should have experienced,\n\n\n\nYou should go and face it,\n\n\n\nCan't run away at all\n\n\n\nZhou Ze didn't know why this dream, this chain, has such great ability.\n\n\n\nI think when I first entered Sancheng Village, relying on the \"operation\" of the blue copper ring, Sancheng Village has become a unique structure and has been around until now, but it does not have the ability to actively \"suck\" people.\n\n\n\nSanjie Village can only exist quietly in that location, and you still need to find it carefully before you can enter. It will not be like this dream, open your mouth and actively swallow you up.\n\n\n\nThe end of the dream,\n\n\n\nThe beginning of the dream,\n\n\n\nAmong them, it is very obvious that it is unreasonable, and it seems that Zhou Ze, the dreamer, is simply insignificant.\n\n\n\nRegardless of whether Zhou Ze is willing or not,\n\n\n\nHe will come in.\n\n\n\nAnd it must come in\n\n\n\nZhou Ze took a deep breath,\n\n\n\nTrue,\n\n\n\nWhat Mr. Zhou, who has always been fucked by fish, dislikes this feeling the most. He likes to be unrestrained and wastes himself on his youth and life, but he does not want someone to point fingers at his life, or even force himself to do something.\n\n\n\nTherefore,\n\n\n\nBoss Zhou chose non-violent non-cooperation at this time.\n\n\n\n  Are in the dream in a mess,\n\n\n\n  All right,\n\n\n\nSince that's the case,\n\n\n\nThen you should be a cold and quiet viewer\n\n\n\nClose your eyes,\n\n\n\nEven open your arms,\n\n\n\nZhou Ze made a proactive approach to welcome him\n\n\n\nPressure and cramped space,\n\n\n\nThe liquids kept pouring on Zhou Ze's body.\n\n\n\n  A little sticky and the tip of the nose constantly swells up like disinfectant\n\n\n\nHowever, some of the things that Zhou Ze originally had in his brain did not appearFor example, skin cracks or dense blisters or flesh rot reveals white bones, none of these appear.\n\n\n\n  Of course,\n\n\n\nThis feeling is not good either, it is a bit similar to a standard book soaked in Formalin\n\n\n\nIn front of me was a piece of white cloth wrapped in a very practical way\n\n\n\nZhou Ze walked over, reached out to tear a hole, and then broke it hard\n\n\n\n  Front,\n\n\n\nIt is the same space as behind you,\n\n\n\nBut another woman with a big belly was holding the wall and drying it, which was very painful\n\n\n\nHer body should be very weak, and the stimulating smell in this space at this time actually made her feel very uncomfortable.\n\n\n\nIt's a pregnant woman again\n\n\n\nThere are so many pregnant women here\n\n\n\nZhou Ze lowered his head subconsciously.\n\n\n\nThen he was a little surprised.\n\n\n\nMy stomach is dry.\n\n\n\n  Um\n\n\n\nIt seems that there is something wrong\n\n\n\nZhou Ze reached out and touched the place where the old Taoist often took out the talisman paper.\n\n\n\nOne-piece gun plus a bag,\n\n\n\nThis is a man's body\n\n\n\nThis time I re-entered the dream and changed my main perspective\n\n\n\n  and,\n\n\n\nThe woman in front of me,\n\n\n\nNo wonder it looks so familiar.\n\n\n\nIt turns out that it was my main perspective when I had a dream last time\n\n\n\nZhou Ze walked over and wanted to help the woman up\n\n\n\nIt was an instinct. Even though he knew it was a dream, he had at least been with this woman.\n\n\n\nAt this moment, the iron door behind Zhou Ze was pushed open, and a harsh friction sound came out. Then several people wearing chemical protective suits walked in. Their rain boots stomped on the ground and made a sound of \"bajibaji\".\n\n\n\nTwo of them reached out to snatch Zhou Ze's shoulders and dragged Zhou Ze backwards.\n\n\n\nTheir energy is not very strong, but although Zhou Ze changed from a woman's perspective to a man's perspective in this dream, it doesn't change the body's body is still weak.\n\n\n\nEven the most powerful person is imprisoned in this place, eating food similar to sausage every day. If you don’t see the light of day, you will probably be gone soon.\n\n\n\nThe pregnant woman was also clamped up, and the two were carried out together.\n\n\n\nZhou Ze tried to twist his head and look around until the road around him began to get wider and wider. Finally, he heard the sound of the air everywhere.\n\n\n\nNot the sound in the cell,\n\n\n\nIn fact, Zhou Ze was staying in the cell last year. Although there were many people in the cell, it was extremely peaceful and everyone was no longer in a state of energy. No one would foolishly grab the column and shout \"Let me out, please let me out.\"\n\n\n\nThe lamp on the top became brighter and denser\n\n\n\nZhou Ze was lifted up and placed on a stent carriage, and then his wrist and wrist positions were fixed againZhou Ze heard from the old Taoist before that some love rooms with SM themes will have this kind of project, and people will be tied to the bed with \"big\" font to increase their interest.\n\n\n\nThe carriage was pushed forward continuously, and the head of the surround was over. I saw that there was a carriage beside me, with the pregnant woman lying on it.\n\n\n\nCompared to Zhou Ze's indifferent attitude, pregnant women are much more intense, and they keep crying and shouting something. Obviously, she found that she was not in a relationship.\n\n\n\nHer husband, let's think that the man who fed her was her husband. He fought to the iron chain and was definitely not trying to enjoy this moment.\n\n\n\nZhou Ze always felt that everyone in the cell had a huge misunderstanding about this chain. Of course, this was also a misunderstanding deliberately caused by the supervisor and even intentionally operating this kind of responsibilities.\n\n\n\nThe woman's shouting was very complicated. It was not Tongcheng dialect, but it should be the dialect from other places. So Zhou Ze listened hard to what she was shouting and saying something, but he received very little, and basically he couldn't understand it.\n\n\n\nFinally,\n\n\n\nTwo carriages were pushed into a room with some surgical equipment and equipment\n\n\n\nFor Zhou Ze, who was once a doctor, the surgical equipment and equipment here are so old that they can't be old anymore. I used to see some things in my class.\n\n\n\nThe person wearing chemical protective clothing checked the two people on the rack again, then left together and walked out. Soon, another group of people in white coats walked in.\n\n\n\nZhou Ze has been looking at them, looking forward to these white coats sayings, because there has been a guess in Zhou Ze’s heart, and this guess requires a testimony.\n\n\n\nAs long as this helps people,\n\n\n\nYou can determine whether your guess is correct\n\n\n\n  However,\n\n\n\nThey didn't say anything\n\n\n\nThis group of white coats has no communication since they entered this room\n\n\n\nAlthough Zhou Ze could see that the young and old men under their masks were even gray, they could also see that there was a gap in their status, and the obvious deputy and chief surgeon\n\n\n\nBut they just don't speak or communicate\n\n\n\nMaybe, this kind of thing is a bit like a daily routine for them.\n\n\n\nTwo standard living rooms were sent in from the experiment room.\n\n\n\nThey go as usual,\n\n\n\nJust like a chef checks in at work every day, there is no need to study new dishes, and the dishes cooked every day are also fixed. There are standard ingredients such as salt and MSG oil, and everything is done step by step.\n\n\n\nTwo of the young white coats walked to the inside of the house that looked like a safe cabinet. There was a metal tube poking out from the inside. The two white coats seemed to be opening a water dragon head and pulled out a group of red things from the inside.\n\n\n\nThis is,\n\n\n\n  Blood\n\n\n\nIn this large security cabinet, there is a blood vesselNext, he stood beside him in a young white coat with blood, and pointed at Zhou Ze and the pregnant woman on the bed next door.\n\n\n\nMeaning,\n\n\n\nWhich one to come first\n\n\n\nA slightly older white coat walked to the pregnant woman and signaled to this first\n\n\n\nNo communication,\n\n\n\nThere was no communication\n\n\n\nThis is a dream. Zhou Ze kept saying to himself that since it is a dream, it must be fake. Even if it happened before, it definitely did not happen in front of him at this moment.\n\n\n\nZhou Ze thought he could finish all this in a calm manner.\n\n\n\nIt’s like a person sitting in a cinema watching a midnight horror movie, and there is a standard for horror movies that can be released in China that cannot appear real ghosts. No matter how mysterious the atmosphere is, it will definitely be blamed for you in the end. In the end, you will definitely be blamed for the so-called scientific explanation of mental illness or hypnosis.\n\n\n\nSo as long as you hold on to the idea of definitely eating shit in the end,\n\n\n\nYou will feel that no matter how terrifying the opening part is, it will be limited.\n\n\n\nZhou Ze thought he should have this kind of mentality.\n\n\n\nThere will not be too many waves.\n\n\n\nBut he thought it was wrong\n\n\n\nWhen my young white coat slowly injected the blood into the pregnant woman's body like a drop.\n\n\n\nZhou Ze's eyes were staring at the pregnant woman's body and began to twitch wildly.\n\n\n\nHer blood vessels kept getting thicker and her veins were exposed, as if they were about to explode out soon.\n\n\n\nHer expression was extremely painful, and at the same time she kept trying to raise her head, wanting to see her abdomen\n\n\n\nThe few white coats on the side were very calmly recording with the form next to them.

    "content": "A single \"Yoshi\"¹ said it all.\n\nIn his past life as a doctor, Zhou Ze knew well that the development of new drugs and the advancement of medicine were inseparable from this kind of human experimentation. The most classic example, \"Shennong tasting the hundred herbs,\"² could be considered the progenitor of human experimentation, but in that case, he was experimenting on his own body, which is what made it great and noble.\n\nModern medicine, however, had already formed a relatively complete and mature system. The development of new drugs had its own set of standards and procedures. From preliminary assessments and mid-stage animal testing to the subsequent Phase I, II, and III clinical trials, the potential side effects and other theoretically possible harms of a drug were often compressed to a controllable and acceptable range.\n\nHumanity tirelessly puts mosaics and shackles on its own progress. Perhaps in the eyes of some mad scientists, these are fetters, but in reality, they are humanity's instinct for self-preservation.\n\nNo matter the field of study, the ultimate goal of its development is to benefit humanity, not to inflict harm upon itself.\n\nIn his previous life, a medical professor from Japan had visited China for an industry exchange lecture. He constantly spoke of his master; whenever he touched upon major directions or principles, he would inevitably bring up his master as proof. During his lifetime, his master had been a titan of Japanese surgery.\n\nAdhering to the principle that medicine knows no borders, Zhou Ze listened to the entire lecture. Afterward, he searched online and consulted with people in the industry, only to discover that the titan's master had once participated in research projects involving human experimentation during the Sino-Japanese War.\n\nFor special reasons, people like him were not sent to the defendant's stand or the gallows. On the contrary, after returning to their country, they often became professors or even directors at major local hospitals in Japan, eventually becoming powerful figures in certain fields of the global medical community.\n\nIt was truly a dark irony.\n\nAt this very moment, a group of people in white coats surrounded an infant that was being held up, applauding nonstop.\n\nBut before long, the infant, whose entire body was black and had been crudely and directly dissected from its dead mother's body, also stopped moving.\n\nThe middle-aged man in the white coat set the infant down and began to dissect it. The other white-coated individuals around him readied themselves to take notes.\n\nAfter the initial dissection was complete, they seemed satisfied. They appeared very pleased with today's research breakthrough, and it looked like they intended to continue the project with this specimen.\n\nOne of the younger men in a white coat pointed at Zhou Ze, as if asking what to do with the specimen still here.\n\nThe middle-aged man in the white coat responded with a string of Japanese. Zhou Ze couldn't understand it, but from his tone, he could sense the man's meaning was to just find some random project for him. It felt like they were saying the supply was plentiful, and since everyone already had enough data and discoveries for the day, he could just mess around as he pleased.\n\nAfterward, leaving one white-coated man behind, the rest of the group departed excitedly with the infant's corpse specimen.\n\nThis young man in the white coat seemed eager to try, like a child who had only ever been able to watch adults play a game and was now finally getting to operate it himself. It was an indescribable thrill.\n\n\"Maruta... heh...\"\n\nThe young man in the white coat muttered a string of Japanese to himself. Zhou Ze still couldn't understand it, but there was one word inside that he recognized.\n\n\"Maruta\" means \"log\" in Japanese. It could be understood as a very common material. This term alone revealed the Japanese attitude toward the living specimens locked in the dungeon, ready to be used at any time.\n\nZhou Ze's eyes were half-open. He no longer had the initial impulse to constantly think about ending this dream. Since he would just wake up again after leaving this dream, or since someone outside could wake him up and interrupt it only for him to unconsciously re-enter it, he figured it was better to be done with it. Rather than savoring the nightmare in segments, as if eating a Western meal, it was better to be decisive and devour it all in one go.\n\nMoreover, Zhou Ze was feeling an increasing sense of doubt about this strange dream. In the unseen world, it felt as if something was constantly pulling him along.\n\nThe infant carried away by the Japanese should have later turned into a vengeful ghost. After all, in the last dream, Zhou Ze had seen this infant crawl out of \"his\" stomach, and then crawl back in.\n\nPerhaps the formation of this dream had a great deal to do with the infant's lost soul.\n\nWhile Zhou Ze's thoughts were drifting, the man in the white coat used a syringe to inject something into him.\n\nAs soon as the substance was injected into his body, Zhou Ze felt a searing pain in his left arm. Then, the pain began to spread throughout his entire body with his blood circulation.\n\nZhou Ze thought of the pregnant woman. She had been tormented by pain until she died on the gurney. Was he to follow in her footsteps?\n\nBut the young man in the white coat directly undid Zhou Ze's restraints, leaving only the shackles on his feet. Then, he used a rope to tie Zhou Ze's wrists behind his back, and next, he took out a metal ring from the side and slipped it around Zhou Ze's neck.\n\nZhou Ze had seen this thing before. It was a favorite tool for catching patients in mental asylums, and some police departments also had it in their riot gear. It was a large pole with a catcher at the end; once it clamped around a suspect's neck, you could basically subdue them.\n\nThe pain was unbearable, and Zhou Ze rolled over and fell off the gurney. The man in the white coat held the handle with one hand, controlling Zhou Ze, while holding a pen in the other, looking at his watch, as if recording some data.\n\nAching, pain, muscle spasms and convulsions—Zhou Ze had thought he would have to experience that kind of agony all over again, but for some reason, the pain slowly began to recede.\n\nHe was still in this first-person perspective, still in this body. He could feel what kind of immense torment this body was currently enduring, but it was as if he had grown numb, or perhaps detached.\n\nThe body began to crawl outward subconsciously. Zhou Ze, like a bystander, continued to watch through this perspective. It felt like watching a documentary with a VR headset on.\n\nPerhaps this was a stroke of luck amid misfortune. Or maybe the dream believed that if it transmitted this pain to his senses in equal measure, it might trigger a physical reaction in his real body, and the dream would then be forcibly cut off.\n\nImagining the scene of the pregnant woman's tragic death just now, Zhou Ze even felt that if the same torture were inflicted on him, his real-life self might subconsciously enter a \"zombie-like\" state.\n\nThe young man in the white coat seemed to be letting his \"maruta\" crawl outward, as if he were walking a dog, looking quite relaxed and pleased with himself.\n\nAfter crawling out of this laboratory, he continued to crawl down the corridor.\n\nZhou Ze saw the situation in other laboratories. Even in the corridor, other white-coated individuals passed by, but they were all unfazed by the sight.\n\nPassing by one laboratory, Zhou Ze saw two men lying on two gurneys inside. An arm had just been severed from each man, and several people in white coats were busy trying to graft the limbs onto them.\n\nTo modern medicine, this was an extremely ridiculous operation and experiment, one that could even be called fantastical.\n\nBut here, it was being carried out in all seriousness.\n\nThis research project was for the consideration of the Imperial Army soldiers who were injured and disabled on the battlefield. They believed that if limbs could be replaced, it would increase the combat effectiveness of the Imperial Army.\n\nPerhaps it was because this young man in the white coat did it on purpose, needing to record some data, or maybe the liquid he injected into this living specimen was less than what the pregnant woman received. As a result, this specimen was able to continue crawling for a longer time and didn't die quickly. Of course, the duration of this agonizing torture was also multiplied.\n\nZhou Ze also saw a laboratory where five women were lying. The commonality among them was that their abdomens had been cut open. All five were dead. Unsurprisingly, they must have all been pregnant women, and the infants in their wombs had already been taken out.\n\nIt's hard to imagine that in this not-so-large space, every laboratory was the stage for an inhuman tragedy.\n\nThere's a horror movie called *The Cabin in the Woods*. But the scenes in *The Cabin in the Woods* don't compare to one or two tenths of what was here.\n\n*Clang.*\n\nA door was bumped open.\n\nThe few people in white coats inside looked over, displeasure on their faces. The young man in the white coat immediately apologized and then pulled Zhou Ze away.\n\nIn the brief moment, Zhou Ze saw that inside this laboratory, five people were kneeling, their hands placed in something resembling a large freezer. There were small holes there, only large enough for a person's hands to fit through.\n\nOne of the men was pulled out. His hands had long been frozen white. Then, two men in white coats held him down and plunged his hands into boiling hot water.\n\nThe next moment, the flesh and skin melted away like ice cream, leaving only a pair of white bones.\n\nAnd the man just watched it all happen numbly. He could no longer feel any pain.\n\nThe young man in the white coat seemed somewhat surprised, surprised by the terrifying vitality of this live specimen, as if it had broken some kind of record. He called out to a passing colleague, apparently to notify his superior, and then dragged Zhou Ze back to the original laboratory.\n\nHe closed the laboratory door, then walked over to the giant safe again, as if to extract another blood sample.\n\nThis body's convulsions seemed to have stopped, as if it had overcome the initial spasms and rejection phase. It just sat there, leaning against the wall, eyes vacant.\n\nBut Zhou Ze's gaze was fixed on the giant safe in front of him.\n\nAfter the \"crawl\" around the facility, Zhou Ze had realized that this lab seemed to be the core of the entire underground research facility.\n\nZhou Ze wasn't too surprised that Tongcheng had this kind of research facility. Most people were only familiar with one, Unit 731, which was in Harbin.\n\nIn fact, there was also the Kwantung Army's Unit 100 in Changchun, the North China Area Army's Unit 1855 in Beijing, the Tama Detachment's Unit 1644 in Nanjing, the Nami Detachment's Unit 8604 in Guangzhou, and so on. These were just the cities where the headquarters were located. Each headquarters had many branches, located in large, medium, and small cities in the surrounding provinces, which also conducted human experimentation research.\n\nThe young man in the white coat drew blood from the metal tube with a large syringe, then walked back over to Zhou Ze.\n\nWith curiosity and surprise, he looked at Zhou Ze, grabbed his arm with one hand, and prepared to inject more.\n\nZhou Ze slowly raised his head, looking at the very young face before him.\n\nIt was strange.\n\nIt was ironic.\n\nA young man of this age, in most modern hospitals, would probably just be some lowly intern, perhaps not even as old as the interns Zhou Ze used to order around.\n\nBut in this era, he was doing this kind of thing, and with the attitude of a child entering an amusement park.\n\n\"Baka!\"³\n\nSeeing that Zhou Ze dared to glare at him, the young man in the white coat slapped him directly across the face.\n\nPerhaps he sensed the scorn deep within Zhou Ze's gaze, which made him very uncomfortable.\n\nFortunately, Zhou Ze felt nothing from the slap. He had lost all feeling long ago. Besides being able to see, he couldn't perceive pain.\n\nHowever, because of this slap, the mocking look in Zhou Ze's eyes became even clearer.\n\nThe young man in the white coat raised his hand again, preparing to deliver another slap, but before his palm could fall—\n\n*Thud!*\n\nA muffled sound came from the giant safe, as if something inside had slammed into it hard.\n\nZhou Ze saw the young man's hand in front of him tremble.\n\nA look of terror appeared on his face.\n\nHe whipped his head around, looking at the giant safe behind him...\n\n***\n\n**Footnotes:**\n\n¹ Japanese for \"Alright\" or \"Good.\" Often used to signal approval or the start of an action.\n² A figure in Chinese mythology credited with discovering agriculture and herbal medicine by personally testing hundreds of plants.\n³ Japanese for \"idiot\" or \"fool.\"",

    "content": "A Cadillac pulled up to the bookstore's entrance. It was still the early morning, so South Avenue, usually bustling during the day, was quiet and deserted.\n\nA woman got out of the car, wearing a lily skirt and black stockings. Combined with her youthful face and delicate, flawless skin, she was the perfect embodiment of youth and sensuality in harmony.\n\nLicking her lips, the woman didn't rush inside. Instead, she looked at the memorial arches on either side of the bookstore. On one was \"Take it with a grain of salt,\" and on the other, \"Thus have I heard.\"\n\n*I just tell these hearsay stories as I please; you just listen as you please. Don't take them seriously, and don't take them to heart.*\n\nWhat hit her in the face was the aura of a salted fish.\n\nIf it were someone of the rank of a prince or general who hung this at their door after retirement, it would give people the impression of someone who had seen all the world's vicissitudes and was returning to a state of simple authenticity.\n\nBut the woman knew that the owner of this bookstore naturally had a \"salted fish\" temperament. To put it bluntly, he was a bit unambitious, thinking only of getting by day to day.\n\nIt was like how an ordinary person intentionally ignoring a hundred-dollar bill on the ground would be seen as a classic case of slapping one's own face to look imposing,¹ whereas if Bill Gates didn't pick it up, it would likely spawn many profound life lessons.\n\nShe walked to the shop's entrance. The door was locked. For a bookstore that normally only opened for business late at night, the fact that its door was locked at this hour was itself a sign of something unusual.\n\nThe woman's fingers twitched slightly.\n\n*Click...*\n\nThe lock inside opened on its own.\n\nShe pushed the door open,\n\nAnd walked in.\n\nThe woman closed her eyes, a look of extreme enjoyment on her face.\n\nYou see, at this moment, many places inside the bookstore were covered in frost, especially near the floor. White vapor swirled about, like the mist that clings to the edges of a popsicle in summer—and this was no dry ice effect.\n\nAt first, it was comfortable. But gradually, even the woman found it a bit unbearable. She glanced at the motionless man and woman on the sofa and chose to retreat outside.\n\nThen she took out her phone and dialed a number.\n\nSoon, the old Taoist, wrapped in a cotton army greatcoat, came running down the stairs, shivering and sniffling. Especially when he passed by his boss, he could clearly feel the little fellow down below shrink into a hard walnut from the cold.\n\nThe old Taoist didn't dare to delay. He immediately ran outside the shop and took off his greatcoat.\n\nSummer nights could also be muggy, but right now, the old Taoist was enjoying the stuffy heat, wishing it were even hotter.\n\nLooking left and right, the old Taoist spotted the Cadillac. He drew closer and saw the woman leaning against the car door, holding her phone.\n\nThe woman was very young, perhaps just a little older than Bai Yingying from the bookstore.\n\n\"Yo, you're here!\"\n\nThe old Taoist's face immediately broke into a fawning expression, mixed, of course, with the joy of seeing an old acquaintance.\n\nThe newcomer was none other than Tang Shi.\n\nTang Shi looked at the old Taoist, whose nose was red from the cold, and smiled faintly. \"Someone saw your current boss on the Yellow Springs in a dream, so he sent me to take a look. It seems the problem is quite serious.\"\n\n\"Uh, how is the boss?\" the old Taoist asked.\n\nTang Shi sighed, pointed to her own eyes, and then fell silent.\n\nThe old Taoist also sighed and didn't press further. He then glanced back at the bookstore behind him and said, \"Should I go wake him up?\"\n\n\"Waking him up would be useless. This matter isn't that simple, and it might cause some trouble. First, tell me the specifics of what happened. He wasn't clear when he sent me, just told me to come and have a look.\"\n\n\"Alright, why don't we go inside for a cup of tea and...\"\n\nThe old Taoist trailed off as he glanced back at the \"Frozen\"-themed bookstore behind him.\n\nThen he shook his head and said:\n\n\"Forget it. Let's just sit on the curb and talk.\"\n\n***\n\nBy dawn, the roar of machinery could already be heard from behind the police station. A newly approved plot of land was being converted into an underground parking garage. Because of a tight schedule, the construction crew had started work early in the morning.\n\nZhang Yanfeng had just woken up and was yawning. His work was usually busy, so sleeping in the office was a common occurrence for him.\n\nAfter returning from the bookstore last night, he had sat in his office, chain-smoking one cigarette after another, and had unknowingly fallen asleep at his desk.\n\nHe had a dream.\n\nHe dreamt that he and Zhou Ze were sitting face-to-face on a park bench. He had forgotten what they were talking about, only remembering that he saw a rust-spotted chain on both his leg and Zhou Ze's.\n\nThe first thing he did after waking up was wash up. After brushing his teeth and washing his face, Zhang Yanfeng felt his mind finally clear up a bit.\n\nHe had just grabbed his toiletries and was about to head back to his office to start the day's work when two young police officers walked towards him, engrossed in a heated discussion. They bumped right into Zhang Yanfeng at the corner.\n\n\"What are you talking about? So engrossed.\"\n\nZhang Yanfeng wasn't angry. A divorced, middle-aged man who was used to sleeping in his office wasn't likely to put on airs.\n\n\"Captain Zhang, sorry about that. We were talking about what the construction crew just dug up out back. Looked like memorial tablets or something, and some pottery,\" one of the young officers replied.\n\n\"What?\"\n\nZhang Yanfeng immediately shoved the things in his hands at the young officer next to him and ran straight down from the office building towards the construction site out back.\n\nHe hadn't expected Zhou Ze to be so fast. He had only told him about the construction crew last night, and by this morning, Zhou Ze had already arranged for people to deliberately dig deeper.\n\nOfficer Zhang had misunderstood Boss Zhou.\n\nNot long after he left, Boss Zhou had fallen into a deep sleep, with no time to delegate the matter to the old Taoist or Xu Qinglang to arrange.\n\nEven if he had made arrangements, it couldn't have taken effect so quickly. Greasing palms and pulling strings—even the simplest, crudest form of intimidation—couldn't have worked that fast.\n\nIt could only be described as a coincidence.\n\nCoincidentally, they were building an underground parking garage, which already required digging quite deep, and they just happened to hit the right spot and unearth some things.\n\nWhen Zhang Yanfeng ran to the construction site, he found quite a few police officers there, watching the excitement. Fortunately, it was within the police station's grounds, so the \"melon-eating masses\"² couldn't get in, and the scene was still orderly.\n\nActually, you couldn't blame everyone for being interested in the spectacle. Discovering things during construction was hardly a novelty anywhere in the country.\n\nA while ago in Rongcheng, a stadium was being renovated, and they ended up discovering an ancient tomb under the lawn. When you consider that the stadium was often used for concerts, that was \"raving on a grave\" in the truest sense.\n\nBut Tongcheng wasn't Rongcheng. Although it had the reputation of being the \"First City of Modern China,\" when it came to things buried underground, it really couldn't compare with places like Rongcheng or Xi'an. For the people of Tongcheng, this spectacle was genuinely novel.\n\n\"What did they dig up?\"\n\nZhang Yanfeng asked an officer beside him.\n\n\"Everything they dug up has been collected here.\" This was an officer from another department. He pointed to the items laid out on a white cloth nearby. \"It's all just small, miscellaneous trinkets. And I've looked; they don't seem to be antiques. More like things from the modern era.\n\nBut to be safe, I've already had them halt construction. I just called the bureau leadership to report it, and the leadership said to first contact our comrades at the Cultural Relics Bureau to come take a look.\"\n\nThere were many capable people in the police station. This particular officer had recently assisted in an investigation of an antique smuggling case, so he had a discerning eye.\n\nZhang Yanfeng looked at the items on the white cloth. Most of them were ceramics shaped like small animals, along with some memorial tablets. But they didn't look like they were for people; they were very small and miniature.\n\n\"Tsk tsk, things from the Republican era. The 'little devils' liked this style. Back then, many Japanese families would buy these as toys for their children.\"\n\nZhang Yanfeng looked up,\n\nand saw the old Taoist squatting opposite him.\n\nStanding beside the old Taoist was a young woman in a very revealing outfit.\n\nZhang Yanfeng recognized the old Taoist and nodded at him, mistakenly assuming he was someone Zhou Ze had sent over.\n\n\"What does this say?\"\n\nZhang Yanfeng asked, pointing to the Japanese writing on the tablets.\n\nThe old Taoist was stumped. He was worldly and had seen a lot, but when it came to something specialized, he was more or less clueless.\n\nJust then, Tang Shi, who was beside him, also squatted down and reached out to touch the tablets.\n\nAn officer nearby instinctively moved to stop her but was waved off by Zhang Yanfeng.\n\n\"They're for sacrificial rites, to commemorate small animals,\" Tang Shi said. \"There's writing on this cloth strip, too. The Japanese on it says it's to commemorate these small animals who sacrificed themselves for the Great Japanese Empire, hoping they can bathe in the radiance of the goddess Amaterasu, and so on.\"\n\nThe old Taoist gave Tang Shi a surprised glance. \"You know Japanese?\"\n\nAnd it wasn't just that she knew Japanese; she clearly knew a lot about Japanese culture as well.\n\nTang Shi ignored the old Taoist's questioning look, dusted off her hands, and stood up again.\n\nZhang Yanfeng, however, thought of what Zhou Ze had told him last night—that this place was very likely a concentration camp. Anyone even slightly familiar with WWII history would know what \"concentration camp\" meant.\n\nSo he immediately said to Tang Shi:\n\n\"These were all used by the Japanese to commemorate the small animals that died in their experiments, right?\"\n\nTang Shi nodded.\n\n\"Then if they keep digging, will they find memorial tablets and urns for people?\"\n\nIt was common knowledge that the Japanese army had conducted bacterial experiments on humans in China during the war of aggression. Zhang Yanfeng was asking this now to prepare for the subsequent arrangements. These things would certainly have to be handled properly; after all, they were all suffering souls, and fellow countrymen.\n\nTang Shi shook her head. \"There won't be any.\"\n\n\"Why?\" Zhang Yanfeng asked.\n\n\"When the Unit 731 site was excavated, they found memorial sites and facilities the Japanese had set up for the small animals in their labs. But for the people who died in the labs, used as live specimens, forget about memorial tablets or altars—not even their ashes were kept.\"\n\n\"Why's that?\" the old Taoist asked.\n\n\"Because in the eyes of the Japanese at that time, Chinese people were lower than beasts.\"\n\n***\n**Footnotes:**\n¹ Literally, \"slapping one's own face until it's swollen to look fat,\" an idiom for pretending to be well-off or tough when one is not.\n² A popular Chinese internet slang for onlookers or bystanders who are uninvolved but enjoy watching a dramatic event unfold.",

    "content": "How much difference is there between dreams and reality?\n\n\n\nIt can be said to be very big.\n\n\n\nBut it can also be said to be a line of separation\n\n\n\nDuring the dream of Zhuangsheng, Zhuangzi once raised a philosophical question. If the dream is sufficient and true, will people still have the ability to realize that they are doing it?\n\n\n\nZhou Ze felt this way at this time. Originally, he might have been just a hiding perspective. After being dragged into this dream, he always regarded himself as a spectator.\n\n\n\nIt's just that I'm watching a movie that is more interactive and more realistic\n\n\n\nBut as the dream deepened, Boss Zhou was slowly immersed in it, and began to feel the joys, anger, sorrow and joy of the characters in the dream, and touched their emotions.\n\n\n\nIt is clearly a human body laboratory that treats living people as \"Maluda\". Living people are the most valuable materials here and are consumed every day.\n\n\n\nBut in the cell, the foot chain was destroyed by the rumor and caused something that everyone was eager for. Zhou Ze didn't know what the foot chain meant, but it might be just an excuse, so it's not difficult to guess.\n\n\n\nFor example, exchange prisoners, and for example, release prisoners every day to gain freedom. As the stewards here, they have too many ways to create dreams after dream, giving them the hope of continuing to survive in bad environments.\n\n\n\nThis little hope, the \"hope\" that can be seen every day, can allow most people to overcome the destruction brought by the hard life conditions, so that they can keep it as possible, and then be used as a test product.\n\n\n\nZhou Ze never forgot the scene when her husband got a skeleton and gave him a pregnant wife after he was in a fight.\n\n\n\nIn the eyes of that husband, he had done everything he could. He gave up the opportunity to leave and gave the opportunity to his wife and his children in his stomach.\n\n\n\nHowever, her wife died in great distortion on the surgery table in pain, while his child was taken out, continued his experiment, and changed to those white coats with a shocking sound.\n\n\n\n\"Shi Xi\"\n\n\n\nEvery experiment room is doing their own projects, including baby bacteria experiments, body continuous experiments, and even human and animal intercourse experiments, etc. From a modern perspective, it is almost a real experiment that can be seen from the perspective of the sky and night fish, which is carried out here without any night.\n\n\n\nIt’s not that the Japanese people here are the second and strangers, nor that they really don’t have enough professional qualities, but because their living standard raw materials are actually too sufficient and endless, so they can freely experiment and experiment with and experiment with those concepts and concepts that are as beautiful as the sky and night fish.\n\n\n\nFor them, the most unworthy thing is the cost, the most undesirable thing is the cost.\n\n\n\nZhou Ze went to the local garrison, saw Huangquan Road, and saw the other shore flower, but in his heart, in this dream, in this place, he seemed to have seen what the real \"local garrison\" was calledThis is actually the sense of substitution, which is piled up bit by bit and slowly soaked\n\n\n\nTherefore,\n\n\n\nAfter that sound of snail came out from the inside of the huge metal tube-inserted safe cabinet,\n\n\n\nZhou Ze looked at that place again.\n\n\n\nThe place he noticed from the beginning\n\n\n\nOriginally, he thought there was a blood vessel, because he had seen a white coat extracting blood from it, and injecting it into the pregnant woman, including the blood injected into her body, were actually grafted from a metal tube outside the insurance cabinet.\n\n\n\nThe young white coat was incomparable at this time, and was trembling with fear. He didn't know what he was saying. Anyway, Zhou Ze couldn't understand.\n\n\n\nAt this time, I don’t know whether it was the shouting of the white coat or the memory of the security cabinet. In short, more and more white coats began to gather in this experiment room.\n\n\n\nMost people have a look of terror on their faces, as if they have a natural awe for the things in the security cabinet, but there are also several old things with gray hair, full of excitement and desire to try.\n\n\n\nZhou Ze's test product was ignored at this time. Zhou Ze felt that he had just broken a small record, but it seemed that no one had noticed him.\n\n\n\nSeveral of the oldest or most prestigious white coats started a fierce quarrel. They were so quarreled that they were red and neither of them wanted to take a step back.\n\n\n\nAs he heard the language he couldn't understand kept noisy, Zhou Ze felt that he was a little big\n\n\n\nAt this time, the young white coat that had been crawling in Zhou Ze before walked to an old man and pointed to Zhou Ze what he said. The elderly slapped his hands impatiently, as if he was saying that you would beat such a trivial matter at this time and I really have no eyesight to see\n\n\n\nThe young white coat kept \"Hai\" and \"Hai\" with respectful expressions.\n\n\n\nThen he walked over and pulled Zhou Ze out of this laboratory\n\n\n\n  Happy,\n\n\n\nThey didn't have time to take care of themselves at a time, and they had a small breakthrough in their experience, so it was useful to keep themselves. Zhou Ze thought in his mind.\n\n\n\nThe young white coat did not send Zhou Ze back to the cell, and it was obviously impossible to be sent to the cell, because Zhou Ze had seen the true meaning of the foot chain. For these white coats, they hoped that their \"Maluda\" would live more and give them practical use.\n\n\n\nZhou Ze was pushed into a room with a slightly larger space. There was half a ball size here. In a young white coat, he tied Zhou Ze in a fine iron chain next to a shelf. Then he talked about several white coats that were working inside, and then ran back to the original laboratory without stopping.\n\n\n\nZhou Ze was sitting here. At first, he was still thinking, thinking about the safe cabinet that had just happened, but soon, Zhou Ze's attention was attracted by the room he was now in.There is a huge metal and glass container in the room. Through some glass, you can see the situation inside.\n\n\n\nThere was a woman and a girl inside. They seemed to be a mother and daughter. Because the little girl was snuggling against the woman, the woman was touching the girl's head with her hands and comforting her.\n\n\n\nIn several white coats outside, there was a camera, a timer and a data report, and two were standing next to a container and starting to operate the machine.\n\n\n\nAt the beginning,\n\n\n\nZhou Ze didn't know what kind of experience this was.\n\n\n\nSlowly,\n\n\n\nHe understood,\n\n\n\nBecause the principle of the experiment is very simple, they constantly extract the air in the container, and there is a watch plate that shows the actual pressure inside the container.\n\n\n\nWith the air constantly being pulled out,\n\n\n\nZhou Ze saw that the mother and daughter in the container were all lying on the ground, with an incomparable pain\n\n\n\nThe little girl left her mother's control, crawled to the edge of the container, and kept slapping the container outside, but her screams and crying could not be reflected in the slightest response;\n\n\n\nThe white coats around are all doing their own work, in an orderly manner and extremely familiar\n\n\n\n  finally,\n\n\n\nThe little girl looked at Zhou Ze who was being dragged in the corner.\n\n\n\nShe was asking Zhou Ze for help.\n\n\n\nShe couldn't tell it.\n\n\n\nIn fact, Zhou Cheng is also one of them and can't save her at all. Maybe this is the innocence of the child. Her mother may have long anticipated the end, but she looks a little calmer.\n\n\n\nZhou Ze looked at the girl in the container.\n\n\n\nThe girl in the container was also looking at him.\n\n\n\nTwo eyes, just like this\n\n\n\nWhat Zhou Ze wanted to do, but he couldn't break the brink. He was already trying and working hard. This means that in fact, in ignorance, Zhou Ze had forgotten that he was just a viewer. He had forgotten that he was just a spectator. He was involved in it. What he wanted to do, and he wanted to stop everything that was about to happen.\n\n\n\nIn fact, I want to stop what has happened\n\n\n\nOriginally, no matter how solid the chains were, they looked like paper in front of his nails, but now, he couldn't do anything about it.\n\n\n\nAs the air was constantly pulled out, the organs in the little girl began to be pressed out from her eyes, mouth and even the top position. Any place with holes on her body became the outlet for the internal organs to overflow.\n\n\n\nThe blood vessels all over the body are bulging like earthworms covered with strips of dense earthworms\n\n\n\nThe face was like a huge sea, with bulging eyes, still staring at Zhou Ze, maybe, this was her final survival instinct\n\n\n\nZhou Ze kept slamming, hoping to remove this iron chain and make a \"click\" friction sound from time to time, but this kind of slamming seemed a bit insignificant.The girl's body is slowly compressed and stretched.\n\n\n\nAt the same time,\n\n\n\nThe collars in the body began to \"out\" from their eyes and mouth, like living things, digging them out by themselves\n\n\n\nThis picture,\n\n\n\nMake people's skin numb\n\n\n\nIt’s like you were walking and accidentally stepped on an earthworm to death. The yellow and white brains burst out from the earthworm’s body, but the person in front of you was\n\n\n\nYou can feel her joy, anger, and sorrow,\n\n\n\nCan feel her pain,\n\n\n\n  as well as,\n\n\n\nHer hope\n\n\n\n\"Baji...\"\n\n\n\nThe girl's eyes seemed to explode.\n\n\n\nIt seemed like it was popping out again,\n\n\n\nAfter her body twitched,\n\n\n\n  Really fell to the ground,\n\n\n\nShe finally stopped talking to Zhou Ze anymore\n\n\n\nBut even if you die,\n\n\n\nThe kidneys and other organs in her body were still being compressed by air pressure, and the white coats who were responsible for taking the air were still working.\n\n\n\nAfter the air is exhausted to the limit,\n\n\n\nTake photos and record data.\n\n\n\nSeveral white coats made a shout,\n\n\n\nIt seems that it’s time for the time being, the workers get off work, and they can go back to the dormitory to rest. Who may have a ticket to the comfort center, so you can relax.\n\n\n\nIn a white coat, I saw Zhou Ze who was still mechanically numbly twitching the iron chain.\n\n\n\nPointing at Zhou Ze and laughing, and several other companions also laughed together.\n\n\n\nZhou Ze was placed here at a different experiment room at a time. Of course, they would not send Zhou Ze to the container. Moreover, their experiment projects and data have been completed today and they can \"get off work\" to rest.\n\n\n\nI heard a laugh,\n\n\n\nZhou Ze raised his head in a daze.\n\n\n\nLooking at the white coats in front of you,\n\n\n\nBut his action of squeezing and bundling the wire chain did not stop\n\n\n\nIt's useless to know,\n\n\n\nThis is a dream.\n\n\n\nNo matter how real it is,\n\n\n\nIt's just a dream,\n\n\n\nBut at the moment, it seems that only this action can make Zhou Ze feel like he is doing something.\n\n\n\nOr maybe,\n\n\n\nThis can numb yourself\n\n\n\n\"Click...Click...Click......\"\n\n\n\nZhou Ze was still pulling the iron chain\n\n\n\nThe few white coats next to them were still smiling\n\n\n\n\"Click...Click...Click......\"\n\n\n\nZhou Ze's last little girl stared at her again in the sea of brain.\n\n\n\nHer eyes,\n\n\n\nOriginally clear and lovely,\n\n\n\nIn the end, a \"bar\" sound,\n\n\n\nNo more\n\n\n\nHiss………\n\n\n\n  Heart,\n\n\n\nSuddenly it hurts so much.\n\n\n\nI haven't felt the feeling of heartache for a long time, especially after I lost my heartTo endure the inappropriate feeling in your chest,\n\n\n\nZhou Ze continued to thrust the iron chain\n\n\n\n\"Clang\"\n\n\n\nA sound of sound is transmitted from another experimental room\n\n\n\nIn the first experiment room that Zhou Ze was staying in before, several white coats were still arguing. A group of white coats nearby stood respectfully waiting for the result of their quarrel.\n\n\n\nSuddenly,\n\n\n\nThe door of the security cabinet was hit from inside again\n\n\n\nAll the white coats on the scene were stunned.\n\n\n\n  Together, he looked at the huge security cabinet in front of him with a shocking look\n\n\n\n\"Click...\" Zhou Ze continued to pull\n\n\n\n\"Clang\" the sound of the security cabinet is coming again\n\n\n\n\"Click...\"\n\n\n\n\"Clang\"\n\n\n\n\"Click...\"\n\n\n\n\"Clang\"\n\n\n\nThe sound is getting louder and louder.\n\n\n\n  Response to the entire research institute,\n\n\n\nAll the white coats in the laboratory where the insurance cabinet was located were squatting directly on the ground in a startle way. When other laboratory heard this calm staff in the laboratory, they were puzzled. They put down their heads and walked out to check the situation.\n\n\n\nOnly the few white coats in the experiment room where Zhou Ze is now in.\n\n\n\nHe was looking at Zhou Ze with a look at the monster.\n\n\n\nThe face is full of fear,\n\n\n\nBecause they were surprised to find that\n\n\n\nThe frequency of Zhou Ze's pulling the iron chain each time,\n\n\n\nAnd the frequency of that huge response,\n\n\n\nExactly the same",

    "content": "\"Crack...\"\n\n\"Clang!\"\n\n\"Crack...\"\n\n\"Clang!\"\n\nAt this very moment,\n\nZhou Ze had already forgotten that this place was a dream;\n\nand everything that happened in the dream might have been fated eighty years ago.\n\nThe dream was only telling you an ending, telling you a process, telling you an established fact.\n\nAfter all,\n\nwho can change the future?\n\nViewed calmly from the perspective of conventional values, what Zhou Ze was doing right now seemed utterly meaningless. What influence could he possibly have, struggling so desperately, so relentlessly, inside a dream?\n\nChildish,\n\ncrude,\n\nuninteresting,\n\neven more pathetic than a young child who likes to squat in a corner and watch ants fight.\n\nBoss Zhou never considered himself a good person. Being a good person was too tiring, and sometimes, too unjust.\n\nThat teacher who wore a tall hat, one that couldn't be removed even after he died, was the best proof.\n\nBoss Zhou had always been a complete slacker; he had even, by a strange twist of fate, eaten his own conscience.\n\nRecalling the taste, it was actually pretty good. Once his conscience was gone, he could just follow his own whims.\n\nThings he shouldn't meddle in, he didn't.\n\nThings he was too lazy to meddle in, he didn't.\n\nThings that were troublesome, he didn't.\n\nEven if the world outside were flooding, I would just stay in my bookstore, basking in the sun and sipping my civet coffee.\n\nBut some things are easier said than done, easier thought than felt.\n\nOnly,\n\nwhen you are locked in this place,\n\nforced to watch this scene unfold before your very eyes,\n\nwatching that little girl's gaze fixed upon you until her death,\n\nwatching her entire body being slowly squeezed and stretched out like toothpaste,\n\nwatching those intestines, still twitching, one by one,\n\nthose scenes, one after another,\n\nwhat they brought to Zhou Ze wasn't disgust, nor was it fear.\n\nHe had walked through Hell.\n\nHe had experienced life and death.\n\nWhat was there left to truly be afraid of?\n\nBut that feeling,\n\nthat oppression,\n\ncrashed down on him like a flood!\n\nThe numb prisoners in their cells,\n\nsnatching with hope at the leg shackles thrown by the guard,\n\nthe husband fighting desperately to seize them, entrusting that \"beautiful\" hope to his wife, to his unborn child.\n\nImages, one after another,\n\nflashed ceaselessly through Zhou Ze's mind,\n\nlike a slideshow.\n\nZhou Ze's breathing began to slow, his movements grew slower, but they remained powerful and forceful.\n\nEvery tug was accompanied by the further blurring of the flesh and blood around his wrist.\n\nThat stabbing pain, that tearing sensation,\n\nseemed so insignificant at this moment.\n\nOn the laboratory table,\n\nlay the corpse of a pregnant woman, her body twisted, her veins bulging.\n\nIn a palm, an infant, still struggling in agony, was held aloft.\n\nOn five gurneys, five mothers, their bellies all sliced open.\n\nThe men and women forced into cross-breeding experiments with animals to study bloodlines.\n\nThe woman with a numb expression whose hands, frozen for who knows how long, shattered and fell apart with a single tap of a hammer.\n\nIncluding,\n\nthe mother and daughter who still lay in the sealed container, not yet cleaned up.\n\nThis bystander,\n\ntruly could not stand by and watch any longer.\n\nThe excuse he had used before to deliberately dismiss it all, to give himself psychological comfort, had now completely lost its effect.\n\nRage,\n\noppression,\n\ngrief,\n\nat this moment, transformed into a series of roars from Zhou Ze's hoarse throat!\n\n\"Aaargh!!!!\"\n\nZhou Ze screamed hysterically.\n\nHis arm began to tug more and more frantically, ceaselessly.\n\nHe wanted to break free from all of this.\n\nHe wanted to break free from this chain that bound his arm.\n\nHe wanted to rush over,\n\nand tear these bastards in white coats, who were committing acts worse than those of beasts and swine, to shreds, one by one.\n\nHe wanted to flay them alive.\n\nHe wanted to drink their blood.\n\nHe wanted to eat their flesh.\n\nHe wanted to drag out their souls,\n\ngiving them no chance to descend to the Yellow Springs or enter hell.\n\nHe wanted to make them suffer torment day and night.\n\nHe wanted them to endure boundless agony!\n\nYou treat all this as a game.\n\nYou treat this place as your personal playground.\n\nYou treat living human lives as \"maruta,\"¹ as skinned logs.\n\nYou think you are masters.\n\nYou think you are demons walking the earth.\n\nYou think you control everything, control life and death!\n\nFine.\n\nThen today, I will show you,\n\nwhat a real devil,\n\ntruly looks like!\n\nCrawling out from hell,\n\nwalking back from the road to the Yellow Springs,\n\nemerging from the Pool of Netherworld,\n\nI will show you what true terror is.\n\nI will take the torture and pain you have inflicted upon others...\n\nTenfold,\n\na hundredfold,\n\na thousandfold,\n\nten-thousandfold,\n\nand return it to you!\n\n\"Aaaaargh!!!!\"\n\nThe roaring continued.\n\nA silent shout bellowed in his heart.\n\nZhou Ze laughed wildly,\n\nhis face contorted.\n\n\"Crack! Crack! Crack! Craaaaaack!!!!\"\n\nThe frequency at which his arm yanked the iron chain grew faster and faster.\n\nFaster and faster,\n\nso fast it was absurd.\n\nIn the eyes of these few white coats,\n\nZhou Ze at this moment was like a beast so desperate to escape it would stop at nothing.\n\nEven if it meant self-mutilation,\n\nit would break the chain's restraint,\n\nand devour anyone in its path!\n\n...\n\n\"Clang!\"\n\n\"Clang!\"\n\n\"Clang!\"\n\nThe sound of banging from within the safe was incessant. The nearly ten white coats in this laboratory all wore grave expressions; the less composed among them had even fallen to their knees, just short of kowtowing.\n\nThey knew what was inside, and thus understood just how terrifying a thing it was for the contents to suddenly start ramming the safe.\n\nYes,\n\nthey, too, knew terror.\n\nEven though their hands were stained with blood on a daily basis, even though every one of them was a butcher, an executioner, they could still feel fear and dread.\n\nOne of the elderly white coats, who had been arguing most fiercely earlier, suddenly lunged forward. He actually hugged the safe's latch, caressing it devotionally, like a man seeing his first love.\n\nHe was agitated.\n\nHe was lost in the moment.\n\nHe was shouting something loudly in Japanese.\n\nIt was like a speech,\n\nyet also like a hymn.\n\nHis behavior was utterly crazed, utterly incomprehensible.\n\nBut this was a den of perverts, a dwelling place for \"demons.\" The personnel living and \"working\" here could not be measured by the standards of ordinary people.\n\nUnder the old man's impassioned oration,\n\nthe faces of many surrounding white coats also revealed looks of longing and excitement. They began to embrace, to weep with joy, to cheer, to jump for joy.\n\nThe Japanese had been conducting human bacterial experiments for a long time, but their only truly useful discovery, an invention that could have some small effect on the war front, was a method for filtering and treating drinking water in the wild, discovered by accident during germ warfare experiments.\n\nThis method did indeed help the Japanese army fighting in Southeast Asia reduce illnesses like malaria caused by water issues. Other than that, looking back at the entire history of the human experimentation research, there was not a single other discovery or result worth mentioning.\n\nAlthough the raw materials were easy and convenient to acquire, and extremely \"cheap,\" the Japanese military had also poured vast resources into each of these research institutes. With no results for so long, unable to truly support the expansion and operations of the Great Japanese Empire, the pressure on these researchers was also exceptionally great.\n\nAnd at this moment,\n\nthe banging from within the safe let them see a glimmer of hope, see the hope of their own success. The thing stored inside this safe,\n\nhad actually come alive!\n\nThis was a miracle,\n\na miracle under the protection of His Majesty the Emperor,\n\na glory bestowed upon the Yamato people by the goddess Amaterasu Omikami,\n\nthe future of the entire Great Japanese Empire!\n\nThe banging sounds continued to ring out.\n\nThe safe began to shake along with them.\n\nBut this safe was too thick and heavy. Because of this, even though the thing inside kept ramming it, it still couldn't get out.\n\nThe white coats from other labs in the research institute were also drawn by the huge commotion. One by one, they put down the experiments at hand and came over to see what was happening.\n\nIn some labs, the experiments were still running, but the white coats had left. They didn't care if the data from this experiment would be invalidated; after all, there was no shortage of living specimens. If this one didn't work out, they could just do another one.\n\nGradually,\n\nin and around the laboratory with the safe, seventy to eighty staff members had gathered. They were all peering inside, chattering incessantly.\n\nThe old man hugging the safe was extremely agitated, and his words were highly inflammatory. Gradually, more and more white coats began to echo him. They were excited, they were crazed, they laughed with glee.\n\nSomeone started singing a Japanese military song.\n\nThis atmosphere began to spread.\n\nThe old man hugging the safe also began to sing loudly.\n\nSlowly, everyone seemed to be swept up in this emotion.\n\nThe \"rousing and sonorous\" military song became a grand chorus here.\n\nThey were even moved to tears,\n\nfeeling that their \"hard work\" had not been in vain,\n\nfeeling that their \"sacrifices\" had not been betrayed.\n\nThey were celebrating, they were singing, they felt they were a lucky few, the \"pioneers\" who were about to witness the imminent, complete rise of the Great Japanese Empire.\n\nPerhaps,\n\nonly the four white coats in the same laboratory as Zhou Ze knew what was really going on.\n\nAs the central laboratory erupted into song, accompanied by the ceaseless banging of the safe,\n\nthe four white coats in this laboratory felt nothing but a bone-deep chill.\n\nEvery time Zhou Ze yanked the chain,\n\nthe distant safe would simultaneously emit a loud, muffled \"thud.\"\n\nThey knew.\n\nIt was this man.\n\nIt was this maruta.\n\nHe was causing the vibrations,\n\ncausing the reaction!\n\nAnd Zhou Ze's frenzy continued.\n\nHe tugged madly,\n\nhysterically,\n\nrecklessly.\n\nHis flesh and blood had long since begun to tear.\n\nFresh blood began to spatter.\n\nBut he still had no intention of stopping!\n\nEspecially when Zhou Ze heard the singing coming from the distance,\n\nhis repressed emotions were thoroughly and completely ignited!\n\nYou...\n\n...are still singing!!!\n\n\"Aaaaaaaaaargh!!!!!!!!!\"\n\n\"CRACK!!!!!\"\n\nThe iron chain didn't move.\n\nBut Zhou Ze had gained his freedom.\n\nBecause his wrist,\n\nhad been forcibly torn off by himself!\n\n\"CLANG!\"\n\nAt the same instant,\n\nin that laboratory still filled with singing,\n\nthe safe, which had seemed \"impregnable as a fortress,\"\n\nsuddenly cracked open.\n\nA hand, covered in wounds and skeletal,\n\nreached out from within.\n\nThe singing,\n\nat that moment,\n\ncame to an abrupt halt...\n\n***\n**Footnotes:**\n¹ *Maruta* (丸太): Japanese for \"log.\" This was the code name used by the infamous Unit 731 of the Imperial Japanese Army for human test subjects during the Second Sino-Japanese War and World War II.",

    "content": "The sturdy and massive safe, just like that, had a hole abruptly punched through it.\n\nThe surrounding temperature also began to drop rapidly.\n\nThat skeletal hand was less than twenty centimeters away from the old man in the lab coat who had been hugging the safe.\n\nThe old man lifted his head, looking at the skeletal hand. His expression twitched, seemingly devoid of the drive and passion from his earlier speech. His lower body was trembling slightly. If he weren't leaning on the safe, barely maintaining his balance, he might have already collapsed to the ground.\n\nBecause he was closest to this hand, his sensation was also the most profound.\n\nEspecially just now, he had clearly sensed that the safe, which had been incomparably sturdy and capable of withstanding many impacts, had seemed to turn into military-issue compressed biscuits in an instant, becoming so fragile.\n\nThe crowd, who had just been singing military songs in unison, fell collectively silent. They were somewhat at a loss, and somewhat terrified.\n\nThis was their research institute. Ordinarily, they were the ones who inflicted fear. This role reversal was, for a moment, a bit difficult for them to accept.\n\nOh, no.\n\nIt wasn't that they couldn't accept it.\n\nIt was that they had a hard time getting used to it.\n\n\"Crack… crack… crack…\"\n\nThe massive latch on the freezer vault slowly shattered.\n\nImmediately after, the vault's door was slowly pushed open.\n\nThe old man's body also fell to the floor. He tried to stay standing but collapsed anyway, lifting his head to look in the direction of the vault.\n\nInside the vault was a corpse.\n\nA corpse that was extremely severely damaged.\n\nHalf of the corpse's skull was gone, as if sliced clean off. The wound was exceptionally smooth, even shimmering with a strange luster.\n\nBelow the half-face, its single remaining eye was shut tight, showing no sign of opening. A huge fissure ran from its head down its body, like a channel that had been carved into it.\n\nOn its left chest was a huge hole, a through-and-through wound you could see through to the other side. The ribs inside were clearly visible.\n\nOn the corpse's limbs, some parts were covered in flesh and skin, while others were completely exposed white bone, exuding a bone-chilling cold.\n\nThe most profound impression this corpse gave was its bones. They were like jade, with a translucent, smooth quality, even giving one an aesthetically pleasing feeling.\n\nAll the men in lab coats present were \"researchers\" of live human experiments. They had personally concocted countless inhumane experiments and naturally had a far greater understanding than ordinary people of the limits of human life!\n\nThis was a person who couldn't be any more dead.\n\nHe couldn't possibly still be alive, and there was no reason he could continue to be alive.\n\nBut he was the only one in the safe.\n\nSo, besides him, who else could have been striking the safe before?\n\nFurthermore, it was his hand that had pierced through this thick safe.\n\nJust as the crowd was singing loudly, just as the crowd was at its most jubilant, he had ruthlessly thrown a bucket of cold water on them, bringing their symphony to a halt.\n\nThe corpse stood there, motionless, maintaining the posture of a half-raised arm.\n\nFrom the moment the safe's door slowly opened, it hadn't moved again.\n\nIt was as quiet as a work of art, carrying an exquisite aura, even creating a sense of beauty like that of the Venus de Milo.\n\nThe old man, sitting on the ground and still shaken, saw this and raised his arms again, shouting something in Japanese. He was still excited, still jubilant, and still optimistic.\n\nPerhaps, every team needed someone like him to maintain the group's morale.\n\nBut this time, before he could infect his nearby colleagues, the previously motionless skeletal hand slowly descended.\n\nAs if it found him too noisy, it descended naturally, wanting to interrupt his incessant chatter.\n\nOr perhaps like a caring elder who is fond of you, wanting… to pat your head.\n\nThis was a touch of love.\n\nThe old man wasn't afraid, because the corpse's movement was very slow; you could even sense an emotion called gentleness.\n\nThe old man grew even more excited.\n\nHe became more convinced that this was a miracle bestowed upon the Great Japanese Empire by Amaterasu Omikami, an opportunity for the Empire to rise and dominate. And he was its witness and discoverer.\n\nHis name, in the future, was destined to be engraved in the most prominent spot at the Yasukuni Shrine!\n\nIn this place, engaged in this kind of research, perhaps some of them didn't even realize that their own minds and personalities had long since become twisted.\n\nTake the old man, for instance.\n\nAfter getting over his initial, unbearable fear, his heart was replaced by ecstasy.\n\nNot one of the nearby men in lab coats screamed. They were afraid, they were scared, but no one chose to leave. Instead, they all stood their ground, seemingly waiting for the situation to develop further.\n\nIn the bottom of everyone's heart, there was a little bit of relief, and a little bit of anticipation. They all felt that if Heaven were to choose to favor a person or a group of people, it would most likely be them.\n\nThen, the situation developed.\n\nThe skeletal hand gently landed on the old man's head.\n\nImmediately after, the old man's face, still brimming with a happy and joyous smile, began to rapidly melt like an ice sculpture doused with hot water.\n\nHis wrinkled skin, his sunken eye sockets, his somewhat flat nose, his hair, everything on his head, instantly rotted away.\n\nIn almost the blink of an eye, the old man's head became a skull.\n\nAnd only then, having directly experienced this sensation, did the old man finally have time to let out a scream of agony.\n\nThe skull's mouth opened wide, but he could no longer make a sound, as if letting out a silent roar!\n\nA Japanese officer once wrote in his memoirs that after swiftly cutting off a Chinese person's head with a samurai sword, the head, lying on the ground, could still blink for a short time.\n\nAnd this time, this scene re-enacted that experiment, but in a more extreme and direct way!\n\nAfter the silent roar, the old man's body slumped to one side.\n\nOnly then did the group of lab coats gathered inside and outside the laboratory begin to panic. They started to flee madly. Faced with such an incomprehensible scene, their minds collapsed in an instant!\n\nTheir devotion to the Empire, their loyalty to the Emperor, under this incomprehensible impact, was like a piece of paper, instantly torn to shreds!\n\nA demon.\n\nA true demon.\n\nHad appeared!\n\n***\n\nInside the sealed container, the tragic corpses of the mother and daughter had yet to be dealt with. They lay there quietly.\n\nZhou Ze didn't know if their spirits were still there, if they would linger here and watch all of this.\n\nBecause at this moment, Zhou Ze's perspective was only that of an ordinary person.\n\nHis arm, broken off halfway, looked a bit empty and uncoordinated, but Zhou Ze still walked resolutely toward the four men in lab coats ahead.\n\nIn the eyes of the four lab coats, Zhou Ze was a hungry wolf, a hungry wolf that had gone mad.\n\nThey originally had no fear of the Maruta,¹ but Zhou Ze was different. That spirit of self-mutilation was already startling enough. Besides, others might not know, but they knew: the roar that had previously echoed throughout the entire institute was actually responding to the frequency of this man in front of them yanking the chains.\n\nA demon, released from its cage, had descended upon the human world.\n\nBut the laughable thing was, the first thing the demon did after its descent was to wash away the sins here.\n\nBecause he discovered that this place, more so than the hell he was supposed to be in, was more like hell.\n\nThe alarms sounded at this moment. From several entrances to the institute, military police armed with live ammunition began to pour in. Their purpose was to suppress any potential riots in the institute.\n\nUnfortunately, having received their orders, they were not simultaneously informed that this time, they weren't suppressing some disobedient Maruta, but a demon that had just broken free from its restraints.\n\nA true, real demon!\n\nSeveral military police entered this laboratory first. They were somewhat confused as to why a one-armed Maruta could scare these four researchers into backing away, unwilling to approach. But they very professionally raised their guns and aimed the muzzles at Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze stopped his forward steps.\n\nHe turned to the side, then turned his head, looking at the dark muzzles already aimed at him.\n\nThe four lab coats roared something almost in unison, as if impatiently ordering the military police to open fire and execute this guy who chilled them to the bone!\n\nTo be honest, in his past life or this one, Zhou Ze really didn't seem to have ever faced the barrel of a gun, especially not a scene as big as a firing line.\n\nClearly, he was currently just an ordinary person.\n\nClearly, he had just had to resort to self-mutilation to break free from a thin iron chain.\n\nBut for some reason, right now, Zhou Ze wasn't the least bit panicked.\n\nNot only did he not feel panicked, he actually found it a bit funny.\n\nThis feeling was very strange.\n\nIt was like an adult watching a group of children under five years old pointing water guns at him, threatening him.\n\nZhou Ze even found them a little bit cute.\n\nZhou Ze didn't know where this mentality of his came from, nor did he understand why he had become so arrogant so quickly and without reason.\n\nBut just as these military police were about to pull the triggers, a figure appeared behind them.\n\nHe appeared suddenly, like a specter, without any warning.\n\n\"Ahhhhhh!!!!!!\"\n\n\"Ahhhh!!!!!\"\n\nIn an instant, after letting out blood-curdling screams, the five armed military police turned into dried corpses and fell to the ground. On the ground, their military uniforms looked so baggy and oversized.\n\nAs for the four lab coats, they were so scared that some collapsed to the ground, some leaned against the wall trembling, and one squatted down, clutching his head and sobbing, constantly yelling in Japanese:\n\n\"Demon! Demon!!!!\"\n\nAt this moment, they truly experienced the perspective and feeling of their test subjects when they looked at them during experiments.\n\nZhou Ze looked at this guy who had suddenly appeared.\n\nHe saw his body, which couldn't be more broken.\n\nHe saw his head with only half a face left, and the hollow cavity in his chest.\n\nThe other's originally closed eye slowly opened at this moment. Deep within the eye socket was a chilling emptiness.\n\nBut in the unseen, there was truly a feeling that he was also looking at him.\n\nFamiliar.\n\nA strange familiarity.\n\nIt was a resonance of bloodlines—no, it was a resonance that transcended blood ties!\n\nThere was no need for much of an introduction, not even much hesitation.\n\nAfter all, that feeling was just too clear, and there was definitely no mistaking it!\n\nZhou Ze pursed his lips and said somewhat drily:\n\n\"You… are me?\"\n\nThe other didn't answer, just continued to stand there peacefully, as if nothing in this world could arouse the slightest bit of his interest, except for… Zhou Ze in front of him.\n\nZhou Ze grinned.\n\nHe smiled.\n\nHe finally understood what the thing inside the safe in that laboratory was.\n\nIt was actually… himself!\n\nThat group of crazed Japanese who pursued insane experiments had, through some unknown channel and from some unknown place, found his former corpse, stored it as a specimen, transported it here, and began to research and analyze it.\n\nEven the blood the young lab coat had drawn from the safe earlier actually came from this body of his!\n\nThe Japanese, wanting to use his body as a template…\n\nThey wanted… to create a god!\n\nNo wonder he couldn't escape this dream, no wonder he was dragged back in even after waking up, no wonder this dream was so real!\n\nAll the reasons, all the causes, at this moment, finally had a definitive answer!\n\nBecause back then, in this very research institute, there had been a version of himself!\n\nWhen you're a child, both parents and teachers will teach you how to communicate and converse with others.\n\nBut no one probably ever taught you how to have a conversation with yourself.\n\nAnd not in the taken-for-granted, \"soul-searching\" way, the literary, exaggerated description of communicating with one's inner self.\n\nBut in the truest sense, when you are face to face with another you, how exactly are you supposed to communicate?\n\nZhou Ze was also a bit at a loss now.\n\nAnd being at a loss led to being tongue-tied.\n\nHe didn't know what to say, nor did he know what to do.\n\nBut in an instant, he suddenly thought of a very crucial matter.\n\nIf the dream couldn't be changed,\n\nif the dream was an established fact,\n\nif the dream was just a record, a presentation of what had happened in the past!\n\nThen, did this mean that at this very moment, nearly eighty years ago, his corpse had actually awakened?\n\nAwakened, in this research institute?\n\nZhou Ze turned his head and looked at the mother and daughter in the sealed container. They had just died not long ago. Especially the little girl, right in front of him, the two of them looking at each other as she was slowly tortured to death.\n\nZhou Ze's voice trembled slightly as he slowly said:\n\n\"Kill them… all of them.\"\n\nThe broken figure turned around, as if it had heard an order.\n\nOr, perhaps, it was simply following its own true nature.\n\nHere, there was no chain of command.\n\nIt was just himself… doing himself a favor, himself requesting himself, himself demanding of himself.\n\nHe wanted to do this.\n\nAnd then, \"he\" went and did it.\n\nZhou Ze lowered his head. He remembered the scene of the five military policemen's deaths. He felt that such a quick and clean death was too simple, and let them off too easily.\n\nFinally, as the broken body walked towards the four lab coats in the corner, Zhou Ze added two more words, setting the proper tone for this operation.\n\nAnd that was:\n\n\"Torture… kill…\"\n\n***\n¹Maruta: Japanese for \"log,\" a codename used by researchers of Unit 731 for human test subjects.",

    "content": "This place had always been \"Purgatory,\" only now, it had something more—an authentic flavor.\n\nIt was like a counterfeit of a major international brand. In terms of quality, the difference was truly minuscule, and some counterfeits were even superior to the genuine article. But in the eyes of the consumer, the genuine article possessed an aura, a purity, that was its own.\n\nRight now,\nA true demon had descended.\n\nAll living things were equal.\n\nBefore Hell,\n\nAll of them,\n\nTrembled!\n\nThe instruments in every laboratory began to vibrate, as if they had sensed a magnetic field, a summons. The murder weapons and tools of before seemed to possess their own consciousness at this moment.\n\nThey began to cheer, they began to stir, and they grew ever more impatient, awaiting a new round of a demon's feast.\n\nThere was the scraping of chains, the clanging of scalpels and forceps, the creak of gurneys, the rustle of doors and windows. Even over in the cremation workshop used to incinerate corpses,\n\nAshes,\n\nFlew about chaotically.\n\nA medley of sounds—some high, some low, some orderly, some chaotic—were perfectly integrated at this moment, forming a stirring rhythm. It was as if Beethoven's \"Symphony of Fate\" was slowly beginning its overture, rising toward its cres...cendo.\n\nThis was an aura, a rendering of the atmosphere. True gloom, true terror. It was a bit like candlelight on a dinner table; it wouldn't change the flavor of the dishes in any way,\n\nBut this sense of ceremony,\n\nWas indispensable.\n\nZhou Ze, missing half an arm, walked through the research institute. He walked very, very slowly;\n\nWatching his self from eighty years ago carry out his judgment, his slaughter.\n\nFor the first time,\n\nZhou Ze truly realized,\n\nDeath,\n\nIt turned out, was also an art form.\n\nIt carried its own unique rhythm,\n\nContained its own distinct charm,\n\nLike a fine vintage aged for many years. Before even tasting it, you were already intoxicated by its aroma. And now, sipping it slowly, mouthful by mouthful, the fragrance entered through the mouth, flowed through the nose, and finally settled in the stomach, a fiery sensation instantly washing over the entire body.\n\nSo satisfyingly exhilarating, you could barely restrain yourself from letting out a moan of pleasure!\n\nThe white coats ran back and forth through the institute like headless flies—screaming, crying, and roaring. When the roles of demon and *maruta*¹ were reversed, it proved that no one was inherently nobler than anyone else. In the same position and circumstances, everyone was the same.\n\nBack then, while facing the struggles and wails of the prisoners in the testing grounds, they could probably still chat and laugh, even discuss which number at the nearby comfort station offered more enthusiastic service.\n\nAt that time, they were on the outside, and the others were on the inside. But now, they were the ones on the inside, and they no longer had the leisure and grace they possessed when they were on the outside.\n\nThey encountered the most terrifying kind of \"ghost wall,\"² knowing they had to run, but unable to escape at all.\n\nJust like the lab mice kept in containers, their fate was, in fact, already sealed.\n\nBecause of Zhou Ze's special request,\n\nThe death scenes that followed lacked the decisiveness of the beginning. Before, it was the blooming of a night-cereus; now, it was watching a flower from bud, to blossom, to full bloom, and finally, to its withering.\n\nNot a single part of the process could be skipped, not a single link could be missed.\n\nFrom the cultivation of fear, to the initial suppression, the details in the middle, and the extension of pain at the end. The flower of life, so delicate, was slowly branded and tortured in countless ways.\n\nDeath would not come easily, much less simply. Every last drop of your fear would be squeezed out, your final agony released. Not even your souls would be spared.\n\nDon't think the end of the physical body is liberation.\n\nThe true state of being unable to live or die actually begins right after your physical body is finished.\n\nYou must understand, the soul is far more sensitive than the body. The punishments of Hell are, for the most part, aimed at the soul.\n\nIf the body is the foreskin, then the soul is the head of the penis hidden within.\n\nWe all know,\n\nWhich is more sensitive.\n\nThe art of slaughter,\n\nThe vortex of death,\n\nConstantly clamoring, constantly wandering, and constantly intersecting.\n\nZhou Ze lowered his head.\n\nHe saw the blood on the ground, which seemed to have come alive, like a master of ink wash painting, constantly changing its form.\n\nIt was sinister, arcane, like demonic sigils—like stars adorning the night sky, carrying a mockery and sarcasm that it didn't even bother to conceal.\n\nPools of blood extended continuously, transforming into lotuses of blood by Zhou Ze's feet. On each petal was a face twisted in agony—the lingering souls of the white coats who had just died. This was their prison, their terrifying feast.\n\nIt was like watching a black-and-white television as a child: a tangle of lines, patches of white space. The lines were a mess, the white wasn't quite white. The tumultuous changes were dizzying, nauseating, disgusting.\n\nZhou Ze bent over.\n\nHe clutched his chest with his one remaining hand.\n\nHe felt like throwing up.\n\nIt wasn't out of sympathy, nor out of pity, but simply out of a kind of surprise.\n\nHis self from eighty years ago,\n\nCompared to his current self,\n\nSeemed even more ruthless and cruel.\n\nThat broken body was still walking among them,\n\nSlowly and deliberately, as if admiring his own masterpiece.\n\nWhen the time was right,\n\nHe would appear before a still-living white coat and, treating him as a side dish, toss him into the stirring symphony to become another note, or squeeze out his fresh blood to supplement the romantic watercolor of crimson.\n\nHe didn't wear a savage grin.\n\nIn fact, aside from the moment he first opened his eyes to look at Zhou Ze, he kept them closed the entire time.\n\nHe looked somewhat nonchalant,\n\nBut he was like the most perfectionist of artists, a conductor of an orchestra. He was diligent and responsible, ensuring every last detail was done to the best of his ability, so that the audience... would be satisfied.\n\nOh, no.\n\nActually, it was to satisfy himself.\n\nA dream that crossed a distance of eighty years,\n\nEach standing at one end of a point in time.\n\nWhat exactly was the dream,\n\nAnd what was the false part that a dream could change?\n\nZhou Ze didn't know, nor did he understand.\n\nBut probably,\n\nHis self from eighty years ago awakening here, beginning the slaughter, purifying himself—that was likely real.\n\nAs for whether he saw his future self from eighty years later, whether he accepted his own commission and thus turned what would have been a simple slaughter for him into something more complex, more tiring, more drawn-out, and more enjoyable,\n\nThat was impossible to know.\n\nIf he wanted to know the truth,\n\nHe could only wait until the secret underground was excavated.\n\nLeave this dream,\n\nAnd in reality,\n\nLook at the traces left behind from eighty years ago.\n\nOnly then could he make the most accurate judgment.\n\nHowever,\n\nSuddenly,\n\nEverything seemed to fast-forward.\n\nZhou Ze was startled to see the blood on the ground, which had been forming patterns, begin to boil.\n\nThe white coats and military police who had been waiting their turn to be thrown into the feast were now hurled into the various laboratories all at once. The experiments in the labs resumed; tools and equipment began to operate on their own. All sorts of experiments started anew, and even the logbooks and pens flew about, recording on their own accord.\n\nExcept now, the raw materials were no longer the *maruta* they spoke of, but themselves.\n\nBut this change in rhythm sent a nameless shock through Zhou Ze's heart. When he looked at the broken figure again, he found that it had already appeared right in front of him.\n\nHe was clutching the two halves of his own head,\n\nLooking to be in great pain.\n\nHis body was also swaying nonstop,\n\nAs if he could no longer control himself.\n\nEverything around them was his handiwork, his art of death. Everything changed according to the state of his mind, and as he began to descend into madness, into a loss of control, everything around them began to devolve into a brutal, violent aesthetic.\n\nScreams,\n\nWails,\n\nFrom the living,\n\nFrom the dead souls.\n\nThey suffered even more unbearable agony within it.\n\nAbruptly,\n\nThe broken figure opened its eyes. His pupils were blood-red, momentarily stunning Zhou Ze.\n\nHe was shouting something at him.\n\nHe was telling him something.\n\nBut damn it,\n\nWhy couldn't he hear a single word!\n\n\"I can't hear you! What are you saying!\"\n\nZhou Ze yelled at him. He knew that what the other was saying had to be important; it might even be a message his self from eighty years ago had left for him.\n\nThrough...\n\nThe form of a dream.\n\nBut he couldn't hear anything, he really couldn't hear a thing. Moreover, the other man was on the verge of losing control, roaring and shouting. Even if Zhou Ze could read lips, it would be impossible to analyze what he was saying.\n\n\"Boom!\"\n\n\"Boom!\"\n\nA series of explosions sounded.\n\nIt was the sound of several exits being blown up.\n\nThe Japanese soldiers above no longer dared to go down and were planning to seal the place off.\n\nAnd at that moment,\n\nThe broken figure seemed to grow ever more frenzied.\n\nThe blood on the ground rose steadily, slowly covering everything. At first, it merely reached Zhou Ze's insteps, then slowly rose to his knees, and finally, it submerged him past his waist.\n\nZhou Ze badly wanted to call out to the figure again. He badly wanted to know what he had just said, but Zhou Ze didn't have time to ask again, nor time to do anything else, because the blood had already drowned him completely.\n\n\"Glug...\"\n\nHis body,\n\nFelt like it was sinking into the depths of the ocean.\n\nAll around,\n\nWas a desolate loneliness that brought despair to the heart.\n\nAnd below,\n\nWas a broken figure,\n\nWho also seemed to be looking up, but the distance between them was growing at a visible rate.\n\nThe buoyancy began to increase, and Zhou Ze's ascent grew faster and faster. The suffocating sense of panic also grew stronger and stronger.\n\n\"Puh...\"\n\nWhen Zhou Ze broke the surface,\n\nHe shot up from the sofa.\n\n\"Hah... hah... hah... hah...\"\n\nZhou Ze was drenched in sweat, his whole body soaked through.\n\nBeside him, Bai Yingying was still fast asleep, but her hair had returned to a girlish black, and even her skin had become firmer and more elastic, as if you could squeeze water from it with a pinch.\n\nLike a fresh flower bud, thoroughly nourished by the morning dew.\n\nZhou Ze reached up and clutched his forehead.\n\nHe still hadn't fully come to his senses.\n\nThe scenes from before were simply too insane, too shocking. Especially the sense of artistry embodied within the slaughter; it made one feel as if they were standing in the very center of a symphony orchestra.\n\nNo, the center of a tsunami!\n\nJust then,\n\nZhou Ze's phone rang.\n\nHe glanced at the screen.\n\nIt was unexpectedly a call from Zhang Yanfeng.\n\nHe answered the phone, letting out a listless, \"Hello.\"\n\nZhang Yanfeng on the other end sounded very excited, with the loud roar of machinery in the background. He shouted:\n\n\"Hey, the higher-ups have approved! We're starting the dig! We're starting the dig...\"\n\nStarting the dig?\n\nZhou Ze was still a bit dazed.\n\nDigging what?\n\nBut very quickly,\n\nZhou Ze snapped awake.\n\nHe immediately brought the phone to his mouth and roared:\n\n\"You can't dig! Not now!\n\nWhatever you do, don't dig it up!!!\"\n\n---\n---\nPS: It's a new month, everyone please give your guaranteed monthly tickets to Dragon.³\n\nDon't panic,\n\nHold on to Dragon!\n\n---\n¹*Maruta* (丸太): Japanese for \"log.\" This was the codename used by the Japanese Imperial Army's Unit 731 for human subjects of their horrific experiments during WWII.\n\n²Ghost wall (鬼打牆, *guǐ dǎ qiáng*): A Chinese idiom for a supernatural phenomenon where a person feels trapped and walks in circles, unable to find their way out, as if blocked by an invisible wall created by a ghost.\n\n³Author's Note: \"Guaranteed monthly tickets\" are a feature on Chinese web novel platforms that readers can give to their favorite novels to support the author. \"Dragon\" is likely the author's nickname.",

    "content": "Hanging up the phone, Zhou Ze rubbed his face, let out a long sigh, and startled Bai Yingying as he stood up.\n\nBai Yingying rubbed her eyes. Lying sideways on the sofa, her two long, shapely legs were on full display, feet crossed lightly, her curves revealed.\n\nA woman's charm, yet with a young girl's innocence.\n\n\"Boss...\"\n\nHer voice was soft and sweet, carrying a natural warmth and adoration.\n\n\"I feel so good, so satisfied.\"\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze.\n\nMeanwhile, Xu Qinglang, wearing a cotton-padded jacket, was sitting at the bar drinking hot tea. A space heater was placed next to him, and with headphones in his ears, he was listening to music, looking completely at ease.\n\nOutside the shop, it was the height of summer, pedestrians being baked by the blazing sun, while inside felt like the dead of winter.\n\nHe had spent most of the day sitting in the bookstore for a while before running outside to wander around again, truly enjoying himself.\n\nThe experience of ice and fire, tsk tsk, interesting.\n\nMany people have experienced missing winter during summer and summer during winter. Xu Qinglang was getting to thoroughly enjoy both at once.\n\nSeeing Zhou Ze was awake, Xu Qinglang stretched languidly, as if he hadn't had enough, looking for all the world like a long-suffering, neglected wife.\n\n\"Give me your car keys,\" Zhou Ze said directly.\n\nXu Qinglang exhaled a puff of white breath, took the car keys out of his pocket, and tossed them to Zhou Ze.\n\nSeeing Zhou Ze was about to leave, Bai Yingying immediately tried to get off the sofa to go with her boss, but the moment her feet touched the floor, she let out a soft cry and collapsed.\n\n\"Ying ying ying,¹\nBoss,\nMy legs are weak.\"\n\nThis time, she had drunk her fill, completely replenishing all the vital energy she had lost before. She was filled with a sense of satisfaction that was hard to describe in words; even her bones felt soft.\n\n\"Just get some rest.\"\n\nZhou Ze had no intention of taking Bai Yingying. He walked straight outside, got into the car, and drove off.\n\nOn the road, Zhou Ze drove very fast. Although he had yelled several times on the phone for them to halt work and stop the excavation, Zhou Ze knew that Zhang Yanfeng didn't have absolute authority in this matter.\n\nFurthermore, whether Zhang Yanfeng would actually listen to him and agree to help stop it all was an unknown.\n\nAfter all, putting himself in the other's shoes, the incident with the iron chains had become a twenty-year nightmare, an obsession. Now that there was a chance to unravel the knot in his heart, how could he possibly hold back?\n\nThat place had been sealed away all this time. Eighty years ago, the events from the dream occurred. Zhou Ze remembered that at the end of the dream, the Japanese had blown up the research institute's entrance and exit tunnels. The fact that the modern world knew nothing about this place or the incident likely meant the Japanese had deliberately suppressed the information.\n\nBecause of that, the place had probably remained undiscovered and unopened for eighty years.\n\nWhich meant,\nthat the incomplete body was, in all likelihood, still inside.\n\nIf they rashly excavated, opened that place up, and reawakened that incomplete body... recalling the scene at the end of the dream where the body couldn't even control itself, Zhou Ze felt a chill run down his spine.\n\nThe deadliest part was,\nthat thing, to a certain extent, *was* him.\nIn the end,\nif an accident really happened, the blame would most likely fall on his own head.\n\nIt wasn't that Zhou Ze was afraid of taking responsibility; rather, if his former self went berserk and caused an accident, he would definitely not be able to live with himself.\n\nJust then, his phone rang. It was a call from Xu Qinglang. Zhou Ze answered.\n\"What's up?\"\n\n\"Oh, I forgot to tell you, that Tang girl showed up. Lao Dao went with her to the police station. He told me earlier to have you call him if you woke up.\"\n\nTang Shi was there?\nA wave of pleasant surprise washed over Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze immediately hung up and dialed Lao Dao's number while driving.\n\n\"Hey, Boss, what's up? We're digging over here.\"\nLao Dao's end was also very noisy, similar to when Zhang Yanfeng had called him. Clearly, Lao Dao was at the construction site.\n\n\"Put Tang Shi on the phone!\" Zhou Ze yelled.\n\n\"Recite poetry?\"² Lao Dao covered his other ear. Obviously, the noise on his end was too loud for him to hear clearly.\n\nJust then, a beep sounded from Lao Dao's end, followed immediately by a woman's voice.\n\"It's me.\"\n\nIt must have been Tang Shi, who, upon learning it was Zhou Ze calling, had snatched the phone from Lao Dao's hand without a second thought.\n\n\"Don't let them keep digging! There's something wrong down there!\" Zhou Ze shouted.\n\n\"I know.\"\nTang Shi said, then hung up.\n\nZhou Ze froze for a moment. Did she really hear him clearly?\n\nNever mind. Zhou Ze subconsciously accelerated toward the police station. Any traffic violations were Xu Qinglang's problem anyway; he'd be the one going to the traffic bureau to pay the fines and take the points, since it was his car.\n\nAlong the way, aside from a brief traffic jam at the entrance of an elementary school where students were crossing the road for a field trip to celebrate \"June 1st Children's Day,\" the rest of the drive was smooth and unobstructed.\n\nParking the car on the road outside the police station, Zhou Ze quickly got out and charged directly toward the construction site.\n\nThe construction site was now quiet, gone was the noise he had heard over the phone. Many of the construction workers were sitting on the ground, spacing out or chatting idly.\n\n\"Boss, over here, over here!\"\nLao Dao spotted Zhou Ze first and immediately shouted.\n\nZhou Ze walked over and saw Tang Shi sitting on the edge of a clean planter box.\n\nTang Shi was unwrapping White Rabbit creamy candies and popping them into her mouth one after another, a habit she seemingly had never kicked.\n\nIt had been almost half a year. Seeing her again, he noticed she hadn't changed at all.\n\nChewing on a candy, Tang Shi glanced at the hurried Zhou Ze and said:\n\"I've tampered with all the construction machinery. They're all broken.\"\n\nHearing this, Zhou Ze let out a long sigh of relief. Tang Shi had helped him out in a big way this time. No matter what, it was good that they hadn't dug it up yet.\n\nThis meant the most terrifying possibility wouldn't happen for now. There was still room to maneuver.\n\n\"Down there... it's most likely a concentration camp, right?\"\nTang Shi asked, looking at Zhou Ze. She had already analyzed the items that were initially unearthed.\n\n\"Yes. It's a live human experimentation research institute, similar to Unit 731,\" Zhou Ze said, getting straight to the point.\n\nTang Shi wasn't particularly surprised. She changed the subject and continued to ask, \"What was the reason you wanted me to stop them from excavating?\"\n\n\"Why did you come here?\" Zhou Ze didn't rush to answer her question.\n\n\"You dreamed your way back to hell, and someone saw you. She noticed something was wrong with you and told him. He then told me to come over and check on you, saying something might happen.\"\n\nWhile Zhou Ze was still trying to parse in his head just who \"he\" and \"she\" were,\nTang Shi nudged Zhou Ze's calf with her sandaled foot and urged:\n\"You still haven't answered my previous question.\"\n\nZhou Ze sighed,\npointed at the construction site ahead, and said:\n\"I'm buried down there.\"\n\n\"...\" Tang Shi.\n\n\"...\" Lao Dao.\n\n***\n\n\"Boss, you're really... heheh. Just this morning I saw a post on Weibo. It said an archaeologist was excavating a tomb and halfway through, discovered it was his own family's ancestral grave,\" Lao Dao said from the side.\n\n\"You believe that joke? I saw that one years ago,\" Tang Shi said flatly.\n\n\"Oh.\" Lao Dao shrugged, then pointed at Zhou Ze. \"You can't be saying the boss was just kidding with us, telling us a joke, can you?\"\n\nTang Shi said no more. Instead, she swept a playful smile over Zhou Ze. \"I never would have guessed. You have such an impressive background. Past lives and all that... not just anyone gets to have one. It's usually a privilege reserved for big shots.\nOr perhaps, this isn't really a past life, but a physical body you used before?\"\n\nTang Shi moved closer to Zhou Ze, squeezed his shoulder, and continued:\n\"If you can switch once, why not twice? The last time was an accident, but since it succeeded, it means it could have succeeded before.\"\n\nJust then, Zhang Yanfeng saw Zhou Ze and walked over.\n\n\"The machinery broke down,\" Zhang Yanfeng said directly.\n\n\"Mm.\"\n\n\"Fortunately, after you called me, I went to report to my superiors. I told them what's underneath is likely a former Japanese military bacteriological research institute, and that blind excavation could lead to the leakage of toxic gas or something similar, endangering the nearby residents. The higher-ups have already decided to suspend the excavation until expert teams from Beijing and Shanghai can come and inspect it.\"\n\nZhou Ze looked at Zhang Yanfeng with some surprise. \"You can hold back?\"\n\n\"I'm a police officer. I have to be responsible for the lives and safety of the people,\" Zhang Yanfeng replied.\n\nPutting himself in the other man's shoes, if Zhou Ze were Zhang Yanfeng, he probably wouldn't have been able to resist. He would have ignored all consequences and urged them to start digging immediately.\n\nA psychological shadow that had tormented him for twenty years wasn't something one could just let go of.\n\n\"So that means, until tomorrow at least, this place is safe?\" Zhou Ze confirmed again.\n\nZhang Yanfeng nodded. \"The expert teams can't get here until tomorrow.\"\n\nZhou Ze relaxed,\nbut very quickly,\nhis expression changed.\n\nBecause with a *click*,\nZhang Yanfeng had taken out a pair of handcuffs, cuffed one of Zhou Ze's hands, and cuffed the other end to his own. The two men were now handcuffed together.\n\n\"What's the meaning of this?\" Zhou Ze asked, gesturing at the handcuffs.\n\n\"I can hold back, and you have to hold back too. Don't think I don't know you were definitely planning to find a chance to go down there tonight.\nI'm sorry, my duty doesn't allow for even the slightest chance of an accident here. I'm bending the rules this time, restricting your personal freedom. After the expert team arrives tomorrow and takes over, you can file a complaint against me at the station. I'm willing to accept the disciplinary action.\"\n\nZhou Ze licked his lips, forcefully suppressing the urge to snap the handcuffs with his fingernails and show Officer Zhang what real power looked like.\nBecause when he thought about it, the man's actions, from a moral and professional standpoint, were truly irreproachable, even admirable.\n\nBoss Zhou still decided to persuade him with reason,³\nstating directly:\n\"Trust me, I'm very familiar with what's down there.\"\n\nZhang Yanfeng let out a dry laugh,\nclearly unconvinced.\n\n\"I've lived down there for eighty years.\"\n***\n**Footnotes:**\n1.  `嚶嚶嚶 (yīng yīng yīng)`: Onomatopoeia for a soft, whimpering sound.

Even if those experts come tomorrow, it won't be as effective as me going down.\"\n\nZhang Yanfeng remained silent, just quietly puffing out smoke rings.\n\n\"There's no reason for me to lie to you, really.\"\n\n\"Beneath us is a former Japanese bacterial research lab. Can you be certain that going down there without authorization won't cause a leak of hazardous gases?\" Zhang Yanfeng said in a low voice. \"Do you know just how many people live in this vicinity?\"\n\n\"I can tell you with certainty that if the situation below is the worst-case scenario, once things get out of hand, the damage will be far greater than that caused by a gas leak.\"\n\nThinking of that mangled body, which in the end couldn't even control itself... if it were to reawaken, the consequences would be truly terrifying.\n\n\"You could have knocked me out.\"\n\nZhang Yanfeng threw his cigarette butt on the ground and stomped it out.\n\n\"What?\" Zhou Ze was taken aback.\n\n\"I've been waiting for you to knock me out. Of course, I would have resisted, because that's my duty. But I believe someone like you... has the ability to knock me out even with me resisting. When that time comes, whatever you want to do, I won't be able to stop you.\"\n\n\"Why are you so stubborn?\" Zhou Ze said, a bit helplessly.\n\n\"The stubborn one isn't me, it's you.\"\n\nZhang Yanfeng pointed toward Tang Shi and Lao Dao, who were still waiting under the streetlight ahead.\n\n\"That girl, she's killed people, hasn't she?\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't answer.\n\n\"I knew it the first moment I saw her. Heh, I used to be a soldier, then a criminal detective. I've been in this line of work for many years and have seen my share of vicious people. The look in that girl's eyes... I knew right away. She's killed, and she's the type who thinks nothing of human life. If I didn't believe you, I could have called for backup back at the station, surrounded her, and run a background check.\"\n\nZhou Ze smiled. \"You wouldn't find anything.\"\n\nZhang Yanfeng glanced at Zhou Ze, somewhat surprised.\n\n\"There are many things in this world that can't be found through investigation. Really. Back when you arrested me, you couldn't find anything on me either, could you? But I can tell you this for sure: over the past year, I've sent who knows how many people to hell.\"\n\n\"Then why are you still willing to sit here with me for so long?\" Zhang Yanfeng asked, a bit curious.\n\nThe relationship between the two had been constantly changing. At first, Zhou Ze was a suspect and Zhang Yanfeng was a police officer. Later, they were both \"inmates,\" and now, they were more like friends from different circles who held a certain admiration for each other.\n\n\"First, it's not the middle of the night yet. It's still early.\n\n\"Second, I think you're a good cop, and I'm willing to waste a little time on you.\"\n\n\"Should I feel honored by that?\"\n\nZhou Ze stood up, forcing Zhang Yanfeng to stand up with him.\n\n\"I believe that there are more good people than bad in this world. I've met a few good cops before, the kind who truly adhere to their principles in every sense of the word. I respect them, so I respect you now, too. So, I hope you won't be pedantic this time. You can come down with me. You have chains on your leg, too. If I'm not mistaken, one of your ancestors probably died down there.\"\n\n\"I looked into it. I had a great-uncle who was said to have joined the army during the war of resistance, but there was no news of him after that. My family tried to find out what happened, but they never could.\"\n\n\"Come down with me,\" Zhou Ze invited.\n\nZhang Yanfeng pulled out his gun.\n\nHe pointed it at Zhou Ze's back.\n\n\"I'm not clear on your identity. To be honest, I'm afraid to be clear on it. You might think my actions are pedantic and stubborn, but I'm sorry. My past life and work experience have taught me that sometimes, you truly have to be stubborn and persistent. You can't retreat a single step.\"\n\n\"Mm, I respect your...\"\n\n*Thwack!*\n\nIt wasn't a gunshot.\n\nIt was a rock hitting the back of Zhang Yanfeng's neck.\n\nZhang Yanfeng slumped unconscious onto the bench.\n\nTang Shi walked over, her face showing clear impatience.\n\n\"He already told you to knock him out. What are you still wasting time talking for? Should I go get you two some tea and a DV camera so you can continue to spread your positive energy dialogue?\"\n\nZhou Ze extended his fingernails, easily snapping the handcuffs, and sighed. \"There's no getting through to you. Besides White Rabbit creamy candy, what else can that brain of yours possibly hold?\"\n\nTang Shi's gaze hardened, and she seemed ready to lash out, but in the end, she controlled herself. Turning around, she walked directly toward the construction site.\n\nLao Dao chuckled to himself on the side, thinking that ever since his boss learned how to go full Musou,¹ he really stood up straighter when facing Miss Tang Shi. The same went for how he treated the little loli.\n\nSure enough. For a man with power not to get corrupted? That's like a sow climbing a tree and turning into a demon.²\n\nThe three of them arrived at the construction site. The area had been sealed off, but that obviously wasn't going to stop them.\n\n\"Which spot?\" Tang Shi asked coldly.\n\n\"Right here. Just dig down. Try not to make too much noise,\" Zhou Ze said, pointing at his feet.\n\nSoon, the rocks and timber at their feet began to levitate on their own, stacking themselves quietly to the side. With the foundation from the daytime excavation, the rest was actually quite simple. Besides, Tang Shi's \"work efficiency\" was truly no slower than heavy machinery.\n\nBoss Zhou had previously thought that if he were to start a construction company, the profits would be considerable. With the immensely strong Bai Yingying as a laborer and Tang Shi acting as heavy machinery—one didn't need to eat, the other didn't consume electricity—it would be almost all profit with no costs.\n\nAfter a while, a passage wide enough for one person was cleared. Zhou Ze went down first, Tang Shi was second, and Lao Dao was third.\n\nThere was no smell of poison gas below, only a musty, sealed-up odor.\n\nFollowing the steps down, he used his phone as a flashlight.\n\nThe view ahead was reasonably clear.\n\nLao Dao, walking at the very back, felt his soles getting a bit sticky. He muttered, \"What is this stuff on the ground?\"\n\n\"Bloodstains,\" Tang Shi replied.\n\n\"*Hiss...*\"\n\nLao Dao didn't dare run his mouth any further and stuck close behind the two powerhouses.\n\nPushing open an iron door ahead that was so rusted and corroded it was barely recognizable, they were met with the sight of a familiar cell block hallway, with cells on both sides.\n\nZhou Ze still remembered the scene from his dream, walking through here with shackles on his feet, while the people in the nearby cells watched him with envious eyes.\n\nPassing through here again, he shone his flashlight inside. In the cells within his line of sight were shriveled, desiccated corpses.\n\nAfter the Japanese blew up the entrance, they must have never intended to reopen it. Later, perhaps due to the war situation or other reasons, and right up until Japan's defeat, this place was forgotten.\n\nThe people originally imprisoned in the cells were trapped and died right here.\n\n\"They didn't starve to death.\"\n\nTang Shi used her telekinesis to snap two of the bars, then even crouched down to examine a body. \"There must have been a lot of dust when the passage was blown up. These people died of suffocation, not because you left them for dead back then.\"\n\n\"Thanks.\"\n\nZhou Ze took a deep breath.\n\n\"I take back what I said earlier about your brain only holding White Rabbit creamy candy.\"\n\n\"What about you? Where are you?\" Tang Shi asked. \"That body you mentioned.\"\n\nZhou Ze pointed ahead.\n\n\"Let's not delay. You can pay your respects tomorrow.\"\n\nWith that, Tang Shi took the initiative and walked forward.\n\nAfter passing through a corridor ahead, the space immediately opened up as they entered the laboratory area.\n\nTang Shi stopped in her tracks. Lao Dao caught up and stopped with her. Then, Lao Dao covered his mouth and bent over, his body convulsing as he tried to suppress his dry heaves.\n\nZhou Ze was the last to arrive. The scene before him didn't surprise him much; after all, in his dream, he had witnessed the most vivid, real-time version of it.\n\nBut now, in the laboratory area, the various grisly deaths, the inhuman ways of dying, the exaggerated and artistically explosive scenes—after eighty years had passed, they had been coated with the dust of time, no longer as fresh and shocking as they were at the beginning.\n\nOf course, for those who hadn't seen the original version, this scene was already enough to be called hell on earth.\n\n\"The ones who died here were basically all Japanese soldiers and researchers. They deserved it,\" Zhou Ze explained.\n\n\"That may be so, but Boss, this scene is way too R-rated. I really can't take it.\"\n\nLao Dao wiped the corner of his mouth, his face pale.\n\n\"You'd better clean up your own vomit on the ground, lest the expert team comes down tomorrow and takes your sample back for research,\" Zhou Ze reminded him.\n\nFinished, Zhou Ze looked at Tang Shi beside him and asked, \"Are you okay?\"\n\nTang Shi shook her head.\n\nZhou Ze was a bit puzzled. Logically, her psychological resilience should be higher than Lao Dao's.\n\nWhen Zhou Ze took two more steps forward and saw Tang Shi's face, he discovered that she was actually smiling, her face revealing a look of excitement and appreciation.\n\n\"Uh...\"\n\nTang Shi looked at Zhou Ze and said, \"It's hard to imagine that your taste and style used to be so refined. This scene, these bodies, these states of death, including the patterns constructed from blood... really, it's very beautiful.\"\n\n\"...\" Lao Dao.\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze.\n\n\"*Crack...*\"\n\nA clear, crisp sound suddenly came from the depths of the laboratory.\n\nZhou Ze's gaze shot toward that location.\n\nThat laboratory... if he remembered correctly, was the area where the safe was kept!\n\nTang Shi licked her lips. She appeared a bit nervous, but she couldn't hide her excitement. She said slowly, \"You see? He agrees with me, too.\"\n\n---\n**Footnotes:**\n¹ A reference to the *Dynasty Warriors* (真・三國無雙) video game series, where a \"Musou attack\" is an ultimate move that clears the screen of enemies.

    "content": "Unlike Tang Shi's excitement, Zhou Ze now felt a chill down his spine, because Zhou Ze had witnessed the scene of that broken body wandering through the research institute, painting a masterpiece of art with death.\n\nThat leisurely stroll, that unhurried pace…\n\n…it was just short of laying out nine large copper coins in front of you and asking how many ways there are to write the character for \"death.\"¹\n\nIf other people saying, \"When I go crazy, even I'm scared of myself,\" is just a joke,\n\nthen for Boss Zhou right now,\n\nit was truly the most fitting description.\n\nThey were clearly one and the same person,\n\nbut in his own heart, he harbored an extreme sense of dread toward that other one.\n\n\"Actually... you've been overlooking a problem this whole time.\"\n\nTang Shi said as she slowly walked forward.\n\n\"What problem?\"\n\n\"That is, the you of the past was you;\n\nthe you of the present is also you.\n\nSince the present you is you, then the past you is no longer you.\"\n\nThe old Daoist priest at the side was counting the many \"you\"s. To be honest, he hadn't understood at all what Tang Shi meant, and at the same time, a doubt began to form in his mind:\n\nThese ghosts are really different from ordinary people.\n\nIn such a gloomy and terrifying place,\n\nthey're actually discussing philosophy.\n\nTo be honest, the old Daoist priest was now regretting coming down with them. It would have been much better to stay up top and keep watch. It was already creepy enough down here, and now they were talking in riddles.\n\nZhou Ze, however, understood. Tang Shi meant that the scenes he saw in his dreams were of his past self killing people.\n\nIn that case,\n\neighty years later,\n\nhe had become Zhou Ze. He had lost many memories and only remembered that he was Zhou Ze, but his soul had been passed down, which was also why he could become a Jiangshi.²\n\nTherefore,\n\nit was impossible for him and that broken body to exist in the same era. Even if that other one was here now, it was merely a physical body.\n\nBecause the soul of that broken figure who had wreaked havoc and created his art of death here eighty years ago had already become his own present-day soul.\n\nSo,\n\nwith only an empty shell left here, the threat level was certainly not as great as it was back then.\n\n\"Don't you care at all about your own past? In any case, I haven't sensed any urgency from you to know your true identity or learn about your past.\"\n\nTang Shi asked, stepping around a desiccated corpse on the floor.\n\n\"I only remember that I am me, that I am Zhou Ze. I think that's good enough,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\n\"Heh, what a great attitude.\"\n\n\"My bookstore has plenty of stories where the protagonist, to uncover the mystery of their identity and find the forgotten truth, goes on a journey full of deep-seated bitterness and resentment. But that's so exhausting.\"\n\n\"Very reasonable,\" Tang Shi nodded.\n\n\"Actually, the most crucial point is, if I were to find my past self, I'm afraid I would no longer be the me I am now. To the current me, that would be almost the same as being 'killed'.\"\n\nListening from behind, the old Daoist priest was truly and utterly confused.\n\nDamn it all,\n\nhave this shameless pair gotten addicted to chatting?\n\nAnd about such profound things, too.\n\nFinally,\n\nthey reached the door of that laboratory. The laboratory door was closed.\n\n\"In the end, did he trap himself back in the safe?\" Tang Shi asked.\n\n\"I don't know.\"\n\n\"Creeaak...\"\n\nThe decaying door slowly opened, emitting a piercing screech that echoed endlessly throughout the research institute. Echoes even came from some distant corners, as if the wailing souls of the dead were still crying out in agony.\n\n\"Miss Tang, could we please just open the door with our hands this time? The way you do it… this humble priest finds it awfully creepy.\"\n\nThe old Daoist priest muttered softly from the side.\n\nTang Shi looked at the old Daoist priest and shrugged.\n\n\"If I told you I didn't use psychokinesis just now, would you find it even creepier?\"\n\n\"...\" said the old Daoist priest.\n\nTang Shi didn't rush inside. Instead, she scanned her surroundings again. She kept feeling as if something was hiding in a dark corner, watching them.\n\n\"Zhou Ze, I think we've been overlooking the most fundamental problem all along. My apologies, I've never handled a case as complex as yours, so I neglected to think of it.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"That is, since the present you is here, and you are Zhou Ze. Doesn't that mean something must have happened to the one who remained here during these eighty years?\n\nOtherwise,\n\nwhere did *you* come from?\"\n\n\"Clang!\"\n\nJust as Tang Shi's voice fell,\n\na dull thud came from inside the laboratory.\n\nTang Shi's gaze hardened. Forgetting her discussion with Zhou Ze, she walked directly into the laboratory.\n\nThe safe door was already closed. Dust still hung in the air around it. On top of the safe, there was a hole about the size of a human face.\n\nAnd below it lay a desiccated corpse that was nothing but white bones. The skull was a purer white than the rest of the skeleton, looking as if it had just had its teeth cleaned.\n\nThe old Daoist priest hid behind Zhou Ze, clutching the paper talisman in his hand, but his eyes kept darting over the dried corpse as he asked Zhou Ze:\n\n\"Boss, we could take that skull back with us. It's like a work of art.\"\n\n\"You can take it back if you want.\" Zhou Ze had no particular feelings about it.\n\nTang Shi glanced at Zhou Ze, signaling that she was about to open the safe.\n\nZhou Ze nodded and stepped to the side, preparing himself to provide support no matter what happened.\n\n\"Screee... screee...\"\n\nA faint scraping sound came from the safe, as if something inside was pulling on the door, preventing Tang Shi from opening it with her psychokinesis.\n\nTang Shi frowned slightly,\n\nand increased her power.\n\n\"BOOM!\"\n\nWith a deafening bang,\n\nthe entire safe flew into the air.\n\nYes,\n\nit flew into the air.\n\nZhou Ze immediately pushed the old Daoist priest aside and then dodged himself, narrowly avoiding being crushed by the safe.\n\n\"Sssssssssssssssssss...\"\n\nThe safe door opened on its own.\n\nFrom within suddenly scurried out several enormous rats. Each one was as large as a small cat, their eyes gleaming with a dark light. After emerging, they showed no fear of the people, instead gathering in front of them as if ready to attack at any moment.\n\nAnd where the safe had originally been, a large hole had appeared, sunken into the ground. White smoke still lingered there.\n\nTwo shards of glass on the floor were manipulated by Tang Shi and swept directly toward the large rats. In an instant, flesh and blood flew everywhere, and the rats suffered heavy casualties. The remaining ones were immediately terrified and scurried back into the hole.\n\n\"What just happened?\" Zhou Ze asked Tang Shi, glancing at the fragmented rat corpses on the floor.\n\n\"Something down below was fighting me for control.\"\n\nTang Shi didn't hurry toward the hole, but instead looked at the surrounding walls.\n\n\"Zhou Ze, I don't think the problem now is as simple as dealing with the body you left behind. There's really something else here.\"\n\nJust as Tang Shi's voice fell,\n\nthe walls of the laboratory suddenly began to crack. Root-like tentacles abruptly swept out, creating a whistling sound in the air, carrying immense force!\n\nTang Shi spread her hands, and her psychokinesis formed an invisible wall, blocking most of the tentacles.\n\nOne tentacle pierced through from another direction. Just as it was about to touch Tang Shi, it was seized by Zhou Ze, who then sliced it open with his fingernails. Instantly, a pool of foul-smelling liquid appeared in Zhou Ze's palm.\n\nAt that very moment, rustling sounds also came from other parts of the research institute, as if countless vines were extending toward them.\n\n\"Crash, crash, crash...\"\n\nThe nearby glass was also shattered, and those vines quickly blocked all the exits and crevices of the laboratory. They didn't attack, but began to secrete a viscous, milky-white liquid. This white liquid had an extremely strong corrosive smell; when it landed on the ground, it sizzled like splashed sulfuric acid.\n\n\"Damn it all, what the hell is this thing?\" The old Daoist priest's body began to tremble with fear.\n\nThe scene felt as if they had walked into the stomach of a man-eating flower, and now it was preparing to digest them.\n\n\"It should be a plant affected by this place.\" Tang Shi said, frowning slightly. \"No, it's a demon. I thought it was strange before. There isn't the slightest trace of ghostly energy here, but I always felt like something was watching me. It's a demon!\"\n\n\"Splat... splat...\"\n\nThe milky-white liquid all around began to multiply, gradually closing in on Zhou Ze and the others.\n\n\"It's trying to drive us into that hole.\"\n\nZhou Ze pointed to the place where the rats had just scurried back into.\n\n\"Such a grand display. We've come all this way, and you won't come out to meet us yourself? You expect us to come and pay our respects to you?\"\n\nTang Shi closed her eyes,\n\nthen slowly opened them again.\n\nDeep within her pupils, a purple light flickered. Her entire body seemed to float off the ground—of course, not very high, only a few centimeters.\n\nAnd then,\n\nthe wind began to rise.\n\nIn an instant, all the white liquid surging across the floor levitated, flying back in reverse and splashing all over the tentacles.\n\nThe liquid, which had clearly been secreted from those tentacles, now had an equally damaging effect on them. In a flash, the dense mass of tentacles began to writhe and melt frantically, then rapidly retreated. The air filled with the strong smell of roasted gluten.\n\nTang Shi closed her eyes again,\n\ntook a deep breath,\n\nher body swaying slightly, but she forced herself to stand firm. She had just overexerted herself.\n\n\"Kacha... kacha... kacha... kacha...\"\n\nA clear scraping sound began to emanate from the hole, as if something was moving toward them.\n\nThat thing,\n\nwas coming.\n\nA shadow,\n\nslowly rose from the hole below,\n\nlike a human face.\n\nThe old Daoist priest took out his phone and shone its flashlight in that direction, his eyes immediately widening.\n\nAt the location of the hole,\n\nwhat was revealed,\n\nwas half of a human face.\n\nThe other half looked as if it had been sliced away with perfect smoothness, and it even had a strange sheen to it.\n\n---\n¹ A reference to a story about a scholar showing off his calligraphy, implying a methodical and almost arrogant display of deadly skill.\n² Jiangshi (殭屍) are a type of reanimated corpse, or \"hopping vampire,\" from Chinese folklore.",

    "content": "Half a face rose abruptly from the opening of the cave, and the surrounding temperature began to drop rapidly.\n\nZhou Ze subconsciously sucked in a sharp breath. The situation he had most feared had still come to pass.\n\nActually, Zhou Ze had considered it before. Since he was now Zhou Ze—regardless of soul or memory—it proved that in the eighty years from then to now, his original self, who had been kept in the research institute as a test subject by the Japanese, must have moved. Otherwise, he himself wouldn't exist.\n\nDid that mean this body might not be here anymore?\n\nBut Zhou Ze had been wrong.\n\nThe body was still here.\n\nAnd it had undergone a strange transformation.\n\nEarlier, Tang Shi had said there was a demon here.\n\nZhou Ze hadn't sensed a thing.\n\nHowever…\n\nA man’s reputation precedes him. Having seen this broken body go on a rampage in his dreams and witnessed its uncontrollable madness with his own eyes, Zhou Ze still felt a little apprehensive facing it now.\n\n\"Hum!\"\n\nA ripple spread out.\n\nThe single eye on that half-face opened. Within the orb was the same familiar emptiness; it seemed there was no eyeball to speak of. But in the next moment, clumps of what looked like straw roots shot out from the eye socket, gradually extending and even filling in the contour of the missing right half of the face. It made the face look, in a way, \"complete,\" but in reality, it appeared even more grotesque and discordant.\n\n\"Thump!\"\n\nA skeletal hand reached out from the edge, gripping the ground, and its body began to slowly haul itself up.\n\nIts movements were very slow, almost sluggish, like a puppet being manipulated by a clumsy apprentice, and one could even see the difficulty in its struggle.\n\nBut its aura was like an inborn trait, even though its body was broken, even though the soul that had once inhabited it had, through some unknown circumstances, ended up with Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Snap!\"\n\nIt climbed out of the cave, but in an instant, its body began to retreat uncontrollably, as if some invisible force was pressing down on it.\n\nA trail of sparks appeared on the ground, a testament to the intensity of the friction.\n\n\"Roar!\"\n\nIt opened its mouth. The remaining half of its mouth gaped open in a wildly exaggerated and terrifying manner, while the other half, woven from straw stalks, instantly disintegrated. It let out a silent roar, clearly enraged by the situation.\n\n\"Plop...\"\n\nZhou Ze and Tang Shi didn't react at all. They just watched as the mangled body, which had just struggled to climb out, knelt back on the ground and was then forcibly dragged back into the cave.\n\nThe whole scene was somewhat comical: a grand, awe-inspiring entrance, followed by being inexplicably dragged back down, like an actor whose curtain falls before he can even speak his first line.\n\nHowever, this turn of events also dissipated much of the pressure on Zhou Ze's group, lifting a great deal of the gravity that had been weighing on their minds.\n\n\"Boss, is that... the old you?\" the old Daoist asked Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"Looks like this body has a problem. Grass is literally growing on its head.\"\n\nZhou Ze couldn't be bothered to respond, but unexpectedly, the old Daoist got hooked on his own monologue and continued:\n\n\"Boss, I feel like your luck has really hit rock bottom. Your own grave keeps getting robbed. First, your corpse from your last life was ground to dust and eaten like black sesame paste.\n\n\"And now this corpse is being used as a planter. Tsk tsk, Boss, my profession is feng shui for graves. Next time you plan on dying, find me. I'll definitely pick a safe spot for you...\"\n\nThe old Daoist grew more and more excited, but upon seeing Zhou Ze's glare, his voice trailed off.\n\n\"Go up ahead and see what's down there,\" Zhou Ze said to the old Daoist.\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\nThe old Daoist was startled.\n\n*Holy crap,*\n\n*I'm just a bystander,¹ responsible for looting the bodies and shouting 'Nice one!' on the sidelines.*\n\n*You want me to go check it out?*\n\nThe old Daoist looked toward Tang Shi, hoping Miss Tang would veto this order, which was clearly a case of personal revenge.\n\nBut to his surprise, Tang Shi simply nodded in agreement.\n\n\"Good idea.\"\n\n\"...\" said the old Daoist.\n\nThe old Daoist had no choice but to bite the bullet and slowly walk forward.\n\n\"Don't worry too much. That thing just now was obviously restricted here. That's why, over the past eighty years, it's clearly mutated, and may have even had its nest usurped by something, but it still can't leave this place.\n\n\"Your Boss and I are 'ghosts.' You're a living person. You won't provoke whatever might be down there.\"\n\nTang Shi explained from behind him.\n\nHearing this, the old Daoist felt much more at ease. He crept closer, shone his flashlight down, and then quickly peeked over the edge.\n\n\"Boss, it looks like a well down there. There's water, too,\" the old Daoist called out.\n\nOnly then did Zhou Ze and Tang Shi approach. Sure enough, it wasn't a cave below, but a well.\n\n\"What now? Does anyone know how your soul got out back then?\" Tang Shi crouched down, brushing her hair back in frustration. \"Or, we could just leave. Let the expert team come down tomorrow. Once they find this place, let them figure out a way to blow it up with explosives. It can't escape anyway.\"\n\n\"You think they'll blow it up?\" Zhou Ze retorted. \"If they find this body?\"\n\n\"Hmm?\"\n\n\"A body that's clearly dead but can still move... That transcends national borders, transcends ideology. They'll definitely be unable to resist taking it back as a research subject.\"\n\n\"Isn't that good, too? You can make your own contribution to modern medicine,\" Tang Shi said with an indifferent air.\n\n\"You're very beautiful,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Thank you.\"\n\n\"But do you have any idea how many young men, due to a lack of money or opportunity, have nowhere to vent their daily pent-up physiological needs? Why don't you go help them?\"\n\nA purple light flashed in Tang Shi's eyes. It was clear she was angry.\n\nShe remembered the old Zhou Ze wasn't like this.\n\nIndeed.\n\nPeople change.\n\nEspecially when you realize your own strength no longer requires you to grovel before the person in front of you. This is only human nature, and the ones who have the hardest time adjusting are usually the ones who used to be on top.\n\n\"Hey, hey, you two, stop fighting, stop fighting! The water below is starting to boil.\"\n\nThe old Daoist pointed down. He knew Tang Shi's temper and understood his boss's anger after having his first corpse desecrated. Now, finding that his other body also had problems, it was surely hard for him to accept.\n\nThe water in the well began to boil with a \"gurgle, gurgle.\"\n\nThen,\n\nThe water level began to rise rapidly, as if an underground spring had burst forth.\n\nIn an instant,\n\nThe water had not only flooded the cave but was beginning to spread outward, its pace and volume more terrifying than a burst fire hydrant.\n\nCountless rats were once again swept up, followed closely by a mass of straw stalks and branches.\n\nThe water gushed faster and faster. They could even hear what sounded like a cry from below, and the current's speed increased severalfold.\n\nIn a moment, the water level in the research institute was already up to a person's waist.\n\nTang Shi's body instinctively retreated, putting some distance between herself and the rising water, but in the next second, a hand suddenly grabbed her ankle from beneath the surface.\n\n\"Swish!\"\n\nTwo shards of glass instantly sliced into the water, but they only saw the current churn violently as Tang Shi was pulled upside down and dragged under.\n\nOnce underwater, Tang Shi saw that the broken body, which had climbed out and been dragged back, had somehow silently crawled out again.\n\nAn icy, bone-piercing pain radiated from her ankle. The surrounding water, under the control of her psychic power, frantically battered the corpse, but it was like a heavy steel plate, remaining completely unmoved!\n\n\"Splash!\"\n\nJust then,\n\nZhou Ze plunged into the water, lunging directly at the mangled body. The nails of his ten fingers dug mercilessly into its skull, showing no mercy just because it was his former body.\n\n\"Roar!\"\n\nThe mangled body opened its mouth, releasing Tang Shi's ankle, then clamped both its hands tightly around Zhou Ze's neck. The two of them became entangled, grappling with each other.\n\n\"Gurgle... gurgle... gurgle...\"\n\nSounds began to emanate from beneath the water's surface again. Meanwhile, the old Daoist was standing on a desk, his head nearly touching the ceiling. Seeing Tang Shi surface, he immediately reached out and pulled her over.\n\n\"Where's the boss? Where's the boss?\"\n\nTang Shi's face was grim. Ignoring her still-bleeding ankle, she plunged both hands into the water and let out a sharp cry.\n\n\"Whoosh...\"\n\nThe water that had nearly filled the entire laboratory was instantly split apart, revealing the figures of Zhou Ze and the mangled body.\n\nThe body was relentlessly pulling at Zhou Ze, but Zhou Ze's fingernails remained dug deep into its skull.\n\nHowever, it was clear that the mangled body's target wasn't Zhou Ze at all. It was still stubbornly moving in one direction—towards Tang Shi.\n\nIn that instant,\n\nIn the back of her mind,\n\nTang Shi had a premonition.\n\nWhat that thing wanted wasn't Zhou Ze, who was inextricably linked to it, but her!\n\nWhat on earth was going on?\n\n\"Whoosh... whoosh...\"\n\nThe water began to swirl rapidly. The surface that had covered the entire lab began to recede quickly, like a full bathtub when the plug is pulled.\n\nThe massive whirlpool itself exerted a natural suction. Furthermore, having lost the protection and cover of the water, the mangled body, which had once again climbed out of the hole, felt that terrifying force of repulsion and confinement anew. Its body, full of extreme unwillingness, began to slide rapidly backward until it fell back into the opening.\n\nAnd Zhou Ze, whom it had been gripping tightly,\n\nwas not spared this time.\n\nWith the sound of a stone falling into water,\n\nZhou Ze and the mangled body fell into the well together.\n\nAll around, everything was perfectly calm and still.\n\nThere wasn't even a single drop of water left on the ground.\n\nIt was still dry.\n\n***\n\n**Footnotes:**\n\n¹ \"Just a bystander\" is a translation of the Chinese slang *dǎ jiàng yóu* (打醬油), literally \"to buy soy sauce,\" meaning one is uninvolved in the main events.

    "content": "\"Gurgle... gurgle...\"\n\nZhou Ze remembered sinking into water several times before, but those times were either in hell or in a dream, especially when he passed through that pool where he'd met the faceless woman.\n\nBut this time was different. The feeling of suffocation and crisis was so intense. From the moment he was dragged down, he knew his life was on a countdown.\n\nHe didn't regret running to save Tang Shi, even though the two had just argued. Boss Zhou couldn't stand that hag's temper either; it was as if she looked down on every man in the world except for that \"blind man.\"\n\nBut no matter what, Tang Shi had come all the way from Shanghai specifically to help him. It would have been too unconscionable for him to just stand by and watch.\n\nHe hadn't thought too much about it at the time, just like back at the burning movie theater, he hadn't thought twice before running straight into the fire to save people.\n\nMost importantly, although Tang Shi seemed very powerful at times, her physical body was a major weakness. Once an enemy got close, there was little she could do. He, at least, still had a fighting chance.\n\n\"Gurgle... gurgle...\"\n\nBubbles continuously escaped from his mouth and nose. The air in his lungs was running out.\n\nBut the mutilated body, with only half a face remaining, still held him in a death grip. Vines formed from grass stems continuously interwove, completing the other half of its face.\n\nThe original left side of the face remained calm, but the green right side was clearly hideous, as if filled with a monstrous resentment. It didn't look like a person at all, but rather the manifestation of another consciousness.\n\nThe other party seemed to hate him. Was it because he'd stopped it from catching Tang Shi?\n\nAnd what was its purpose for wanting to drag Tang Shi down here?\n\n\"Plunge...\"\n\nHis captor pushed him further down. It didn't seem to be that deep—only about a dozen meters from the cave entrance to the bottom. But down below, Zhou Ze saw an old tree root entrenched there. The root wasn't as large as he'd imagined; on the contrary, it seemed quite \"slender,\" yet it also looked exceptionally exquisite. An androgynous face was continuously twisting in the middle of the root.\n\nOn this face, Zhou Ze saw an immense amount of resentment.\n\nThe feeling was hard to describe. It was like a young, virile man being fed a massive dose of potent aphrodisiacs, having his hands and feet bound, and then being forced to watch adult films. Every second would be excruciating torment, not to mention this thing had probably been tormented for many years.\n\n\"Thump!\"\n\nZhou Ze was slammed down next to the tree root. The face on the root looked at Zhou Ze. At first, it showed anger and disdain, but slowly, new emotions appeared on its face.\n\nShock,\nFear,\nTerror,\nThen confusion,\nAnd finally,\nIt turned to ecstasy!\n\nSichuan opera's face-changing is world-renowned, but this root's facial expressions were even more vivid.\n\n\"It's... you...\"\n\nA voice actually came from within the root. Heaven knows how the sound traveled through the water, but Zhou Ze could somehow hear it, though it was a little unclear and noisy.\n\n*You recognize me?* Zhou Ze thought.\n\nThen Zhou Ze felt a little embarrassed.\n\nGenuinely embarrassed.\n\nLook,\n\nThis thing had recognized him,\n\nBut he himself didn't even recognize himself.\n\n\"Zzz... zzz...\"\n\nThe root's vines began to tremble with excitement. Clearly, it hadn't recognized Zhou Ze at first, which was why it had chosen to grab Tang Shi. As for its purpose in grabbing her, Zhou Ze could now guess some of it. It wanted to move!\n\nIt was trapped here.\n\nEven though its vines controlled that soulless, mutilated body, it was, for some unknown reason, also nailed firmly to this spot. It probably wanted to capture Tang Shi because controlling her might have offered a chance to escape.\n\nBut now, Zhou Ze could sense that this root had already lost its mind. In most movies and books, tree spirits were depicted as calm and wise, usually appearing as old grandfathers. Yet, the thing before him was like someone high on drugs, breakdancing.\n\n\"You... die...\"\n\nThe voice came again,\nFilled with a sinister and venomous hatred!\n\nAt the same time, the mutilated body began to tear at him even more frantically. This time, it was serious!\n\nA heavy sense of crisis washed over him.\n\nBefore, the enemy had probably intended to save energy by just dragging him underwater to drown, letting him die on his own.\n\nNow, it wanted to kill him with its own hands, to experience the pleasure of revenge.\n\nAs for Zhou Ze, he had actually been waiting and observing. After all, unless it was a truly desperate moment, Boss Zhou really didn't want to enter his zombie state. It meant he would have to lie in bed for another half a month after returning.\n\nBut this time, he had no choice. Staring at the creature practically face-to-face with him, Zhou Ze opened his mouth. Two fangs grew out rapidly. At the same time, his body began to dehydrate quickly, shriveling up. Deep within his eyes, a green light shone, and his entire temperament changed, becoming frenzied and unrestrained!\n\n\"Roar!\"\n\n\"Roar!\"\n\nThe two of them opened their mouths and roared together, like provoked tigers declaring their own majesty!\n\nIf the scene were to freeze here, a careful observer would even notice an extreme similarity in their expressions as they roared.\n\n\"BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!!!!!!\"\n\nA series of terrifying, explosive impacts came from below.\n\nZhou Ze was like a maddened, hungry wolf, desperately tearing at the mutilated yet incredibly tough body before him. It was clear that Zhou Ze had the absolute advantage.\n\nAfter all,\n\nThe mutilated body in front of him was no longer the one who had wreaked havoc eighty years ago. It was just a former shell, and a broken one at that. Zhou Ze, on the other hand, possessed the former inner core!\n\nThe mutilated body was kicked away. From all around, countless vines suddenly swept in. As fine as strands of hair, they began to entangle Zhou Ze's body.\n\n\"Thump!\"\n\nZhou Ze's body trembled, and the tree root trembled as well, but it still managed to restrain him.\n\nThe mutilated body that had just been kicked away charged back again. Opening its mouth, it bit directly into Zhou Ze's neck. It threw itself on top of Zhou Ze, utterly crazed.\n\n\"You... die...\"\n\nThe root trembled with excitement.\n\nThis scene excited it even more than the prospect of its own escape. It would even be willing to trade its freedom for the chance to completely destroy that person's soul!\n\nThis person,\n\nHad deceived it back then,\n\nCausing it to miss its chance for transformation and leaving it trapped here, unable to move from this tiny spot.\n\nThis hatred,\nWas higher than the sky, deeper than the sea!\n\n\"Fate... retribution...\"\n\nThe other sneered.\n\nZhou Ze's body trembled ceaselessly, as if trying to resist, but the fine vines covering him were like the most terrifying iron chains in the world, locking him down completely.\n\nThe root was using its own power,\nControlling and suppressing Zhou Ze.\n\nThis was the first time since gaining his \"Musou\" ability that Zhou Ze had ever been suppressed. In the past, he had always been unstoppable, killing gods and buddhas who stood in his way.¹\n\nOf course, the current Zhou Ze had completely lost the ability to think. In his mind, only the emotion called \"madness\" remained.\n\nThis stalemate lasted for about ten minutes.\nThe root began to wilt, clearly exhausting its strength, but the weakening of Zhou Ze's aura was even more obvious.\n\nLast time, at General's Mountain, his physical body had nearly collapsed from being in the zombie state for too long. Because of that, the duration Zhou Ze could maintain the zombie state was now very, very short; he couldn't sustain it for long at all.\n\nThe muscles in Zhou Ze's neck, which had been completely tensed, now slackened. The mutilated body's fangs tore a chunk of flesh directly from his neck.\n\n\"Spltch...\"\n\nBlood began to diffuse into the water.\n\nA large hole was ripped in Zhou Ze's neck, and his head was now connected to his shoulders by little more than a sliver of skin and flesh.\n\nThe green light in his eyes slowly dimmed,\nAnd the strength of his resistance was fading.\n\nThe root grew even more excited. It even had the tattered body release Zhou Ze, instead using its own dense vines to pull his body over.\n\nIt couldn't move,\nBut it wanted to savor the final death throes of its enemy!\n\nThis was its happiest moment in sixty years!\n\nBesides the wound on his neck, blood also began to seep from other parts of Zhou Ze's body. Every time he entered the zombie state, his body would crack under the pressure, his skin splitting open.\n\nThis time,\nWas no exception.\n\n\"Heh heh... retribution... fate... heavenly punishment...\"\n\nThe root could only speak two characters at a time. At this moment, it was ceaselessly venting its inner fury and schadenfreude.\n\nWhat a wonderful thing!\nThe culprit who had tricked it sixty years ago, causing it to be locked here, unable to move a single step,\nHad actually delivered himself right to its doorstep after sixty years,\nAnd so weak, at that!\n\nThis was providence!\nThis was the heavens opening their eyes!\n\nAs a demon who once had a chance at transformation, it had been screwed over so, so badly by that guy.\n\nThe tattered body floated to the side, motionless. The former body was now controlled by the root, having become its most loyal puppet and enforcer.\n\n\"Retribution... fate... one... cycle...\"\n\nThe root watched Zhou Ze float before it, his life signs growing ever weaker, and waved its vines continuously, as if singing and dancing in celebration.\n\nIt wanted to watch him quietly,\nWatch him up close,\nWatch him die,\nWatch him die completely and utterly!\n\nHowever,\nAt that very moment,\nZhou Ze's eyes, which had long since dimmed, suddenly erupted with a blinding green light.\n\nPreviously, a large chunk of flesh had been torn from Zhou Ze's neck by the mutilated body, leaving his head attached by only a sliver of skin. But now, this very injury allowed him to whip his head around nearly three hundred degrees, smashing it directly into the root's face.\n\nHis two fangs pierced deep with vicious precision,\nTearing away the root's outer layer.\nHe opened his mouth,\nSwallowed the glowing green fruit from within, and began to chew slowly.\n\"Crunch... crunch...\"\n\nVery crunchy!\n\nThe root's body began to convulse.\nIt couldn't believe what was happening before its eyes.\n\n\"Waited for you... sixty years... you're finally... ripe...\"\n\nZhou Ze said slowly in a raspy voice, still chewing on the thing in his mouth:\n\n\"And...\nAfter sixty years...\nYou're still so...\nGullible.\"\n\n---\n¹\"Musou\" is a reference to the super-powered state in the Dynasty Warriors video game series. The original text uses \"無雙\" (Wushuang). \"Killing gods and buddhas who stood in his way\" is a literal translation of a Chinese idiom meaning \"to be utterly unstoppable.\"",

    "content": "I planted a seed,\n\n  At last a fruit has grown,\n\n  Today is a great day…\n\n  By now, the fruit had already been chewed to a pulp, transforming into a cyan-green mist that slowly seeped out from Zhou Ze's eyes, ears, mouth, and nose, before drifting down to envelop his torso.\n\n  Even though his neck had been nearly severed, Zhou Ze had continued to eat the fruit. Clearly, he knew it didn't need to be digested through the esophagus.\n\n  And the tree root, having lost the fruit that had been hidden in its deepest core, slowly began to wither. It was filled with intense unwillingness, with an indescribable resentment.\n\n  It never would have dreamed that this would be the final outcome.\n\n  Divine retribution,\n\n  Revenge,\n\n  Karma,\n\n  In the end, it all became bullshit. At least, for the tree root, that was certainly the case.\n\n  However,\n\n  Just then,\n\n  The mutilated body suddenly trembled again and charged directly at Zhou Ze. The old tree root used its last bit of life essence to fuel the fierce flames of vengeance. No matter what, it wanted Zhou Ze dead!\n\n  But,\n\n  The moment the mutilated body neared Zhou Ze, it abruptly stopped.\n\n  Not only did it stop,\n\n  It proactively reached out to support Zhou Ze's head, which had been about to fall off, allowing the green light to swirl around the wound.\n\n  \"This flesh… you thought… it was left… for… you?\"\n\n  A hint of mockery laced Zhou Ze's voice, as if he had already gained the upper hand in a game of Go and was now leisurely critiquing his opponent's moves after their defeat was certain—a special kind of satisfaction.\n\n  \"He… was the… groundskeeper… I left behind.\"\n\n  The mutilated body reached up with its own hand and, with a very stiff motion, tore the grass stems from the other half of its face. It then plunged its fingers into its own eye socket and forcefully pulled out all the grass from within.\n\n  Although it was only pulling out grass stems, the visual impact of this was no less than tearing away one's own flesh and blood.\n\n  It was a complete and utter betrayal.\n\n  The green in Zhou Ze's eyes slowly began to dim, while the flesh and blood of his neck regenerated at a speed visible to the naked eye.\n\n  \"Hmm?\"\n\n  A soft sound of doubt escaped from Zhou Ze.\n\n  \"You… are resisting me?\"\n\n  It was as if he were talking to himself, and in fact, he really was.\n\n  \"Without me… you would have died… who knows how many times…\"\n\n  The tone was exactly the same as when it had faced the tree root earlier.\n\n  Suddenly, the green in Zhou Ze's eyes began to flicker incessantly—at times clear, at times confused, at times furious, and at times appearing utterly lost.\n\n  \"You are… an intelligence born from me… but you… must understand… you are also… a part of me!\"\n\n  \"Bzz!\"\n\n  Zhou Ze's body began to tremble.\n\n  This internal resistance carried an unyielding defiance.\n\n  The next moment,\n\n  The green light in Zhou Ze's eyes began to dissipate, and his body slowly started to float upwards.\n\n  Meanwhile, the mutilated body silently submerged back into the water, dragging the now-decayed and withered old tree root with it, sinking slowly downward.\n\n  Though the water was not astonishingly deep, at this moment it seemed to have transformed into a terrifying abyss, swallowing them both, with no telling where they would ultimately end up.\n\n  The mortal world has its own rules. Any existence that does not belong to the mortal world will be suppressed and erased. Ordinary people have their own life trajectories, and anyone who dares to covet things they should not touch will inevitably be punished.\n\n  Eighty years ago,\n\n  The nearly-insane Japanese had found this mutilated body and transported it here, attempting to obtain a power that surpassed the limits of human thought. The final result was the corpse going berserk, turning this place into a living hell.\n\n  In the great unseen,\n\n  It was as if a hand,\n\n  Behind a dark curtain,\n\n  Was adjusting and correcting everything.\n\n  It valued one thing:\n\n  A clear distinction.\n\n  ………………\n\n  \"Glug… glug… glug…\"\n\n  Water,\n\n  More water,\n\n  More of this damned water.\n\n  Zhou Ze hated water now, truly, deeply hated it. He was sick of the sound of liquid filling his eardrums and despised the suffocating feeling of his lungs being compressed.\n\n  Slowly,\n\n  He opened his eyes.\n\n  He saw that he was lying in a bathtub. Bai Yingying, wearing a swimsuit, was scrubbing his body clean.\n\n  Moreover,\n\n  Bai Yingying had her back to him, currently scrubbing and massaging his thighs in the hot water.\n\n  Anyone with a bit of medical knowledge knows that if a person lies in bed for too long, they can easily develop bedsores and even suffer from other physical ailments.\n\n  Whether there’s a filial child by a long-term sickbed can often be seen by whether the patient has bedsores.\n\n  Just as Zhou Ze was about to move,\n\n  A sharp, intense pain shot through his entire body. This pain wasn't from his skin or flesh, but from his very nerves.\n\n  \"Splash…\"\n\n  His body convulsed,\n\n  And Zhou Ze slid right into the bathtub,\n\n  Dragging Bai Yingying, who had been on her tiptoes scrubbing him, down with him.\n\n  In that instant,\n\n  Zhou Ze only felt two soft, fleshy mounds pressing against his face, and right in the middle, the chill of eating a popsicle on a hot summer day.\n\n  _Even in the hot water,\n_\n  That iciness was still a bit hard to take.\n\n  Especially for a patient like Zhou Ze, whose body was extremely fragile and on the verge of falling apart, that moment was equivalent to someone smashing a brick-sized block of ice into his face.\n\n  \"Glug…\"\n\n  In an instant, Zhou Ze fainted once more.\n\n  \"Ah, Boss!\"\n\n  Bai Yingying shrieked and immediately stood up, pulling Zhou Ze's face out of the water.\n\n  She worriedly reached out to touch Zhou Ze's face. After confirming that his breathing was normal, Bai Yingying let out a long sigh of relief.\n\n  If her own boss was really…\n\n  Utterly dumbfounded,\n\n  And then suffocated to death,\n\n  That would be a really big joke.\n\n  ………………\n\n  The second time he woke up, it was two days later. Upon waking, Zhou Ze found himself lying on… huh, where am I lying?\n\n  It wasn't a bed below him,\n\n  But the clothes-drying rack by the window.\n\n  His entire body was actually suspended in mid-air!\n\n  Am I dreaming again?\n\n  Then I might as well go back to sleep.\n\n  _He closed his eyes.\n_\n  After a few minutes,\n\n  Zhou Ze tried opening his eyes again.\n\n  Why am I still in this dream?\n\n  Floating by the windowsill, with the sun shining on his body.\n\n  Just then, Zhou Ze turned his head and saw Tang Shi sitting by the window, reading a book.\n\n  \"What are you doing?\"\n\n  Tang Shi looked up at Zhou Ze, then picked up the coffee cup beside her and took a sip.\n\n  Without even thinking,\n\n  Zhou Ze knew that this woman was definitely drinking the expensive civet coffee he had specially bought!\n\n  There's plenty of instant Nescafé in the store, go drink that!\n\n  \"For a patient, getting some sun seems to be beneficial. You're a doctor, you should understand that.\"\n\n  \"Then you could have put me in a wheelchair and pushed me out for some sun.\"\n\n  Zhou Ze was rather amused.\n\n  Levitating me outside with psychokinesis,\n\n  Hanging me on the balcony to dry like laundry,\n\n  How embarrassing.\n\n  \"A wheelchair? The old Daoist has one, the kind that goes 'doot doot doot' and moves on its own with the push of a button. I figured you wouldn't like it, so I didn't make you sit in that.\"\n\n  \"Thanks.\"\n\n  Zhou Ze's gratitude was sincere.\n\n  The old Daoist's wheelchair is still around?\n\n  Just imagine,\n\n  If one day in the future, the old Daoist or Xu Qinglang showed him a video on their phone of him sitting in that electric wheelchair, with children's songs playing \"doot doot doot\" beside him—that would be the ultimate dark history.\n\n  \"Now, put me down.\"\n\n  Tang Shi nodded, and Zhou Ze was moved from the windowsill to the bed.\n\n  \"You're awake. Are you alright?\" Tang Shi asked. \"You were unconscious for twenty days this time. That's quite a while.\"\n\n  \"Why didn't you go back to Shanghai?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n  The matter is resolved, so why are you still here?\n\n  Even if you stay here,\n\n  I know you won't help with customers or make money.\n\n  Not stabbing the customers to death with your fountain pen is already your greatest contribution.\n\n  And you're staying here drinking my civet coffee???\n\n  Tang Shi didn't answer the question. That was her personality. The truth was, because Zhou Ze had saved her that night at the research institute, she felt she should stay until he woke up, otherwise she would feel indebted. But getting her to say it out loud was difficult.\n\n  \"Should I go get Bai Yingying?\" Tang Shi asked.\n\n  \"Not yet. There's something I want to ask you,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n  \"What is it?\"\n\n  \"I think there's something inside my body.\"\n\n  \"I could tell. It's like an Ultraman transformation,\" Tang Shi said, taking another sip of coffee.\n\n  \"That night, you fell, and then you floated back up.\n\n  And then, the problem was solved.\"\n\n  Zhou Ze's heart was bleeding.\n\n  \"What's wrong? Most people would be envious. Naruto's Nine-Tails seal, Ultraman's transformation—who wouldn't want a powerful force sealed within them?\"\n\n  Tang Shi said, crooking her little finger. \"Didn't your attitude toward me change because you had that power to rely on?\"\n\n  \"The key problem is, it's changing.\"\n\n  Zhou Ze said very seriously,\n\n  \"At first, I could feel that it was unconscious. An unconscious thing, it doesn't matter, right? I could just use it when I wanted to.\n\n  The side effect was just lying in bed for half a month.\n\n  But now,\n\n  As I use it more and more, I've found that it's changing. I can clearly perceive its consciousness, and I can even feel its consciousness and thoughts constantly improving.\n\n  Every time I stimulate it to awaken, it also repairs itself.\n\n  Like a person, it's constantly healing, constantly recovering.\n\n  Each time I use it to deal with a crisis,\n\n  While it helps me solve the problem, it also gets some nourishment for itself. Most of my enemies and opponents have become its rations.\"\n\n  Hearing this, Tang Shi's expression also grew solemn. \"So, you're worried?\"\n\n  \"Yes, I'm worried.\n\n  I'm even starting to feel afraid;\n\n  Because,\n\n  It's possible,\n\n  That the next time I let it awaken,\n\n  Will be the time it completely takes over.\"",

    "content": "Zhou Ze woke up.\n\nThis event didn't cause much of a stir in the bookstore.\n\nXu Qinglang was still applying a face mask, giving himself a facial massage.\n\nThe old Taoist was still live-streaming, with the monkey helping him film.\n\nThe Death Emissary continued to sit in the corner of the bookstore; he wouldn't move an inch unless something was dirty.\n\nEven Bai Yingying was still in her room eating chicken¹, only putting down her headset to come to Zhou Ze's private bedroom after her match was over.\n\nThe boss was awake.\n\nSo what? The boss slept all the time anyway.\n\nYou couldn't blame the shop's employees for being so apathetic. If you were in a company where the boss regularly disappeared for half a month or a month at a time, you'd become just as lax... and degenerate... as them.\n\nWith Bai Yingying's help, Zhou Ze took a shower, changed his clothes, and sat down in his familiar spot by the window on the ground floor.\n\nThe sun was bright and pleasant, but Zhou Ze felt as if he had only just \"awakened\" a short while ago.\n\nThese sudden two-week comas had to happen less often. Otherwise, other people would live for a month while he only experienced two days. Their lifespans were clearly the same, but he couldn't help feeling like he was getting shortchanged.\n\nMost importantly, Zhou Ze was a little afraid to let *that* consciousness awaken again.\n\nBasking in the warm sunlight, Zhou Ze mulled it over.\n\nThe prerequisite for not letting that consciousness awaken again was that he could no longer fall into an awkward and dangerous situation, a predicament that exceeded his current ability to resolve.\n\nAnd to keep himself from falling into a helpless predicament, he needed to be skilled enough at seeking fortune and avoiding disaster, at steering clear of trouble.\n\nAnd the prerequisite for not attracting major trouble was that he had to be calm enough, to learn to dodge trouble, and to prevent trouble from finding him.\n\nSo,\n\nhe still had to be a salted fish.²\n\nBeing a salted fish was the only way.\n\nHe had to be even more determined and thorough in his salted-fish ways.\n\nSee nothing, hear nothing, go nowhere.\n\nJust bask in the sun every day, comfortably drink coffee, and resolutely avoid stirring up trouble or letting trouble stir him up.\n\nBefore, Boss Zhou only felt that being a salted fish was comfortable, that it was his choice.\n\nNow, being a salted fish had truly become his principle for survival.\n\nHowever, just as Boss Zhou had woken up and Bai Yingying was making his coffee, trouble arrived.\n\nThe one who entered was Zhang Yanfeng.\n\nWhile he was showering, Bai Yingying had told him that Zhang Yanfeng had been coming by every two days for the past three weeks, but they had put him off each time with the excuse that the boss was away on business.\n\nThis time, as soon as Zhang Yanfeng entered, he saw Zhou Ze and immediately walked over.\n\nZhou Ze lowered his head, lay sideways on the sofa, and closed his eyes. He really didn't want to see the man.\n\n\"Have you seen the news? The excavation work over there is finished. It exposed the crimes Japan committed in China back then. The whole country is in an uproar.\" As he spoke, Zhang Yanfeng's expression grew a little awkward. \"It's just that the tragically deceased Japanese people in the research institute ruins made the propaganda angle a bit awkward.\"\n\n\"Were your relative's remains there?\"\n\n\"It'd be hard to find them. Doing DNA tests on each and every one would be a massive undertaking and far too costly. Besides, there was an incinerator there. My relative might have been burned to ashes long ago.\"\n\n\"As long as you can accept that.\"\n\n\"By the way, where have you been recently? I came looking for you many times, but your staff all said you were out.\"\n\n\"I went to borrow money.\n\nYou know, running a bookstore on South Avenue is really bad for business. But I'm attached to this place, so I needed to borrow money to keep it running and in existence.\n\nSigh, but I didn't manage to borrow much.\"\n\n\"Er...\" Zhang Yanfeng awkwardly rubbed the back of his hand. \"That's a pity. I don't have much money, or I'd definitely lend you some.\"\n\nAt that moment, Bai Yingying brought Zhou Ze's coffee over and placed it on the table.\n\nZhang Yanfeng, assuming it was coffee prepared for him as a guest, said \"Thank you\" and proceeded to pick it up and drink it himself.\n\nThe corner of Zhou Ze's mouth twitched.\n\nHis heart was bleeding.\n\n\"I have to go out and borrow money. Can't delay, so I won't be able to entertain you.\"\n\nZhou Ze issued a direct order to leave.\n\n\"Uh, I came to see you because I have something to discuss.\"\n\n*I know you have business, that's why I'm telling you to leave!*\n\nBoss Zhou clutched his temples with both hands, groaning in pain,\n\n\"My head hurts, it's killing me. Money, I can't borrow any money. It's so hard, so stressful, so difficult...\"\n\n\"The money thing isn't urgent.\"\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze really wanted to point at the man's nose and start cursing.\n\n*The money thing isn't urgent?*\n\n*I believe you're a good, selfless People's Police officer, but doesn't your conscience hurt when you say things like that?*\n\n\"At first, I came looking for you because of the excavation work. Later, it was because I thought of a case I have on hand that has been stalled for a long time with no progress.\n\nYou said before that if I ever ran into a really mysterious case, I could come and see you about it, so I...\"\n\n\"Did I say that?\" Zhou Ze immediately asked.\n\n\"You did. That day in the park.\"\n\n\"You can't take that seriously. Besides, I had just been thrown in the detention center by you. I was intimidated by your official authority, so I was just talking nonsense.\"\n\n\"...\" Zhang Yanfeng.\n\nThe conversation, it seemed, was difficult to continue.\n\nBut Zhang Yanfeng quickly pressed on. He placed a case file on the table and said, \"This is the file for that case. I brought the parts you're allowed to see. If you want to see more details, you can come to my office.\n\nTo be honest, there were a lot of things I didn't use to believe in.\n\nI am a Party member. I believe in Marxism-Leninism, and I am a staunch atheist.\"\n\nZhou Ze reached out and pushed the file away slightly. \"Exactly. You really shouldn't get too close to a charlatan like me.\"\n\n\"But *** taught us that we must rely on and unite all forces that can be united!\" Zhang Yanfeng said with righteous conviction. \"So, I think you might be able to offer me some perspectives and conjectures on this case.\"\n\n\"I'm not a cop, just a debt-ridden bookstore owner. Isn't it inappropriate for me to get mixed up in a case like yours?\"\n\n\"I can give you the status of a police consultant.\"\n\n*Police consultant?*\n\n*The last police consultant is still blind.*\n\nZhou Ze subconsciously glanced up at the ceiling. Tang Shi had said she was leaving soon; the blind man still needed her care.\n\n\"I'll be honest with you, I don't want to do anything else right now.\" Zhou Ze sighed. \"That business with the research institute last time cost me dearly.\"\n\n\"How about this? I won't make things difficult for you. I'll leave this case file here with you. You can look at it when you feel like it. It's a cold case anyway. I'll take my leave now. Thank you for your hospitality.\"\n\n\"The bill...\"\n\nZhou Ze called out.\n\nBut Zhang Yanfeng walked right out of the bookstore as if he hadn't heard.\n\nAnd the old Taoist, who was sitting by the counter live-streaming, clearly pretended not to hear Zhou Ze's prompt.\n\n*What a joke.*\n\n*You want me to ask a police officer for money?*\n\n*This humble Taoist isn't that stupid!*\n\nZhou Ze felt that his bookstore urgently needed a rectification campaign to correct this crooked trend of holding a position without doing any work, indulging in pleasure, and not taking care of business!\n\n\"You're awake. I'm leaving.\"\n\nTang Shi came down from upstairs, dressed in a different set of clothes, car keys in hand.\n\n\"Goodbye.\"\n\nZhou Ze waved to her.\n\nShe nodded and walked out of the bookstore.\n\n\"Boss, have some tea.\" Bai Yingying brought over a cup of tea.\n\n\"Where's the coffee?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"The one I just made was the last of it. We're all out of that kind of coffee now,\" Bai Yingying replied.\n\n\"It's all gone?\"\n\nZhou Ze bit his lip.\n\nHis heart...\n\nached so much he couldn't breathe.\n\n\"What should I do with this case file?\" Bai Yingying asked, pointing at the file on the table.\n\n\"Throw it somewhere I can't see it,\" Zhou Ze said, glancing at the file with disgust.\n\nHe wasn't about to open it and read it. He didn't want to know about any injustices, how cruel the murderer was, how pitiful the victim was, or how vile the circumstances were.\n\nHe didn't even want to look at it, to just pretend he knew nothing at all.\n\nIf he didn't know, he wouldn't feel guilty. If he didn't feel guilty, nothing would happen. If nothing happened, there'd be no trouble.\n\nLifting the tea, he took a sip. Zhou Ze picked up his Ghost Emissary Certificate and glanced at it. The merit points on it hadn't risen in a long time and had remained at a very low level.\n\nHe frowned.\n\nZhou Ze felt that his recent habit of messing around everywhere instead of attending to his duties was a true sin. It looked like he needed to seriously consider where to find some ghosts to raise his merit points.\n\nBut honestly, Tongcheng was only so big a city. It wasn't realistic to expect it to suddenly be overrun with ghosts.\n\n\"By the way, what about the Red Spider Lilies I told you to seal up last time?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Oh, those. Lin Ke came by while you were out and took the Red Spider Lilies. She found a way to make them into a sealed liquid in jars. She kept some for herself and sent the rest back.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded, somewhat gratified.\n\nWaking up,\n\nhe had finally heard one piece of good news.\n\nAt that moment, Zhou Ze looked over at Xu Qinglang and called out,\n\n\"What's for dinner tonight?\"\n\nXu Qinglang took off his face mask and looked at Zhou Ze as if he'd seen a ghost. He had no idea just how much Zhou Ze was craving a \"hearty meal\" right now.\n\n\"Fine, I'll go buy groceries.\"\n\nXu Qinglang wore an expression of utter helplessness.\n\nHe looked for all the world like a long-suffering wife whose good-for-nothing husband was a lazy bum who lazed around the house all day, yet she still had to hold her nose and cook for him.\n\n\"Come out for a walk with me. I've been lying down for too long.\"\n\n\"Okay, Boss.\"\n\nBai Yingying helped Zhou Ze out of the bookstore.\n\nJust as they stepped outside, Zhou Ze saw someone who looked like an old, female scavenger fumbling around by the bookstore's display window.\n\n\"Go ask her what she's doing,\" Zhou Ze said. The old woman didn't look like a beggar; although her clothes were tattered, her face and hair were quite clean, and she seemed very alert.\n\nBai Yingying ran over to ask. The old woman spoke and gestured, explaining something to her.\n\nLeaning against a nearby utility pole, Zhou Ze lit a cigarette. He had barely taken two puffs before Yingying returned.\n\n\"Boss, I found out. She says she's looking for something.\"\n\n\"Looking for what?\"\n\n\"For flowers.\"\n\n---\n¹A slang term for playing and winning battle royale games like PUBG, originating from the victory phrase \"Winner, winner, chicken dinner!\"\n²A popular Chinese slang term for someone who is lazy, unmotivated, and has no ambition, like a salted fish just lying there.",

    "content": "The hand holding the cigarette…\n\n  trembled slightly.\n\n  He had just made a grand vow,\n\n  resolving to be a good salted fish who slacked off properly and was drowsy every day.\n\n  Who would have thought…\n\n  that while the vow was still warm,\n\n  trouble would come knocking.\n\n  The last time, there was the earthen mound, the small street and its house of pleasure inside, the scabby-headed monk's paper effigy clone, and on top of all that, the Equinox Flower he'd swiped from there to use as a condiment.\n\n  What gave Zhou Ze the biggest headache was that he hadn't even had a chance to \"feast heartily\" yet, and the original owner had already come looking for him.\n\n  Of course, as for guilt, there was really none of that.\n\n  Boss Zhou felt no remorse for stealing someone else's property.\n\n  That group of people had set up that small barrier to lure nearby departed souls, using them as fodder to nourish the Equinox Flower. They had utterly tormented souls that could have originally gone down to the Yellow Springs, entered the underworld, and been reincarnated, cutting off their chance at rebirth.\n\n  This was an act highly detrimental to one's karmic balance. The fact that Zhou Ze wasn't boasting about \"enacting justice on behalf of Heaven\" was already him being modest. How could he possibly feel guilty over something like this?\n\n  \"My flower, where's my flower?\"\n\n  The old woman tottered up to Zhou Ze, grabbing his shoulders. Her sunken eyes held a mix of despair and madness as she violently shook his body, screaming.\n\n  Boss Zhou had just woken from a coma and was still quite frail. The old woman looked as if a gust of wind could blow her over, but she was surprisingly strong, shaking him so hard he was about to suffocate.\n\n  \"Let go!\"\n\n  Bai Yingying immediately reached out and pulled the old woman away. The old woman's body fell backward, and she dropped directly to the ground, unconscious.\n\n  \"...\" Bai Yingying.\n\n  \"...\" Zhou Ze.\n\n  \"Boss, is she trying to fake an injury for money?\" Bai Yingying asked.\n\n  Zhou Ze frowned as well. He thought about it. *That can't be right.* Back then, he and the little loli had speculated about the person who set up the barrier to cultivate the Equinox Flower. Whether they were living or dead, in the mortal world or in the underworld, they had to be a figure of some standing, right?\n\n  An ordinary person wouldn't have the qualifications, much less the ability, to pull off something on that scale.\n\n  But this old woman who came to collect the debt... wasn't she a bit pathetically weak?\n\n  Bai Yingying gives her one push,\n\n  and she faints?\n\n  Trying to extort money?\n\n  Boss Zhou wouldn't have minded spending some hell money or RMB to satisfy her and send her on her way. Compared to the chain of trouble this matter could trigger, Zhou Ze felt that spending money to avert disaster was a perfectly acceptable option.\n\n  After all,\n\n  having realized that what was once his greatest support had now become his biggest powder keg, Zhou Ze's mentality had shifted somewhat.\n\n  Before, he was Zhou the Teddy Bear, thinking he was awesome enough to screw the sky, the earth, and the very air.\n\n  Now, he was Zhou the Salted Fish.\n\n  There were quite a few pedestrians on the street casting glances their way, but no one went out of their way to come over for a closer look. Nobody wanted to get involved in trouble. At most, they would slow down as they passed, wondering if there was any drama to watch.\n\n  It was the same principle as \"pure and good-natured\" men, regardless of age, who would always pretend to casually glance inside the small, shady hair salons on the street to see what color stockings the young ladies were wearing that day.\n\n  Therefore, Boss Zhou didn't feel there was anything wrong with his current mentality and attitude toward life.\n\n  Open your eyes and look around.\n\n  On the bustling streets, in this secular world,\n\n  everyone coming and going...\n\n  is a salted fish.\n\n  ……………………\n\n  \"Mmm... Delicious! So delicious!!!!\"\n\n  \"This is amazing... The flavor is so good!!!!\"\n\n  At the dinner table,\n\n  Zhou Ze sat leaning back in his chair while Xu Qinglang stood by, keeping an eye on the dishes and stir-frying more whenever something ran low.\n\n  The old woman ate alone, absolutely wolfing down her food. She looked like a prisoner just released from an ancient jail, especially with the incredibly greasy pork knuckle she held in her left hand.\n\n  Her mouth was dripping with grease as she ate.\n\n  That pork knuckle was a substantial main course Xu Qinglang had specially prepared for Zhou Ze's \"hearty feast\" tonight.\n\n  The old Daoist priest kept her company with drinks, pouring for her. The old woman would clink glasses with him from time to time and drain her cup in one go, her manner extremely unrestrained.\n\n  Of course,\n\n  although they looked to be of a similar age, the old Daoist didn't fancy his peers. He much preferred those pitiful women of a younger generation, around forty or so, from the hair salons.\n\n  Yes, they were beginning to age and lose their looks, becoming, as the lecherous old poet Bai Juyi described, women \"before whose desolate door guests and carriages are few.\"¹\n\n  But if you patronized them, cherished them, they would be more grateful and provide better service, unlike those youngsters who had plenty of business and were a real handful.\n\n  Still, the old Daoist found the old woman quite congenial. Besides, you couldn't very well have Bai Yingying keep her company, could you?\n\n  Although, come to think of it, Bai Yingying was probably old enough.\n\n  The old woman ate and ate, never stopping, like the reincarnation of a starving ghost.\n\n  The ingredients Xu Qinglang had bought tonight for Zhou Ze's grand meal had mostly ended up in her stomach. At a time like this, Zhou Ze certainly wasn't going to make trouble for himself by taking out the oral solution made from the Equinox Flower to flaunt while he ate.\n\n  \"Phew...\"\n\n  Full.\n\n  The old woman patted her perfectly round belly,\n\n  a look of utter satisfaction on her face.\n\n  Then she looked at Xu Qinglang, gave him a thumbs-up, and said:\n\n  \"Young lady, you're a really good cook.\"\n\n  \"...\" Xu Qinglang.\n\n  Old Xu suddenly felt it was a bit of a shame that his cooking wasn't quite perfect—he hadn't put a little arsenic in the dishes.\n\n  \"Hehe, little sister, he's a man, hahahahaha.\"\n\n  The old Daoist cackled as he explained,\n\n  \"Little sister, you don't know, but the first time I saw him, I almost got hard.\"\n\n  \"Tsk tsk, he's a man?\" The old woman studied Xu Qinglang again, nodded, and said, \"A truly handsome young lad. A pity. If this were back in the former Qing dynasty, with your looks, you could go on stage and play a young male lead. I can't imagine how many people you'd charm. The theater districts would be full of your admirers.\"\n\n  The old woman opened her mouth and casually dropped \"the former Qing.\"\n\n  The sheer class and depth of that reminiscence were truly profound.\n\n  It left the old Daoist next to her at a loss for how to respond. *We look about the same age, but I was born the year before Liberation. Even then, the Qing dynasty was a lifetime away.*\n\n  \"It's just that the oil was a bit too heavy. I imagine it's from cooking too often in large pots, serving at endless banquets for too long. Naturally, it lacks a certain refinement.\n\n  \"The flavor is excellent, but there are far more delicious cuisines in this world. Never mind the various levels of taste; honestly, can something really be so delicious that you'd eat your own tongue?\n\n  \"It's just a matter of the different effort put into the refinement, get it?\"\n\n  Hearing this, Xu Qinglang paused for a moment, then nodded. \"I stand corrected.\"\n\n  The old woman let out a breath, sounding somewhat wistful.\n\n  \"Forget it, forget it. This meal, no matter what, was quite good. You keep at it, study hard in the future, and strive to reach the next level. The culinary skills of a Prince's Mansion chef from the former Qing... looks like I'll never get to taste that again for real.\"\n\n  \"Mm.\" Xu Qinglang nodded.\n\n  \"When your culinary skills have improved another step, I reckon you'll be about ready to die. When that time comes, you can come down below and be my personal chef.\"\n\n  \"...\" Xu Qinglang.\n\n  Xu Qinglang's Negative Emotions +999\n\n  Zhou Ze's gaze sharpened.\n\n  *The main event...*\n\n  *is it here?*\n\n  The moment the underworld was mentioned,\n\n  the moment the Equinox Flower was mentioned,\n\n  it meant both sides had laid their cards on the table. There was no longer a need to be coy and hide things in a fog.\n\n  But Xu Qinglang was at a loss for whether to laugh or cry. Was that a compliment? A reward?\n\n  \"What's with the long face? With your half-assed level of occult skill, you've got no hope of changing your fate in this life. Old age, sickness, death—you can't escape them either.\n\n  \"Besides,\n\n  \"is following a lowly bailiff for the Netherworld yamen\n\n  \"better than following this old woman?\"\n\n  As she spoke,\n\n  the old woman pointed a very dismissive finger at Zhou Ze.\n\n  The aura she projected at that moment was not faked. An ordinary person, without her experiences and disposition, couldn't possibly imitate such a feeling.\n\n  \"Little sister... oh no, Big Sister, you're a big shot down below, too?\n\n  \"Hey, this humble Daoist could tell from the start, Big Sister, that you're no ordinary person. From the sounds of it, you're a Bannerman?\n\n  \"Let me tell you, my ancestors were Bannermen too, from the Niohuru clan!\"\n\n  The old Daoist immediately began to flatter her.\n\n  *Your loyal Daoist has come online.*\n\n  Once people get old, all they really care about are their posthumous affairs. But the old Daoist had no wife or children, so he didn't need to worry about his descendants. Now he had a chance to look after his own affairs for after he died. This was a great opportunity!\n\n  \"Oh?\"\n\n  The old woman squinted at him with drunken eyes and patted his face.\n\n  \"Really a Bannerman?\"\n\n  \"Yes, yes.\"\n\n  \"But back in the former Qing, this old woman was with the Tongmenghui.² That meal at the Prince's Mansion? I got it by crashing the place after we stormed a prince's home.\"\n\n  \"...\" The old Daoist.\n\n  Zhou Ze tapped the table lightly. \"Let's get to the point.\"\n\n  *She's eaten and drunk her fill. It's time for her to state her real purpose.*\n\n  \"Hah, get to the point?\" The old woman stretched lazily. \"The Equinox Flower, it's with you?\"\n\n  \"You could say that.\"\n\n  *If it's a blessing, it's not a curse; if it's a curse, you can't escape it.* Boss Zhou decided to just be blunt about it.\n\n  \"Do you know who I am?\" the old woman asked, pointing to her own face.\n\n  \"No,\" Zhou Ze shook his head.\n\n  At first, Zhou Ze had guessed she might be Granny Meng, but since she was a person from the late Qing dynasty, she couldn't be. Besides, it was unlikely that a major figure from the underworld like Granny Meng would personally come to the mortal realm.\n\n  \"Heh heh, so I really don't know what gives you your courage.\" The old woman stood up and placed her hand on Zhou Ze's chest. \"This old woman wants to see where your courage and your backing come from.\"\n\n  That greasy hand, which had just held a pork knuckle, was now groping his chest.\n\n  Boss Zhou, a man with a touch of mysophobia, found it extremely uncomfortable and agonizing. He couldn't help but swat her hand away.\n\n  \"Oh, I see now. To think that this little city of Tongcheng is actually full of hidden dragons and crouching tigers.\n\n  \"A minor ghost runner for the Netherworld has a hidden identity of his own.\"\n\n  The old woman took another sip of rice wine, smiling so wide her yellowed front teeth showed.\n\n  \"But don't you know, you are merely the consciousness that happened to be born during the period when the one inside your body was in a coma? In other words, you are fundamentally nothing at all.\n\n  \"What do you have to be so arrogant about?\n\n  \"When a person dies and becomes a zombie, that is at least a new life born from death.\n\n  \"And you?\n\n  \"You don't even count as that.\n\n  \"At best, you're the watchdog tied to the front door while its master is away.\n\n  \"When the master returns...\n\n  \"the dog will be slaughtered and stewed for soup.\"\n\n***\n¹ From Bai Juyi's \"Song of the Pipa Player,\" describing a former courtesan in her later years.\n² The Tongmenghui, or Revolutionary Alliance, was a secret society and underground resistance movement founded by Sun Yat-sen and others to overthrow the Qing dynasty in the early 20th century.",

    "content": "The old woman's cold sarcasm made everyone present fall subconsciously silent.\n\nBai Yingying was silent.\n\nXu Qinglang was silent.\n\nThe old Taoist was silent.\n\nThe ghoul, who had been silent all along, continued to be silent.\n\nAs a subordinate employee, when your boss is being publicly called out, what else can you do but stay silent?\n\n*Snap!*\n\nZhou Ze lit a cigarette, took a deep drag, and then slowly exhaled a smoke ring.\n\nWhat the old woman had said was actually very similar to what Zhou Ze himself had guessed, but to say it had truly stung his pride or anything like that… well, that wasn't the case.\n\nBoss Zhou wasn't that thin-skinned.\n\nHowever, her attitude—pulling rank, acting aggressive, and pontificating like some relic from a bygone era—was truly unpleasant.\n\nThis was the Midnight Bookstore.\n\nAfter all, this was his shop.\n\nIn cruder terms, this was his, Zhou Ze's, execution ground. Or his \"lair.\"\n\nEven a mighty dragon can't suppress a local snake!\n\n\"Have you said your piece?\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"What? Are you angry?\" The old woman looked as if she'd expected this.\n\n\"Yes,\" Zhou Ze admitted.\n\n\"The Spider Lily, give it to me. Then help me settle this matter. Your specific punishment will depend on your performance.\"\n\nThe old woman sat down again.\n\nShe even reached over and took a cigarette from in front of Zhou Ze, lighting it for herself.\n\nThat posture,\n\nThat expression,\n\nIt had the air of a songstress smoking backstage in an old Shanghai dance hall.\n\n\"Heh.\"\n\nZhou Ze pointed at the food on the table and said:\n\n\"You can start by paying.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\nThe old woman frowned, as if she didn't understand.\n\n\"Down here, I always arrange a final meal for the ghosts I send on. When they leave, they always leave behind some extra spirit money. You've had wine and meat, the highest-grade spread we offer. You should leave a little more.\"\n\nThe old woman's eyes narrowed.\n\nHer withered hand slammed down on the table as she snapped:\n\n\"Do you know who you're talking to?\"\n\n\"Paying for a meal is the way of the world.\"\n\nZhou Ze slowly raised his head, his expression one of self-evident truth.\n\n\"Heh heh, and what if I say I won't pay?\" the old woman said sharply.\n\nBefore, when she hadn't revealed her identity, it didn't matter.\n\nNow that she had, Zhou Ze was treating her with even more contempt than before. She couldn't tolerate it!\n\nIt was like one of those emperors on an incognito tour. You could joke with him while he was in disguise, but once he put on his dragon robes, if you were still so flippant, you'd be taking a trip to the execution block.\n\n\"You won't pay?\"\n\nZhou Ze looked at the old Taoist sitting in front of him and said:\n\n\"Beat her.\"\n\nThe old Taoist shuddered.\n\n*Holy crap.*\n\n*Beat her?*\n\n*Boss,*\n\n*I can die, you know. What happens to me after I'm dead?*\n\nThe old Taoist was still hesitating. Who the hell wouldn't hesitate in his shoes?\n\nUnless you were absolutely certain you were immortal—and even if you were, there's no guarantee some accident wouldn't befall you.\n\nBut seeing the look on Zhou Ze's face,\n\nThe old Taoist knew that if he disobeyed the order today, he probably wouldn't even live long enough to die of old age. The boss would express-mail him to the afterlife himself.\n\n*Smack!*\n\nThe old Taoist raised his hand,\n\nand brought it down on the old woman's arm,\n\ngently slapping it.\n\nThe force, the weight of it,\n\nwas less like hitting someone,\n\nand more like the playful bickering of an old married couple.\n\nTime reveals a horse's strength, and a person's heart, indeed.\n\nZhou Ze gently rubbed his head, then gave a slight wave of his hand.\n\nClose the door.\n\nRelease Yingying.\n\nIn any case, Yingying was a true-born Jiangshi.¹\n\nEven if she were to \"die,\" she wouldn't enter the cycle of reincarnation; her end would be complete annihilation of both life and spirit. She wouldn't go to Hell or walk the Yellow Springs Road, so she had no fear of future retribution.\n\nBesides, this girl had a natural sense of loyalty and obedience towards Zhou Ze.\n\nSure enough,\n\nYingying didn't disappoint him.\n\nShe walked straight forward.\n\n\"You dare call my boss a dog?\" Bai Yingying said, hands on her hips, staring at the old woman.\n\n\"Haha, he is a dog. Little girl, your bloodline is actually much purer than his. He's just borrowing a tiger's skin to look impressive. He's not him at all.\"\n\nZhou Ze took a deep breath.\n\nHe was a little hesitant,\n\nand a little lost.\n\nNot because of what the old woman said,\n\nbut because of Bai Yingying.\n\nYes, Bai Yingying was very obedient to him, but that was based on the aura of a high-level Jiangshi she sensed from him. It was the bloodline within him suppressing hers that forced her to submit, transforming her from a cold, iceberg-like female Jiangshi into his little \"whimper-bug.\"²\n\nNow,\n\nthat she knew he was just a front,\n\nwould she continue to listen to him?\n\nWhat if the consciousness inside him issued a summons?\n\nWould Bai Yingying directly obey that consciousness's command and turn on him?\n\nBoss Zhou was feeling a little insecure right now.\n\nSuddenly, he discovered he truly had nothing to stand on.\n\nBefore, he felt like he was a low-level character in max-level gear that he could use to show off everywhere.\n\nNow, he realized the gear was just on loan, bound to someone else, and he himself might just be a pre-designated experience bar for that other person.\n\nPanic.\n\nHe couldn't help but panic.\n\nThe panic of a salted fish.³\n\n*SLAP!*\n\nBai Yingying slapped the old woman across the face, sending her flying right into the wall.\n\nShe didn't hold back at all!\n\nThe old woman was durable, though; she only suffered a split lip and some bleeding.\n\n\"You!!!!!!!!!!\"\n\nThe old woman pointed a finger at Bai Yingying.\n\n\"How dare you! A mere Jiangshi, a mere filth, barred from reincarnation, by the heav—\"\n\n*BANG! BANG!!!!!!!!!!*\n\nBai Yingying grabbed the old woman by the neck,\n\nand lifted her up.\n\n\"You...\" The old woman tried to speak but couldn't get the words out.\n\n\"You dare insult my boss!\"\n\nBai Yingying instantly transformed into a violent high-school beauty,\n\ngrabbing the old woman by the neck,\n\n*BANG! BANG! BANG!*\n\nand slamming her against the wall again and again!\n\nOnce,\n\nTwice,\n\nThree times,\n\nFour times...\n\nOn and on she slammed, without pause!\n\nThe shop next door probably thought the bookstore was undergoing renovations.\n\nThe old Taoist watched, sucking in a cold breath.\n\nXu Qinglang watched in silence.\n\nThe little monkey watched, so engrossed that the peanut in its paw fell to the floor.\n\nEven the ghoul, who had been sitting motionlessly against the wall, was now shaking nonstop from the vibrations.\n\nZhou Ze continued smoking off to the side,\n\npuffing furiously.\n\nFinally,\n\nafter who knows how many impacts,\n\nBai Yingying dropped the old woman to the floor.\n\nThe old woman was bruised and swollen, her hair disheveled, and she had lost who knows how many teeth.\n\nBut she still wasn't dead!\n\n\"You... you... you dare do this... dare do this to me... You'd better not die... you'd better not die...\"\n\nThe old Taoist, sitting on the side, frantically waved his hands,\n\nas if to signal that this had nothing to do with him.\n\nBecause in this bookstore,\n\nBai Yingying and the boss wouldn't die, and Xu Qinglang was still young. Damn it, when you thought about it, he'd be the one to die the earliest and quickest.\n\nZhou Ze dropped his cigarette butt, shakily stood up, walked over to the old woman, and slowly squatted down.\n\nBai Yingying stood beside him, showing none of the satisfaction or triumph of having violently beaten a sandbag. Instead, as Zhou Ze approached, her eyes welled up with tears, as if she were about to cry.\n\nZhou Ze looked up, a little surprised, at Bai Yingying beside him and asked:\n\n\"What are you crying for?\"\n\n\"She said bad things about you, Boss. I couldn't stand it.\"\n\n\"What she said wasn't false. Nothing to get angry about.\"\n\nZhou Ze comforted her.\n\nWhat she said,\n\nwas the truth, after all.\n\n\"No, what she said was wrong. The boss is the boss, not some kind of gatekeeper dog. The boss is the boss. In Yingying's eyes, you are my boss, not that thing inside your body. That thing... it's so scary. Yingying doesn't like it.\"\n\n\"Heh heh.\"\n\nZhou Ze smiled, genuinely happy.\n\nThen, Zhou Ze reached out. His fingernails grew long, and he clawed straight at the old woman's head, then yanked upwards fiercely.\n\n*You're an indestructible cockroach,*\n\n*so I'll just rip your soul out!*\n\nThe old woman's soul was truly pulled out by Zhou Ze,\n\nbut her image changed instantly.\n\nShe still had the appearance of an old woman,\n\nbut she now wore a tall black hat, its brim extending down and trailing on the floor. Her face was adorned with numerous sigils,⁴ showing at a glance that she was no ordinary ghost.\n\n\"That array wasn't set up by you, and you didn't plant the Spider Lily either.\"\n\nZhou Ze analyzed:\n\n\"Aside from being hard to kill, you have no other skills. So, you're someone who came out from Hell specifically to investigate this matter?\"\n\n\"You know I'm from Hell, and you still dare treat me like this!\" the old woman snarled.\n\n\"You're a big fish. My merit points haven't gone up in a long time. Also, I hear that those who work in Hell have a lot of perks—plucking a feather from every passing goose, and all that. You had such a fine meal here. Sending you down should not only boost my performance, but the spirit money payout should be quite handsome, right?\"\n\n\"You dare!\"\n\nThe old woman began to panic.\n\nIt wasn't easy for someone of her status to come up to the mortal realm; the cost was immense. If she went back with her mission incomplete, her fate would be grim!\n\nZhou Ze nodded. It seemed his guess was right.\n\nImmediately after,\n\nZhou Ze took out his phone, opened WeChat, and started a video call with the little loli.\n\nShe answered quickly,\n\nrevealing Lin Ke lying in bed, wearing a lolita dress.\n\n\"Her. Do you know her?\"\n\nZhou Ze pointed the phone at the old woman.\n\n\"She... She's a night watchman from the Bridge of Helplessness! Why is she here? Is she here to investigate the Spider Lily? Ah! How did her soul get out? Who did it! Was it you?\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"Zhou Ze, you're in deep trouble! If you let her go down and she reports your crimes, when the Bridge of Helplessness files a complaint with the Underworld courts, forget being a mere Ghost Emissary—even if you were an Inspector, you couldn't handle the consequences!\"\n\n\"I get what you mean.\" A look of realization dawned on Zhou Ze. \"You mean, I can't send her soul down to Hell. I should just destroy it right here.\"\n\n\"...\" Lin Ke.\n\nLin Ke: **&amp;*@@#￥%￥\n\nThe moment he finished speaking,\n\nZhou Ze's nails began to frantically knead and pierce the old woman's soul,\n\nas if he'd gone mad!\n\n*This'll teach you to call me a gatekeeper dog!*\n\n*This'll teach you to say I'm worthless!*\n\n*This'll teach you to act all high-and-mighty in front of me!*\n\n*Today, I'll let you know,*\n\n*that even a dog,*\n\n*when it's pushed too far,*\n\n*will bite back!*\n\nAmidst the old woman's miserable screams,\n\nher soul was finally torn to shreds by Zhou Ze.\n\nAll around,\n\nwisps of ash drifted.\n\nIt was over.\n\nEverything was over.\n\nA faint smile lingered on Zhou Ze's lips.\n\nHe closed his eyes,\n\nand sat right down on the floor.\n\nFor some reason,\n\nat that moment,\n\nhe was suddenly reminded of how it felt to sit alone in the backyard of the orphanage as a child.\n\n***\n\n**Footnotes:**\n1.  **Jiangshi:** A type of reanimated corpse in Chinese folklore, sometimes translated as \"hopping vampire\" or \"zombie.\"\n2.  **Whimper-bug (嚶嚶怪):** A pun on Bai Yingying's name.

    "content": "\"Here, Kuding tea.\"\n\nWang Ke placed the tea in front of Zhou Ze.\n\nKuding tea, also known as bitter tea, lived up to its name.\n\nBut Wang Ke had been hooked on this flavor ever since he started drinking tea. Whether at home or in the office, this was the tea he drank.\n\nYou could say he was remembering past bitterness to appreciate present sweetness, and he certainly deserved to.\n\nTo have gone from being an orphan with nothing to where he was today was as successful as one could possibly be. The hardships he had endured along the way were all swirling in this cup of bitter tea.\n\nZhou Ze picked up the teacup, took a sip, slowly chewed on the tea dregs, then set the cup down and lit another cigarette.\n\n\"Feeling lonely?\"\n\nWang Ke said.\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\nAs a psychologist, his greatest skill was, in fact, reading people. It was a subject that seemed easy to learn but was actually very difficult to master.\n\n\"Where's your daughter?\"\n\n\"Oh, she's getting out of school soon.\"\n\n\"And your wife?\"\n\n\"Getting her hair done. Then she should be picking up our child from school. They should be back before long.\"\n\n\"You're pretty brave, letting her go out on her own.\"\n\n\"She's normal, most of the time.\"\n\nWang Ke blew a breath over his own teacup before picking it up and taking a sip.\n\nThe bitterness that slid down his throat was no less intense than baijiu burning through his gut.\n\n\"I wanted to talk to someone, but I didn't know who. Then I thought of you.\"\n\nAfter he spoke, Zhou Ze gave a small smile.\n\nIt was clear that his spirits were actually quite low.\n\nInstantly annihilating that old woman's soul hadn't allowed Boss Zhou to vent any of his inner rage. Instead, it was like getting \"fast food\" by the roadside. The intense activity was seemingly over, but as he walked away, he couldn't hide the deep sense of loss and emptiness within him.\n\nZhou Ze didn't think his action was clean or decisive. It was truly just an act of desperation, the kind of madness a person displays after being forced into an emotional corner. A brute's move. Nothing to brag about.\n\nUltimately, whether the Naihe Bridge would find out about this, whether he would face consequences—he didn't know, and had no way of knowing.\n\n\"I can understand how you feel. We were the same when we were kids.\" Wang Ke pushed the ashtray closer to Zhou Ze and continued, \"We started off so much further behind our peers, and we had a greater sense of crisis too. Because we've experienced the terror of having nothing, we understand the importance of cherishing what we have better than anyone.\"\n\nZhou Ze looked at Wang Ke, not saying a word.\n\n\"Right now, you give me the feeling that we're back in the orphanage.\"\n\n\"Heh.\"\n\n\"It's true. That feeling of having nothing to rely on, that uncertainty and confusion about the future... I see it in you, clear as day.\"\n\n\"I had nothing to begin with. In my last life, I struggled my way to thirty, and one car crash burned it all to the ground. In this life, I've discovered an even more unacceptable truth: my entire existence is just a misunderstanding, a probability, you could even call it... a joke.\"\n\n\"So? What have you decided to do about it?\"\n\nWang Ke reached up and rubbed his chin.\n\nTo be honest, when dealing with his various clients, Wang Ke was always confident. His talent, his accomplishments in psychology, and his experience allowed him to solve the vast majority of problems.\n\nBut when faced with Zhou Ze, all of Wang Ke's usual confidence completely vanished.\n\nAfter all, there wasn't exactly a course in school dedicated to the psychological study of \"ghosts.\"\n\n\"That question is too vague,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Alright then, how about this: tomorrow, what do you plan to do? What will you do when you wake up in the morning? What about at noon? And in the evening? That makes it more concrete and clear.\"\n\n\"In the morning...\"\n\nZhou Ze mulled it over for a moment, then answered:\n\n\"In the morning, I'll sit by the bookstore window, bask in the sun, and drink some coffee.\"\n\n\"...\" Wang Ke.\n\nSuppressing the urge to cough, Wang Ke forced himself to continue, \"What about noon? After lunch, you'll keep reading the newspaper?\"\n\nZhou Ze smiled, shook his head, and said, \"Of course I won't be reading the newspaper. And I won't drink coffee either.\"\n\n\"Ah, good.\"\n\nWang Ke let out a long sigh of relief.\n\nHe felt that his childhood friend,\n\nmight be salvageable after all.\n\n\"The newspaper only has so many pages. From noon to afternoon, I'll switch to a book. The bookstore has plenty of them. And I won't sit in the same spot; the morning sun is pleasant enough, but the afternoon sun is too strong. I'll pick a corner, lie on my side, and flip through a book.\n\nIf I'm in the mood, I'll read some serious literature or some ancient texts.\n\nIf I get bored, I'll find some contemporary novels for a change of pace. Sometimes I find those novels quite interesting.\n\nAnd no more coffee. After all, drinking too much isn't good for the heart. I used to be a doctor, I know these things.\n\nI'll switch to tea. But not your kind of bitter tea. I have a lot of expensive, high-quality tea leaves back at my place.\"\n\n\"...\" Wang Ke.\n\n\"As for the evening, I'll see if any business comes in. If it does, I'll take it. If not, I'll close up on time, take a shower, and go to sleep.\"\n\nWang Ke glanced at the ashtray in front of him.\n\nFor some reason,\n\nhe was suddenly struck by an impulse,\n\nto pick up that ashtray and smash it over his childhood friend's head until he was bloodied and broken!\n\n\"Is that kind of life... interesting?\"\n\nWang Ke chose his words carefully and continued:\n\n\"Or rather, does that kind of life help with the troubles you're facing now? Can it improve your situation or resolve your worries?\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head.\n\nObviously not.\n\nIn this world, there's no such thing as a free lunch.\n\n\"Then why do you still plan to do it?\" Wang Ke coaxed, trying to guide him.\n\nHonestly,\n\nhe felt so tired. Really, truly tired.\n\n\"But my worry, my concern, is precisely that in the future, I might not be able to live this kind of 'salted fish' life anymore.\n\nSo why would I,\n\nin order to protect this way of life, proactively change this way of life now?\"\n\nWang Ke reached up and wiped his forehead.\n\nHe was tied in knots by Zhou Ze's words.\n\nYes,\n\nBoss Zhou quite liked this kind of life.\n\nA bookstore, a maid, a newspaper, a ray of sunshine—a day and a night would pass just like that. A month, a year, would pass just like that.\n\nHe didn't like to disturb this tranquility, nor could he bear to destroy this atmosphere.\n\nThis was a truth he had come to understand after death, a view on life completely different from his previous one.\n\nThe two men's conversation had reached an impasse.\n\nFortunately, the front door opened.\n\nThe little loli and her mother had returned.\n\nThe moment she entered, the little loli stared hard at Zhou Ze, the fury deep in her eyes perfectly clear!\n\nHe'd caused trouble again,\n\nhe'd stirred up shit again!\n\nThe little loli felt wronged.\n\nWhy was it that ever since she started following him, she had to live every day in fear and trepidation!\n\nAfter starting to follow him,\n\nthe little loli suddenly felt her life had become exceptionally thrilling!\n\nInsanely thrilling!\n\nAfter returning with her child, Wang Ke's wife went upstairs on her own.\n\nRegarding this,\n\nZhou Ze, the guest, didn't feel the slightest bit snubbed.\n\nOn the contrary,\n\nif Wang Ke's wife had enthusiastically insisted he stay for dinner, that would have been the thing Zhou Ze found most unacceptable.\n\n\"Xiao Rui, go do your homework.\"\n\nWang Ke gestured for his daughter to leave first.\n\nWang Rui nodded obediently, shouldered her schoolbag, and also went upstairs to her room.\n\nZhou Ze took the opportunity to stand up and say his goodbyes.\n\nWang Ke tried to keep him to chat a little longer. He felt he ought to inject a bit more vitality into his childhood friend's outlook on life, but it was clearly a case of playing a lute to a cow.\n\nLeaving Wang Ke's home, Zhou Ze didn't rush off. Instead, he sat down on a bench in the residential complex's garden.\n\nA moment later, a petite figure walked up behind Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Very angry?\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't need to turn around to know who it was.\n\n\"Too angry to feel anything.\"\n\nThe little loli sat down on the bench next to Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Was your Chinese class taught by a math teacher?\"¹ the little loli sneered.\n\nWhen she was on the video call with Zhou Ze earlier, he had actually torn the person's soul to shreds!\n\nAnd he had the gall to say he'd understood her meaning!\n\n\"Heh, I seem to recall being the Chinese class representative back in the day.\"\n\n\"Then your reading comprehension is truly top marks,\" the little loli said huffily. \"You just killed her like that. Doesn't that mean if this gets out, there'll be no room for negotiation at all?\"\n\n\"And if I'd kept her alive, there would have been?\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head and said nonchalantly:\n\n\"The person... oh no, the ghost is already dead. There's no point discussing it now.\"\n\n\"So what do you plan to do now?\"\n\n\"What do you mean, 'what do I do'? I'll just keep living my life.\"\n\n\"You lit the powder keg and now you're just going to pretend nothing happened?\"\n\nZhou Ze fell silent.\n\nAfter ten minutes,\n\nZhou Ze spoke up: \"Are there any cultivation methods?\"\n\n\"You want to learn?\" The little loli looked at Zhou Ze, a little surprised. \"You want to get stronger?\"\n\n\"I get bored sometimes, so I thought I'd find something to do.\"\n\n\"Do you think this is some idiotic cultivation fantasy novel?\n\nLike those books on the shelves in your store?\n\nFor us Ghost Emissaries, like me, all our abilities are fixed from the moment we return to the mortal realm. Our talents, our divine powers, they're all set in stone.\n\nUnless you become a temple god and accumulate incense offerings, or use some other sinister method, proper cultivation might have some effect in Hell, but here in the mortal realm, it's useless.\"\n\n\"Well, that's quite a headache, isn't it.\"\n\nZhou Ze looked a bit disheartened.\n\nHe subconsciously reached up and rubbed his temples.\n\nBut inwardly, he also felt at ease. The last trace of guilt was wiped away.\n\n*See? It's not that I don't want to improve myself, not that I want to be a salted fish. The fact is, there's no difference between cultivating and not cultivating.*\n\n\"However...\" The little loli's tone suddenly shifted.\n\nAnd then,\n\nBoss Zhou shot to his feet,\n\nstrode quickly to the complex entrance, and raised his hand to hail a cab.\n\nHe was one step short of covering his ears, stomping his feet, and shouting, \"I'm not listening, I'm not listening, a tortoise is chanting scriptures!\"\n\nThis left the little loli, who had been about to make a turn and whet Zhou Ze's appetite, completely dumbfounded.\n\nSon of a bitch!\n\nWas this guy really that afraid I'd reveal some cultivation method and stop him from being a salted fish?!\n\n***\n\n¹ A common Chinese insult implying someone has poor language and comprehension skills, as if they were taught by a teacher from a completely unrelated, logic-based subject.",

    "content": "Taxis are a very strange phenomenon.\n\nWhen you don’t need one, they cruise past you one after another, their \"Vacant\" lights on, the driver even giving you a wink, as if inviting you to get in.\n\nBut when you do need one, you'll find they’ve vanished. Even if you spot one, it’s already occupied.\n\nBoss Zhou was in this exact situation right now.\n\nWhere's a cab?\n\nWhere's a cab?\n\nWhere did all the cabs go?\n\n\"Hey.\"\n\nThe little loli, her hands clasped behind her back, slowly walked over.\n\nTo be honest, the little loli was somewhat in despair over Zhou Ze.\n\nThrough a bizarre twist of fate, their roles had been reversed. Zhou Ze, who was once a \"dispose after use\" figure in her eyes, had now become the \"Head Constable\" who held her life and death in his hands.\n\nWhether she liked it or not, nothing could change the current situation and reality.\n\nThus, every time Zhou Ze did something out of line, the little loli had no choice but to help him wipe his ass, just like that stupid female zombie in her eyes.\n\nThis was Tongcheng, and she was a Ghost Messenger of Tongcheng. She also had a subordinate relationship with Zhou Ze, so they truly rose and fell together.\n\nShe hadn't seen any rising, but there had been a lot of falling lately.\n\nSorrowful.\n\nHeart-weary.\n\nHowever, she was one of the people who most wanted to see Zhou Ze get his act together and not turn into a salty fish,¹ giving her the feeling of a wife looking at her good-for-nothing husband.\n\nShe'd beat him and scold him, telling him to look at how hard other husbands worked while he only knew how to mooch at home, lacking any ambition. But after the beating and scolding, she still had to make sure he hadn't starved to death.\n\nZhou Ze lit a cigarette, no longer bothering to wave down a cab. He simply said, \"Go on.\"\n\n\"You know that guy who used to run the Netherworld Shop in Rongcheng, right?\"\n\n\"Cut the crap.\"\n\n\"He was able to become much stronger than before.\" When the little loli spoke of that person, the nightmarish memories of that rainy night in Rongcheng seemed to be stirred up again, and her expression turned serious. \"If you can find him, you can go ask him. Of course, his method might not be suitable for you, because there are huge differences between you two.\"\n\nBack then, the Ghost Messengers of Rongcheng were the first to discover him.\n\nUnder their pursuit, that person could only flee with his head in his hands at the beginning, completely powerless to fight back.\n\nIn fact, if the Ghost Messengers of Rongcheng hadn't been led on a merry chase by that boy who seemed able to see through even the minds of ghosts, that person would have been caught long ago.\n\nThat boy was killed because of that incident.\n\nGhost Messengers rarely killed people—perhaps it was more accurate to say they didn't dare to—but that boy was still killed. Because he could even deceive ghosts; those eyes seemed to be able to see through and perceive everything.\n\nAnd then, that man who could only flee before, actively came back.\n\nWhile the people around him were being captured or injured and chased off one by one, he returned.\n\nAfter that came the bloody night, souls burning, everyone killing each other, and what fell to the ground were Ghost Messenger credentials.\n\nAs she spoke, the little loli kicked a small stone out of her way. She didn't want to recall that scene anymore, but she continued anyway.\n\n\"I remember the Faceless Woman talking about you in front of me. Her evaluation of you was very high, terrifyingly high, even. I didn't understand what she meant before, but now I think I get it.\n\n\"Actually, there's another way, one that's more suitable for you, and it will definitely work.\"\n\n\"Speak.\"\n\n\"You are a sliver of consciousness born while that powerful existence was in a coma, and you've formed an independent personality, even possessing the form of a soul.\n\n\"That old hag called you nothing but a watchdog. You might as well accept that for now.\"\n\nZhou Ze fell into deep thought. He seemed to have understood something.\n\n\"You are the watchdog, you guard the main gate, and you're guarding a massive treasure trove!\n\n\"You can...\n\n\"Embezzle from your own post!\"\n\nEmbezzle from my own post!\n\nThe corner of Zhou Ze's mouth twitched subconsciously.\n\n\"Isn't he still incomplete?\n\n\"Isn't he still not awakened?\n\n\"Isn't he still fragmented?\n\n\"This is your chance!\n\n\"His power,\n\n\"His abilities,\n\n\"His innate divine talents!\"\n\nAs she spoke, the little loli proactively grabbed Zhou Ze's hand and, prying his fingers open, said, \"Take these black fingernails, for example. This is a manifestation of you embezzling from your own post! You've already unconsciously completed a part of it. Even if it's just a small part, for a long time, it was actually enough for you to protect yourself, even enough to support you in your duties as a Ghost Messenger.\n\n\"You can steal more.\n\n\"You can pilfer more.\n\n\"Steal everything of his, or, steal half!\n\n\"As long as you steal half, will you still need to be afraid of him waking up?\n\n\"To take it to an extreme, back when you were just a temporary Ghost Messenger, you had the courage to entertain the thought of replacing me. Do you not dare to think of replacing him now?\n\n\"You are Zhou Ze, you are an independent personality, you are a person!\n\n\"Why can't you?\"\n\nAfter hearing these words, Zhou Ze looked at his own fingers and nodded silently.\n\nThat's right.\n\nInstead of seeking advice from others on how to cultivate and become stronger, he clearly had a treasure trove like the Sutra Pavilion of the Shaolin Temple right beside him, with the key in his own hand. Why should he seek from afar what was close at hand?\n\n\"Whether you take it or not, these things are just sitting here.\n\n\"If you don't take them, they aren't yours.\n\n\"If you take them, they become yours.\n\n\"Leaving them here is just a waste.\"\n\nThe little loli's words carried a certain seductive incitement.\n\n\"So, only by taking them and moving them into your own house do they become your own.\"\n\n\"But if he wakes up and replaces me, wouldn't that be more beneficial for you?\" Zhou Ze asked, looking at the little loli.\n\n\"I'm just a Ghost Messenger.\" The little loli smiled. \"If that thing inside you fully awakens, in his eyes, I'm just a fart. He probably wouldn't even mind swallowing me along with you when he devours you. After all, my soul blood is in your hands too.\"\n\nThat explanation made sense.\n\n\"I understand,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"From now on, take a small portion of your precious time for sunbathing, reading newspapers, and drinking coffee, and give it a try,\" the little loli continued to persuade.\n\nLike a worried mother trying her best to persuade her good-for-nothing, brain-damaged son to show a bit of ambition.\n\n\"Right, one more question.\" Zhou Ze looked at the little loli before him. \"You said quite a lot just now.\"\n\n*And wasn't it all for you.*\n\n\"Can you tell me what you did before you died?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"An entrepreneur. A female entrepreneur,\" the little loli answered directly.\n\n\"Oh?\"\n\n\"I made my fortune by embezzling state-owned assets during the privatization of state-owned enterprises.\"\n\nZhou Ze had an epiphany.\n\nNo wonder this girl was so skilled when she was persuading him to embezzle from his own post.\n\n...\n\nTaking a taxi back to the bookstore, Zhou Ze spent the entire ride pondering how to embezzle from his own post.\n\nThe mountain of treasure was right in front of him, and he had the key to the gate, as he could actively awaken it. However, he didn't know how to move the gold and silver from there to his own house.\n\nIt was a very frustrating problem. A bit like that night when the Faceless Woman, disguised as Doctor Lin, tried to seduce him.\n\nWilling, but unable.\n\nBy the time he got out of the car, it was already evening. The lights in the shop were on.\n\nAnd then, he saw that the bookstore was full of people.\n\nYes, full of people.\n\nAccording to Boss Zhou's memory, his bookstore hadn't been this lively in a long time.\n\nWalking into the bookstore, he saw mostly young people who looked like students, both male and female. They sat quietly in their seats, looking at the books in front of them, looking at their notebooks. A few of them were moving their lips slightly, probably reciting English words.\n\nZhou Ze was a bit puzzled.\n\nTonight, business was really good.\n\nXu Qinglang was sitting by the counter. When Zhou Ze approached, Xu Qinglang shrugged and said, \"What do you think? Isn't business surprisingly good tonight?\"\n\n\"What's going on?\"\n\nThe sudden arrival of so many ghosts meant so much business. Boss Zhou was a little unused to it.\n\nHe'd been living a hard life for too long. What a masochist.\n\n\"The Gaokao² starts at dawn.\"\n\nXu Qinglang lit a cigarette, blew out a smoke ring, and continued, \"These are the spirits of students. They don't know they're dead and still think they have to take the Gaokao tomorrow, so they've come here to study for it.\"\n\n\"So many?\"\n\n\"Yup. And some who failed the Gaokao before and committed suicide by jumping off a building.\"\n\n\"Oh.\"\n\nThe two men sat together by the counter, smoking.\n\nZhou Ze wasn't in a hurry to collect these people into the Gates of Hell for merit points. They were all reviewing with such intensity and focus, and Zhou Ze didn't want to disturb them for the time being.\n\n\"My grades were never good, ever since I was a kid,\" Xu Qinglang lamented. \"I never experienced the Gaokao.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded and said, \"When I was in school, the pretty ones in class usually didn't have very good grades.\"\n\n\"...\" went Xu Qinglang.\n\n\"What about you? Your grades must have been excellent, right? A top student? Otherwise, you couldn't have become a genius surgeon, right?\"\n\n\"You can check the records. I was that year's top scorer in the sciences for Tongcheng.\"\n\nXu Qinglang was stunned for a moment. \"Whoa, I couldn't tell. You were a top scholar.\"\n\n\"So what if I was a top scholar? In the end, I still became a ghost.\"\n\nAnother customer walked in through the bookstore's entrance. It was a woman, dressed plainly.\n\nA familiar face. She had been to the shop before.\n\n\"Oh, you've moved. It took me quite a while to find you,\" the woman said.\n\n\"Oh, have a seat for a bit. You can head on your way later,\" Zhou Ze said, pointing to a chair nearby.\n\n\"Ah, alright.\"\n\nThe woman sat down.\n\nShe had come to Zhou Ze's bookstore before, accompanying that rich girl who had lost her Corgi.\n\nBut back then, she said she needed to stay and support her son, who was taking the Gaokao this year, so Zhou Ze had shown mercy and let her leave, not taking her down to hell.\n\nAt dawn, the Gaokao would begin. Her task of supporting him was over, so as promised, she came to report.\n\n\"Why not wait until the results are out? You could at least see which university your son gets into,\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"What's there to see? As his mother, I've done all I can. I accompanied him every night as he studied late. When he fell asleep, I would watch over him. His father is careless, so I had to send him dreams from time to time to tell him what to feed our son the next day, what supplements to give him.\n\n\"He's taking the Gaokao.\n\n\"No matter how well or poorly he does, no matter what school he gets into, I don't care anymore.\n\n\"He has his own life, his own path to walk. It's just the Gaokao. His life is just beginning. The road ahead is very, very long. It's not something that can be completely determined by one exam. His future still depends on his own efforts.\"\n\n\"It's good that you can see it that way,\" Zhou Ze nodded.\n\nAnd so they sat, almost until the sky began to lighten. The bookstore closed much later than usual today.\n\nThe time was about right.\n\nZhou Ze stood up.\n\nFirst, he opened the Gates of Hell.\n\nThen he clapped his hands and shouted to the students in the bookstore, who had also been studying all night, \"It's time for the Gaokao. Students, come over here to get your admission tickets. I wish you all a safe journey.\"\n\nBeside him, Xu Qinglang brought out the pastries and sticky rice zongzi he had rushed to make in the latter half of the night. He called out to the student spirits who were now standing up, \"Before you go, take a rice cake and a zongzi. Uncle wishes you... *gao zong* (high passing)!\"³\n\n***\n\n**Footnotes:**\n\n1.  **Salty fish (鹹魚):** A popular Chinese internet slang term for someone who is lazy and unambitious, content to just lie around and do nothing.\n2.  **Gaokao (高考):** The National College Entrance Examination in China, a highly competitive and culturally significant event that determines university admission.\n3.  ***Gao zong* (糕粽):** A pun.

    "content": "Boss Zhou’s harvest today was truly massive; it could even be said that he hadn't had a haul this big in a very long time. Whether in merit points or hell money, he had made a killing this time.\n\nAfter all, no matter the era or the industry, students' money was always the easiest to earn.\n\nAfter sending this batch of student souls on their way, Zhou Ze took a shower, then went upstairs to rest. Bai Yingying had already made the bed and, having scrubbed herself squeaky clean and smelling sweet, was waiting.\n\nWalking to the bedside, Zhou Ze didn't rush to get in. Instead, he first stood by the window and lit a cigarette.\n\nXu Qing knew about this habit of Zhou Ze's, joking that while others savored their post-coital smoke, Boss Zhou preferred a pre-game one.\n\nBut today, Boss Zhou’s “pre-game smoke” stretched into several cigarettes in a row.\n\nLying in bed, already posed and ready, Bai Yingying noticed something was strange. She was just short of crying out:\n\n\"Boss, come on, come on over...\"\n\nZhou Ze turned his head, saw Yingying, and smiled. \"Sorry. I was really sleepy, but now I'm not.\"\n\nWith that, he lit another cigarette.\n\nBai Yingying got out of bed, brought a chair over for Zhou Ze to sit in, and stood behind him, kneading his shoulders. She asked in a soft voice:\n\n\"What are you thinking about, Boss?\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't answer. Instead, he silently spread his hands. Ten black fingernails slowly grew out, specks of black mist swirling and brewing between them.\n\nBai Yingying’s body trembled several times. She had an instinctive fear of Zhou Ze’s nails.\n\n\"You tell me, besides these fungal nails, what do I have left?\"\n\nZhou Ze seemed to be asking Bai Yingying, yet also talking to himself.\n\nThe little loli had given Zhou Ze the suggestion to \"guard and steal from himself.\"¹\n\nSo now, Zhou Ze was beginning to seriously consider this problem.\n\nHow to steal,\n\nin what manner to steal,\n\nand how to steal in a way that wouldn't arouse the slightest suspicion from the authorities, wouldn't cause backlash or investigation, and might even earn you their thanks.\n\nThis was a truly profound art.\n\nBai Yingying didn't understand what the boss meant. Since she didn't understand, she didn't ask any more questions and focused on giving him a massage.\n\nJust then,\n\nZhou Ze's phone rang. It was the little loli.\n\n\"Hello, what's up?\"\n\nThey had just seen each other the night before. Zhou Ze found it a bit strange for her to be calling now.\n\n\"Just a small thing. A Ghost Emissary from Changzhou needs to pass through Tongcheng and gave me a heads-up. I'm just letting you know.\"\n\n\"Oh.\"\n\nThe call ended.\n\nZhou Ze rubbed his temples and sank back into thought.\n\nHumans possess a natural ability to imitate. When this ability evolves from its most primitive state, it becomes \"learning.\"\n\nAfter hanging up the phone, Zhou Ze slowly closed his eyes and began to recall the feeling of that consciousness inside him awakening.\n\nThe best kind of theft,\n\nis actually imitation.\n\nA scholar's business, can that be called stealing?²\n\nBesides, when all is said and done, it was all his own stuff anyway.\n\nBai Yingying noticed the boss's breathing was slowly growing long and steady. She thought he had fallen asleep and began to ease up on the massage.\n\nIn reality, Zhou Ze wasn't asleep. His mind was still very clear. He had just temporarily cast aside his distracting thoughts and begun to immerse himself completely in that state.\n\nThe first time he entered that state,\n\nwas on the skyscraper rooftop, facing Lady in Blue,\n\nwhen he had been swaying back and forth on the edge of the roof, teetering on the line between life and death.\n\nAfter that was at the Lin family home, during the fight with his sister-in-law's Ghost Emissary soul, and then later in places like Yancheng and General Mountain.\n\nEvery time,\n\nwhen that consciousness awakened,\n\nthat air of looking down on everything,\n\nthat absolute confidence,\n\nthat feeling as if everything was under his control,\n\nZhou Ze was slowly trying to summon those emotions now.\n\nAnd then,\n\nBai Yingying, who was still gently massaging Zhou Ze, suddenly froze. She saw his skin slowly shriveling, and the aura around him retracting more and more, retracting to the point where she could no longer sense any trace of a living person's presence.\n\nAt the same time, Zhou Ze’s nails began to grow even longer, emitting a dark, spectral sheen. The air around them grew heavy and oppressive, as if everything had fallen into stagnation.\n\nBai Yingying’s little heart pounded—*thump, thump, thump*. The pressure originating from her very bloodline was almost too much for her to bear. She even felt the urge to kneel.\n\nThis was the first time Bai Yingying had been this close to Zhou Ze in this state. Previously, she had only been responsible for taking care of him after he was paralyzed.\n\n\"Boss... Boss...\"\n\nZhou Ze’s eyes remained closed as he continued to meticulously chase and search for that feeling. Perhaps because he was so immersed in it, Zhou Ze himself was completely unaware of the changes happening to his own body.\n\nThe nails grew longer and longer.\n\nZhou Ze’s body became more and more stooped.\n\nOriginally, he had been slumped lazily back in the chair, as this made it more comfortable and convenient for Bai Yingying's massage.\n\nNow,\n\nZhou Ze's body seemed to be deflating like a balloon, starting to shrink, like a person entering old age as their body's moisture is lost.\n\nBut those nails,\n\nthey had truly grown to a jaw-dropping length.\n\nZhou Ze's hands were resting on his knees,\n\nbut his nails now,\n\nhad grown long enough to touch the floor, a good few decimeters long, almost long enough to be used as scythes.\n\nAnd the originally black nails now had a dark red luster flowing across them.\n\n*Zzzzt... zzzzt...*\n\nThe tips of the ten nails scraped against the tile floor, actually kicking up a shower of sparks. The tiles looked as if they had been melted by the heat, leaving deep marks behind.\n\nBai Yingying was stunned silly.\n\nSo thick,\n\nso long,\n\nso hard.\n\nIf you got stabbed by that,\n\nwho could possibly take it!\n\n*Ying ying ying ying ying!!!!*\n\nZhou Ze was completely oblivious to his maidservant's reaction. He didn't even know that he had, without realizing it, unlocked a new \"position.\"\n\nIt seemed so simple.\n\nBut in reality, if not for the little loli's words during the day, Zhou Ze would never have thought to do this. This was perhaps a case of being too close to the problem to see it clearly.\n\nBut at least, for now, the effect was immediate.\n\n*Wooooom...*\n\nHowever,\n\njust as Zhou Ze was still immersed in this feeling of \"recollection,\"\n\nhis body suddenly gave a slight shudder.\n\nBai Yingying, who was still sighing with emotion at how thick and large they were, saw her expression instantly fixate. She felt a drastic change in the boss's aura.\n\nIn the unseen world,\n\nZhou Ze felt his consciousness sink into a swamp filled with viscous liquid. By the time he became aware of it, he wanted to open his eyes and wake from his deep thought but found he simply couldn't.\n\n*Crack... crack... crack...*\n\nZhou Ze’s body began to tremble violently.\n\nCracks started to appear in the chair.\n\nThen it shattered completely, turning into a spray of flying fragments.\n\nBut Zhou Ze, with no chair beneath him, remained in a sitting posture, not falling at all.\n\nHis body's weight and balance were completely supported by those ten nails.\n\nA very strange posture,\n\na very jarring image.\n\nZhou Ze's eyelids began to flutter madly, as if in a violent struggle.\n\nThat consciousness,\n\nthat consciousness had actually been unintentionally triggered by his \"recollection\"?\n\nThis seemed to be an inevitable result. Zhou Ze had never tried to stop it from awakening before, because every time he let it awaken, it was by his own intention.\n\nWhen encountering a critical situation,\n\nwhen he needed a more powerful force,\n\nZhou Ze would actively summon its awakening to borrow its power.\n\nBut this time,\n\nZhou Ze was not the one who initiated it.\n\nAnd Zhou Ze knew that if he were truly in absolute danger, summoning it would be one thing—a matter of choosing the lesser of two evils—but right now, he was about to go to sleep, in the bookstore.\n\nWhat was the point of waking it up for no reason?\n\nThis was like doing business; it was truly a terrible loss. The cost and the return were completely incomparable.\n\nRestrain,\n\nrestrain,\n\nrestrain!\n\nZhou Ze slowly tilted his head back.\n\nHe was竭力 trying to suppress the awakening of that consciousness, fighting to maintain control of his own body.\n\nYou,\n\nget,\n\nback!\n\n*Crackle... pop... crackle...*\n\nIn the next room, Xu Qing, who was lying in bed reading a bedtime story, suddenly noticed that the lights in the room seemed to have a problem and began to flicker on and off.\n\nIn the old Daoist's room, the monkey immediately jumped off the bed, chittering, \"Squeak squeak squeak!\"\n\nThe old Daoist was dead asleep. He clamped his legs around the blanket, rolled over, and continued to sleep.\n\nAnd the death-knight, who had been sitting on the bed in the same room all night,\n\nknelt directly on the floor.\n\nAs the ancient saying goes, \"When a Hanba appears, a thousand li of land turns barren.\"³ The commotion from Zhou Ze's side was of course not as exaggerated as \"a thousand li of land turns barren,\" but his immediate surroundings, and the people around him, were all very clearly affected.\n\n\"Urgh...\"\n\nA suppressed sound came from Zhou Ze's throat.\n\nHe felt like he was in a tug-of-war.\n\nThe prize of this tug-of-war was whether the key to this door could still hang from his own waist.\n\nIf the other party could still awaken and take control of this body against his will, it would mean that it had already seized absolute initiative.\n\nA series of crisp cracks echoed from his joints.\n\nZhou Ze slowly raised his head,\n\nthe veins on his neck bulging.\n\nHis mouth opened in a silent roar.\n\nAt that moment, the windows of all the rooms on the second floor of the bookstore, including the TV and computer screens, shattered in unison.\n\nAfter it was all over,\n\nZhou Ze's body swayed, but he managed to stabilize himself with the nails driven into the floor.\n\n\"Hah... hah... hah...\"\n\nHis mouth hung wide open as he gasped for breath.\n\nZhou Ze slowly opened his eyes.\n\nWithin his pupils,\n\nthere was still clarity.\n\nBut a cold sweat had already drenched Zhou Ze's entire body.\n\nHe was terrified.\n\nBecause just now, Zhou Ze had clearly sensed that the other entity seemed to know his intentions and had launched a counterattack!\n\nAlthough he had suppressed it this time, the next time he wanted to steal some things in the same way, he would really have to think twice.\n\nHowever,\n\nwhen Zhou Ze's eyes fell on his ten nails, now so long they could be snapped off and given to peasant uncles to use as scythes for harvesting wheat,\n\na smile appeared on his lips.\n\nAt least,\n\nthis round,\n\nwasn't a loss.\n\n***\n\n**Footnotes:**\n\n1.  **\"Guard and steal from himself\" (监守自盗):** This is a Chinese idiom that means to embezzle or steal something one is supposed to be protecting. Here, it's used literally to describe Zhou Ze's plan to \"steal\" control over the power residing within him.\n2.  **\"A scholar's business, can that be called stealing?\" (讀書人的事兒，能叫偷麼？):** A famous, sarcastic line from \"Kong Yiji,\" a short story by the renowned Chinese author Lu Xun.

    "title": "Chapter 231: A ghost mess outside the country",
    "content": "*The Great Salted Fish Codex*, Volume One, Chapter One, Article One:\n\n\"One must know when to be content.\"\n\nAs a man who aspired to be the King of Salted Fish, Boss Zhou waved his \"new claws\" around a few times. Like a child who'd just gotten a new toy, he was giddy for a moment, but it wasn't long before he retracted the claws, went downstairs to take another shower, and then went to bed, cuddling his maid, Bai.\n\nThis act of \"guarding the granary while stealing the grain\"¹ was truly dangerous, especially since the consciousness within his body was repulsed by it and had even begun to resist. Fortunately, Zhou Ze managed to suppress it.\n\nBut from another perspective, the feeling was actually quite thrilling.\n\nBoss Zhou felt like he'd successfully \"snatched a chicken,\"² and with the mentality that he'd already come out ahead, he slept especially soundly.\n\nPerhaps because he had expended too much energy last night, Zhou Ze didn't wake up until the afternoon. When he got up, he found that many parts of his body were sore, like the aftermath of someone who rarely exercised but had suddenly, on a whim, shouted \"Time to lose weight!\" and forced themselves through a workout.\n\nAs a former doctor, Zhou Ze naturally knew this was due to a sudden overproduction of lactic acid, so he paid it no mind. He casually went downstairs to wash up, then sat down on the first floor.\n\nBai Yingying immediately brought him tea and today's newspaper, which she had specially ironed beforehand.\n\nFor a long time, nobles would have their servants iron the newspaper before they read it. This was because old printing technology was poor, and ironing the paper prevented the ink from staining one's fingers while reading. That wasn't really a problem anymore, but Bai Yingying liked the sense of ritual.\n\nZhou Ze let her be.\n\nThese days, under Bai Yingying's meticulous care, Boss Zhou was very much like one of those old Manchu gentry from the late Qing dynasty, who would stroll out every morning with a birdcage in hand.³\n\nThe Old Taoist was watching the news, sitting by the bar with the monkey in his lap. He picked for lice on the monkey as he watched.\n\nActually, Houza was very clean and knew how to groom itself, but the Old Taoist was used to the feeling anyway. It didn't matter if he found any lice; the monkey's fur was soft, felt great in his hands, and was very pleasant to knead and rub.\n\nHouza quite enjoyed it too, resting its little head against the Old Taoist's chest, looking utterly content.\n\nThe idle state of the man and monkey was even more decadent and languid than the government offices described by common folk, where people supposedly just drink tea and read newspapers all day.\n\n\"Yo, Boss, this celebrity killed himself.\"\n\nThe Old Taoist pointed at the TV screen and called out to Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Who?\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't even look up. He wasn't interested in entertainment news.\n\n\"The male singer who sang *'%￥@@#'*.\"\n\n\"Oh.\"\n\nHe knew the song, not the person.\n\n\"He went on Weibo early this morning and exposed his own affair, his drug use, and the fact that he's gay. Wow, damn, it's like he reached enlightenment and became a Buddha. He aired all his own dirty laundry online, then jumped to his death from a hotel building. Tsk tsk, this humble Taoist quite liked a few of his songs.\"\n\nAs he spoke, the Old Taoist reached out and stroked the monkey's fur.\n\n\"Houza likes them too, often plays his songs on its phone.\"\n\n\"Oh.\"\n\nBoss Zhou continued to enjoy the pleasant sensation of the ironed newspaper. He really had no interest in this kind of news.\n\nDead people, he'd seen plenty.\n\nMen, women, tall, short, plump, slender, beautiful, witty, scumbags, good husbands, and so on and so forth.\n\nIn Boss Zhou's eyes, they had practically become like Nanjing salted ducks on a production line.\n\nThey arrive stark naked, get packaged up in a routine fashion, and are then dispatched for Hell to receive.\n\nIt's said that some forensic pathologists like to sleep at their workplace because it makes them feel the warmth of companionship. It might not really be a sign of psychological problems; after all, humans are highly adaptable animals.\n\n\"Hey, wait a minute.\"\n\nThe Old Taoist took out his phone and scrolled some more, exclaiming in surprise, \"Boss, this singer had a commercial performance in Tongcheng yesterday. He jumped from the top floor of the Tongcheng Grand Hotel.\"\n\n\"Oh.\"\n\nFor a long time, the Tongcheng Grand Hotel was a landmark in the hearts of Tongcheng's residents. More than a decade ago, when people from Tongcheng wanted to brag, they'd boast about having eaten at the Tongcheng Grand Hotel the other day.\n\nThe Old Taoist grew more and more excited, completely ignoring his boss's perfunctory replies. He continued, \"Boss, do you think he'll come to our bookstore tonight? I'd better get the cow's tears ready.⁴ If he comes, maybe we can even hear him sing a song live.\"\n\nZhou Ze looked up and glanced at the Old Taoist.\n\n\"Not every dead person comes to our bookstore,\" Zhou Ze reminded him.\n\nIf every dead person had to come to the bookstore, the shop's GDP would be terrifying. Boss Zhou would be too busy to even have time for coffee; surpassing constables and outperforming inspectors would likely be a breeze.\n\nBut in reality, the vast majority of souls go to Hell on their own. Only a small minority of disobedient little souls are sent to Hell through the channel of the bookstore.\n\n\"Boss, I think he has a great grievance. Look, he exposed all his own dark history right before he died, and *then* committed suicide. There must be a great injustice in all this!\"\n\n\"So?\"\n\n\"So it's very likely he'll really come to the bookstore tonight!\" the Old Taoist said, full of celebrity-chasing fervor.\n\nHonestly, the Old Taoist's method of chasing stars could, to a certain extent, be said to completely blow the famous \"Hongqiao First Sister\"⁵ out of the water.\n\nYou block the airport entrance; I'll block the entrance to Hell.\n\n\"You want to chase stars? I know a place with lots of stars, including ones I like, such as Zhang Rong and Mei Fang.\"\n\n\"Really?\" the Old Taoist asked in pleasant surprise.\n\n\"Yeah. Go find a rope and hang yourself. I'll be responsible for sending your soul to Hell. You might even catch their underground concert.\"\n\n\"...\" said the Old Taoist.\n\nThat evening, Xu Qinglang once again prepared a grand feast. For the first time, Boss Zhou solemnly took out his treasured Other Shore Flower brand juice. He took a careful sip, and in the next moment, his appetite soared. He truly ate his fill!\n\nThe others at the table looked at Boss Zhou in much the same way they had watched the old woman from the Bridge of Helplessness wolf down her food two days prior.\n\nIt was true, then. The living conditions in Hell were terrible. Look how starved these ghosts were.\n\nAfter dinner, feeling a bit stuffed, Boss Zhou simply moved a chair to the bookstore entrance and sat down. Riding the lingering effects of the Other Shore Flower medicine, Zhou Ze took the candied fruits from Bai Yingying and continued to eat.\n\nA blissful meal. The wonderful feeling of enjoying food. This long-lost happiness... if Boss Zhou hadn't deliberately held it in, he might have cried right there at the dinner table.\n\nXu Qinglang walked to the shop entrance and lit a cigarette, a somewhat dejected look on his face.\n\nToday's meal marked the impending exit of Xu Qinglang's signature line of plum juice-based beverages from the market.\n\nNo words were spoken, no exchange was made. After finishing his cigarette, Xu Qinglang went back into the bookstore to busy himself with his own affairs.\n\nBoss Zhou comfortably enjoyed the last of the evening clamor on South Avenue, while also mentally calculating whether he should spend some time tonight practicing with the scythe-claws that had appeared yesterday to get the hang of them, or if he should try to pull another fast one.\n\nThe latter impulse was quickly suppressed by Zhou Ze. *Forget it. Don't bite off more than you can chew. Take it slow.*\n\nA small car pulled up in front of the bookstore. The window rolled down, and Zhou Ze saw, sitting inside, a... man in a blue dress!\n\nThe piece of candied fruit in his throat suddenly got stuck, and Zhou Ze started coughing.\n\nThe person turned his face and looked at Zhou Ze, a hint of dissatisfaction in his expression, but he didn't say anything.\n\nHe took out his phone, as if reconfirming his location. Finally, he glanced toward Zhou Ze again, then pushed open the car door and got out.\n\nOnly when the person was out of the car did Zhou Ze realize he might have been mistaken earlier. The person was wearing an exquisite black suit; in the car, he must have draped a woman's dress over himself while driving.\n\nBefore the person even got close, a fragrance had already permeated the air. It was the smell of perfume, pungent and thick.\n\nIn this situation, Zhou Ze really wanted to call Xu Qinglang out for a face-off.\n\n*You've met your match!*\n\nHowever, Zhou Ze soon noticed a difference. Old Xu was a straight man; he had no issues with his function or interest in that department. His feminine features were natural. But the man before him was filled with an air of affectation. And as a veteran surgeon, Zhou Ze could tell that the man's face had likely seen quite a few knives; he had been surgically sculpted to have a feminine aura.\n\n\"I've come to your territory, so I'm paying my respects. My name is Liu Chuyu, a newly-appointed Ghost Emissary from Changzhou. I'm here tonight to take a soul into custody and escort it back.\"\n\nThe person extended a hand toward Zhou Ze, intending to shake it, but he had first placed a handkerchief over his own palm. The meaning was obvious: he thought Zhou Ze's hand was dirty.\n\nBoss Zhou had his own mysophobia. Seeing this, he just chuckled, not bothering to shake the guy's hand, and asked directly, \"Lin Ke told me a Ghost Emissary from Changzhou would be crossing into my territory. What's this, coming here to take a ghost from me? Stealing my business?\"\n\n\"I can compensate you in other ways. This soul is very important to me. I need to personally see him off, and there might be some... accidents along the way.\"\n\nThe person bent down, looking at Zhou Ze.\n\n\"If my attitude and posture are making you uncomfortable, then I apologize in advance. I don't want to cause trouble here. I'm not being arrogant or aloof. It's because the inertia of this body is too strong. Many of my current behaviors and details are driven by this body's old habits. I haven't fully adapted yet, my apologies.\"\n\n\"The body's inertia?\"\n\n\"Oh, to put it simply, this body instinctively repels and despises men, yet he himself was a man.\"\n\nLiu Chuyu wore an expression of utter despair.\n\n\"Ending up in this host body... I'm quite desperate myself.\"\n\nAs he spoke, Liu Chuyu looked Zhou Ze over carefully, smiled, and said, \"Brother, you picked a good body. Quite handsome. I'm really envious of you.\"\n\n\"Heh.\"\n\nZhou Ze had been thinking of telling him that ending up in the body of the man who murdered you wasn't exactly something to be envied.\n\nBut then he looked at the man in front of him.\n\nHe suddenly felt that Xu Le had his own cute side after all.\n\n***\n\n**Footnotes:**\n\n¹ **Guarding the granary while stealing the grain (監守自盜):** A Chinese idiom for an \"inside job\" or abusing one's position for personal gain.

    "content": "In the bookstore,\n\nLiu Chuyu was sitting in a chair. There was tea and a fruit platter next to him, but he didn't grab a book to feign reading. Instead, he took out a makeup mirror and began touching up his own makeup.\n\nThe delicacy, the affectation, that expression...\n\nTsk tsk.\n\nWhen Xu Qinglang saw this scene, he found he couldn't quite stomach it. In the end, out of sight, out of mind, he went straight upstairs to rest.\n\nZhou Ze vaguely heard a contemptuous voice from Xu Qinglang, who had just started up the stairs:\n\n\"Slut.\"\n\nLao Dao, serene as ever, sat at the counter, engrossed in a copy of *The Adventures of ****,¹* occasionally fiddling with his crotch.\n\nBefore, when Lao Dao had nothing to do, he would read *Bai Jie's Teaching Career.* He had even finished the multi-million-word sequel and had re-read it several times over.\n\nIn the end, Lao Dao even started to resent the Boss for being reanimated too soon. He felt that the damned Xu Le should have been allowed to write a bit more. After all, it was a monumental work that would benefit generations, even becoming a deep-seated mark of youth for generations to come.\n\nBai Yingying sat behind Zhou Ze, periodically refilling his hot tea. She herself was holding a copy of *The Self-Cultivation and Refinement of a Maid,* studying it intently.\n\nWhat's more, it was the Japanese version.\n\nZhou Ze was a little surprised that Bai Yingying had actually taught herself Japanese.\n\nBut on second thought, it made sense. For someone who had lived for two hundred years with no mental or physical decline, her intellect could hardly be judged by ordinary standards.\n\nJust like that, night gradually began to fall.\n\nLao Dao was waiting for a lingering soul. He was waiting for that singer, hoping the singer's soul might come over and satisfy his unique celebrity-chasing needs.\n\nThe newly appointed Emissary of Hell from Changzhou, Liu Chuyu, was also waiting for his lingering soul.\n\nZhou Ze stretched.\n\nHe glanced up at the two of them.\n\nCould they be waiting for the same person?\n\nIt seemed...\n\nlike a real possibility.\n\nBut was this colleague from next door also a celebrity chaser?\n\nDid he become an Emissary of Hell just to chase stars?\n\nHeh,\n\nit couldn't be that extreme, could it?\n\n\"Creaaak......\"\n\nThe bookstore door was pushed open.\n\nA tall, thin man wearing a conical bamboo hat walked in. He held a bamboo pole and was, surprisingly, also wearing sunglasses.\n\nWearing sunglasses in the middle of the night.\n\nAnd that conical hat.\n\nIt really made one want to smash his head in.\n\nRadiating an air of \"I'm so badass\" and \"I'm an enlightened master\" from head to toe, the tall, thin man found a seat by the window and sat down. He didn't call for tea, nor did he get a book from the shelves. He just sat there, bolt upright, still wearing his sunglasses.\n\nLao Dao, however, showed some sense. He casually poured a cup of mineral water and brought it over to him, reminding the poser at the same time:\n\n\"One-hundred-yuan minimum charge.\"\n\nPutting the water down, Lao Dao returned to the counter and resumed reading his book.\n\nThe monkey, bored, sidled up to Lao Dao and started picking at his crotch as if searching for lice.\n\nThe monkey was small, and Lao Dao was sitting behind the counter, so Boss Zhou didn't see. If Zhou Ze had seen, he probably would have slapped Lao Dao right across the face.\n\nThere was one image in Zhou Ze's memory that he could never forget: the monkey standing outside the emergency room, pulling out its \"iron rod\" and stroking it furiously.\n\nThe little monkey was still maintaining its initial innocence, which was a good thing. Boss Zhou would not stand by and watch Lao Dao lead the monkey down the wrong path again.\n\nWith one more person, the atmosphere in the bookstore grew even quieter.\n\nNo one spoke, no one chatted.\n\nEveryone was absorbed in their own activities.\n\nZhou Ze simply squinted and leaned back in his chair. Bai Yingying got up and started massaging his shoulders.\n\nHe waited in this half-asleep state until around midnight, when a wind picked up outside. Following that, the temperature seemed to drop a few degrees.\n\nZhou Ze looked up, puzzled, and glanced out the window.\n\nBai Yingying muttered, \"Boss, is what's coming a ghost? What a grand entrance.\"\n\nYes,\n\nthe wind had risen,\n\na light rain had begun to fall.\n\nAll that was missing was the background music; it was a bona fide movie-protagonist entrance.\n\nBoss Zhou had sent off countless ghosts from this bookstore. Others all \"entered the village quietly, no firing of guns,\"² but today was the first time he'd encountered such a high-profile situation.\n\nThe wind was laced with ghostly energy.\n\nIt was a ghost, no doubt about it.\n\nNext, the background music actually appeared. A man was singing outside, a once-popular love song from the nineties. His voice was mellow, carrying a unique, weathered quality.\n\nLao Dao immediately shot to his feet, his face flush with excitement!\n\nHoly crap,\n\nhe really came!\n\nLiu Chuyu didn't move an inch, continuing to admire himself in the mirror. He had held this pose for several hours now; truly, the more he looked at himself, the more he wanted to look, the more handsome he found himself. He was utterly captivated.\n\nThe poser in the conical hat also remained still. He had been sitting bolt upright ever since he came in. His demeanor, in this moment, could rival that of the motionless Deadpool sitting over there; it was as if the two were in a contest.\n\nThe visitor made a grand enough entrance.\n\nThe first to enter...\n\n...was a man in a wine-red suit. He was singing soulfully, his face deathly pale.\n\nLao Dao almost ran over to ask for an autograph, but then he saw that behind the man was a woman, a woman in a red dress. Even the high heels on her feet were red.\n\nOrdinary people couldn't see it,\n\nbut Zhou Ze could.\n\nThe red on this woman's body was already dripping down like a liquid. Wherever she walked, she left behind specks of crimson residue.\n\nLiu Chuyu finally stood up. He walked over to the woman, his eyes blazing as he stared at her.\n\nThe woman looked up at him, then smiled faintly, spreading her hands.\n\n\"Lord Emissary, as we agreed, I have come to be bound and sent to Hell.\"\n\nLiu Chuyu pursed his lips, looking somewhat furious.\n\nZhou Ze could understand why this newly appointed colleague was angry. Perhaps Liu Chuyu and this female ghost had some prior agreement, just like he once had with the woman who accompanied her son during his college entrance exam review.\n\nBut the result now was that...\n\nthe woman had become a vengeful spirit.\n\nAnd vengeful spirits...\n\n...are not qualified to enter Hell for reincarnation.\n\nIt was like a fresh fruit that could have been sold for a good price had rotted. Forget selling it; you'd be afraid of getting a stomachache just from eating it yourself.\n\n\"Let him go. You can't go to Hell; just dissipate on your own. He still can. Release your hold on him, and I will send him to Hell.\"\n\n\"Hey!\"\n\nBai Yingying spoke up resentfully, about to say more.\n\nBut Zhou Ze reached out and grabbed her wrist, signaling her to be quiet.\n\nZhou Ze knew what Bai Yingying wanted to complain about. *You came for the female ghost, but now that you see she's become a vengeful spirit and can't be turned into merit points, you're trying to send the male ghost down instead.*\n\n*This is Tongcheng, this is my Boss's territory.*\n\n*What do you mean, coming here to steal business?*\n\n\"But I want to be with him,\"\n\nThe female ghost's hand was tightly clasped with the male ghost's. The male ghost looked bewildered, while the female ghost's eyes were full of devotion.\n\nNow *this* was what you'd call a die-hard fan.\n\nSo fanatical that even in death,\n\neven as a ghost,\n\nshe had to drag him down to Hell with her.\n\nLao Dao had mentioned during the day that this male singer's death was a bit strange. Before he died, he had exposed all of his own dark history and then jumped off a building.\n\nIt seemed he had been influenced by a ghost.\n\nZhou Ze's mind focused slightly.\n\nA ghost had killed someone in his Tongcheng.\n\nThis was no small matter.\n\n\"You debased yourself, and now you're dragging him down with you. Have some shame!\"\n\nLiu Chuyu stared at the female ghost, enunciating each word.\n\nThe female ghost looked both bashful and aggrieved, but she still knelt before Liu Chuyu, crying and pleading:\n\n\"Lord Emissary, I beg you. With him by my side on the Road to the Underworld, I won't feel lonely.\"\n\n\"The Road to the Underworld? You think you still have a chance to go down that road?\n\nNow, you let him go. I will send him down. He has suffered enough because of you.\"\n\n\"But I had three abortions for him! I gave him everything!\n\nI love him,\n\nI love him more than my own family.\n\nI've already wronged my family,\n\nnow I just want him to be with me, even if we go to Hell together!\"\n\nThe female ghost seemed to have gone mad.\n\nOf course,\n\nif you weren't mad, if your obsessions weren't deep, you couldn't have turned into a vengeful spirit.\n\n\"Get lost!\"\n\nLiu Chuyu turned over the mirror he had been toying with while sitting there. A beam of purple light shot out, striking the female ghost squarely. She was thrown heavily to the ground, her soul becoming much fainter.\n\nImmediately after,\n\nLiu Chuyu grabbed the lingering soul of the male singer.\n\n\"No, no, I beg you, Lord Emissary, no, please, no!!!\"\n\nThe female ghost pleaded miserably, her hands clutching Liu Chuyu's legs.\n\nAnd because of this, Liu Chuyu was actually unable to move.\n\nZhou Ze, who had been contentedly being a \"melon-eating bystander\"³ from the start, finally showed a flicker of realization on his face.\n\nHe had been wondering why this newly appointed colleague from next door would go out of his way to come to Tongcheng to capture a female ghost. Even if this ghost had turned into a vengeful spirit, it wasn't that important; if she came to Tongcheng, the local Emissary of Hell could deal with her just the same.\n\nThe key point was that after her soul had been injured,\n\nshe could still restrain the movements of an Emissary of Hell!\n\nThis was by no means an ordinary female ghost.\n\nTo be precise,\n\nit wasn't that the ghost had undergone some abnormal change after death.\n\nRather, this woman, when she was alive,\n\nwas anything but ordinary!\n\nThis was a big fish.\n\nIn reality, there were people like Baldy Monk who possessed arcane knowledge.\n\nIn fact, Xu Qinglang could be considered one of them, though he was a half-baked one. Lao Dao's ancestors must have been prosperous at some point, otherwise they wouldn't have been able to leave behind such useful talisman paper. And it was like wholesale cabbage; Lao Dao always had another sheet after using one up.\n\nZhou Ze lit a cigarette. He still didn't move. If the female ghost hadn't become a vengeful spirit, Boss Zhou might have just pulled a fast one and stolen the prize for himself.\n\nHowever, while Zhou Ze didn't move, the tall, thin man who had been wearing a conical hat, looking like he desperately wanted the world to know \"I'm so badass,\" slowly stood up.\n\nHe took off the hat,\n\nrevealing a balding head.\n\nHis pair of triangular eyes gave off a very sly impression.\n\nLooking at the female ghost desperately clutching Liu Chuyu's leg and pleading,\n\nlooking at Liu Chuyu, who was continuously striking and berating the female ghost with his mirror,\n\nthe tall, thin man took a deep breath,\n\nand said in a low, solemn voice:\n\n\"You've gone too far, you god-damned Emissaries of Hell.\"\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze.\n\nBoss Zhou, who had been sitting on the side without saying a word or making a move, wore a look of utter, meme-worthy confusion.\n\nThis was truly,\n\nsitting at home, minding your own business,\n\nwhen a pot falls on you from the sky.\n\n---\n**Footnotes:**\n\n1.  *The original title is censored, appearing as 《****歷險記》.*\n2.  *A famously mispronounced line, \"悄悄地進村，打槍滴不要,\" from the classic 1965 Chinese war movie \"Tunnel Warfare\" (地道战).

    "title": "Chapter 233: The Great Immortal Stay!",
    "content": "Boss Zhou really wanted to stand up and curse someone out.\n\nWhat do you mean, \"you lot of Ghost Emissaries\"?\n\nThis is *my* house.\n\nI'm sitting in my own home,\n\nnot doing anything,\n\nnot saying anything,\n\nand I still get lumped in with them?\n\nOf course, Boss Zhou wasn't so impulsive as to immediately jump out, tear off all pretenses, and start a fight. The other party's primary target was clearly Liu Chuyu, the new Ghost Emissary from Changzhou. That pretentious guy obviously had an unusual relationship with the woman.\n\nZhou Ze wasn't really familiar with or knowledgeable about this kind of real-world Xuan cultivator. The scab-headed monk was crazy and erratic with a severe case of eighth-grader syndrome,¹ while Lao Dao and Lady Xu didn't come from orthodox backgrounds.\n\nHaving Liu Chuyu up front to scout the way for him was something Zhou Ze couldn't have asked for more.\n\n*Pa!*\n\nThe female ghost was finally flicked away by Liu Chuyu. At the same time, his mirror suddenly flipped, angled downward, and pressed directly toward the female ghost's face.\n\nThis was an attempt to directly shatter the vengeful spirit, forcibly \"liberating\" her.\n\n*Ding-dong!*\n\nThe tall, skinny man's bamboo pole extended and struck the mirror. The mirror flew backward and landed right on the bar counter.\n\n*Clatter...*\n\nAfter spinning once on the counter, the mirror rolled onto the floor, landing right in front of Lao Dao and Hou'za.\n\nWhen Liu Chuyu had made his move, Lao Dao had one hand clutching his crotch and the other gripping the edge of the bar, crouched behind it like a soldier hiding in a trench, though this particular soldier was trembling.\n\nBut all of a sudden,\n\nA sudden windfall from heaven!\n\nLao Dao stared at the mirror on the floor, his eyes turning green with greed. Of course, he wasn't foolish enough to quickly pick the object up and return it to the esteemed Ghost Emissary from Changzhou. Instead, he subconsciously reached out, wanting to snatch the item and stuff it inside his robes.\n\nAfter all, his two previous Ghost Emissary bosses had killed quite a few of their kind, and by extension, Lao Dao, the subordinate whose only job was to stand by and shout \"666,\"² didn't have much reverence for Ghost Emissaries either.\n\nHowever, the moment Lao Dao's hand touched the mirror, his palm instantly turned bright red. Lao Dao let out a muffled grunt and hastily pulled his hand back.\n\n*Hooo, hooo, hooo...*\n\nBlowing continuously on his burned palm, Lao Dao felt a stampede of ten thousand grass-mud horses³ gallop through his mind.\n\nIn truth, Lao Dao had been too naive. A magical artifact used by a Ghost Emissary, and one that had just been activated at that—how could a mere mortal touch it so easily?\n\nThe monkey to the side scurried forward two steps and reached down with its paw.\n\n\"Hey, don't—\"\n\nLao Dao called out subconsciously.\n\n*Squeak squeak squeak!*\n\nBut the monkey picked up the mirror and began to play with it.\n\nLooking at the monkey's perfectly fine paw,\n\nthen at his own currently burnt pig's trotter,\n\nLao Dao suddenly felt worse than an animal!\n\nAfter playing with it for a bit, Hou'za made a motion as if to toss it to Lao Dao. Terrified, Lao Dao waved his hands frantically, signaling it not to be impulsive.\n\n*Hou'za, I understand your filial piety, but this humble Daoist will pass on this one.*\n\nThe monkey scratched its head in confusion, then pointed the mirror at itself.\n\nIn the mirror,\n\nwhat appeared wasn't a cute, dorky monkey face,\n\nbut a ferocious adult ape with a vicious aura, its brow heavy with a lust for... yin bullets!\n\n*SQUEAK SQUEAK SQUEAK!!!!!*\n\nThe monkey was so scared it smashed the mirror on the ground,\n\nand collapsed onto the floor itself.\n\nWhat was that?\n\nScared the heck outta me!\n\nOver on the other side,\n\nafter knocking the magical artifact from the Ghost Emissary's hand with a bamboo pole, the skinny pretentious guy's moment of coolness didn't last long.\n\nIn fact,\n\nthe tit-for-tat confrontation or even the underdog-comes-out-on-top scenario that Zhou Ze had predicted didn't happen.\n\nJudging from his attire, the fact that he wore sunglasses at night, and his previous action of including the quietly-snacking-on-melon⁴ Zhou Ze in his taunts,\n\nit was clear that,\n\nthe guy's IQ was somewhat underdeveloped.\n\nAnd reality proved it.\n\nThe current situation was that Liu Chuyu, despite having his mirror knocked away, hadn't disgraced the title of Ghost Emissary. Losing one magical artifact didn't turn him into a useless weakling like Lao Dao. Instead, he quickly used his other skills to pin the skinny guy to the ground and proceeded to wipe the floor with him.\n\nThe skinny guy was beaten black and blue. At first, he was still talking tough, but soon he could only curl up, cover his head, and take the beating passively, whimpering all the while.\n\nThe melon-eating crowd suddenly felt this drama wasn't very interesting anymore. Boss Zhou and Bai Yingying even started calculating how many chairs had been broken and what areas had been dirtied, and how much they'd need to be compensated for it afterward—preferably settled in hell money.\n\nMeanwhile, the female ghost, taking advantage of the moment Liu Chuyu was pummeling the skinny guy, actually pulled the male singer's hand, walked over to Zhou Ze, and knelt before him:\n\n\"I implore you, honored emissary, to fulfill our wish and send us both down the Yellow Springs together.\"\n\nZhou Ze shrugged, showing no reaction. A vengeful spirit couldn't be sent down; it could only be destroyed on the spot. If one wasn't afraid of the trouble, one could \"persuade\" it to dissipate on its own.\n\nAs for the male singer's soul, Boss Zhou, having just sent off a group of student souls the day before yesterday, wasn't that desperate for a meal right now. Whether he ate this mosquito-leg-sized piece of meat or not could be decided after Liu Chuyu was finished.\n\nThe female ghost was kowtowing to Zhou Ze,\n\npleading.\n\nZhou Ze felt a bit helpless. Honestly, Hell wasn't his family business.\n\nIt was a rule that vengeful spirits couldn't be sent to Hell by a Ghost Emissary through the Gates of Hell.\n\nBoss Zhou wasn't some little fangirl who'd get teary-eyed watching a tragic romance drama; no matter how miserably or fiercely she cried, he was still powerless to help.\n\n\"Boss, there's a problem.\"\n\nBai Yingying, who had been standing to the side, suddenly turned and looked out the window. In the distant sky, a dark cloud was slowly descending toward them.\n\nAnd the skinny guy, who had been beaten by Liu Chuyu into a pig-headed mess, suddenly lifted his head, muttering something while bleeding from his mouth.\n\nLiu Chuyu, who had a natural repulsion and loathing for men, suddenly stiffened.\n\nPreviously, while he was beating the man, the guy had been cursing nonstop, then started whimpering in what sounded like some regional dialect. Liu Chuyu had just assumed he'd broken him.\n\nBut now, as his mind cooled slightly from the excitement of beating someone up, he finally realized that what the other guy had been muttering was actually a type of spell from the Northeast. He was inviting a Great Immortal to possess him!\n\n\"Why not just kill him at the start?\" Bai Yingying muttered.\n\n\"For a Ghost Emissary, the price of killing a living person without cause is too great,\" Zhou Ze explained.\n\n*Hoooooo... hooooooo...*\n\nFrom outside the bookstore,\n\na gust of sinister wind swept in.\n\n\"My, it's certainly lively at home today.\"\n\nZhou Ze propped his chin on his hands and continued to watch.\n\nBai Yingying turned, walked to the fridge, and came back with half a frozen watermelon. She began feeding it to Zhou Ze, one spoonful at a time.\n\n\"It's a little too cold.\"\n\nZhou Ze frowned.\n\nBai Yingying put the spoon in her own mouth for a moment to warm it, then took it out and brought it to Zhou Ze's lips.\n\nZhou Ze opened his mouth and ate it.\n\nWarm on the outside, icy on the inside.\n\nThe taste was just right.\n\nOn one side, a man and a woman were earnestly enjoying the show.\n\nOn the other side,\n\nthe situation had already begun to shift dramatically.\n\n\"Eighth Aunt-Grandmother!\"\n\nThe tall, skinny man let out a low cry, and then his entire demeanor underwent a complete transformation, becoming cold, sinister, and withdrawn. In particular, his triangular eyes now seemed as if the pupils within were splitting apart.\n\n*Hiss hiss...*\n\nFlicking out its tongue,\n\nEighth Aunt-Grandmother chuckled.\n\n\"Young man, this old one offers her respects. Whatever the misunderstanding, grant this old one a small favor and let us end this here.\n\nLet us take Chunmei back to the village. We guarantee she will not cause trouble again. In any case, she has already transformed into a vengeful spirit, so she holds little value for an emissary.\n\nAs for this fellow...\"\n\nEighth Aunt-Grandmother pointed at the male singer's soul, which was still in a daze.\n\n\"You can send him down. Once this matter is settled, I shall prepare some local specialties to be sent to you two emissaries upon my return.\"\n\nZhou Ze took another bite of watermelon, licked his upper lip, and shook his head slightly. How unsatisfying.\n\nHe had originally thought that after getting thrashed, the skinny guy would summon a Great Immortal to get his revenge. Who knew the Great Immortal would show up and start reasoning with them?\n\nTsk tsk.\n\nThis melon was really bland.\n\nIt was clearly his own bookstore, but damn it, it was one act after another, as if he were just a stage for them to perform on.\n\nHuh,\n\nRight,\n\nA Great Immortal?\n\nWait a minute.\n\nA thoughtful look appeared on Zhou Ze's face. Then, as if he had remembered something, he instructed Bai Yingying to leave.\n\nBai Yingying nodded and walked away.\n\nLiu Chuyu hesitated for a moment, then nodded.\n\nAgainst ordinary people and ordinary ghosts, he had a natural advantage and felt no fear. But facing this \"Eighth Aunt-Grandmother\" who had been inexplicably summoned, Liu Chuyu didn't dare be too brazen.\n\nIn Zhou Ze's view,\n\nLiu Chuyu was a new Ghost Emissary, his mind likely filled with a thirst for merit points. The female ghost must have been a Xuan cultivator in life, and sending her to the Underworld would have yielded merit points equivalent to ten ordinary souls, or even more. That was why he had made a deal with her, making certain compromises and concessions to send her down.\n\nBut who knew the female ghost wouldn't play by the rules, getting someone killed and turning herself into a vengeful spirit, instantly making her value negligible.\n\nHis recent thrashing of the skinny guy was more like an outlet for his inner fury.\n\nAnd this mysterious Eighth Aunt-Grandmother was likely wary of the Underworld's authority and didn't want to cause a major incident with the Yin Division over such a matter, which was why she was willing to de-escalate.\n\nThe female ghost was still crying and pleading, sometimes to Zhou Ze, sometimes to Liu Chuyu, but no one was paying her any attention.\n\nLiu Chuyu looked at Zhou Ze and sighed.\n\nZhou Ze, however, was smiling happily. Seeing this, Liu Chuyu was taken aback.\n\n\"Come on, come back with me. We'll look at the mountains and rivers of our hometown again, and a few of us old folks will send you on your way to liberation.\"\n\nEighth Aunt-Grandmother reached out, grabbed the female ghost, and pulled her away from the male ghost's soul.\n\n\"Silly girl, is this kind of man really worth entrusting so much to, even to the point of cutting off your own path to reincarnation?\"\n\nEighth Aunt-Grandmother wore a pained expression.\n\nThen,\n\nshe took the female ghost's hand and started walking toward the entrance, sighing at the same time:\n\n\"Ask the world, what is love...\"\n\nIt seemed Eighth Aunt-Grandmother was also a female with a story... er... a female of a species, that is.\n\nJust then,\n\nBai Yingying brought an exquisite wooden box down from upstairs and handed it to Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze impatiently opened the box,\n\nand took out a somewhat dilapidated, old-fashioned notebook with a black cat printed on its cover.\n\nHolding up the notebook,\n\nZhou Ze looked at Eighth Aunt-Grandmother, who had just reached the bookstore's entrance.\n\nHearing her sigh of lament,\n\nhe immediately shouted:\n\n\"I call out 'Eighth Aunt-Grandmother'—\n\ndo you dare answer?\"\n\n---\n---\n大家可以「威辛」搜索「純潔滴小龍」或者「kongbu66」，關注龍的「攻種威信耗」。\n\n龍在那裡會寫一些番外小故事以及人物年鑑，現在已經寫了白鶯鶯和老道的，後續還會繼續寫。\n\n---\n*Translator's Note from Author's Postscript:*\nEveryone can search on \"Weixin\"⁵ for \"Chunjie Di Xiaolong\" or \"kongbu66\" and follow Long's \"Official Weixin Account.\"⁶\n\nLong will be writing some extra side stories and character annals there.

    "content": "Life, a lot of the time, isn't like the black-and-white TV shows you watched as a kid, where there were only two kinds of people:\n\n  One type was Zhu Shimao,¹\n\n  The other was Chen Peisi,¹\n\n  Just two camps:\n\n  One for the good guys,\n\n  And another for the bad guys.\n\n  Take Boss Zhou right now, for example. He was holding up the Yin-Yang Register and bellowing, \"If I call your name, do you dare answer?\"\n\n  If you dropped him into *Journey to the West*,\n\n  He'd have the distinct feel of a bit-part player with ten minutes of screen time,\n\n  Maybe even less than the little demon who sings, \"My king sent me to patrol the mountains.\"²\n\n  A situation that should have ended peacefully, due to the involvement and mutual wariness of two opposing forces, was now being disrupted by Boss Zhou butting in.\n\n  Were his actions good or bad?\n\n  Could you even tell the difference?\n\n  In the end, this was Zhou Ze's first time encountering a real shaman sorcerer, and his first time seeing one of the legendary \"Great Immortals\"³ that could possess a body. It was also the first time he'd actively taken out the Yin-Yang Register with the intention of using it.\n\n  The Yin-Yang Register had one function: it could collect souls!\n\n  The woman who claimed to have been raped by Zhou Ze's predecessor had once told him that if he wanted, he could collect a few seductive female ghosts in it. Whenever he was bored, he could go in and... experience them.\n\n  Of course, it would only be a half-service.\n\n  Boss Zhou was certainly not bored enough to use the Yin-Yang Register to store seductive ghosts. To treat it like a high-class Fleshlight would be a true waste of a divine object.\n\n  But today,\n\n  Upon meeting one of these so-called Great Immortals from the Northeast for the first time,\n\n  Boss Zhou had a sudden whim.\n\n  He picked up the Yin-Yang Register,\n\n  Ready to claim first blood!\n\n  No past grievances,\n\n  No current connection.\n\n  But since you've come to my bookstore,\n\n  That must mean...\n\n  We're fated to meet!\n\n  Eighth Auntie turned her head to look at Zhou Ze. She didn't respond, nor did she shout, \"Old Eighth is here!\"\n\n  But as Zhou Ze channeled his baleful qi into it, the Yin-Yang Register began to tremble on its own. A cat's meow echoed out, long and leisurely, like a long-slumbering beast revealing its ferocity.\n\n  Eighth Auntie took a step back.\n\n  But a beam of white light shot out from the Yin-Yang Register, enveloping the tall, thin man's entire body.\n\n  An extremely pained expression appeared on his face.\n\n  Then, wisps of black smoke rose from the crown of his head. The smoke coiled and swirled above him, as if struggling and resisting.\n\n  Below,\n\n  Boss Zhou, holding the Yin-Yang Register, began to tremble violently.\n\n  Damn it.\n\n  This Yin-Yang Register was like a high-powered range hood, continuously sucking the baleful qi from his body!\n\n  \"Ugh... ugh... ugh...\"\n\n  Boss Zhou struggled to keep his balance while desperately scraping together the baleful qi within him.\n\n  From the Old Daoist's perspective, however, his boss looked like he was suddenly having an epileptic fit while clutching a notebook, breaking into some kind of senior citizen disco dance. All he was missing was a bit of foam at the corner of his mouth.\n\n  Seeing this, Bai Yingying immediately reached out and placed a hand on Zhou Ze's shoulder. Her own baleful qi flowed into him, helping him share the burden.\n\n  You couldn't blame Zhou Ze for nearly making a fool of himself.\n\n  It was, after all, his first time using this \"high-tech product,\" and it hadn't come with an instruction manual.\n\n  Zhou Ze didn't dare carry this thing around normally; he usually had Bai Yingying keep it safely stored somewhere. Because if you walked around with it, it would constantly notify you which people around you were about to die.\n\n  Do you save them or not?\n\n  These are complete strangers with no connection to you. If you knew they were about to die but did nothing, why burden yourself with guilt for no reason?\n\n  Aren't old age, sickness, death, and all sorts of accidents just a normal part of life?\n\n  But who could truly be that detached? Even Boss Zhou, who had once metaphorically eaten his own conscience, would he really be able to remain indifferent if he suddenly saw that a child or a pregnant woman didn't have long to live?\n\n  The lack of preparation,\n\n  Coupled with the haste of the moment,\n\n  Had indeed left Zhou Ze a bit flustered.\n\n  But Eighth Auntie wasn't that formidable either. Or perhaps, the Yin-Yang Register simply had a natural advantage over powerful spirit-type creatures. After all, it was standard equipment for an Underworld Judge. Even if its quality had degraded, it was by no means an easy thing to trifle with.\n\n  \"Damn you... however...\"\n\n  After letting out a few indistinct cries,\n\n  The black mist that formed Eighth Auntie was finally absorbed by Zhou Ze into the Yin-Yang Register.\n\n  Zhou Ze felt the register become slightly heavier. The cover had also changed. Originally, it only depicted a black cat. Now, it was a black cat on the left and a patterned snake on the right. The cat was clearly much larger than the snake and was roaring at it, while the snake appeared dazed and trembling.\n\n  *Thwack!*\n\n  He slammed the notebook face-down on the counter.\n\n  Zhou Ze took several deep breaths.\n\n  Exhausted.\n\n  He was so damn tired.\n\n  His whole body was drenched in a cold sweat.\n\n  He had no choice but to sit down on the chair behind him and continue panting.\n\n  The tall, thin man collapsed unconscious on the floor. First being possessed by a spirit, then having that spirit forcibly ripped out, not to mention getting beaten to a pulp in between—the tall, thin man was truly overdrawn to the extreme and had passed out completely.\n\n  As for Liu Chuyu, his gaze, filled with deep wariness, swept over the tall, thin man before focusing intently on Zhou Ze.\n\n  Boss Zhou didn't bother hiding his weakness from him.\n\n  Not because Boss Zhou overlooked it,\n\n  But because he felt it was completely unnecessary.\n\n  A mere newly-minted Ghost Emissary. Even if he was panting for breath, dealing with him wouldn't be a problem.\n\n  In fact, Zhou Ze felt a slight urge, hoping the other man would lose his composure and try to snatch the Yin-Yang Register. It would give him the perfect excuse to practice his newly upgraded \"Dragon Claw Hand\" on him.\n\n  Boss Zhou really wanted to experience the feeling of those long, sharp, scythe-like claws in actual combat.\n\n  However,\n\n  Liu Chuyu seemed to have a better sense of the big picture than expected. Or rather, he was simply more cautious. With the lesson of Eighth Auntie right before his eyes, his perception of Zhou Ze had changed in an instant.\n\n  He only sidled up to Zhou Ze and whispered:\n\n  \"Buddy, that artifact of yours is seriously powerful. A Great Immortal from the Northeast, and you suppressed it in a single encounter?\"\n\n  Zhou Ze just smiled, taking the cup of tea Bai Yingying handed him and downing several gulps.\n\n  \"But buddy, even though the Great Immortals of the Northeast have always been few in number, and it's become even harder for them to gain sentience since the founding of the PRC,\n\n  They're famous for their solidarity. You captured one today, who knows if others will come looking for trouble tomorrow or the day after.\"\n\n  Hearing this, Zhou Ze wasn't the least bit frightened by his few words of intimidation.\n\n  Boss Zhou was truly at the point where \"when you have enough lice, you stop itching.\"⁴ He already had a massive time bomb on him that could detonate at any moment. As the saying goes, \"A man of great wealth doesn't sit under dangerous eaves,\"⁵ but Boss Zhou was like a desperado with a bomb strapped to his back.\n\n  For instance, that old woman from the Bridge of Helplessness? Zhou Ze killed her without a second thought.\n\n  This Great Immortal from the Northeast... did Zhou Ze know what chain reaction capturing him without authorization might cause?\n\n  He didn't care.\n\n  He'd already captured it.\n\n  Might as well test out how effective his new artifact was.\n\n  It wasn't that the lazy Zhou \"Salted Fish\" Ze had suddenly seen the light and was ready to turn over a new leaf and stir up trouble.\n\n  Even the old Empress Dowager Cixi dared to declare war on all the world powers at once.\n\n  In the end,\n\n  This only meant that Zhou Ze's \"salted fish\" state had leveled up once again.\n\n  He had entered the realm of the \"cracked pot that doesn't mind being smashed.\"⁶\n\n  Liu Chuyu then pointed to the male singer and said, \"Buddy, you took the main prize. Let me have the leftovers, alright?\"\n\n  He meant, let him at least escort one ghost to the underworld to earn some merit points, so his trip wouldn't be a total waste.\n\n  He felt this was not an excessive request. Zhou Ze had done basically nothing from start to finish, yet ended up capturing a Great Immortal. Ignoring the potential chain reactions, just looking at the present, Zhou Ze had already eaten his fill.\n\n  It wouldn't be too much for him to have a sip of the soup,\n\n  Would it?\n\n  Who would have guessed that Boss Zhou was actually quite annoyed by his \"sensible\" reaction? It seemed his scythe-brand fingernails would have to wait a while longer for a test run. Faced with the \"reasonable request,\" he said simply:\n\n  \"Scram.\"\n\n  \"...\" Liu Chuyu was speechless.\n\n  *Holy shit,*\n\n  *You bastard,*\n\n  *Have you no shame!*\n\n  Liu Chuyu waved his palm.\n\n  The small mirror still in front of the Old Daoist immediately flew up. However, midway, Bai Yingying reached out and snatched it.\n\n  The mirror trembled nonstop in Bai Yingying's hand but couldn't escape her \"demonic clutches.\"\n\n  \"Ying ying ying~ Boss, I like this little mirror. This way, I can do even prettier makeup to serve you in the future,\" Bai Yingying said, squatting in front of Zhou Ze and acting cute.\n\n  \"Take it, take it.\" Zhou the Skinflint⁷ said, as if it were a matter of course.\n\n  \"Buddy, don't push it. We're colleagues. If you don't leave any room for face, it won't look good for anyone!\"\n\n  Liu Chuyu shouted, pointing at Zhou Ze.\n\n  Zhou Ze just smiled,\n\n  Casually shifting into a \"Ge You slouch.\"⁸\n\n  The mockery was palpable.\n\n  \"Are we really past the point of reasoning?\"\n\n  Liu Chuyu began his \"don't say I didn't warn you\" spiel.\n\n  In truth, Zhou Ze wished he would just skip the foreplay. The two Ghost Emissaries he'd killed back in Yancheng hadn't been this long-winded.\n\n  However,\n\n  Liu Chuyu, who had just been mercilessly beating the tall, thin man and berating the female ghost,\n\n  Now appeared incredibly cautious and craven.\n\n  So craven that even the Old Daoist couldn't stand to watch anymore.\n\n  *Damn,*\n\n  *The boss is already exploiting and bullying you like this,*\n\n  *And you still don't dare to fight back?*\n\n  *Did you not only get work done on your face,*\n\n  *But also have something snipped off down below?*\n\n  \"We'll see about this in the future!\"\n\n  After leaving this \"fierce\" threat, Liu Chuyu actually turned and prepared to leave.\n\n  Zhou Ze was a bit baffled. He looked at Bai Yingying, pointed at himself, and asked:\n\n  \"I wasn't this much of a wimp when I first became a Ghost Emissary, was I?\"\n\n  Bai Yingying shook her head.\n\n  Then immediately nodded.\n\n  Having reached the door and pushed it open,\n\n  Liu Chuyu, with his back to Zhou Ze and the others, was practically grinding his teeth.\n\n  Just then, Zhou Ze called out to him again:\n\n  \"Hey, stop.\"\n\n  Liu Chuyu felt a sudden wave of relief. He turned around, looked at Zhou Ze, and smiled.\n\n  \"Ready to bury the hatchet, buddy? That's the way. Leave a little leeway in your dealings, and in the future...\"\n\n  \"I forgot, I'm aiming to be a Constable Head. I'm still short a few Ghost Emissary underlings.\n\n  How about this:\n\n  Leave your soul-blood with me,\n\n  And then you can go.\"\n\n  \"...\" Liu Chuyu was speechless again.\n\n  His face, which had been injected with who-knows-how-much hyaluronic acid and gone under the knife who-knows-how-many times,\n\n  Was now forced into the color of pig's liver by sheer fury!\n\n  \"You... go... too... far...\"\n\n***\n\n¹ **Zhu Shimao and Chen Peisi**: A famous Chinese comedy duo from the 1980s and 90s, known for their TV skits where Zhu often played the upright \"good guy\" and Chen played the bumbling \"bad guy\" or troublemaker.\n² **\"My king sent me to patrol the mountains\"**: A line from a song in the popular 2015 Chinese movie *Surprise*, which parodies *Journey to the West*.

    "content": "Being a good person is too tiring.\n\nBeing the kind of great person who could be put on a promotional poster is even more tiring.\n\nIt means you have to maintain your absolute purity and noble character from beginning to end. Otherwise, those omnipresent trolls will definitely dig up every bit of your dark history.\n\nIn contrast,\n\nbeing a villain is much more comfortable.\n\nBoss Zhou felt he was having a very easy time right now. Exploiting a new colleague, peeling him layer by layer, was simply delightful beyond compare.\n\n\"You've gone too far!\"\n\nLiu Chuyu opened his hand. A fleshy sprout grew from his palm, like a budding bean sprout. A faint, fresh fragrance immediately began to fill the air.\n\nZhou Ze subconsciously held his breath and continued to stare at the person before him—or more accurately, at the plant growing from the other's palm.\n\nEvery Ghost Official has their own unique skill, like his own fingernails and the little loli's oral technique.\n\nAnd this guy in front of him had clearly planted something inside his own body. This would explain why Liu Chuyu had been so tolerant before. Humans are creatures easily influenced by subjective emotions, but plants can more calmly perceive things to seek advantages and avoid harm.\n\nPerhaps it was because of this plant in his body that Liu Chuyu had been so forbearing time and time again.\n\n\"Picking on the weak because you're strong, are we? Then I'd like to see if you're actually worthy!\"\n\nThe bean sprout in Liu Chuyu's palm grew rapidly. At the same time, vines and weeds began to sprout from all the crevices in the bookstore's exterior and interior.\n\nLush and green,\n\nverdant and dense,\n\na genuine \"green and eco-friendly bookstore.\"\n\nVines shot up from the ground, sweeping directly toward the area where Zhou Ze was.\n\nBai Yingying stepped forward on her own initiative. She grabbed a few vines with both hands and yanked them down, snapping them directly. But the broken vines regenerated instantly, wrapping around and binding her relentlessly like a sticky plaster.¹ For a moment, Bai Yingying really couldn't break free.\n\nThe old Taoist was already wrapped up by the vines like a green zongzi, and even the little monkey was bundled into a small ball, rolling back and forth on the floor.\n\nThe Death Servant sitting in the corner was also enveloped, but he just tilted his head left and right in confusion. He seemed to be pondering whether these plants counted as bookstore landscaping or as a sign of being messy and dirty.\n\nUntil he finished contemplating these questions, or until Zhou Ze gave him a direct order, the Death Servant would probably remain stuck in this dilemma.\n\nIn his previous life, he was a priest who was especially good at stirring up trouble—one could say he was too clever for his own good with his scheming. For him to end up in this dazed state is, one must admit, a rather interesting irony.\n\nThis wasn't an attack-type spell. It was probably just meant for delay and defense, or perhaps this Liu Chuyu fellow hadn't fully cultivated this plant yet, so its effects weren't very pronounced.\n\nBut for now, at least, it had indeed succeeded in obstructing his opponents. This also showed that Liu Chuyu had no intention of a head-on confrontation; he planned to find a chance to escape.\n\nEscape back to Dadiaozhou.*\n\nThere were still a few other Ghost Officials in Changzhou. If Zhou Ze still wanted to go to Changzhou to recruit underlings, he would surely provoke the public wrath of all the Ghost Officials in the entire Southern Jiangsu region.\n\nZhou Ze blew out a smoke ring.\n\nLiu Chuyu hadn't left yet.\n\nHe couldn't leave.\n\nBecause his vines had already entangled everyone else in the bookstore, with the sole exception of Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze was still sitting there, leisurely and unconcerned, while those vines didn't dare to approach him.\n\nFear,\n\nawe,\n\nterror,\n\nthese emotions were clearly transmitted to Liu Chuyu's mind through the medium of the vines.\n\n\"Heh heh, I told you, we have a destiny together.\"\n\nZhou Ze smiled.\n\nIn the basement of that research institute, he had swallowed the fruit from inside the Old Tree Root. And who was the Old Tree Root? He was practically a great demon.\n\nHow could this thing of Liu Chuyu's, which had just sprouted a tender shoot, dare to act so presumptuously before him?\n\nIt was the same principle as how Bai Yingying had been terrified of the zombie aura he emitted back then.\n\nHumans can often shout \"Are kings and nobles born to their station?\"² to start a rebellion, but for demons and other types of creatures, the hierarchical pressure of a bloodline is truly immense and terrifying.\n\nZhou Ze dropped his cigarette butt, ground it out with the sole of his shoe, then stood up and lightly dusted off his hands.\n\n\"When I was a kid watching *Pokémon*, to capture a wild Pokémon, you first had to beat it up until it was on the verge of fainting. Only then was it easy to catch.\n\n\"It's the same principle when recruiting underlings on TV. You have to beat them up first, so the underlings will be obedient later on.\"\n\n\"Ying ying ying...\"\n\nEven Bai Yingying, who was quite troubled by her entanglement in the green vines, somehow found the presence of mind to play along with her boss, signaling that she too had been subdued by him after he had viciously \"inserted\" himself.\n\nZhou Ze tilted his head slightly, looking at Liu Chuyu.\n\n\"Let's have a fight. Actually, it's not bad being my underling. Take Lin Ke, for example, the veteran Ghost Official from Tongcheng.\n\n\"She always says,\n\n\"that serving me as her Chief³ and being my underling,\n\n\"was the best decision she ever made in her life.\n\n\"And there's another Ghost Official in Tongcheng, who's my sister-in-law. You see, I have a really great relationship with my underlings. Everyone who follows me gets along wonderfully.\"\n\nZhou Ze almost convinced himself with his own words, feeling that he really was a good boss, a good leader.\n\nLiu Chuyu's expression shifted erratically. The next moment, he decisively retracted the stalk in his hand, turned, and instead of heading for the door, prepared to smash through the glass to escape.\n\nWhen Zhou Ze saw he was about to smash the glass,\n\nhe didn't dare to delay.\n\nLast night, he had snuck out the \"Dragon's Claw Hand,\"⁴ which had nearly awakened the one inside him. Although it was suppressed in the end, it had also shattered all the glass windows and various screens in the bookstore.\n\nHe had woken up in the afternoon, and no one had complained in the slightest.\n\nThe old Taoist had used public funds to hire someone to replace all the glass, then bought a more expensive and better TV to replace the old one. Bai Yingying, unable to contain her joy, had also switched to a more expensive gaming monitor.\n\nSince it was all on the public dime, no one had any objections. They just treated it as an early upgrade to their quality of life.\n\nBut it was Boss Zhou's purse that was being spent! Boss Zhou's heart ached!\n\nThis glass was just replaced this afternoon,\n\nand now you want to smash it for me again?\n\nHave you been watching too many movies and TV shows? Why do you insist on crashing through glass instead of using the door?\n\nZhou Ze waved his hand,\n\nand five long fingernails instantly shot out.\n\nA gust of sinister wind immediately rippled outward.\n\nA terrifying suction force latched directly onto Liu Chuyu's body. He had just leaped, not even touching the glass, when he was flung backward and slammed heavily onto the floor.\n\nZhou Ze strode forward. Liu Chuyu spread his hands, and vines sprouted from his body in an attempt to block Zhou Ze.\n\nBut Zhou Ze's long fingernails were far too sharp. In an instant, they shredded the vines to pieces. He then bent over, squatted down, and placed two fingernails directly on either side of Liu Chuyu's neck.\n\nAt this point,\n\nall Zhou Ze had to do was give a gentle squeeze,\n\nand Liu Chuyu would be served up to the \"Dog-Head铡.\"⁵\n\nZhou Ze stopped,\n\nlooking down at Liu Chuyu.\n\nLiu Chuyu felt that today's experience was simply too bizarre to comprehend.\n\nHe had come to catch a ghost, to boost his performance stats.\n\nIn the end, not only did he fail to catch the ghost, but he also provoked a Great Immortal from the Northeast.\n\nThe Great Immortal from the Northeast was actually quite reasonable and spoke very pleasantly.\n\nBut the final outcome was that after being peeled layer by layer, he still had to sell himself to him?\n\nThe newly appointed Ghost Official, Liu Chuyu, was filled with what could only be described as deep psychological trauma. He knew a few other Ghost Officials back in Changzhou. They weren't exactly close, but they were nodding acquaintances and were always polite to each other.\n\nHow was it that upon arriving in Tongcheng,\n\nthe colleagues here felt like bandits?\n\nA drop of soul blood floated out from Liu Chuyu's forehead, carrying with it a thick sense of resentment and unwillingness.\n\nHe had truly been forced into prostitution by Zhou Ze.\n\nAccepting the other's soul blood, Zhou Ze wasted no time and directly merged it with his own Ghost Official credential. Contract successful. Perfect.\n\nRetracting his fingernails,\n\nLiu Chuyu slowly got up. He glanced at the merit points on Zhou Ze's Ghost Official credential, and his already pale face turned ashen.\n\n\"What's wrong?\"\n\nZhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Your merit points... are even lower than mine...\"\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze.\n\nTo be looked down upon and surpassed in performance by his own subordinate... as a leader, it was inevitably a bit of a loss of face.\n\nIn truth, it was because of Boss Zhou's slacker attitude, plus the fact that he'd fall into a coma every now and then for half a month or a full month at a time. This meant he didn't have much time to properly work on his performance. Furthermore, Zhou Ze had a probationary period as a Ghost Official before, which also set him back.\n\n\"As a leader, you don't need to know the specifics of how to do things. You just need to know what needs to be done. Understand?\"\n\nZhou Ze reached out and patted Liu Chuyu's face.\n\nSo smooth.\n\nSo soft.\n\nDammit,\n\nhow much hyaluronic acid did this guy get injected with!\n\nLiu Chuyu didn't want to argue anymore. After getting up, he knelt on one knee again before Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Greetings, Chief!\"\n\n\"Mhm, get up, get up. The floor is cold, don't catch a chill.\"\n\n\"...\" Liu Chuyu.\n\n\"Alright, there's nothing else for you here. You can go back to Changzhou. I'll call you if anything comes up. Changzhou is quite close to here anyway.\"\n\n\"Uh... okay.\"\n\nLiu Chuyu got up,\n\nthen said, \"My mirror...\"\n\n\"The Dragon Boat Festival is coming up soon, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Ah... yes.\"\n\n\"Giving your leader a little something as a sign of respect during the holidays isn't too much to ask, right?\"\n\n\"Uh... not too much... but...\"\n\n\"Then why are you still here?\"\n\n\"Oh, right. I'm leaving.\"\n\nLiu Chuyu walked out of the bookstore, dejected. He felt as if he had just been in a dream.\n\n\"Boss, this mirror is really fun,\"\n\nBai Yingying said, holding the mirror.\n\nIn the mirror, she was a picture of loveliness, her smile like a blossoming flower, wearing an ancient headdress, bashful and charming.\n\nAs she spoke,\n\nBai Yingying aimed the mirror at Zhou Ze. \"Boss, you try it. It seems like it can show you your past life.\"\n\nWhen the mirror was aimed at Zhou Ze's face,\n\nwith a \"crack,\"\n\na fissure appeared on its surface, and then it shattered completely.\n\n\"Hiss...\"\n\nBai Yingying pulled her hand back,\n\nstaring at the pile of shards on the floor, somewhat at a loss.\n\nZhou Ze, who had just received a gift from his subordinate through \"unspoken rules,\" was also stunned.\n\nHe shook his head,\n\nand sighed:\n\n\"Ah, what a spendthrift.\"\n\n---\n*Dadiaozhou (大吊州).

    "content": "This morning,\n\nBoss Zhou sat in his usual spot, as always.\n\nSunlight,\n\nNewspaper,\n\nCoffee,\n\nGe You,¹\n\nSalted fish,²\n\nAnd so, Boss Zhou's day began.\n\nEven though many things had happened yesterday, Zhou Ze tossed them all to the back of his mind after getting up, contentedly enjoying the vibrant energy of his morning.\n\nBai Yingying sat beside him, staring blankly at a pile of small fragments, looking a little down.\n\nThe old Taoist passed by, glanced over, and said:\n\n\"Is this the mirror that was shattered by the boss's handsomeness yesterday?\"\n\nAs he said this, the old Taoist deliberately raised his voice, afraid the boss wouldn't hear.\n\nBai Yingying looked up, pouting.\n\nShe held it in for a long time,\n\nbut still let out a \"pfft\" of laughter.\n\nShe was actually still sad and upset about breaking the mirror yesterday. She knew her boss wasn't well-off and didn't have many nice things. He'd finally gotten his hands on one, and before he could even enjoy it, she had broken it.\n\nThe old Taoist also sighed, leaned in, and whispered:\n\n\"Actually, this mirror cried itself to death over how ugly the boss is. See these cracks? Don't they look like tear tracks?\"\n\n*Slap…*\n\nZhou Ze snapped his newspaper shut.\n\nThe old Taoist jumped in fright.\n\n\"The paper says Tongcheng is at a critical moment in its bid to become a Civilized City.\"\n\n\"Hm?\" The old Taoist was a bit confused, but he had a bad feeling.\n\n\"Old Taoist.\"\n\n\"Yes, here.\"\n\n\"Go do your part. Sweep the road in front of the shop.\"\n\n\"...\" the old Taoist.\n\nThe old Taoist drooped his head and went out with a broom and mop. Zhou Ze also stood up and followed him out.\n\nHe lit a cigarette,\n\nand stretched.\n\nJust then, across the street, a crowd had gathered. A woman was in the middle of it, shouting at the top of her lungs. Her voice was loud and extremely aggressive.\n\nIt was early morning, and South Avenue was already bustling with people, so naturally, a crowd of onlookers had gathered.\n\nAcross the street was what looked like an internet cafe, not long opened.\n\nBoss Zhou, with a cigarette between his fingers, slowly sauntered over. Seen from behind, he looked exactly like an idler who did nothing productive all day but wander around and gossip.\n\n\"My son did poorly on his midterms! The teacher even called us parents in, saying he hasn't been concentrating in class lately. I was wondering why. Well, today I finally caught him!\n\nHe told me he was going to school early for morning reading, but it turns out he was sneaking off to the internet cafe to play games!\n\nDamn it all,\n\nwho invented video games!\n\nWhy doesn't the government throw all these damned game developers and internet cafe owners in jail?\n\nAren't they deliberately trying to ruin our children!\n\nWhat does a child know?\n\nHe plays a game because it's there.\n\nHe plays it because he thinks it's fun.\n\nThis stuff is like a drug addiction,\n\nthe child has no idea!\"\n\nThe middle-aged woman shrieked hoarsely, nonstop.\n\nIn front of her stood a young man in a blue shirt. He wore glasses and looked very refined. As the woman spoke, he simply stood opposite her with a smile, neither refuting her nor shouting back.\n\nBeside the two of them, a young man who looked like a high school student stood with his head down and messy hair, his cheeks burning. He was clearly ashamed of his mother shouting like this in public.\n\nThe woman, tired from talking,\n\nfinally paused,\n\nfor what amounted to a halftime break.\n\nThe refined young man finally found an opportunity to speak, saying very calmly:\n\n\"Ma'am, if you wish to discipline your son, you can take him home or back to school to educate him with his teachers.\n\nWe are an internet cafe, a place of business. Your shouting and blocking the entrance is already affecting our normal operations.\"\n\n\"Pah! You have the nerve to talk about business!\n\nNone of you internet cafe owners are any good. You're all just scamming money from kids.\n\nEveryone, you be the judge! I just went inside and took a look. It's full of people playing games, every one of them staring intently at the screen.\n\nSome of them look all greasy, you can tell they've been playing all night, not going to work, not going to school, just single-mindedly playing games!\n\nIf their parents saw them like this,\n\nhow heartbroken would they be!\"\n\n\"Ma'am, your son is a legal adult. If he wants to use the internet, we can't stop him...\"\n\n\"What damn legal adult! My son is still just a student, he has his college entrance exams next year!\n\nI was wondering why my son's grades were dropping.\n\nIt's all because of this game,\n\nall because of this internet cafe!\n\nThe government should shut down all the game companies. They do nothing but corrupt children and make us parents worry!\"\n\nThe woman was still shouting nonstop.\n\nThe refined man reached up to adjust his glasses, shook his head, took out his phone, and prepared to make a call.\n\n\"What do you think you're doing? Are you trying to argue with me?\n\nAre you calling for backup?\n\nTrying to play gangster with me?\n\nYou've ruined my child, gotten him addicted to games and made his grades drop,\n\nand now you dare to call people to beat me up?\n\nI'm telling you, I wasn't born yesterday, I'm a local too. Let's see you dare to have someone lay a finger on me!\"\n\n\"I'm calling the police.\"\n\n\"The police?\" The woman was taken aback.\n\n\"You're disrupting my business.\"\n\n\"Get lost, you shameless bastard!\" The woman raised her hand and swatted. With a *smack*, the refined man's phone was knocked out of his hand and fell to the ground, rolling right to Zhou Ze's feet.\n\n\"Calling the police? My son might not get into a good university next year because of scumbags like you opening internet cafes, and *I'm* the one who should be calling the police!\n\nEveryone, you be the judge.\n\nIs it easy for us parents?\n\nWe provide them with food, clothes, and an education. Who doesn't hope their child will be successful? Who doesn't hope their child can get into a good university?\n\nBut there are these bastards who make games, these black-hearted people who open internet cafes,\n\njust thinking about making this dirty money off our children.\n\nThey're ruining our kids!\n\nOh god,\n\nsave the children!\n\nThese goddamned games.\"\n\nJust then, a young girl walked out from behind the man. She first went to Zhou Ze, squatted down to pick up the phone, and then pointed straight at the woman's nose and let loose:\n\n\"Save the children?\n\nYou have the gall to say that?\n\nYou can't discipline your own child, your family has no manners, you don't know how to raise a kid, and you have the nerve to blame games and internet cafes?\n\nYour kid is a moron. The fact that he's addicted to games means he's a moron, an idiot, which means you're the parents of an idiot!\n\nDammit,\n\nI should be the one shouting!\n\nSave the games!\n\nSomeone do something about these moron kids!\n\nSomeone do something about you moron parents!\n\nWe adults want to play a game, and the blood can't even be red, it has to be green! All the violent and bloody scenes have to be cut because it might affect minors!\n\nA minor steals some money or robs someone, and it's all the game's fault.\n\nSo everyone in the world is a good person, is that it?\n\nIt's all the fault of games, right?\n\nStop trying to shift the blame. In this society, it takes all sorts to make a world. If some people are going to do well, others have to be at the bottom. Why aren't other people addicted to games? Why can other people get good grades?\n\nYou dog, you only know how to give birth but not how to raise a child!\n\nAll you know is how to push the responsibility onto others.\n\nIf you don't know how to raise a kid, why didn't you wear a... condom when you were having fun!\"\n\nThe woman was stunned speechless.\n\nMany of the onlookers, after hearing the girl's sharp-witted counterattack, actually started cheering and hooting.\n\nThis was more than the woman could bear. She charged forward and started grappling with the girl.\n\n\"You little hussy, how dare you curse at me, how dare you!\"\n\nThe two women scuffled until they were quickly pulled apart by the surrounding onlookers.\n\nMany people in the crowd began to persuade the woman to let her son go to school and stop making a scene. The woman, having lost her momentum after the girl's tirade, threw out a few more threatening words before pulling her son away.\n\nZhou Ze followed the woman for a short distance. When she took her son to the bus stop, while she was still berating him, Zhou Ze walked up behind her and casually lifted a strand of her hair.\n\nThe woman turned and glanced at Zhou Ze. She probably thought he was dressed well enough not to be some pervert trying to cop a feel, so she dismissed it as accidental and paid him no more mind. She turned back and, while waiting for the bus, continued to scold her son.\n\nZhou Ze ambled back towards the internet cafe.\n\nThe entrance to the cafe was empty now, and business had returned to normal.\n\nZhou Ze walked up.\n\nThe internet cafe's environment was actually quite nice, and the computers were new. So even though it was early morning, there were still quite a few customers inside.\n\nThe refined man was applying medicine to the girl's neck, which must have been scratched during the scuffle.\n\nThe girl was still indignantly telling the refined boss something,\n\nbut the refined man just smiled casually and tapped her on the nose with his finger.\n\nThe girl pouted, turned her head, and saw Zhou Ze. She immediately asked:\n\n\"Good morning. Your ID, please, sir.\"\n\n\"I'm not here to use the internet.\" Zhou Ze placed his hand on the counter and looked at the girl.\n\nThe girl frowned slightly, clearly taking Zhou Ze for a hoodlum.\n\nAt that moment, the refined boss walked over with a cup of tea. He paused when he saw Zhou Ze and said:\n\n\"Sir, how can I help you?\"\n\n\"Actually, during the argument just now, I was on your side,\" said Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Heh, sorry you had to see that, sir. It's all in the past now,\" the refined man said.\n\n\"I'm the one who runs the bookstore across the street. Seven or eight years ago, people like me selling novels got the same treatment as you internet cafe owners do now—blamed by parents as the culprits for corrupting their children.\n\nTimes change, society changes, and many ancient cultural traditions have been lost.\n\nBut the skill of each generation of parents at shifting blame,\n\nhas been passed down perfectly intact.\"\n\n\"Since you're a neighbor, please, come in. Let me treat you to some tea,\" the refined man said enthusiastically.\n\nZhou Ze raised a hand, gesturing for him not to hurry.\n\nThen, Zhou Ze placed a small black insect, which he was holding under his fingernail, on the counter.\n\nThe little bug looked like it was on its last breath. It resembled a maggot, but its body was iridescent with color.\n\nPointing at the little bug,\n\nZhou Ze asked slowly:\n\n\"Sympathy is sympathy,\n\nand understanding is understanding.\n\nI don't like that woman either,\n\nbut to just let her die like this...\n\nisn't that going a bit too far?\"\n\n***\n\n¹A famous Chinese actor.

    "content": "The refined-looking boss glanced at his employee, shook his head, and made a ‘please’ gesture to Zhou Ze, indicating he could come inside to talk.\n\nThe female employee stood to the side, nervously clutching the hem of her clothes, so anxious tears were about to spill. It was clear she was terrified—not of Zhou Ze, but of her own boss.\n\nZhou Ze walked into the inner room.\n\nFew internet cafes would go to the trouble of setting up a dedicated office. Most would rather squeeze out every last bit of space, adding another computer station wherever one could fit, or another private booth if possible. As for the staff's rest area, it would be as simple as it could get.\n\nMoreover, this office was actually quite spacious. Inside, there was another room, which seemed to be a bedroom. The main area had a sofa and a desk. The carpet was an ink wash painting under a protective film, done in the grand style of a landscape. When you stepped on it, you had the illusion of truly being amidst white mountains and black waters.\n\nThe walls were hung with calligraphy and paintings. Among them were a few signatures from famous artists that even Zhou Ze, who knew nothing about such art, vaguely recognized. He had no idea if they were real or fake.\n\nBut… they were probably real. After all, the man could afford to open an internet cafe in a place like South Avenue, and even more extravagantly, use such a large space within it as a living and resting area.\n\nLooking at this man now, Zhou Ze felt a bit like how others used to look at him.\n\nOpening a bookstore that was guaranteed to lose money on a city's most prime commercial street…\n\nHmm,\n\nThis boss was definitely \"unfathomable\"—or at the very least, very rich.\n\nThe other man brewed some tea and brought it over.\n\n\"Please, sit.\"\n\nZhou Ze sat down on the sofa. One could say he was here to call the man to account, but in reality, his emotional investment wasn't that strong.\n\nEveryone inevitably brings some subjective emotional bias to whatever they do. For instance, Zhou Ze hadn't been particularly fond of that woman. Although he had stepped in to remove the bug from her, he wasn't about to rush in and furiously demand justice or seek revenge on her behalf. It wasn't worth the trouble.\n\n\"This matter is my fault. I failed to discipline my people properly. And thank you, brother, for stepping in to help. Otherwise, the consequences would have been unthinkable.\"\n\nAs he spoke,\n\nThe refined-looking man directly crushed the teacup in his hand.\n\nThen, grabbing a ceramic shard with his right hand, he sliced it straight down his left arm!\n\nIn an instant,\n\nOn his left arm, from the shoulder down,\n\nA terrifying wound appeared,\n\nDripping with fresh blood.\n\nZhou Ze lowered his head and took a sip of tea. The fragrance was rich and invigorating.\n\nThe man's blood dripped onto the carpet, forming a puddle, but he acted as if nothing had happened. He adjusted his glasses with his right hand, his left arm hanging by his side. He walked over to Zhou Ze and asked:\n\n\"Brother, what do you think of this explanation?\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded, indicating it was enough.\n\nIn truth, according to Boss Zhou's view of good and evil, he had no sense of obligation to \"enforce justice on behalf of heaven\"¹ whenever \"special individuals\" caused trouble in the mortal world. Zhou Ze didn't know if beings like \"Daoist priests from Mount Longhu\" or \"Mount Lao\" truly existed in this world, but he understood one thing: no matter how things were arranged, the responsibility of punishing evil, promoting good, and maintaining order in the mortal realm would never fall on the shoulders of a ghost emissary like him.\n\nAt most,\n\nThe real reason Zhou Ze had come was that he had accidentally discovered this neighbor living right across the street was a bit unusual. Acting on the principle of not tolerating a threat so close to home, he had come to size him up.\n\n\"Brother, may I be so bold as to ask which school you belong to?\"\n\nFirst, self-punishment, then probing for details. This was a common tactic in the Jianghu.²\n\nZhou Ze pointed a finger downward,\n\nMeaning, \"I'm an underground worker.\"\n\n\"Oh, a brother from the tomb raiding world. I wonder which school of tomb raiding you hail from?\"\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze.\n\n\"My apologies, that was presumptuous of me. My name is Qu Mingming. My hometown is in Henan, and my ancestors were physicians.\n\n\"But by my generation, hehe, I enjoy playing games. As a child, I often skipped my medical studies, preferring internet cafes. So now that I've left home, I just opened an internet cafe. This one has been open for about half a year.\n\n\"Looking at it this way, it was my negligence. I can't believe I didn't know there was a hidden master like you in the neighborhood.\"\n\n\"I thought you were from Miaojiang.\"³\n\n\"Is it because of that bug? Actually, since ancient times, medicine and Gu⁴ have never been separate disciplines. In even more distant times, physicians also worked part-time as fortune-tellers and other professions, and were known as shamans in their tribes.\n\n\"People nowadays, influenced by some film and literary works, believe that only Miaojiang has Gu arts. This can only be considered a common misconception.\n\n\"That bug was raised on a diet of blended traditional Chinese medicines. After entering a human body, it can release a slow-acting toxin that causes the heart and lung functions to enter a cycle of failure.\n\n\"I also didn't expect my little sister to be so heavy-handed this time. It was my oversight. Thinking about it now, I can't help but feel a bit of lingering fear. It's thanks to you, brother, that a disaster was averted.\"\n\nThere were indeed many extraordinary individuals in this world. They weren't necessarily versed in the supernatural, but their respective methods were by no means to be underestimated.\n\nSince the man had mistaken him for someone in the tomb raiding trade, it meant he didn't possess the ability of \"Yin-Yang Eyes\" and couldn't see his true identity.\n\nMoreover, both in his attitude and his act of self-punishment, the man had performed perfectly. His actions were measured and sincere, leaving no room for criticism.\n\nAs for the little sister at the counter, this man's self-mutilation in front of him already counted as taking her punishment. Zhou Ze wouldn't pursue it any further.\n\nWas he really going to call the police and say, \"Officer, someone here is trying to kill people with 'Miaojiang Gu arts'?\"\n\nIf he got a policeman with a sense of humor on the line, he might just get a reply like: \"Alright, then I ask you to punish her in the name of the moon!\"\n\n\"Since we're neighbors, why don't you stay for a meal, brother? I'm not much of a talent, but my cooking skills are passable.\"\n\nDinner?\n\nBetter not.\n\nZhou Ze wasn't used to eating out.\n\nJust as Zhou Ze was about to refuse, this Qu Mingming fellow unexpectedly added:\n\n\"I specialize in medicinal cuisine. I use herbs to infuse flavor, which can regulate the body's qi and blood, and invigorate the meridians.\n\n\"Observing your complexion, I've noticed, brother, that you seem to get injured often, don't you?\n\n\"As a result, stagnant qi has accumulated in your body and won't disperse. These things are ultimately harmful to the body.\n\n\"A little conditioning can have the effect of prolonging life.\n\n\"Man lives by qi; if the qi is active, the man thrives, and even ghost emissaries wouldn't dare to trespass.\"\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze.\n\n\"That's not necessary.\"\n\nZhou Ze stood up, ready to leave. He knew his own body best. Was he supposed to come here for \"conditioning\" every time he went berserk?\n\nThis internet cafe boss might even think he was a very dedicated professional, always getting into fights with zombies⁵ when he went tomb raiding.\n\nWait,\n\nZombies,\n\nThat sounded a bit grating to the ear.\n\nZhou Ze walked to the door.\n\nQu Mingming spoke again:\n\n\"My medicinal cuisine is very effective for treating hidden ailments.\"\n\nHidden ailments?\n\nZhou Ze stopped in his tracks.\n\nHe reached up and rubbed his neck, remarking:\n\n\"My neck does feel a little sore, now that you mention it. I did injure it in the past. I suppose a little conditioning wouldn't hurt.\"\n\n………………\n\nThe kitchen was on the second floor.\n\nYes,\n\nQu Mingming had rented two floors. One floor for the internet cafe, office, and bedroom.\n\nThis second floor,\n\nWas filled with neatly sorted medicinal herbs, several large and small stoves, and various cooking pots. It was practically a foodie's paradise.\n\nZhou Ze toured it once and then went back downstairs. There was an area blocked by a curtain that Qu Mingming didn't pull back for him, so Zhou Ze tactfully didn't press the issue.\n\nIn truth,\n\nZhou Ze had already \"heard\" it. From within came a dense sound of faint rustling. What was stored there was self-evident.\n\nBoss Zhou had little interest in those Gu worms.\n\nQu Mingming was in charge of making the medicinal cuisine; he said he would bring it down when it was ready.\n\nSo Zhou Ze stayed in the office by himself, admiring the scrolls. The little sister from the counter came in with tears in her eyes, knelt on the floor, and wiped the bloodstain off the carpet with a rag.\n\nShe was heartbroken and sad. Seeing her, Zhou Ze was reminded of Bai Yingying.\n\nIf he were injured and bleeding that much, Bai Yingying would probably be very sad too.\n\nAt this thought, Zhou Ze took out his phone and called Bai Yingying, telling her he was at the internet cafe across the street and wouldn't be back for dinner.\n\nBai Yingying shouted that after she finished with the bookstore's business, she also wanted to come and duo... fly with Zhou Ze.⁶\n\nOh, no, she meant duo-queuing for some games.\n\nShe thought Zhou Ze had gone to the internet cafe to play video games.\n\nPutting down the phone, Zhou Ze noticed the little girl was standing there, looking at him with a complex expression.\n\nZhou Ze pointed a finger at his own face:\n\n\"Blaming me?\"\n\nThe young girl didn't react. She wiped her tears, pouted, and walked out of the office, looking for all the world like she had been deeply wronged.\n\nZhou Ze shrugged. In this day and age, fangirls were the hardest to deal with. He could only hope Qu Mingming could keep her in check. But Zhou Ze didn't think much of it. Murders and injuries caused by non-ghost entities didn't seem to be his jurisdiction anyway. There were plenty of murders and other vicious incidents happening in the world every day.\n\n…………\n\nAfter wiping up the bloodstain, the young girl washed her hands and went up to the second floor.\n\nQu Mingming was squatting by a small stove, watching the heat. The medicinal stew in the pot had a rich aroma, yet it wasn't cloying; instead, it exuded a clear fragrance similar to mint.\n\n\"Brother, you didn't have to do that.\"\n\nThe young girl walked to her boss's side and took his left hand, her voice full of heartache.\n\n\"It's nothing. Little sister was being naughty and caused trouble. Of course, it's up to me, her big brother, to bear the blame. The man downstairs is a reasonable person; he didn't give us too much trouble.\"\n\n\"He's just a ground rat,⁷ a character from the lower nine schools. He really thinks he's some kind of official figure.\"\n\n\"Qu Zhenzhen, wrong is wrong. If he hadn't stepped in, you might have the blood of a human life on your hands. Gu worms have spirits. Do you really want to be devoured one day by a Gu worm you raised yourself?\"\n\n\"Alright, alright, Zhenzhen was wrong, Zhenzhen was wrong.\"\n\nQu Zhenzhen reached out to stroke her brother's arm, buried her face in it, and began to gently lick his wound with her tongue.\n\n\"Brother, you're so good to me.\"\n\n\"Of course. You're my sister. If I'm not good to you, who would I be good to?\"\n\n\"Mhm, brother loves me the most.\"\n\n\"Heh.\"\n\nQu Mingming reached out and stroked his sister's face.\n\nQu Mingming looked up at his brother with an adoring expression and said:\n\n\"Brother, your little sister will always be a good 'cultivation furnace'⁸ for you.\"\n\n\"Good girl.\" Qu Mingming lifted the lid to check the pot, then said, \"Time to add the medicine. His yang qi is deficient, and his yin qi is heavy, probably from spending so much time in places like tomb chambers.\n\n\"It's quite interesting, though.\n\n\"An ordinary tomb raider wouldn't go into tombs so frequently. The feeling he gives me is as if he sleeps in a tomb chamber every single day.\n\n\"Oh well.\n\n\"Get three qian of Nine-Spotted Bugs, one qian of Silver-Thread Worms, and one qian of Dark-Fire Bugs. That should be enough to treat the yang deficiency in his body.\"\n\nAfter speaking, Qu Mingming placed his hand on his sister's jaw.\n\n\"Mhm, okay.\"\n\nThe girl nodded.\n\nThen she opened her mouth.\n\nThe next moment,\n\nThree small, patterned-wing insects flew out of her mouth,\n\nA small, silver insect slowly wriggled out of her left ear,\n\nAnd a dark, gold-flecked insect forcefully squeezed its way out from the corner of her eye.\n\nThese insects all obediently landed in Qu Mingming's palm.\n\nQu Mingming flipped his hand,\n\nAnd tossed all the insects into the pot.\n\nInstantly,\n\nThe aroma of the medicinal stew became even more fragrant.\n\n---\n¹ **Enforce justice on behalf of heaven (替天行道)**: A famous Chinese idiom, often associated with righteous heroes in fiction who take the law into their own hands to punish evil.\n\n² **Jianghu (江湖)**: Literally \"rivers and lakes,\" it refers to a sub-community of martial artists, mystics, and outlaws operating outside of mainstream society, with its own code of ethics and conduct.\n\n³ **Miaojiang (苗疆)**: A region in southwestern China historically associated with the Miao ethnic group. In Chinese folklore and popular culture, it is stereotypically known as a place of exotic shamanism and the practice of Gu.\n\n⁴ **Gu (蠱)**: A legendary venomous poison associated with cultures of southern China. It typically involves sealing several venomous creatures in a container and letting them devour one another until only one remains, its venom supposedly concentrated. It's often depicted in fiction as a controllable, parasitic creature.\n\n⁵ **Zombies (粽子)**: A slang term used by tomb raiders in Chinese fiction to refer to reanimated corpses or other supernatural dangers found in tombs. It literally means \"rice dumpling.\"\n\n⁶ **duo... fly with Zhou Ze (雙……飛)**: The original text uses a stuttered `雙飛` (shuāng fēi), which means \"double flight\" but is common slang for a threesome. The text immediately corrects this to `雙排開黑` (shuāng pái kāi hēi), which is gaming slang for duo-queuing (playing as a team of two).\n\n⁷ **Ground rat (土耗子)**: A derogatory slang term for a tomb raider.\n\n⁸ **Cultivation furnace (爐頂)**: In some esoteric Daoist practices, a \"furnace\" or \"cauldron\" is a partner (often female) whose life essence is used by another practitioner to advance their own spiritual or physical cultivation, typically to the partner's detriment.",

    "content": "It takes a little time to cook food. Zhou Ze, who was waiting in the office, first waited for, was not Mingming, but Bao Bao.\n\n\n\n\"Boss\"\n\n\n\nBai Baobao stood at the door of the office and shouted\n\n\n\nZhou Ze walked out\n\n\n\n\"Boss, what are you doing here? You're not playing games.\"\n\n\n\nBai Bao Bao glanced at the Internet bar, and many of them were playing with chicken on the screen.\n\n\n\n\"The Internet Cafe owner is a chef and is cooking for me, so I'm waiting to eat.\"\n\n\n\nOf course, it is impossible for Zhou Ze to say that he is waiting for decoction and taking medicine.\n\n\n\nOtherwise, Bai Baobao will ask what disease to treat if he takes medicine and how to answer\n\n\n\n\"Ah, then the Empress may be so sad that you won't eat his juice anymore.\n\n\n\nNow you won’t eat what he makes.”\n\n\n\nBai Baozi looked very distressed for her colleague, but her eyes quickly looked at her\n\n\n\n\"You go and play, and call you when I'm leaving.\"\n\n\n\n\"Okay\"\n\n\n\nBai Baobao immediately ran to the side of the house to recharge, and then happily went to the top-equipped VIP store that cost 80 yuan per hour.\n\n\n\nZhou Ze stood beside the bar, took a pack of smoke in his hand, opened it, pulled out one, and ignited it.\n\n\n\nQu Zhenzhen happened to walk down from the second floor and saw Zhou Cheng picking up smoke. She didn't say anything, but just walked to the bar with expressionless face to sort out things.\n\n\n\nZhou Ze suddenly felt like he was a villain, and he went to someone else's house to eat and take it.\n\n\n\n   She eats people's mouths and takes hands. Zhou Ze doesn't want to see this girl always being cold. Her brother is self-deprecating and doing medicine, so he can't always keep his face and pulling it like 250,000\n\n\n\n\"Your brother is pretty, he looks the same as Li Yifeng.\"\n\n\n\nThe sound of the Internet bar is a bit noisy,\n\n\n\nQu Zhenzhen heard Zhou Zhen’s words, raised her head and looked at Zhou Zhen with some confusion, and asked:\n\n\n\n\"Looking like *******\"\n\n\n\n\"…………” Zhou Cheng\n\n\n\n\"That's right, Uncle **** is pretty good too.\" Zhou Ze conceived\n\n\n\n\"Today, it's my fault. My brother has already taught me.\" Qu Zhenzhen sighed, \"But that woman dared to criticize my brother and even hit him. I can't see it.\"\n\n\n\n\"In fact, this is the case. You are not very ordinary people, but if you want to live a normal person, you still need to adjust it in your mind.\"\n\n\n\n\"What about changing to you?\" Qu Zhenzhen looked at Zhou Ze, \"The girl I just passed by is very familiar with you, should I be familiar with you if someone on the Internet now goes to attack her and hit her, what reaction will you have?\"\n\n\n\n\"I will continue to smoke my smoke,\" Zhou Ze said calmly\n\n\n\nQu Zhenzhen was so angry that she really had no way to have any good feelings for Zhou Ze. She didn't say anything now and sat down to sort out the things in front of her.\n\n\n\nZhou Ze spit out a smoke ring and glanced at the white baby sitting in the VIP glass pane.Jokes,\n\n\n\nWho dares to run to provoke her, slap her, and beat her,\n\n\n\nShe will be serking with you\n\n\n\nIt is possible to swallow you alive directly\n\n\n\nZhou Ze has seen the original appearance of Bai Bao Bao\n\n\n\nBut these brothers and sisters are really blind. They can't see it when they are ghosts. They insist that they are from the tomb. She can't see it even if Bai Bao Bao is a slaughter.\n\n\n\nThe fragrance is coming,\n\n\n\nZhou Ze returned to the head,\n\n\n\nI saw that my classmates walked down the stairs with a sand pot on their back.\n\n\n\nZhou Ze took the initiative to step forward and asked, \"Don't burn your hands.\"\n\n\n\n\"Somewhat is it,\" Mingming's classmate replied\n\n\n\nQu Mingming was planning to say, \"It's okay, he can take it himself, and he doesn't need Zhou Ze to help.\"\n\n\n\nBut who knows that Zhou Ze’s next sentence is:\n\n\n\n\"Then be careful, don't sprinkle it out. I've been waiting for this long.\"\n\n\n\n\"…………” Mingming\n\n\n\n Sand crocks served on the table,\n\n\n\nZhou Yuan put on another set of antique bowls and chopsticks\n\n\n\nZhou Ze held the porcelain bowl in his hand, played with it for a while, and admired the exquisite carvings on it, and said:\n\n\n\n\"What a luxury, I'm the official from the Qianlong period.\"\n\n\n\n\"Experts\"\n\n\n\nIt is worthy of being a tragic businessman\n\n\n\nZhou Ze smiled in his heart.\n\n\n\nHe uploaded his way of living, so how could he have money and time to play with antiques?\n\n\n\nHe knew this bowl because there was a pair of Bao Bao’s funeral objects. When Zhou Ze took it, there were more than 500,000 porcelain bowls.\n\n\n\n\"It's very expensive for Chinese doctors,\" Zhou Ze asked curiously\n\n\n\nMost people can’t afford to eat this bowl. This is a 500,000-yuan meal.\n\n\n\n\"In fact, it's good, but Chinese medicine has been over-produced, and many marketing parties like to be famous for Chinese medicine;\n\n\n\nMoreover, it takes time to calm down and achieve rapid success, so there are really not many Chinese medicine practitioners who are active in society and have a high level of social skills.”\n\n\n\nQu Mingming gave Zhou Mingming a bowl of it, but it was soup, no vegetables, and there were no miscellaneous supplements. The soup was soaked and the soup was clear, and the soup was not oily at all.\n\n\n\nZhou Ze had secretly drank some Bi'anhua oral liquid in advance, so he could naturally pick up the bowl slowly and take a sip.\n\n\n\nFresh and beautiful,\n\n\n\nVery beautiful,\n\n\n\nAnd after drinking it,\n\n\n\nIt seemed like a heat flowed into my stomach in an instant\n\n\n\nI took a few more sips in succession.\n\n\n\nWaiting for a while,\n\n\n\nI only felt that a few small streams of heat flowed constantly in my limbs and bones, and finally, they went down together.\n\n\n\n  Gathering to an indescribable position\n\n\n\n\"Ha\"\n\n\n\nThis effect,\n\n\n\nSo awesome,\n\n\n\nI can't stand the wizard, brother\n\n\n\nQu Mingming gave Zhou Ze a second bowl, put it in front of Zhou Ze, and made a \"please\" hand\"It's a little bit full\"\n\n\n\nZhou Ze said and picked up the bowl again.\n\n\n\nAfter taking a sip, I asked:\n\n\n\n\"Why don't you drink?\"\n\n\n\nQu Mingming's language,\n\n\n\nSmile,\n\n\n\nA little confident,\n\n\n\n  everything,\n\n\n\nEven if you don't say anything\n\n\n\nZhou Ze suddenly felt that the taste of this soup was not as delicious as before.\n\n\n\n\"Mr. Zhou often gets tombs, so he naturally knows the rich. However, I have one thing that I am very curious about. In Tongcheng, there should be few ancient tombs. Why did Mr. Zhou choose to make a living in this area?\"\n\n\n\n\"If you like to go for a prostitution, you have to buy your home in the opposite place.\"\n\n\n\nQu Mingming was very pointed, and seemed to think this sentence makes sense\n\n\n\n\"If Mr. Zhou has something to do in his hands, he can deliver it to me. You have seen it too. I personally like to collect antiques.\"\n\n\n\n  \"hehe\"\n\n\n\nZhou Ze simply continued this mistake, and said:\n\n\n\n  \"good\"\n\n\n\nAfter drinking the soup, Zhou Ze got up and prepared to tell him that Qu Mingming delivered Zhou Ze to the Internet Cafe\n\n\n\nBai Baobao was still playing there. Zhou Ze saw that she was having fun, so he didn't call her. Anyway, he was not far away from home, so he just went back to the bookstore by himself.\n\n\n\nThis will,\n\n\n\nThe old Taoist just swept the horse road, oh no, it was done to build a civilized city and returned with a lot of work;\n\n\n\nHowever, two young people wearing urban control uniforms stood beside the old Taoist\n\n\n\nThe old Taoist was a little difficult to bear between the two, especially when he saw Zhou Ze just walked back, he was a little helpless.\n\n\n\nZhou Ze had a slight eyebrow\n\n\n\nIt’s hard for the old Taoist to leave a small trip in the middle and go to comfort him again\n\n\n\nBut it's not right,\n\n\n\nI haven't seen the urban management sweep\n\n\n\n\"It's him.\" A young urban manager pointed at Zhou Ze and asked\n\n\n\n\"Well, hey, no, no...\" The old Taoist began to explain what, but he didn't know how to explain it\n\n\n\n\"Oh, it's you\"\n\n\n\nA young urban management officer walked forward a few steps, walked to Zhou Ze, pointed at Zhou Ze's nose and scolded:\n\n\n\n\"You are his son\"\n\n\n\n\"…………” Zhou Cheng\n\n\n\nZhou Ze looked at the old Taoist\n\n\n\nThe old Taoist was shocked and said intimidatingly that he had a secret thought.\n\n\n\n\"How did you become a son\n\n\n\nIn the summer, I asked the elderly to come out to swim the road. What if an elderly person has heatstroke? I tell you, you are abused by the elderly.\"\n\n\n\nZhou Ze licked his lips, but he didn't rush to respond.\n\n\n\n\"This time we discovered that I am not a policeman, nor an industry or a commerce company. I can't control you, but you have to know a truth, God is watching when people are doing it\n\n\n\nNo matter what the elderly have had with you in the past, you, as a son, must have a harp in your heart, a conscience.\"\n\n\n\nSpeaking,\n\n\n\nThis young urban manager also reached out to pat Zhou Ze’s chest.\n\n\n\n\"Remember, I'll come next time. If I find out that you abuse the elderly and let the elderly swim the horse road under this big sun, you will be more beautiful.\n\n\n\nI'm an urban management officer.\n\n\n\nWhat is the name of the urban management?\n\n\n\n  It’s just a matter of time”\n\n \n\nWhen the young urban management said this, he deliberately put on a facial expression, and took out the reputation of the urban management to enhance his power.\n\n\n\n  \"hehe\"\n\n\n\nZhou Ze smiled and clicked the head, took out the smoke, and gave it to the other party.\n\n\n\n\"Stop getting close to me\"\n\n\n\nThe young urban management company doesn’t accept it at all, “It’s good for the elderly, do you know if it’s not?”\n\n\n\nAfter saying that, he walked to the old Taoist's body again, patted the old Taoist's shoulder and said:\n\n\n\n\"Old sir, your son will be unfilial to you next time. Tell us that you can go to the Urban Management Bureau to find us, and we will give you justice.\"\n\n\n\nThe old Taoist's face was even harder than crying. He looked at the young urban management in front of him in a slight manner, and secretly looked at the boss's reaction. He could only send these two kind-hearted urban management guys away with a head-on.\n\n\n\nTwo urban management officers boarded the bus next to them, and one of them was picking up the phone, but they didn't rush to leave.\n\n\n\nThe old Taoist walked to Zhou Ze in a timid way and explained carefully:\n\n\n\n\"Boss, I heard me explain it. They came to ask me many casual affairs. I just wanted to find someone to let them bother me. Who knows that the son made me...\n\n\n\nThey're real.\n\n\n\nI also insisted on following me back to find me…………”\n\n\n\nZhou Ze spit out a smoke ring.\n\n\n\nLooking at the old Taoist,\n\n\n\nScreaming:\n\n\n\n\"Dad\"\n\n\n\n\"Ah, ah\"\n\n\n\nThe old Taoist was so surprised that he knelt down directly at Zhou Ze. If it weren't for this street, the old Taoist would have wanted to knock on Zhou Ze directly.\n\n\n\n  Mother-like,\n\n\n\nWant to suffer\n\n\n\n  Ending Zishou\n\n\n\nZhou Ze threw the cigarette head on the ground and said, \"Stand up, they haven't left yet.\"\n\n\n\nThe old Taoist had to stand up again, but his face was scared\n\n\n\n\"There are also talismans in the fence.\"\n\n\n\n\"Yes, no, the talismans passed down from ancestors are very expensive. I used up all the last time, and the last time was the last time.\"\n\n\n\nZhou Ze directly ignored the old Taoist sentence.\n\n\n\nPointing to the urban management business lane there:\n\n\n\n\"Go and post a talisman to their car\"\n\n\n\nAfter saying this,\n\n\n\nZhou Ze walked directly into the bookstore\n\n\n\n\"The sticker is on the back of the car\"\n\n\n\nThe old Taoist turned his head in confusion and looked, but he didn't find anything strange.\n\n\n\nBut thinking that the boss can't play with himself,\n\n\n\nThen I took out the cow's eyes from my pocket and wiped it.\n\n\n\nThe old Taoist was stunned.\n\n\n\nThe previous rear seat of the urban management business car was empty.\n\n\n\nBut now,\n\n\n\nThe wreath of whiteness was actually filled with",

    "content": "Back behind the bar, Zhou Ze poured himself a glass of water. He had just taken two sips when Lao Dao returned.\n\n\"Did you stick it on?\"\n\n\"I did, Boss.\"\n\nLao Dao scratched his head and asked again, \"Boss, why were there so many funeral wreaths behind their car?\"\n\nAnd they weren't real wreaths; you couldn't see them at all without smearing your eyes with cow's tears.\n\nEvery Chinese person knows that funeral wreaths are for the dead and are considered very unlucky for the living. For those things to suddenly appear behind a car was definitely not a good sign.\n\nBecause of this, even though those two young city management officers had almost gotten him in trouble with the Boss, their intentions had been good. So, Lao Dao had willingly contributed the talisman paper hidden in his trousers.\n\n\"They appear when people spit at their backs too often.\"\n\nZhou Ze smiled, thinking nothing of it. He was about to ask Bai Yingying to make him some tea when he remembered she was still in the middle of a bloody battle at the internet cafe.\n\n\"Make me a pot of tea.\"\n\n\"Yes, right away.\"\n\nLao Dao's movements were quite nimble, and he even had a certain flair for brewing tea. He actually knew a lot and was a quick learner. Zhou Ze had previously seen Lao Dao mixing cocktails for customers when Xu Qinglang wasn't around.\n\n\"Boss, what do you mean, from being cursed too often?\"\n\n\"Often, when people see a city management vehicle, they'll spit on the ground behind it and curse, 'Die early and be reborn early.'\n\nSlowly but surely, the wreaths piled up.\"\n\n\"From curses?\"\n\n\"You could say that.\"\n\n\"But those two young city management guys seemed pretty decent.\"\n\n\"That teacher who jumped to her death was a decent person, too.\"\n\n\"Er... well...\"\n\n\"Don't worry, those wreaths can't kill anyone. At most, they weaken a person's luck. Now that you've put that talisman on, there shouldn't be any more problems.\"\n\n\"Sigh, this humble Taoist feels bad for those two kids. Why should they have to bear the bad reputation of the city management?\"\n\n\"Because most people like to lift their bowl to eat, then set down their chopsticks to curse their mother.¹\n\nThey'll curse if the road is blocked by street vendors when they're driving or walking.\n\nAnd they'll also curse when they see videos online of city management 'beating' people or reports of them 'bullying' vendors.\"\n\n\"Alas, gossip is a fearful thing, a fearful thing indeed.\n\nBoss, the tea is ready.\"\n\nLao Dao served the tea and, with a serious expression, picked up a rag and started wiping things here and there. Even though the bookstore had been cleaned spotless by the deathly attendant, Lao Dao was nervous, afraid that Zhou Ze would bring up the \"son\" incident again.\n\nBoss Zhou, meanwhile, lay down on the sofa. Just as he settled in, Xu Qinglang came downstairs.\n\n\"Did you eat out for lunch?\"\n\nThere was a hint of accusation in Xu Qinglang's words.\n\n\"Yeah.\"\n\n\"Heh.\"\n\nLao Dao tactfully moved further away.\n\n\"Lao Zhou, come out with me. Do me a favor,\" Xu Qinglang said to Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze opened his eyes with a hint of resignation. Looking at Xu Qinglang, who had changed into a set of practical clothes, he hesitated for a moment before nodding.\n\nAs a friend, when someone asks you for help, it's hard to refuse them to their face, especially when you're lying on the sofa looking like you have nothing better to do.\n\nHe couldn't even think of an excuse to weasel his way out.\n\nAnd no matter what, Lao Xu had helped Zhou Ze out a lot over time.\n\nXu Qinglang drove, with Zhou Ze in the passenger seat.\n\nThey were heading toward Xu Qinglang's hometown, Menghai County. It wasn't far, and since Tongcheng's roads were usually clear unless there was an accident, the drive would likely take less than an hour.\n\n\"So that's the situation. The problem we ran into when moving the graves last time is starting to escalate.\"\n\nXu Qinglang had just finished explaining the course of events to Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze knew about this. Xu Qinglang had left the bookstore to go back home more than once to handle the grave relocation. Although Xu Qinglang's skill in the mystic arts was nothing more than that of a dabbler in the eyes of Zhou Ze and the little loli, he was still leagues above the village's funerary masters and so-called wandering Taoists.\n\nTherefore, Xu Qinglang had personally presided over the grave relocation. He calculated the orientation and dates, and everything was done by the book, but problems still arose.\n\nFirst, water began seeping out of the ancestral gravesite, like an underground spring bubbling to the surface, according to Xu Qinglang. The water was even steaming and warm to the touch.\n\nLater, during the excavation, they encountered an unexpected collapse. No one was hurt, but it gave the villagers responsible for the move a terrible fright.\n\nIn the end, they had no choice but to perform a salvage excavation. They unearthed a pile of white bones and other things. Some of the coffins had rotted away over time, the bones buried in the soil; some of the deceased had been too poor to afford a coffin in the first place and were sent on their way wrapped in a simple straw mat.\n\nAside from the graves that had tombstones from recent years, it was impossible for most families to tell which pile of white bones belonged to which ancestor. In any case, most of the villagers shared the same surname, so it didn't seem to matter. They haphazardly moved everything to another location and reburied them in a mass grave.\n\nAs for whether any remains were left behind at the old gravesite, no one bothered to check anymore. Besides, finding them would have been incredibly difficult. It's not like they could just call in an excavator to turn over the entire plot of land, right?\n\nBut after that, strange things began to happen. Things started to go missing in the village, and some families' livestock began to die suddenly for no reason. People also had dreams of their great-grandfathers and great-grandmothers coming to them in tears. All in all, to say the village was in an uproar would be an exaggeration, but everyone was at least on edge.\n\nXu Qinglang had tried to solve the problem, but to no avail, so he had to ask Zhou Ze for help.\n\nBy the time they reached Xu Qinglang's village, it was already past three in the afternoon. Though it was a village, nearly every household had a small, two-story modern house. A major highway was not far off, and the village itself had paved concrete roads. Many families had nice cars parked in their yards.\n\nThere was a huge difference between the rural areas in the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Shanghai region and those in the southwest. Firstly, because of local economic development, and secondly, because of the geographical environment; it was much easier and more suitable for development here than in the mountainous southwest.\n\nXu Qinglang parked the car on a concrete path next to a field ridge. He was straightforward; he didn't suggest taking Zhou Ze to meet any elders or relatives now that he was back in his hometown. He led Zhou Ze directly to the gravesite.\n\nThe old ancestral grave area was now overgrown with weeds, looking desolate.\n\n\"The graves were moved because of land expropriation. A high-speed rail line is going to pass through here. The village wasn't very willing at first, but after receiving a compensation payment, everyone agreed.\"\n\nXu Qinglang squatted down on the edge of the ridge and lit a cigarette.\n\nZhou Ze walked a full circle around the burial ground, then shrugged.\n\n\"I don't see any problem, nor do I sense any ghostly energy. This place is as clean as your face after a nightly facemask.\"\n\n\"I tried looking too, but I didn't find anything here either. I originally thought my cultivation wasn't high enough, but since you can't find anything, the problem probably isn't here.\"\n\n\"What did you end up doing with the remains you dug up?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Apart from the ones that could be identified, which were buried separately, the rest were mostly buried together,\" said Xu Qinglang.\n\n\"Then maybe Seventh Grandma and Eighth Grandma were enemies in life and got into a fight after being accidentally buried together?\" Zhou Ze said, half-joking.\n\n\"It's not that simple. Do ghosts eat livestock?\"\n\nJust as the two of them were smoking and analyzing the situation, a loud shout suddenly came from a distance:\n\n\"Someone jumped in the water! Someone jumped in the water! Someone jumped in the water!!!!!!\"\n\nThe cry came from an old woman. Despite her age, her voice was still powerful, and her shouts were loud enough to startle half the village.\n\nXu Qinglang and Zhou Ze immediately ran over. A few men were already in the pond. Before Xu Qinglang and Zhou Ze could even react, the men had pulled a woman out of the water.\n\nIn the Jiangnan countryside, it was common for families to dig their own ponds to raise fish or for other aquaculture.\n\nWhen the woman was pulled out, her face was pale, but she was still conscious. Her hands were grasping at the air, as if she were still in the desperate stage of drowning.\n\nXu Qinglang immediately went to check on her condition. The surrounding villagers all greeted him.\n\nZhou Ze stood at the edge of the crowd, watching. A question suddenly occurred to him: didn't Lao Xu get over twenty apartments from a demolition? And this was his hometown, so why wasn't it demolished?\n\nOr perhaps, this was his hometown, yes, but he hadn't lived in this particular village when he was with his parents?\n\nZhou Ze didn't feel it was right to ask Xu Qinglang about this. The man was worried, and this wasn't the time for Zhou Ze to show off by bringing up his twenty-odd apartments.\n\nSuicide by drowning wasn't rare anywhere. Zhou Ze squatted by the pond's edge. The water wasn't very clear, with a lot of green algae floating on the surface.\n\nHe reached out a hand, pushed aside the algae in front of him, and tilted his head slightly to look beneath the surface. He still found nothing, saw nothing. The pond was dirty, but not the kind of dirty that had \"dirty things\" in it.\n\nThe woman was carried back to her house. A crowd of villagers gathered around. Tongcheng was in the eastern coastal region, so even the young and able-bodied in the villages could find jobs nearby without having to leave home to work elsewhere. The villages were still quite lively.\n\nXu Qinglang was still busy inside. Zhou Ze stood outside the crowd, smoking his cigarette.\n\nJust then, a shabbily dressed old man walked over, cursing as he went. The villagers' faces showed expressions of disgust and rejection, and they all made way for him.\n\nThe old man muttered his curses to himself.\n\nFirst, he cursed the government.\n\nThen, he cursed the village chief.\n\nThen, he cursed the money-grubbing villagers.\n\nHe had the air of someone frustrated by their lack of backbone.\n\nHe walked and cursed, spittle flying, his words as nasty as could be.\n\nForgetting their roots, blinded by greed, letting down their ancestors...\n\nZhou Ze watched the spectacle from the side, leaning against a locust tree.\n\nIn Zhou Ze's eyes, the old man was rather endearing. At his age, there was nothing left to worry about. He cursed when he wanted, made a scene when he wanted, acted crazy when he wanted. *I'm about to kick the bucket in a few years anyway, so why should I put up with this world's bullshit?*\n\nHowever,\n\nas the old man was cursing, he suddenly turned toward Zhou Ze. When he saw him, his eyes widened instinctively.\n\n\"Grandpa, Grandpa...\"\n\nA little girl ran over from a distance and grabbed her grandfather's hand, afraid he would wander off and cause trouble.\n\nBut the old man continued to stare at Zhou Ze.\n\n\"This is an uncle from out of town, he's not from the village.\"\n\nThe little girl told her grandfather. Grandpa was old, and his memory wasn't good.\n\n\"What uncle!\"\n\nThe old man spat directly at Zhou Ze.\n\nThe spit landed on Zhou Ze's shoe.\n\n\"Dead ghost!\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, I'm sorry, uncle, I'm so sorry.\"\n\nThe little girl immediately bent down and used her own sleeve to wipe Zhou Ze's shoe, afraid this stranger would hit her grandfather.\n\n\"Get back here! Why are you wiping some little ghost's shoe!\n\nOur Cui family won't be shamed like this!\n\nPeople are people, and ghosts are ghosts! Live with dignity,\n\nand you won't have to bow and scrape to these little ghosts after you die!\"\n\nThe old man scolded his granddaughter and pulled her back.\n\nStanding by her grandfather's side, the granddaughter kept apologizing to Zhou Ze, crying, \"I'm sorry, I'm sorry.\"\n\nZhou Ze looked down at his shoe, which the little girl had just wiped. He was a neat freak. Although the old man's thick glob of phlegm had been wiped away, the feeling of disgust in his heart was hard to dispel.\n\nHe saw that although this old man was delirious and disliked by the villagers, he was actually a hidden dragon. He seemed crazy, but in reality, he saw things more clearly than anyone else in the village.\n\n\"You're not afraid of the King of Hell, but what about your granddaughter? How about I take her down with me first?\" Zhou Ze said, as if joking.\n\n\"You brat, how dare you!\"\n\nThe old man roared,\n\nand charged straight at Zhou Ze.\n\n*Plop!*\n\nZhou Ze was already standing by the edge of the pond.\n\nWhen the old man rammed into him,\n\nhe and the old man tumbled into the water together.\n\n\"Someone else jumped in, someone else jumped in!!!\"\n\n\"Help, help, save them!\"\n\n\"Grandpa, Grandpa!\"\n\n\"Crazy Cui jumped in the water!!\"\n\nThe villagers' shouts echoed from the shore...\n\n***\n¹An idiom meaning to be ungrateful or hypocritical, benefiting from something one moment and complaining about it the next.",

    "content": "Boss Zhou had fallen into water more than once,\n\n  especially into a body of water like a pond.\n\n  In Hell,\n\n  in dreams,\n\n  it had all happened before.\n\n  But this was the first time he'd fallen into water in reality, and what's more, he'd been headbutted in by a crazy old coot.\n\n  If he had known,\n\n  he wouldn't have been such a smart-mouth.\n\n  Why on earth had he stooped to the level of a madman?\n\n  Only to suffer this \"Savage Charge\" for no reason.\n\n  And what shocked Zhou Ze even more was that after falling in, the old man had latched onto his shoulders and tangled his legs around his calves. He was planning to drown them both at the bottom of the pond.\n\n  Above, some villagers were getting ready to jump in and rescue them, but Zhou Ze didn't dare entrust the choice of his fate to these villagers. Instead, he instantly grew out his fingernails and jabbed them into the old man's back.\n\n  The old man, who had been clinging on for dear life just a moment ago,\n\n  instantly shuddered,\n\n  and went completely limp.\n\n  Zhou Ze surfaced, carrying the old man. Boss Zhou's swimming skills were actually just average, but this wasn't some great river, just a small pond. Holding up a light old man wasn't much of a problem.\n\n  After they got ashore, Xu Qinglang rushed right up to Zhou Ze and yelled:\n\n  \"What happened to you? What's going on?\"\n\n  \"It was Madman Cui! He went crazy and knocked the young man into the pond. That Madman Cui, always rambling and cursing, and now he's trying to kill people.\"\n\n  \"Let's call the police. He has no children, so it doesn't matter to him, but what if he pushes someone else's family member in next time?\"\n\n  \"Right, call the police! It'd be best if a mental hospital took him in. He's getting more and more out of hand.\"\n\n  The little girl knelt beside her grandfather, wiping her tears as she looked at his unconscious form, crying for him to wake up.\n\n  \"Take him back home. He has a clue,\"\n\n  Zhou Ze said to Xu Qinglang.\n\n  Xu Qinglang nodded. Without a doubt, he walked over and hoisted the old man onto his shoulders.\n\n  \"I'll take him home first. Don't worry about calling the police just yet. Let's deal with the matter at hand. Everyone, don't panic.\"\n\n  With that, Xu Qinglang carried Old Man Cui and walked out of the crowd.\n\n  Zhou Ze and the little girl followed behind.\n\n  The little girl was still crying along the way, and Zhou Ze actually felt a bit bad. He was the one who had made the joke—and that kind of joke, at that. He deserved to be knocked into the water by her grandfather.\n\n  \"Where's your home?\" Zhou Ze asked the little girl.\n\n  \"His house is the mud-brick one at the intersection up ahead. The old man has no children, and he's fond of drinking. He's got some problems upstairs, so life isn't great for him.\"\n\n  Xu Qinglang was quite familiar with the situation in the village.\n\n  Soon, they arrived at the mud-brick house.\n\n  Surrounded by two-, three-, and even four-story modern houses, a mud-brick house from a bygone era of the last century stood there, looking quite out of place.\n\n  The door was unlocked. Perhaps there was nothing in the house worth a thief's attention.\n\n  The mud-brick house had three rooms. The middle one was the living room; one half was filled with scrap like the soda cans and wine bottles the old man had recently collected, while the other half was dedicated to a deity's statue. The altar table, at least, was swept clean.\n\n  To the left was the bedroom, with an old-fashioned wooden bed. To the right was the kitchen, which still used an earthen stove.\n\n  Xu Qinglang settled Old Man Cui on the bed, then looked at Zhou Ze and said, \"Should we wake him up now?\"\n\n  There was a sense of mistrust in his words.\n\n  It wasn't that he mistrusted Zhou Ze; Xu Qinglang just didn't trust that any clues could come from this old man who had been crazy since he was a child.\n\n  This wasn't some novel from a bookstore shelf,\n\n  where you pick up a ring in the middle of nowhere and find an old master living inside,\n\n  or where the most powerful person in the Shaolin Temple is the scripture repository's sweeping monk.\n\n  \"He has Yin-Yang Eyes,\"\n\n  Zhou Ze said.\n\n  Being able to tell he was a ghost at a glance…\n\n  other than Yin-Yang Eyes, there was no other explanation.\n\n  Besides, Zhou Ze hadn't sensed any other spiritual fluctuations from the old man. If the old man were a practitioner of metaphysics, he wouldn't have needed to resort to the trick of headbutting him into a pond to die together.\n\n  \"Yin-Yang Eyes?\"\n\n  Xu Qinglang glanced at the still-unconscious old man on the bed, a little surprised.\n\n  \"I really didn't expect that.\"\n\n  \"He could see my identity at a glance.\"\n\n  Zhou Ze walked to the threshold and sat down.\n\n  \"I'm going out to buy something for dinner,\" Xu Qinglang said as he left the house.\n\n  Zhou Ze waved to the timid-looking little girl beside him, beckoning her over.\n\n  The little girl was a bit shy around strangers. Only after he called a few times did she come over, saying apologetically,\n\n  \"Mister, my grandpa didn't do it on purpose. He really didn't.\"\n\n  \"Mhm, I know. It was my fault. I took the joke too far.\n\n  By the way, do you know about what's been happening in the village recently?\"\n\n  The little girl nodded.\n\n  \"Did your grandpa say what the reason was?\"\n\n  \"Grandpa said... Grandpa said…\"\n\n  The little girl seemed to find it hard to speak, fidgeting with her fingers as if hesitating whether she should say it or not.\n\n  \"Don't worry, you can tell me. I won't tell anyone else.\"\n\n  \"Grandpa said it's because the villagers were greedy for the compensation money. For that little bit of money, they were willing to give up their ancestral graves. If their ancestors knew, they'd be turning in their graves.¹\n\n  Grandpa also said,\n\n  our village's ancestral burial ground originally had excellent feng shui. The demolition wasn't even supposed to reach us, but the village chief conspired with someone 'up there' and forced the boundary line over here.\n\n  A few years ago, the West Village was demolished, and all the people there got a lot of houses and money as compensation. They all moved into the city. Our villagers were green with envy and wanted to be demolished too.\"\n\n  Hearing this, Zhou Ze nodded.\n\n  The ancestors might have had their objections, sure, but the ones causing the destruction probably weren't those \"returning spirits\" of the ancestors.\n\n  \"What else did your grandpa say?\"\n\n  \"He told me not to run around at night. He said things have been unsettled lately, that there's a 'dirty thing' running around the village. I asked Grandpa what it was, if it was a fox or a wild dog, but he wouldn't tell me.\"\n\n  A dirty thing,\n\n  running around?\n\n  Only comes out at night?\n\n  Zhou Ze lit a cigarette, slowly mulling it over.\n\n  The West Village the girl mentioned must be Old Xu's former village. The East and West Villages probably share a surname, so their ancestral graves were likely all grouped together. With Old Xu's current wealth, he wouldn't stoop to coveting this small compensation. The reason he took on this matter must be because his own ancestors are buried there too.\n\n  If it wasn't a ghost causing trouble,\n\n  could it be a creature that has gained sentience?\n\n  If it's a spirit creature, then everything would make sense. But dealing with spirit creatures is actually a bit more troublesome than dealing with ghosts.\n\n  Just then, a coughing sound came from inside the house. The old man was awake.\n\n  Zhou Ze walked to the bedroom doorway and looked at the old man, who had already sat up.\n\n  The old man glanced at the little girl standing next to Zhou Ze and immediately cursed, \"You damned ghost!² If you dare touch my granddaughter, I'll…\n\n  I'll… I'll…\"\n\n  After wracking his brain for a long moment, Old Man Cui couldn't think of any further way to threaten him.\n\n  \"I'm here on behalf of someone to solve a problem. I don't have time to fool around with you. If you keep being unreasonable, I'll pull some strings and have this girl sent to an orphanage. Judging by your appearance and circumstances, it doesn't look like you're capable of raising a child properly anyway.\"\n\n  \"You… You dare…\"\n\n  The old man's bluster immediately weakened.\n\n  The little girl was quick and clever. She pulled out a small wooden stool for Zhou Ze to sit on. Zhou Ze said thanks, blew a smoke ring, and pointed at the old man.\n\n  \"Talk. What exactly is the situation? You have Yin-Yang Eyes, right? You should be able to see things those villagers can't.\"\n\n  Old Man Cui's lips moved uncertainly. He asked tentatively, \"Are you really here to help?\"\n\n  \"What good would it do me to lie to you?\"\n\n  \"Fine, I'll tell you. This is a sin! A sin committed by the descendants! This bunch who've forgotten their ancestors, this bunch of…\"\n\n  \"Get to the point. Is it the spirits of the ancestors causing trouble in the village?\"\n\n  \"N-no, it's not.\" Old Man Cui shook his head.\n\n  \"Then why were you cursing them out?\"\n\n  \"I'm just furious! Such a good ancestral graveyard, such good feng shui! My parents, my grandparents, they were all buried there. But with one dig, all their remains tumbled together.\n\n  You're mixed in with me, I'm mixed in with you.\n\n  No one can even tell whose is whose!\n\n  If that's not a sin, what is?\"\n\n  Zhou Ze nodded. \"Keep talking. What is it, exactly?\"\n\n  \"Have you seen the threshold of my house?\"\n\n  \"I have. It's very high.\"\n\n  \"Be more specific.\"\n\n  Zhou Ze stood up and walked over to the living room threshold. It was old, like the mud-brick house itself, but on the outer side were two fresh scrape marks.\n\n  \"That night, it came. It broke down my door, trying to get in.\n\n  But the threshold was too high.\n\n  It couldn't hop over.\"\n\n  Zhou Ze looked up at Old Man Cui, who was still sitting on the bed, and said in a low voice,\n\n  \"A jiangshi?\"\n\n  \"*Cough, cough, cough…*\" Old Man Cui started coughing. \"Besides a jiangshi, what else could it be?\"\n\n  \"Then why didn't you say anything?\"\n\n  \"That day, it was wearing clothes…\" Old Man Cui's face twisted into a grimace. \"It was wearing local people's clothes. How would I know which person it's disguised as? It was dark. I couldn't see its face, and I didn't dare run outside to look.\"\n\n  \"I'm back.\"\n\n  Xu Qinglang returned, carrying some cooked dishes and a few boxed meals.\n\n  \"Oh, you're awake,\" Xu Qinglang said, glancing at Old Man Cui.\n\n  \"Heh heh.\" Old Man Cui chuckled but said no more. He recognized Xu Qinglang, who was, after all, a kid who had grown up in this area. Without needing help, Old Man Cui slowly made his way to the living room.\n\n  Xu Qinglang put the food on the small table and brought over a few stools.\n\n  The boxed meals were set down, and the cooked dishes were spread out on their plastic bags.\n\n  Zhou Ze sat down beside them, glanced at the small dining table, and asked, a little puzzled,\n\n  \"Why did you only buy three boxed meals?\"\n\n  \"What do you mean, *only* three?\n\n  There are three of us, so I bought three.\n\n  What, is your appetite even better today?\n\n  I can give you some of my rice.\"\n***\n**Footnotes:**\n¹ The original idiom `泉下有知，都得氣得跳腳` translates literally to \"If they knew in the underworld, they'd be so angry they'd jump up and down.\" \"Turning in their graves\" is a fitting English equivalent.\n² The original curse `挨千刀的小鬼` means \"(You) little ghost who deserves to be sliced a thousand times.\"",

    "content": "Three people?\n\nZhou Ze abruptly looked behind him at the little girl who had been standing there timidly the whole time.\n\nFrightened by Zhou Ze's gaze, the little girl subconsciously took a few steps back, looking to her grandfather for help.\n\nThe villagers and Xu Qinglang had both said that Old Man Cui was a madman with no wife or children.\n\nSo how could he possibly have a granddaughter?\n\nFurthermore, the little girl had only ever spoken and interacted with him. Whether it was earlier by the pond or inside the house, she hadn't had any interaction with anyone else.\n\nZhou Ze hadn't noticed this before, but now that he thought back on it carefully, he finally sensed something was off.\n\n\"Hey, what's wrong?\" Xu Qinglang asked, shoveling a mouthful of rice into his mouth.\n\nZhou Ze looked at Old Man Cui. He needed an explanation.\n\nOld Man Cui kept his head down, picked up his chopsticks, and started eating, seemingly with no intention of acknowledging Zhou Ze. At the same time, he grumbled about how Xu Qinglang hadn't brought him back any liquor.\n\n\"Give me an explanation,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Hm?\" Xu Qinglang looked at Zhou Ze, a little confused.\n\n\"This pig's head meat is definitely short-weighted. That guy Pig-Head Four must not recognize you anymore, otherwise he wouldn't have ripped you off,\" Old Man Cui lamented. \"In this day and age, it seems like an honest man just can't get rich.\"\n\nOld Man Cui was still treating Zhou Ze like he was thin air.\n\nXu Qinglang slowly put down his chopsticks. He could sense that the atmosphere was a bit off. More importantly, he knew his friend. Although he usually liked to lie on the sofa and bask in the sun, deep down, he was a man with a strong need for control.\n\nThis was probably related to his past life as a hospital director; he liked to have everything in his grasp. In the bookstore, he himself was the type with no worldly desires. And the others? Let's see...\n\nThe old Daoist?\n\nYingying?\n\nThe Death Knight?\n\nIn ancient times, they would be the house steward, the maidservant, and the guard.\n\nXu Qinglang felt pretty good about not classifying himself as the \"cook.\"\n\nOld Man Cui smacked his lips as he ate, his mouth glistening with grease.\n\nThen, a hand appeared behind his head.\n\n*Smack!*\n\n\"Mmph... mmph... mmph...\"\n\nOld Man Cui's entire face was pressed into the pile of cooked dishes. No matter how the old man struggled and resisted, it was useless.\n\n\"You think just because you have Yin-Yang Eyes, just because you're old, you can treat everyone like they're nothing?\"\n\n*Bang!*\n\nZhou Ze kicked one of the small table's legs, breaking it. Old Man Cui fell right onto the floor. The old man was still shouting something, but he was left to do nothing but eat dirt.\n\nThe little girl cried out and rushed over, trying to push Zhou Ze away and rescue her grandfather. But Zhou Ze's left hand instantly grew long fingernails, and wisps of black mist wrapped around the little girl, trapping her in place, unable to move.\n\nBut it also seemed that because of the black mist, Xu Qinglang could finally see the little girl's figure.\n\n\"Th... th... there's a child here!\"\n\nZhou Ze took a step back. Old Man Cui immediately scrambled up from the ground, wiped the grease and food from his face, and charged at Zhou Ze with a howl, ready to fight to the death.\n\nThis time, Boss Zhou was prepared.\n\nHe swung his arm, and a sharp elbow strike landed heavily on Old Man Cui's chest. Old Man Cui was old, after all. No matter how lazy Boss Zhou was, he was at least in the prime of his youth. Old Man Cui was knocked to the ground again.\n\nThe little girl, bound in place, cried anxiously.\n\n\"If you won't tell me, I'll just peel her open and see for myself.\n\n\"What kind of thing are you that even *I* couldn't tell you weren't human!\"\n\nZhou Ze stepped forward, his nails slowly lengthening.\n\nThe girl's presence hadn't felt the slightest bit strange to Zhou Ze, and that was the strangest thing of all, because Xu Qinglang and the villagers couldn't see her.\n\nShe was illusory, yet she was so real!\n\nThe nails drew closer and closer to the girl's skin.\n\n*If you're willing to peel my heart open, layer by layer, you will find, you will be amazed...*¹\n\nZhou Ze was now genuinely planning to peel the girl open to see what she was truly made of.\n\n\"Don't touch her! I'll talk, I'll talk! She's a corpse fetus I found by the ancestral graves.\"\n\nOld Man Cui seemed to have given up all resistance, ready to come clean.\n\nThis old man possessed the stubbornness common to people of his generation. The villagers' attitude toward him was also a testament to a major flaw in his social skills.\n\nHe was just stupid, truly stupid, to put on such airs in front of a Netherworld official.\n\n\"A corpse fetus, what's that?\" Xu Qinglang asked, not Old Man Cui, but Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Why are you looking at me?\" Zhou Ze retorted.\n\n\"You don't know?\"\n\n\"How would I know?\"\n\nOld Man Cui sighed and said, \"A corpse fetus is a form created from corpse qi. It's not that a corpse got pregnant and gave birth; it's when a body is already pregnant at the time of burial.\n\n\"But she died, so the fetus in her womb died too, becoming a stillborn.\n\n\"However, if the feng shui is right or other coincidental factors align, the dead infant in the womb can, in a state where the physical body is already dead, re-gestate and emerge from the body as a soul.\n\n\"Xiao Chai is just such an existence. Three years ago, I was passing by the graveyard and saw her kneeling there crying.\n\n\"I didn't recognize her, so I asked which village she was from. She said her mother was underground and that she had snuck out to play and now didn't know how to get back.\n\n\"So I brought her back and have been raising her ever since.\"\n\nAfter hearing Old Man Cui's story, Xu Qinglang immediately asked:\n\n\"You've been raising her?\"\n\n\"She only needs to drink a little blood every day—chicken blood, duck blood, it's all fine. Human blood works too. Just a small bowl is enough. She's very easy to raise, very well-behaved, and so considerate. She knows how to care for me. She's my own granddaughter, no, closer than my own granddaughter!\" Old Man Cui said, looking at the little girl.\n\n\"I didn't ask before, but is she the reason that zombie comes knocking on your door at night?\" Zhou Ze pointed at the little girl.\n\n\"She's mine, she's mine!\"\n\nOld Man Cui immediately hugged the little girl tightly.\n\n\"She is my granddaughter, my own granddaughter! No one is allowed to take her away from me. I'll die before I let anyone take her from my side!\"\n\n\"If that zombie is already causing minor trouble in the village, it's just because he's trying to find his daughter. If you keep blocking him and he can't find her, he might be driven into a frenzy.\n\n\"Just stealing some chickens and ducks, and the leaking baleful qi causing some nightmares—that's a small matter.\n\n\"Do you know what the consequences are when a zombie truly runs out of patience? You were born with Yin-Yang Eyes; you should know more about these things than the average person!\" Zhou Ze said, looking at Old Man Cui.\n\n\"If they die, let them die! A bunch of ingrates who've forgotten their ancestors!\n\n\"For a bit of relocation money, they'd abandon even their ancestral graves. Those people aren't worth any pity if they die!\n\n\"They deserve to die!\n\n\"They deserve it!\n\n\"Even if they all die, don't think for a second I'll hand over Xiao Chai. I'll never let Xiao Chai leave me!\"\n\n\"Grandpa, Xiao Chai doesn't want to leave Grandpa either. Xiao Chai wants to stay with you forever, Grandpa.\"\n\nThe little girl and Old Man Cui hugged each other, sobbing.\n\n\"Is that the reason for all this?\" Xu Qinglang leaned in and asked Zhou Ze quietly.\n\nIf the whole thing was because Old Man Cui, a man with innate Yin-Yang Eyes and a very unsuccessful life, wanted this granddaughter, then handing the girl over seemed like the most appropriate course of action.\n\nThe village could avoid a disaster, and the girl was a being formed from a corpse fetus anyway, not technically a living person.\n\n\"The timeline doesn't add up,\" Zhou Ze shook his head. \"The zombie's target is probably this girl, but it's likely not a father-daughter or mother-daughter relationship. Didn't you hear the old man? He adopted this girl three years ago.\n\n\"If her parents were really still around, and if they really had turned into zombies, first, it would be very difficult for her to have run out on her own, and second, after she'd been out for so long, her parents wouldn't have waited three years to come looking for her.\"\n\n\"So what's your take on it?\"\n\n\"The relocation of the ancestral graves, or maybe the construction project itself, caused a shift in the earth somewhere, and that's what let a zombie out.\n\n\"There are tons of strange incidents caused by big construction projects like this. The Dragon Pillar of the Yan'an Road Viaduct in Shanghai is one of them.\n\n\"Then, this zombie, acting on instinct, smelled this girl and wants to eat her to get stronger.\"\n\n\"Then why didn't you sense anything from her?\" Xu Qinglang asked.\n\n\"Primitive people drank blood and ate raw flesh, ancient people thanked the heavens for a mouthful of rice bran, and modern people not only want to be full, they demand to eat well.\"\n\n\"What a roundabout way to brag about your high-class bloodline,\" Xu Qinglang said with disdain.\n\nZhou Ze didn't argue.\n\nBecause he knew the real reason was that he wasn't currently in his zombie state.\n\nIf the consciousness inside him were to awaken, the first thing it would probably do is stuff this little girl into its mouth. It seemed to love eating these special departed souls to nourish itself.\n\n\"What do we do with this corpse fetus? Can we send her for reincarnation?\"\n\n\"We can. She was also formed from a departed soul. Her soul is just tainted with corpse qi, causing some changes, but she's still a departed soul at her core. With some processing, she can be sent to Hell for reincarnation.\n\n\"And the merit points for sending her on should be quite high.\"\n\n\"Then let's wait on that? Help me deal with that zombie first?\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't speak.\n\n\"Hey, do me a favor. You know, when we first met Yingying, how terrifying that was. I can't handle this alone.\"\n\nZhou Ze still didn't speak.\n\n\"This is my hometown, after all. I don't want to see it devastated.\"\n\nZhou Ze looked at Xu Qinglang, then lowered his head and looked at the tips of his shoes.\n\nHe scuffed the tip of his shoe on the ground and said:\n\n\"Sigh, in my past life, I finally saved up enough to buy a house. In this life, I don't even own one. What a failure.\"\n\n\"...\" said Xu Qinglang.\n\n\"You can't do a brother like that. This is blatant extortion,\" Xu Qinglang finally squeezed out.\n\n\"Can you give me a better reason to convince me to act?\" Zhou Ze retorted.\n\n\"Damn it, when you get down to it, isn't this thing your relative?!\n\n\"Your relative is about to cause trouble,\n\n\"and you're just going to sit back and do nothing?\"\n\n\"...\" said Zhou Ze.\n\n---\n¹ A sarcastic reference to the lyrics of the popular Chinese song \"Onion\" (洋蔥) by Aska Yang.",

    "content": "Night had fallen. The door to the small mud house was ajar.\n\nZhou Ze had deliberately arranged for the little girl to sit on the threshold. As for Old Man Cui, he had Xu Qinglang tie him up with a rope, gag his mouth, and seat him on a small stool in the living room.\n\nJust as Old Man Cui had said himself, he would rather see the entire village killed by the jiangshi than let his \"granddaughter\" leave him.\n\nThis was human nature.\n\nMaking such a choice, saying such words—it was all understandable, perfectly normal.\n\nAnd so, for Xu Qinglang to protect the village he was born in by having the little girl act as bait outside the house was also perfectly normal, also understandable.\n\nZhou Ze's plan to send the girl to the Underworld for reincarnation after this was over was also correct. After all, birth, old age, sickness, and death are the natural order of things. The little girl was already dead, so going to the Underworld to get a chance at rebirth was the proper path. Lingering in the mortal world would sooner or later cause problems.\n\nSince you, Old Man Cui, don't care if the whole village lives or dies, why should Zhou Ze and Xu Qinglang care about your opinion?\n\nMost importantly, the old man's temper was so foul it was truly detestable. In any case, Boss Zhou felt not the slightest impulse to help him with anything. It was better for everyone to just handle this as a business matter. There was no need to get bogged down in personal feelings and obligations—it was too damn troublesome.\n\nZhou Ze and Xu Qinglang both stood behind the door, leaning against the frame.\n\n\"Will it come?\"\n\n\"That depends on whether this old coot is hiding anything else.\" Zhou Ze glanced at Old Man Cui, who was tied up like a `zongzi`.¹\n\n\"What else could he be hiding?\"\n\n\"A person who's had Yin-Yang Eyes since birth and has lived this long—is it possible his life has been so peaceful and uneventful?\"\n\n\"True.\"\n\nBy the dead of night, Xu Qinglang was growing weary and sat right down on the floor, leaning against the base of the wall. Zhou Ze was fine, smoking one cigarette after another. He didn't need coffee or anything like that to fight off sleepiness; besides, he couldn't fall asleep without a freezer or Bai Yingying anyway.\n\nStill, waiting like this was pretty boring.\n\nOld Man Cui had exhausted himself struggling and had actually fallen asleep first. The little girl, however, continued to sit obediently on the threshold, constantly looking left and right, and turning back from time to time to check on her grandfather.\n\nBeing ruthless enough to use a little girl as bait, Zhou Ze himself felt a pang of guilt. But you can't catch a wolf if you're not willing to sacrifice the child.² Besides, the girl was a corpse fetus; there was no need to treat her as a completely normal child.\n\n\"Thump... thump...\"\n\nA sound came from the vegetable patch in the distance.\n\nZhou Ze immediately straightened up. Xu Qinglang, who had been dozing off, also shot to his feet.\n\nThe little girl wrapped her arms around her shoulders. She sensed the cold, and at the same time, she sensed fear.\n\n\"Thump... thump...\"\n\nThe sound was getting closer and closer.\n\nZhou Ze peered outside through the crack in the door. For now, he could only hear the sound; he hadn't yet seen the hopping figure.\n\nAfter about ten more minutes, the sound was still circling nearby, hiding itself in the shroud of darkness, but it refused to show itself.\n\n\"Jiangshi have intelligence?\" Xu Qinglang exclaimed in amazement.\n\n\"...\" said Zhou Ze.\n\nBut this wasn't the time for bickering. The jiangshi might have really sensed that something was wrong, so it didn't dare approach for the time being.\n\nThe little girl turned her head, her fear growing heavier. She subconsciously wanted to call for her grandfather, but Zhou Ze, standing behind her, made a \"shushing\" gesture. The little girl held it in, but her eyes welled up and turned red.\n\nAt that moment, Zhou Ze held out his palm. His fingernails grew long, and layers of black mist began to swirl around them. Zhou Ze crouched down and plunged his nails into the ground.\n\nThe black mist began to spread out, pointing in a single direction!\n\n\"Over there!\"\n\nThe next instant, Zhou Ze shot out past the threshold.\n\nSince that thing was refusing to come over, he might as well take the initiative. It was just one jiangshi; Boss Zhou really didn't think there was anything to be afraid of.\n\nBack when he and Bai Yingying had first met, if life were only like the first meeting,³ Bai Yingying's aura was like Wu Zetian holding court, but in the end, didn't he stab her until she cried?\n\nAhead was a vegetable patch, blocked by a simple fence. As Zhou Ze charged forward, a figure also \"hopped\" forward to meet him.\n\nIt was, indeed, hopping. The figure was wearing a black T-shirt and shorts. As it leaped out, it smashed the surrounding fence to pieces.\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nZhou Ze's body collided with the figure's. He felt a hardness like a steel plate from its body, and its momentum didn't lessen, carrying with it a terrifying resolve.\n\nMeanwhile, Zhou Ze's nails smoothly pierced into the figure's chest.\n\nBefore his nails, even the hardest chest would turn to soft clay.\n\n\"Squelch!\"\n\nIt felt like plunging his fingers into a split-open watermelon—greasy, mushy, with a thick, viscous sensation.\n\nThe figure's body shuddered, then twisted violently and curled up on the ground like a leech sprinkled with salt.\n\n\"How is it?\" Xu Qinglang ran over as well.\n\n\"It's dealt with.\"\n\nZhou Ze crouched down beside the man. The man had gradually stopped convulsing, and black mist began to rise from his body.\n\nTaking out his phone and shining the light on the man's face, Zhou Ze realized he had seen this man during the day. He was one of the villagers who had jumped into the water to save the drowning woman.\n\nHow could it be him?\n\nBy now, the man was no longer breathing. His body began to go limp, and black, purulent blood started to ooze from his eyes, ears, mouth, and nose.\n\nBeing pierced directly by Zhou Ze's nails was equivalent to having his very foundation scrambled. Even Bai Yingying back then could barely endure a mere scratch from his nails, let alone this thing, which was clearly no match for her.\n\n\"I know this person.\" Xu Qinglang also took out his phone to shine a light on him. \"It's Auntie Xu's third son, his name is...\"\n\n\"I recognize him too.\"\n\nZhou Ze cut Xu Qinglang off and turned the man's neck over.\n\nOn the left side of his neck were two clear bite marks.\n\nZhou Ze's fingers traced the bite marks, and then his gaze suddenly sharpened.\n\n\"This isn't right. This is a substitute, someone who was just bitten by the jiangshi and turned into a controlled walking corpse!\"\n\nThe next instant, Zhou Ze shot up and rushed back to the small mud house. The little girl who had been sitting on the threshold had vanished.\n\nWhen Zhou Ze burst into the house, Old Man Cui, who had been tied up like a `zongzi` by Xu Qinglang, was also gone. All that remained was a coil of rope and a stool.\n\nHe'd fallen for a trick. He'd actually fallen for a trick.\n\nWhen Xu Qinglang ran back and saw the empty room, he too frowned deeply.\n\n\"How is this possible...\"\n\nXu Qinglang was in disbelief.\n\nThis jiangshi wasn't Zhou Ze, nor was it Bai Yingying, who had been nourished by Madam Bai for two hundred years.\n\nBut it actually knew how to \"lure the tiger out of the mountains\"?⁴\n\n\"Did the jiangshi eat the old man too?\" Xu Qinglang muttered to himself.\n\n\"No.\"\n\nZhou Ze crouched down and picked up the rope scattered on the floor.\n\n\"The break in the rope was made by repeated sawing, not torn by a jiangshi's claws. The old man broke free himself.\"\n\nAs he spoke, Zhou Ze stood up and first looked outside.\n\n\"We were just in the vegetable patch out front. If the old man ran out of the house, it's impossible we wouldn't have known. Besides, knowing there was a jiangshi outside eyeing him like a tiger, he shouldn't be stupid enough to rush out and try to escape. At least in the house, we could still guarantee his and his granddaughter's safety.\"\n\nHearing this, Xu Qinglang first walked over to the kitchen to check, then went to the bedroom, and pointed at the bed, shouting:\n\n\"Under here, there's a tunnel!\"\n\nZhou Ze got up and walked over. Sure enough, the bed platform had been pushed aside, and there was indeed a tunnel underneath.\n\nA lonely old widower, with only a ghost granddaughter for company, and on terrible terms with the villagers—what was he digging a tunnel for?\n\nCould it be that Old Man Cui became obsessed with *Tunnel Warfare*⁵ when he was young and built one for his own house when he had nothing better to do?\n\n\"You go deal with that corpse first. Get it inside and hide it well. I'll follow the tunnel and give chase. Be careful,\" Zhou Ze instructed Xu Qinglang.\n\nXu Qinglang nodded. The walking corpse had just been killed by Zhou Ze, but leaving the body out in the open until villagers passed by at dawn would inevitably cause a huge commotion. Someone did indeed need to take care of it first.\n\nAfter Xu Qinglang left, Zhou Ze jumped into the tunnel alone. It wasn't spacious; for most of it, he had to bend over or even crawl to get through.\n\nAnd the tunnel was really not short.\n\nIn his heart, Zhou Ze began to admire the old bachelor's nighttime capabilities. While other men were plowing fields and sowing seeds, he was here digging a hole.\n\nAbout four minutes later, the tunnel began to slope upwards. Zhou Ze noticed scuff marks from someone having just passed through, and the trapdoor above was also open. Zhou Ze emerged with ease.\n\nAfter coming out, Zhou Ze was surprised to find he was in another old tiled-roof house. It was very dilapidated, and it looked like no one came here often.\n\nThere were many houses like this in the countryside. They were usually for the elderly to live in. After the old folks passed away, the younger generation would have long since moved into newly built multi-story homes. These old houses were then either used as kitchens or for storing junk.\n\nSure enough, when Zhou Ze rounded a corner and entered the main hall, he saw a memorial altar. On it were two candles, unlit and covered in cobwebs. Between the candles was an incense burner full of ash, and behind it was a black-and-white photograph of an old woman.\n\nThe old woman was baring her white teeth, smiling very happily.\n\nOld Man Cui's tunnel led here. Could it be that this old woman was Old Man Cui's mistress when she was alive?\n\nMaybe the old woman had been widowed long ago but had children, so it wasn't convenient for her to be with Old Man Cui. In the countryside, finding a new partner for a widowed parent was a very difficult thing, mainly because the children would feel they were losing face.\n\nBut Old Man Cui's dedication, digging a tunnel for secret trysts, was truly touching.\n\nBut things had changed, and the people were no longer the same. The old woman had passed on first.\n\nZhou Ze guessed that Old Man Cui hadn't used this tunnel in a long time. This time, it was purely a means of escape.\n\n\"Heh.\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head and walked through the main hall. He had to find Old Man Cui as quickly as possible, because he knew that the intelligent jiangshi was also looking for the grandfather and granddaughter.\n\nMoreover, that jiangshi had started out just stealing chickens and dogs,⁶ but now it had started killing people!\n\nWhat Zhou Ze didn't see was that after he passed through the main hall, on the cobweb-covered memorial altar, the smile of the old woman in the black-and-white photograph, who was already smiling, grew even wider.\n\n***\n\n¹ A `zongzi` is a pyramid-shaped glutinous rice dumpling wrapped in bamboo leaves, a common metaphor for someone tied up tightly.\n\n² The original is a Chinese proverb, 捨不得孩子套不住狼 (shě bu de háizi, tào bu zhù láng), which literally translates to this.\n\n³ The original is a famous line of classical Chinese poetry, 人生若只是初見 (rénshēng ruò zhǐshì chūjiàn), from a poem by Nalan Xingde, lamenting how relationships inevitably change and sour over time.\n\n⁴ \"Lure the tiger out of the mountains\" (調虎離山, diào hǔ lí shān) is one of the ancient Thirty-Six Stratagems, meaning to lure an enemy away from their stronghold.\n\n⁵ *Tunnel Warfare* (《地道戰》) is a famous 1965 Chinese war film about villagers using a complex network of tunnels to fight against Japanese invaders during the Second Sino-Japanese War.\n\n⁶ The original is the idiom 偷雞摸狗 (tōu jī mō gǒu), literally \"to steal chickens and feel for dogs,\" which means to engage in petty theft or other minor illicit activities.",

    "content": "In the lonely little mud house,\n\nXu Qinglang was lost in deep thought.\n\nBefore him,\n\nlay the corpse he had just dragged in from the vegetable patch outside.\n\nHe recognized this corpse. It was the third son of Auntie Xu from the village. He was not yet thirty this year, unmarried, and normally worked at the shipyard. He had a good reputation in the village because he was always willing to help others.\n\nNo matter which family had a problem, if someone called on him, he would be sure to come and help. For example, if one family needed to repair their house, or another couldn't harvest their wheat in time, and so on. The payment was nothing more than a meal and some wine.\n\nThis was a spirit of neighborly mutual assistance that belonged to the older generation, something already very rare among the young. But he had always maintained it, and many of his peers thought he was simple-minded.\n\nOf course, no matter how popular he was, it had little to do with Xu Qinglang. Although he was born in the village, he had left it long ago.\n\nNow was not the time for sorrowful reminiscences or holding a memorial service.\n\nHe had to figure out how to dispose of this corpse first.\n\nXu Qinglang remembered from when he watched *The Deer and the Cauldron* that Wei Xiaobao had a kind of Bone-dissolving Water. Just a few drops poured on a person, and they would be corroded away completely. Xu Qinglang didn't know if such a thing existed in reality, but he knew he didn't have time to go looking for it right now.\n\nOr perhaps,\n\nDismemberment?\n\nChop the body up bit by bit, maybe even stir-fry it into a dish?\n\nThat seems a bit twisted.\n\nBut why did he suddenly feel an eager impulse to try it?\n\nHe must have been infected by that pervert, Zhou Ze.\n\nShaking his head, Xu Qinglang decided to use the stupidest method first.\n\nDig a hole,\n\nand bury this corpse for now.\n\nLater, he could burn some spirit money, and the matter should be put to rest. After all, although Zhou Ze had killed him, the man was already a walking corpse when he was killed. He had died long ago; Zhou Ze killing him was, in a way, granting him release.\n\nXu Qinglang fetched a shovel from the house and went to the vegetable patch in front of the door to start digging.\n\nIn truth, the mud house didn't have any tiles or concrete laid down; it was also an earthen floor. But after being trodden on by people for so many years, the ground had been compacted solid and was impossible to dig.\n\nAs he dug, Xu Qinglang leaned on the shovel, panting uncontrollably. For someone who didn't usually do farm work and had recently entered a state of \"self-maintenance,\" this kind of labor was truly a bit much to handle.\n\n\"Woooo... wooooo...\"\n\nFrom a distance, a faint whimpering sound seemed to drift over. It sounded a bit like someone crying, but upon closer listening, it didn't seem like crying. The tune had a certain cadence, a winding and melodious quality.\n\nThe countryside was very quiet at night, especially at this hour. Where could such a sound be coming from?\n\nXu Qinglang subconsciously reached for the Heart-guarding Mirror in his pocket. To be honest, with Boss Zhou not around, Xu Qinglang felt genuinely uneasy, a constant sense of insecurity.\n\nThe whimpering sound drew nearer. Xu Qinglang abruptly raised his shovel. Although he only heard the sound and saw nothing, the sense of crisis was so strong that it sent adrenaline coursing madly through him.\n\n\"Hooo... hooo...\"\n\nDeep breaths.\n\nHe kept taking deep breaths.\n\nXu Qinglang held the shovel in one hand and clutched the Heart-guarding Mirror in the other.\n\nCould it be that Old Zhou didn't catch the jiangshi, and it had circled back for a surprise attack?\n\nThe atmosphere,\n\ngrew extremely tense.\n\nCold sweat began to drip from Xu Qinglang's forehead.\n\nA standoff,\n\na confrontation,\n\npersisted.\n\nAfter about twenty minutes,\n\na few mischievous, sleepless crows flew overhead in the dark night,\n\nletting out cries of \"Caw... caw... caw...\"\n\nA gust of wind blew past,\n\nand a few fallen leaves swirled before him and were swept away.\n\nXu Qinglang and the air,\n\nhad been in a standoff for twenty minutes.\n\nThe whimpering sound began to slowly fade, eventually becoming almost imperceptible.\n\nAfter listening for so long, Xu Qinglang had at least confirmed one thing: it definitely wasn't someone crying. It was more like someone, with nothing better to do late at night, was leisurely playing a xiao flute.\n\nWho the hell has this much time on their hands!\n\nHe remained vigilant for a while longer. Only after the sound had completely disappeared did Xu Qinglang let out a long sigh of relief. The alert was over.\n\nHe continued digging for a while. He had originally wanted to dig deeper, but exhaustion had already overcome him. He ended up digging a very makeshift hole. In any case, he would have to rely on spirit money to avoid trouble later on; burying the corpse now was just to prevent it from being discovered by the villagers in the near future.\n\nWalking back into the house, he saw the corpse still lying there quietly. There was a clear indentation on its chest, and around the indentation were five small holes.\n\nA jiangshi was certainly tough.\n\nIn fact, if a dead body is well-preserved, it does become much \"sturdier\" than a living person after rigor mortis sets in. A jiangshi, moreover, is formed from resentment and obsession, its body even more solid.\n\nBut no matter how solid the body was, it had still been pierced straight through by Zhou Ze's fingernails.\n\nXu Qinglang took a sip of water and pulled out his phone, preparing to send a message to Zhou Ze to ask where he was and whether he had found Old Man Cui.\n\nTo hunt wild geese all day, only to be pecked by a goose in the end.\n\nNeither Xu Qinglang nor Zhou Ze had expected that the foul-tempered Old Man Cui would pull a fast one,¹ feigning sleep while secretly cutting his ropes with who-knows-what. Then, while he and Zhou Ze rushed out of the house to deal with the walking corpse, the old man had decisively escaped with his granddaughter through a hidden tunnel.\n\nWhy the old man had to escape was also simple: because the two of them had used his precious granddaughter as bait, and Zhou Ze had also planned to send his granddaughter for reincarnation after the matter was settled.\n\nOne could only say that Zhou Ze had been right before: for someone born with Yin-Yang Eyes to live to such an old age without a few tricks up his sleeve would be hard for anyone to believe.\n\n\"Why is there no signal?\"\n\nXu Qinglang tapped his phone.\n\nAt that very moment, the corpse that had been lying there, thoroughly dead, slowly sat up.\n\nSilently,\n\nwithout making the slightest sound.\n\nXu Qinglang continued fiddling with his phone, anxious to contact Zhou Ze, completely oblivious to the situation behind him.\n\nIt wasn't that Xu Qinglang was particularly careless. In fact, even if Zhou Ze himself were here, he wouldn't have thought that the walking corpse he had killed with his own nails could stir up any more trouble.\n\nBut against all odds,\n\nit got up.\n\nAnd it slowly opened its mouth,\n\nrevealing two sinister fangs.\n\n\"Huh?\" Xu Qinglang sniffed the air. Why was there a sudden smell of pickled garlic?\n\nHis past as a chef gave him a natural sensitivity to smells, which made Xu Qinglang subconsciously glance behind him.\n\nAnd then,\n\ntheir eyes met!\n\nThe corpse lunged forward, its fangs sinking directly into Xu Qinglang's neck.\n\nXu Qinglang frantically pushed and beat at the thing in front of him, but it clung to him like a caterpillar, refusing to let go.\n\nEnduring the excruciating pain in his neck,\n\nXu Qinglang took out the Heart-guarding Mirror from his pocket,\n\nand shouted in a low voice:\n\n\"Limitless Heaven and Earth, Mystic Heart's True Law!\"\n\nA layer of faint blue ripples shimmered across the surface of the Heart-guarding Mirror.\n\nThe next moment,\n\nXu Qinglang slammed the Heart-guarding Mirror directly onto the thing's body.\n\nThe thing's body trembled ceaselessly, as if in great pain, but it still held its death grip on Xu Qinglang's neck. Its hands and feet began to clamber up him, like an octopus trying to have its way with him by force!\n\nWith a thud,\n\nXu Qinglang was actually pushed to the ground.\n\nHis attacker’s body trembled and writhed unceasingly,\n\npinning Xu Qinglang to the ground and grinding against him with abandon!\n\nDisgust,\n\nNausea,\n\nDiscomfort,\n\nAgony,\n\nPain...\n\nXu Qinglang knew that unless Zhou Ze could arrive at the last second like a cop in a Hong Kong movie, he was likely going to meet his end here today.\n\nBut this thing,\n\nit was clearly cold and dead.\n\nHow could it move again?\n\nRight,\n\nit was the flute music!\n\nIt must have something to do with that flute music!\n\nBut thinking about the flute music now was too late and utterly meaningless.\n\nFor the first time,\n\nXu Qinglang felt that this village where he was born was so alien and terrifying to him, as if a curtain had always been drawn over it, and he had never truly walked through it.\n\nHis hands struggled desperately.\n\nXu Qinglang's fingers touched an indentation,\n\nthe spot where Zhou Ze's nails had pierced through.\n\n\"Limitless Heaven and Earth, Mystic Heart's True Law!\"\n\nXu Qinglang chanted the incantation one last time,\n\ngritted his teeth,\n\nand shoved his Heart-guarding Mirror directly into the walking corpse's chest through the wound.\n\n\"Sssssssssssssssssss...\"\n\nBlack smoke began to pour from the walking corpse's eyes, ears, mouth, and nose. It leaped off Xu Qinglang, then fell to the ground, rolling about madly, like an insect sprayed with pesticide in its final death throes.\n\nInside the walking corpse's body, the Heart-guarding Mirror continuously emitted a blue light, relentlessly burning it from within.\n\nIn the end,\n\nthe walking corpse once again lay motionless on the ground. And then, its body slowly began to decay, melting into a puddle of pus.\n\nSoon,\n\nas the moisture was absorbed by the earthen floor,\n\nall that remained was a clear human-shaped stain on the ground.\n\nThe Bone-dissolving Water from Wei Xiaobao that Xu Qinglang had been daydreaming about had, this time, truly come to pass.\n\nBending down, Xu Qinglang used his sleeve to cover his hand and picked up the black object in the middle of the human stain. It was his Heart-guarding Mirror, but now it was completely charred.\n\nHe, Xu Qinglang, had few assets to his name, and his mastery of mystic arts was half-baked at best. This small magic tool was one of the few decent things he had. Now, it was completely ruined.\n\nHowever,\n\nthat wasn't the most pressing issue.\n\nXu Qinglang picked up his phone and walked over to the broken mirror in the main room.\n\nHe turned on his phone's rear flashlight, aimed it at his neck,\n\nand in the mirror,\n\non the left side of his neck,\n\nwas a pair of extremely clear fang marks.\n\nThe nearby flesh was torn and mangled, but no fresh blood flowed out. Instead, tiny black particles were constantly churning within, looking utterly nauseating.\n\nXu Qinglang gently touched his wound with a trembling hand.\n\nA sense of doom,\n\nslowly washed over him...\n\n***\n**Footnotes:**\n¹ \"Pull a fast one\" is a translation of the Chinese idiom 暗度陳倉 (àn dù chén cāng), which literally means \"to secretly cross the Chencang trail.\" It refers to a historical military feint and is used to describe any act of achieving one's goal through misdirection.",

    "content": "In many rural areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, the layout of a house often consists of an old single-story building on one side and a two-story or taller building on the other. The older generation typically lives in the single-story house, while the next generation and the one after live in the multi-story building.\n\nAfter the elders pass away, the single-story house is either kept as a storage room or torn down and replaced with a new one to be used as a kitchen or for other purposes.\n\nWhen Zhou Ze walked out of this single-story house, he saw a three-story villa with a large courtyard out front. Beyond that was a self-maintained fishpond.\n\nThe property was surrounded by farmland. Although this was a common sight in the countryside, from another perspective, it was a genuine countryside villa.\n\nOld Man Cui must have emerged from the tunnel of his mud-brick house and arrived here. But now the question was, where did Old Man Cui go after leaving this single-story house?\n\nUnder the cover of night, if Old Man Cui and his daughter were to hide in some random corner of the fields, Zhou Ze would have a very hard time finding them.\n\nThe people in the multi-story building were still awake. Even though it was late, sounds of drinking and laughter could be heard from inside.\n\nZhou Ze walked into the courtyard in front of the building and lit a cigarette. The events of the evening had left him feeling somewhat annoyed. For the current Boss Zhou, perhaps the most pleasant thing to do was to sit in his bookstore and wait for the willing to take the bait.\n\nIt was like calling a number from one of those little cards slipped under a hotel room door. The person who showed up was definitely not as pretty as the picture, but at least you were guaranteed they were plug and play.\n\nIf you went out looking for a place yourself, and you didn't have a membership card or weren't a regular customer, they probably wouldn't even give you the time of day, telling you that their services were strictly legitimate, as pure as an exquisite white lotus flower.\n\nBut just as Zhou Ze was smoking,\n\nhis nose suddenly twitched.\n\nIt wasn't that Boss Zhou's nose had evolved into a dog's, but rather that his past life's identity had made him extremely sensitive to a certain smell.\n\nThe smell of disinfectant!\n\nAt this very moment, the smell of disinfectant was wafting from this house. This made Zhou Ze turn around to face the building. He dropped his cigarette, stamped it out with his shoe, walked to the side door, used his fingernail to pick the lock, pushed the door open, and went inside.\n\nThe ground floor likely contained the kitchen and living room. The side room Zhou Ze was in also had a large corn-drying area.\n\nOnly in the countryside could one afford such a luxurious use of living space.\n\nAt the corner of the living room, there was a staircase leading to the second floor.\n\nThe sounds of laughter were coming from the second floor. Zhou Ze slowly walked up, and the smell of disinfectant grew stronger.\n\n\"Why isn't Lao San here yet? Didn't we agree to drink and watch the game together tonight?\"\n\n\"Who knows with him. Maybe some widow invited him over to fix her toilet again, hahahaha.\"\n\n\"That Lao San, he's just too eager to help. He'll do anything you ask him to. What a fool.\"\n\n\"Don't be so naive. Let me tell you, Lao San is smarter than he looks. Bet he's knocked on the doors of plenty of young wives.\"\n\nIn the living room, three men were sitting, watching TV and drinking. The small table was laden with food like pig's head meat and peanuts. The atmosphere was lively.\n\n\"Yo, it's in! Hahahaha, it's really a goal!\"\n\n\"Damn it!\"\n\n\"I told you not to bet on Saudi Arabia to win. The Saudi team is a pushover in Asia, and Russia is a pushover in Europe. They're both pushovers, but there's still a big gap. If you had China's national team play Saudi Arabia, Saudi Arabia would still have a 60-40 edge.\"\n\n\"Didn't the national team beat Saudi Arabia in the last Asian Cup?\"\n\n\"Yeah, in the last Asian Cup, Wang Dalei saved a penalty first, then Yu Hai's free kick was deflected in. I think they won one-nil.\"\n\n\"I just saw the high odds and wanted to bet on an upset, you know?\"\n\n\"Brother, Shunzi, you two keep it down. My wife and the kid are still sleeping inside.\"\n\n\"It's fine. We're grown men watching a game at night, what's a woman going to say? No big deal, no big deal.\"\n\nThe three men, shirtless, were boasting while watching the soccer match. Zhou Ze came up the stairs but didn't enter the living room. Instead, he turned and headed toward the rooms on the other side.\n\nBecause Zhou Ze had smelled something even stranger.\n\nIt was, likewise, a smell that his profession in his past life had made him very sensitive to.\n\nThe smell of fresh blood.\n\nZhou Ze pushed open the bedroom door. Heh, to be honest, it really felt like something out of a rustic porno novel, sneaking into a neighbor's house in the dead of night to steal a taste of the forbidden fruit.\n\nExcept Boss Zhou had no such thoughts in his mind right now, because the stench of blood was growing stronger and stronger.\n\nThe lights were off in the room. The furnishings were simple: a large bed, a wardrobe, and other things. The room was very spacious.\n\nZhou Ze had just taken a step inside when he froze.\n\nHe seemed to have stepped on something underfoot. It was a bit sticky.\n\nFumbling on the wall next to the door for a moment, Zhou Ze found the light switch.\n\n*Click!*\n\nWith a crisp sound,\n\nZhou Ze turned on the light.\n\nA pool of blood had dripped from the bed and was slowly spreading across the floor. Zhou Ze's shoe had landed right in the slowly advancing blood.\n\nOn the bed lay what appeared to be a mother and son. Their bodies were twisted in death, their demise exceedingly gruesome, as if they had been mauled by a wild beast—a mauling that carried a strong sense of revenge.\n\nZhou Ze walked over to examine them. He wasn't a police officer and couldn't do criminal investigation work. He just wanted to confirm what kind of thing had done this.\n\nWas it human,\n\nor...?\n\nAfter inspecting the wounds, Zhou Ze saw that the mother and son had been bitten to death, and in an extremely swift manner.\n\nThe most ridiculous part was,\n\nthe woman's husband and the child's father,\n\nwas still in the living room at this very moment, drinking and watching the soccer match with his two friends, completely oblivious to the tragedy that had occurred in the bedroom.\n\n\"I'm going to the bathroom. Damn it, that Saudi team made me lose money.\"\n\nOne of the men went directly to the second-floor bathroom.\n\n\"Brother, you bet on four-nil, right?\"\n\n\"Yeah, four-nil.\"\n\n\"Just one more goal to go.\"\n\n\"Don't worry, it'll happen. The Saudis have collapsed, they've lost all confidence.\"\n\nAs the match neared its end, Russia scored another goal, making the score four-nil.\n\n\"Yes! Yes!\"\n\nThe homeowner shouted, pumping his fists.\n\nThe friend next to him saw that he had won and felt a bit sour. He had also placed a bet, but he had already lost. He could only say helplessly:\n\n\"Why isn't Shunzi back from the bathroom yet? I'll go check on him. Hope he didn't get depressed and kill himself in there.\"\n\nIn the living room, only the homeowner was left. He was gleefully drinking and eating peanuts, happy as could be.\n\nThe match was in stoppage time, and the outcome was pretty much set. He could wait to collect his winnings.\n\nHe had won money on the World Cup opener, which proved his luck was running hot.\n\nMeanwhile, Zhou Ze continued to inspect the situation in the bedroom. He could now be certain of one thing: this was the work of a zombie. But the habits of this zombie were somewhat unfamiliar to him.\n\nUnlike Bai Yingying and himself, this zombie possessed a strong sense of purpose. This included using a walking corpse to lure him and Xu Qinglang out, which, from another perspective, did help Old Man Cui pull off his deception.\n\nAnd the brutal death of the woman and child in this house at the fangs of the zombie also seemed to signify something.\n\nXu Qinglang's hometown, why is it so full of damn trouble?\n\nZhou Ze shook his head, annoyed.\n\nHe covered the deceased on the bed with a blanket, turned off the light, and concealed himself in the darkness. He could feel that the thing, like him, was probably hiding in some corner of the house.\n\nJust killing two people probably wasn't enough to satisfy it, right?\n\nThere were still three men in this house, their lifeblood at its most vigorous. *Come on, I'm waiting for you.*\n\nThis wasn't the first time Zhou Ze had used people as bait. He had tried it before with the little girl, and it had ended in an accident, but that wouldn't stop Zhou Ze from choosing to do it again.\n\nIf he acted rashly and alerted the people here, letting the creature hiding in the darkness escape, heaven knew where it would flee to next. He didn't have that much time to play hide-and-seek with it.\n\nTime,\n\nslowly ticked by.\n\nSuddenly, Zhou Ze heard a commotion from the bathroom in the distance. It all happened in an instant, but Zhou Ze sensed it. He immediately skirted the living room and rushed toward the bathroom.\n\nThe bathroom door was open. It had a squat toilet, not a sitting one.\n\nAs Zhou Ze arrived, he happened to see a black shadow darting away. As Zhou Ze passed the bathroom doorway, he saw two male corpses lying crossed over the squat toilet, their stomachs ripped wide open, intestines and other things pulled out.\n\nSo fast.\n\nIt was truly fast.\n\nThis speed,\n\nwas almost unbelievable to Zhou Ze. The walking corpses he had dealt with before were in a completely different league compared to this original.\n\nZhou Ze was the fisherman, but the fish had swallowed the bait and run off at lightning speed before he could even reel in his line.\n\n...\n\nThe homeowner had no idea that a stranger had entered his house.\n\nAnd that what had entered,\n\nwere two zombies.\n\nHe was still drinking, leisurely waiting for the match to end. Only one minute left. Sweet, so sweet.\n\nBut just then,\n\nRussian player Golovin bent a free kick over the wall and into the corner of the net. The Saudi goalkeeper couldn't reach it. The score was rewritten to \"five-nil\"!\n\n\"Fuck!\"\n\nThe homeowner, in a fit of anger, swept the plate of peanuts in front of him onto the floor.\n\nHis winnings had just flown away.\n\nAnd in the final moment, just as the referee was about to blow the whistle.\n\nHe was truly and thoroughly frustrated.\n\n\"Damn it, you two, did you die in the toilet or what!\" the homeowner cursed, seeing his two friends still hadn't returned from the bathroom.\n\nHe propped his feet up on the coffee table and lit a cigarette. He was really not happy, very, very not happy.\n\nBefore the cigarette was even lit,\n\nsuddenly,\n\nthe homeowner heard a noise from under the coffee table.\n\nIt sounded like a rat eating something.\n\n\"Fuck, what the hell is that!\"\n\nThe man took his feet down.\n\nHe lowered his head and looked underneath.\n\nSomething was eating.\n\nWhen the man ducked his head down,\n\nhe saw a stooped woman in burial clothes, her head buried as she ate the peanuts and pig's head meat he had just swept off the table.\n\nThe woman froze for a moment.\n\nShe turned her head,\n\nand looked over.\n\nIt was a terrifying face.\n\nHer hair was graying.\n\nHer lips were covered in fresh blood. Her eyes, in particular, glowed with a dim red light. But she had a natural curve to her lips, just like in her black-and-white photos.\n\nShe was smiling.\n\nShe loved to smile.\n\nShe was smiling in every photograph.\n\nSo when she died, and her son was choosing a photo for her funeral portrait, he found that they were all pictures of her smiling. In the end, he had no choice but to bite the bullet and pick one.\n\nSeeing this scene,\n\nthe homeowner trembled in fear.\n\nHis mouth fell open.\n\nAfter a long moment, he managed to force out a single word:\n\n\"Ma...\"",

    "content": "The old woman's smile slowly froze. In its place, a deep chill surged in the depths of her eyes, especially when the homeowner cried out the word \"Ma.\"\n\nIt seemed to have completely awakened the motherly love deep within her.\n\nShe twisted her neck as if \"savoring\" this address, her body trembling with it, like an addict taking a beautiful, long-awaited drag after being starved for ages.\n\nImmediately after, she crawled on the ground like a gecko, rushing directly in front of the homeowner. Her hands, like two \"shovels,\" slammed down hard on the sofa as her body lunged forward like an unbridled tiger.\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nThe sofa was knocked over.\n\nThe homeowner was sent tumbling, rolling onto the floor. The impact was immense; who knows how many ribs he'd broken. He lay on the ground, unable to get up for a moment.\n\n\"Ma, Ma, don't come over, don't come over, DON'T COME OVER!!!\" the homeowner cried, kneeling on the ground.\n\nIt was like a game of hide-and-seek with his mother from his childhood.\n\nExcept this son was a bit old,\n\nand this mother was a bit agile.\n\nA mother's love is like a mountain.\n\nAnd it was, quite literally,\n\nabout to crush you to death!\n\nThe old woman leaped, opening her mouth to reveal terrifying, sinister fangs. Between her fangs and lips, fresh blood dripped and flowed—it was her daughter-in-law's blood, her grandson's blood!\n\nTowards her son, she seemed even more frenzied, more impatient. It was like a grand banquet: after sampling the appetizers one by one, the main course finally arrives, marking the true cli...max of the entire feast!\n\n\"Aaaaaaaah!!!!\"\n\nA black mist suddenly surged up and swept over the old woman. She let out a piercing shriek, like a cat whose tail had been stepped on, and shot backward.\n\nEven more ridiculously,\n\nshe actually scrambled onto the wall, tilting her head to assess the situation. And judging by her movements, she was very stable.\n\nZhou Ze walked into the living room. Looking at the old woman on the wall, his expression grew grave. This old woman's speed was far greater than he had anticipated.\n\n\"Save me... save me...\" The homeowner, lying on the floor, reached out to Zhou Ze for help.\n\n\"She's your mother?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"She is my mother,\" the homeowner nodded.\n\n\"Oh.\"\n\nZhou Ze looked again at the old woman on the wall.\n\nSo this was a blood-kin vendetta?\n\nGenerally, when an ancestor's corpse is unearthed and reanimates, the ones it can most easily sense are those with a direct bloodline connection. To a newly-risen jiangshi, they are like a beacon in the night, guiding them to go and kill them. In fact, this could also be understood as a new life severing its old ties.\n\n\"My mom's dead! She's been dead for years!\" the homeowner cried out to Zhou Ze, his worldview completely shattered.\n\nFor any normal person, seeing their mother who had been dead for years suddenly appear before them and try to kill them was a mental blow sufficient to cause a total breakdown.\n\nZhou Ze ignored the son muttering to himself at the side,\n\nand instead伸手指了指那個在牆壁上張望著這裡的老太婆。\n\n\"You want to kill him?\"\n\nZhou Ze pointed at the homeowner,\n\n\"Then come down and kill him.\"\n\nThe old woman remained cautious and didn't advance. Her eyes kept darting toward Zhou Ze's fingernails; clearly, she was terrified of them.\n\n\"Heh.\"\n\nZhou Ze was a bit troubled.\n\nHe had truly never seen such an agile jiangshi. Even Bai Yingying's specialty was merely her immense strength, but asking Bai Yingying to scale walls and leap across rooftops was unrealistic.\n\nYet the old woman before him had done just that. She was much more nimble. If it weren't for the dense corpse qi emanating from her, Zhou Ze would have started to suspect this damn thing was a jiangshi possessed by some great monkey spirit.\n\nIt was very frustrating.\n\nThe thing was on the wall,\n\nand Boss Zhou didn't know lightness skill¹; he couldn't get up there.\n\nAt the same time, Zhou Ze also understood why he hadn't run into the old woman earlier. She had probably been moving back and forth on the exterior walls of the house, waiting for an opportunity to get in and kill. She didn't need to enter through the door like he did.\n\n\"Hey, are you going to kill him or not?\"\n\nZhou Ze hauled the homeowner up from the floor,\n\nshook him,\n\n\"Come on and kill him. Here, you can have him. Really, I'm not tricking you. Be good, now come on down.\"\n\n\"...\" The homeowner.\n\nThe old woman still wouldn't come down. She was wary of Zhou Ze, afraid of him. This fear even suppressed her impulse to kill her own son.\n\n\"Hey, call her 'Mama' a few more times. Call your mother over,\"\n\nZhou Ze said to the homeowner.\n\nThe homeowner's face was a mask of grief.\n\nHe felt that something was very wrong here.\n\n\"Who are you...\" the homeowner asked Zhou Ze.\n\n\"I told you to call her 'Mama,' why are you asking so many questions.\"\n\nWith that, Zhou Ze slapped the homeowner across the face, then looked back at the old woman on the wall.\n\n\"Hey, if you don't come down, I'm gonna kill your hostage!\"\n\nThe old woman tilted her head slightly, continuing to observe from her perch on the wall.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head and threw the homeowner back onto the floor. And right at that moment, the old woman suddenly moved. She had been on the side wall, but now she did a gecko-walk right across the ceiling and then dropped straight down!\n\nHer speed was astonishing.\n\nAs expected, a mother just can't let go of her son.\n\nZhou Ze's body paused for a fraction of a second, then he threw his arms upward. His ten fingernails instantly grew long, becoming the length of scythes, and he thrust them straight up!\n\nThe old woman descended like the wind. When she saw Zhou Ze's terrifying nails, she froze, but her momentum was already unstoppable, irreversible.\n\n*Shlllllick...*\n\nThe nails tore through her body, piercing into her flesh. It was so clean, so smooth, without the slightest resistance. When it came to fighting jiangshi, Zhou Ze was more professional than any plant.\n\nEver had toothpick meat?\n\nZhou Ze now felt like a worker in the back of a skewer shop, skewering meat.\n\nThe old woman's chest was completely pierced by his ten fingernails. At the same time, as she slid down, not yet dead, she actually opened her mouth and tried to bite Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze immediately sidestepped, swung his arms down, and flung the old woman away. She crashed into the TV and landed on the floor.\n\nShe tried to get up, but it was clearly a struggle. Her eyes, however, remained locked on her son.\n\nZhou Ze glanced at the yellow-green liquid dripping from his nails, feeling utterly disgusted. All he wanted now was to finish this old woman off quickly and go get his nails done.\n\nHowever, as Zhou Ze walked toward the old woman again, someone rushed up the stairs.\n\nIt was Old Man Cui!\n\nOld Man Cui saw Zhou Ze and raised his arm. In his hand was an axe.\n\n*Whoosh...*\n\nOld Man Cui unhesitatingly threw the axe at Zhou Ze. Zhou Ze swiped with his nails, deflecting the axe, but in the next instant, Old Man Cui took something else off his back. It was a crossbow!\n\nA crossbow you'd often see at amusement parks for shooting balloons to win prizes.\n\n*Twang!*\n\nWith a sharp sound,\n\nBoss Zhou, having just batted away the axe, had no time to react. He felt a thud in his chest, took two steps back, and was forced to his knees.\n\n\"Aaaaaaaah!!!\"\n\nThe old woman struggled, clawing her way across the floor with her hands. She didn't dare charge back into the living room; instead, she scrambled toward Old Man Cui. But she didn't attack him. Instead, she tucked the scrawny Old Man Cui under her arm and leaped straight off the balcony.\n\nZhou Ze only heard a *thump*, and the two of them must have landed.\n\nForcing himself to endure the pain in his chest, Zhou Ze stood up and chased them to the balcony. A broke-ass like Old Cui obviously couldn't afford high-end equipment; otherwise, he would have shown up with an RPG, not a crossbow!\n\nBesides,\n\nthis crossbow bolt wasn't the real deal. It was probably something Old Man Cui had actually stolen from an amusement park. Only the arrowhead had pierced Zhou Ze's body; it hadn't caused any major damage.\n\nHowever,\n\nwhen Zhou Ze reached the balcony and was about to jump down to continue the chase,\n\nhis body suddenly staggered,\n\nand he collapsed to his knees.\n\nHis vision started to spin,\n\nand his mind plunged into chaos.\n\nFuck,\n\nthat old man...\n\nhad coated the arrowhead with a drug.\n\nA red glint flashed in Zhou Ze's eyes.\n\nHe subconsciously wanted to enter *that* state to chase after them.\n\nIn fact,\n\nZhou Ze knew,\n\nonce he entered that state, there was no way Old Man Cui and the old woman could escape. But Zhou Ze didn't dare, and wasn't willing.\n\nBefore, when he didn't know the side effects, he'd recklessly unleash his ultimate powers just because it felt damn good.\n\nNow, Zhou Ze didn't dare to keep stimulating that *thing* to awaken.\n\nEven though several people had already died in this house,\n\nZhou Ze had no intention of sacrificing himself to avenge them.\n\nPerhaps,\n\nit was just selfishness?\n\nZhou Ze leaned against the balcony railing and sat down, his consciousness beginning to fade into chaos.\n\n...\n\n\"She... how could she... how could she...\"\n\nWhile Boss Zhou was leaning against the balcony, fading in and out of consciousness,\n\nthe homeowner finally staggered to his feet.\n\nHe first went instinctively to the bedroom. He had to tell his wife and son to run. There was a monster in the house,\n\nhis mother had come back to life!\n\nBut when he pushed open the bedroom door,\n\nand saw the tragic scene on the bed,\n\nhe clutched his head in horror, his mouth agape. He couldn't believe what was happening before his eyes.\n\nHis wife,\n\nhis son...\n\nBoth...\n\nBoth...\n\nIn a daze, the homeowner stumbled back into the living room.\n\nHe felt like this was a nightmare,\n\na nightmare that terrified him and from which he longed to wake up immediately.\n\nSilently,\n\nhe glanced at Zhou Ze, who was sitting on the balcony.\n\nThen,\n\nhe picked up the axe that Old Man Cui had dropped on the floor earlier,\n\nand staggered toward the balcony, one step at a time.\n\n\"You... you're all demons... all executioners... all... demons...\"\n\nThe homeowner brandished the axe,\n\nas he walked toward Zhou Ze.\n\nAnd Zhou Ze's eyes were half-closed the whole time. His head hurt badly. Logically, he should have been anesthetized and asleep, but he couldn't sleep. Anesthetics and sleeping pills were useless on him. However, this feeling of being unable to fall asleep no matter what was the most agonizing.\n\nZhou Ze wasn't even aware of his surroundings, just constantly fighting against the effects of the drug in his system.\n\n*Thud!*\n\nA dull sound echoed out.\n\nZhou Ze forced his eyes open.\n\nHe saw the homeowner collapsed in front of him. An axe lay beside him. Behind the homeowner, he saw a blurry, familiar figure.\n\n...\n\nOh,\n\nOld Xu, you're here...\n\nOld Xu,\n\nmy head is spinning.\n\nThat Old Man Cui...\n\nhe really was in league with that jiangshi.\n\n...\n\n*Sh... sh...*\n\nFootsteps approached.\n\n...\n\nOld Xu,\n\nhelp me up.\n\nLet's get out of here first, before there's trouble at daybreak. I still have some spirit money in my pocket, we can burn some.\n\n...\n\nZhou Ze felt the person's breath on his face,\n\na bit warm and moist.\n\nHe knew Xu Qinglang was squatting in front of him.\n\nImmediately after,\n\nZhou Ze felt a wet, sticky sensation on his face.\n\n...\n\nOld Xu,\n\nhurry and help me up...\n\nUh,\n\nwhat the fuck,\n\nare you sick?\n\nWhat are you licking my face for...\n\n***\n**Footnotes:**\n¹ *Lightness skill* (輕功, qīnggōng) is a common trope in Chinese martial arts fiction, referring to the ability to move swiftly and lightly, as if weightless, allowing for feats like scaling walls and gliding through the air.",

    "content": "Dazed and groggy, he was aware of the outside world, but his mind was in a heavy fog. He felt he should be fast asleep, yet he couldn't manage it. This half-awake, half-asleep state was the most agonizing feeling of all.\n\nZhou Ze remembered Tang Shi once telling him that she had tried every method imaginable just to get some sleep. Sleeping pills and anesthetics were child's play, but aside from leaving her muddled and her body on the verge of collapse, they had no effect on her sleep whatsoever.\n\nPeople who had crawled out of Hell were like fish out of water; deprived of Hell's environment, they were ill at ease in every way.\n\nHis head felt like it was about to explode, like a person trapped in a looping nightmare, cycling endlessly from one dream to the next. What he had dreamed of, he couldn't say. He'd forgotten it all, without even the slightest impression remaining. The only thing he remembered was how awful, how painful he felt.\n\nIt seemed the effects of the drug were slowly wearing off.\n\nZhou Ze gradually opened his eyes.\n\nExhaustion.\n\nA deep exhaustion.\n\nAnd along with it came the soreness of his body.\n\n\"You're awake.\"\n\nXu Qinglang's voice came from the side.\n\nZhou Ze turned his head and saw Xu Qinglang approaching with a damp towel he had just wrung out, using it to wipe his face.\n\nThe wound on his chest had been bandaged. It probably wasn't a major issue. The most important thing was that, who knew Old Man Cui would actually coat the weapon with poison.\n\nXu Qinglang also had several bandaged wounds, especially around his neck, which was wrapped in a thick layer.\n\nZhou Ze was a little puzzled and asked, \"What happened to you?\"\n\n\"That reanimated corpse you killed last night suddenly jumped back up after you left. Luckily, I still managed to take care of it.\"\n\n\"Are you okay?\"\n\n\"I'm fine.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded and sat up in bed, only then realizing the two of them were still in Old Man Cui's mud house.\n\n\"Old Man Cui and that murderous jiangshi are in it together,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Mm,\" Xu Qinglang didn't seem too surprised. In fact, after Old Man Cui had used the appearance of the reanimated corpse to slip away¹, this line of thinking was already quite clear.\n\n\"How are you?\"\n\n\"A bit of a headache.\"\n\nWith that, Zhou Ze got out of bed, gently patting his forehead. His head still felt a little uncomfortable.\n\n\"Mmph... mmph...\"\n\nA muffled whimpering came from the side. It was the male homeowner.\n\n\"Him...\" Zhou Ze pointed at the man and asked.\n\n\"Oh, while you were sitting on the balcony, this guy tried to chop you with an axe. I knocked him out, then conveniently tied him up and brought him over. I burned some hell money, so we shouldn't have any trouble for the time being. After all, we're not the ones who killed those people.\n\n\"I didn't dispose of the bodies in that house either. No point in overdoing it. Besides, it wouldn't be that easy to handle.\"\n\nHearing this, Zhou Ze got up and walked over to the homeowner.\n\nTo be honest, this man was very deserving of sympathy. He possessed all the elements that warranted pity.\n\nFirst,\nHe had a mother who would love him even after death,\nwho came back as a jiangshi just to talk to him.\nHis wife and son had also just died.\nHis two friends were dead too.\nThe \"San'er\" he mentioned was likely last night's reanimated corpse.\nAnd also,\nHe lost a huge sum of money last night.\n\nBut for some reason, Zhou Ze just couldn't bring himself to sympathize with him.\n\nHe reached out and pulled the dirty strip of cloth from the man's mouth.\n\nThe moment his mouth was free, the man tried to shout, \"Help!\"\n\nBut Zhou Ze slapped him.\n\n*Slap!*\n\n\"Hel—\"\n\n*Slap!*\n\n\"Hel—\"\n\n*Slap!*\n\n\"...\"\n\n*Slap!*\n\nBy the last slap, the man had clearly learned his lesson and didn't dare to shout, but Zhou Ze's hand still found its mark.\n\nThe man suddenly felt incredibly wronged.\n\n*I shout, you hit me, that's fair.*\n\n*I stop shouting and admit defeat, so why are you still hitting me?*\n\nZhou Ze paused for a moment, then said apologetically, \"Sorry, I just woke up. A bit of morning grumpiness. Felt like slapping someone to vent.\"\n\n\"...\" the homeowner said nothing.\n\nFinding a small stool, Zhou Ze sat down.\n\nXu Qinglang came in from outside with a plate of vegetable fried rice.\n\n\"Old Man Cui is so lazy he doesn't even keep chickens or ducks. This is the best I could do. Make do with it.\"\n\nZhou Ze took the bowl and chopsticks, saying with some embarrassment, \"I didn't bring my Red Spider Lily Oral Solution.\"\n\nBecause Boss Zhou hadn't expected things here to get so serious, nor had he thought they would be delayed for so long, he hadn't brought his \"utensils\" for eating.\n\nXu Qinglang sighed, as if he had anticipated this. He reached into his pocket,\ntook out a bottle of sour plum juice,\nand placed it on the table.\n\nZhou Ze blinked, then smiled.\n\"Haven't had this stuff in a few days. I kind of miss it.\"\n\nWith a gulp of sour plum juice, Zhou Ze used the tartness to start shoveling down the rice like a prisoner just released from jail.\n\nFor some strange reason,\nZhou Ze felt that eating like this, wolfing down his food, was more satisfying. Indeed, once some habits are formed, they are very difficult to change, regardless of whether others see them as good or bad.\n\nAfter eating,\nZhou Ze tapped the homeowner's head with his chopsticks. Old Xu had neither fed nor given this guy anything to drink while he was tied up here, but his willpower was strong. To still be in such a tenacious state after everything that had happened was truly admirable.\n\n\"What's your name?\"\n\n\"Sun Kewang.\"\n\n\"When did your mother die?\"\n\n\"Four years ago.\"\n\nThis man named Sun Kewang was now being unusually cooperative. The events of last night might have smoothed out all his prickly edges. His attempt to chop Zhou Ze with an axe was perhaps his final display of courage, but it was thwarted by Xu Qinglang's timely arrival.\n\nSome things you only get one shot at.\n\n\"Four years ago.\"\n\nZhou Ze mulled over this answer.\n\nHe believed this was a case of blood-kin revenge. When an ancestor rises from the grave as a jiangshi, their first instinct is to kill their direct descendants. That old woman was no exception.\n\n\"Where was your mother buried?\"\n\n\"In the ancestral graveyard at the village entrance.\"\n\n\"Buried?\"\n\n\"Yes, buried.\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. If she had been cremated, none of this crap would have happened.\n\n\"Feeling envious?\" Xu Qinglang, sipping water on the side, couldn't resist a jab.\n\n\"What do I have to be envious of?\"\n\n\"Envious that they get to be buried. When you come back, you'll only be able to hold your own ashes, with no way to admire your own magnificent beauty from your past life.\"\n\n\"Heh.\"\n\n\"Oh, I forgot. You don't even have ashes.\"\n\n\"...\" said Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Alright, you continue the questioning. I won't interrupt anymore.\"\n\n\"It's fine, let's chat some more. Old Xu, who do you think will die first, you or me?\"\n\n\"You're an underworld emissary. Of course I'll die first,\" Xu Qinglang replied.\n\n\"Then who's going to handle your funeral?\"\n\n\"...\" said Old Xu.\n\n\"Do you prefer your ashes in soup with rice, or in a curry chicken leg rice?\"\n\n\"...\" said Old Xu.\n\nIn the past, Zhou Ze had indeed read in pulp literature that the state promoted cremation to prevent the appearance of jiangshi. This was basically nonsense, but the reverse was quite logical: the implementation of cremation did indeed lower the probability of jiangshi appearing.\n\nIf a body is turned to ash, even if you have some major unresolved issues, you can't just add some water and cement to remold yourself a new body, can you?\n\n\"Your mother was buried four years ago, which isn't that long. When the village was moving the graves, you didn't see your mother's remains?\" Xu Qinglang asked.\n\n\"I didn't.\"\n\n\"How could you not? It's one thing if it's an old grave that can't be found, but yours is...\" Xu Qinglang suddenly thought of something. \"You didn't use a coffin for the burial?\"\n\nSun Kewang shook his head.\n\n\"You're a real filial son,\" Xu Qinglang said sarcastically.\n\nIn this day and age, burial was illegal in most areas. The hard-headed few who insisted on it were usually seeking a semblance of dignity. But for someone like Sun Kewang to bury his own mother without even preparing a coffin was truly baffling.\n\n\"Right, I forgot to ask the most important question. How did your mother die?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nThis was the key to the problem.\n\nHis mother and Old Man Cui were definitely having an affair; this tunnel was the best proof.\n\nIf Old Man Cui hadn't shown up earlier, Zhou Ze would have solved the case already.\n\nSun Kewang hesitated for a moment, then answered with difficulty, \"She died of illness.\"\n\n*Slap!*\n\nZhou Ze swung his hand.\n\nIt was a crisp slap.\nAn eager slap.\nIt was enough to show that Boss Zhou's morning grumpiness hadn't been fully vented.\n\n\"The feeling of slapping you just now was too good. I wasn't finished. Thank you for giving me another chance.\"\n\nWith that, Zhou Ze brought his face close to Sun Kewang's and pointed at Xu Qinglang beside them.\n\n\"Do you think that just because he's so pretty, he's easy to fool?\"\n\n\"...\" said Xu Qinglang.\n\nSun Kewang shook his head.\n\n*Slap!*\n\nAnother slap.\n\n\"Cat got your tongue?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nSun Kewang's face was nearly swollen from Zhou Ze's slaps.\n\nIn the span of 24 hours, he had suffered the most tragic blows imaginable, but at this moment, he still had to endure Zhou Ze's almost playful torture. In truth, he had broken down long ago.\n\n\"I can speak.\"\n\n\"Good. Tell me again, how did your mother die?\"\n\n\"Illne—\"\n\n*Slap!*\n\nA slap.\n\n\"Continue answering.\"\n\n\"She... She... It was my fault... It was all my doing...\"\n\n*Slap!*\n\n\"Please, no emotional buildup or backstory. Get straight to the point.\"\n\n\"I killed her.\"\n\nZhou Ze straightened up and stretched.\n\nIt wasn't that Zhou Ze was some brilliant detective who had seen through everything from the start. It was just that this guy's acting sucked. The first time he answered about his mother's cause of death, he had mumbled and hesitated. Even those pop idols who get slammed online for their acting were better than him.\n\n\"Why did you kill your mother?\"\n\n\"She was pregnant.\"\n\nZhou Ze and Xu Qinglang exchanged a glance.\n\nThat old woman must have been in her sixties or seventies, right?\n\n\"She could still get pregnant at that age?\"\n\nXu Qinglang asked Zhou Ze. After all, Zhou Ze had been a doctor in his past life and knew more about these things.\n\n\"There have been cases of women in their sixties giving birth in this country, and in their seventies abroad,\" Zhou Ze answered. \"But it's very dangerous.\"\n\nSun Kewang seemed to have entered a certain state. His emotions were now a bit manic. Without waiting for Zhou Ze's next question, he gritted his teeth and continued, \"At her age, she was still messing around with a man, and even got herself knocked up. Then she told me she wanted to live with that lover of hers, begging me that even if they didn't get a certificate or have a ceremony, just living together would be enough!\n\n\"Her belly was already showing.\nWhere was I supposed to put my face as her son?\nI told her to get rid of the baby.\nBut she refused.\nHahahaha,\nSo me and a few of my friends,\nWe took her...\nWe took her...\nWe took her... and with a quilt,\nsmothered her!\"\n\n***\n**Footnotes:**\n1.  **Slip away (金蟬脫殼, jīn chán tuō qiào):** An idiom meaning \"the golden cicada sheds its shell,\" used to describe escaping a situation by leaving behind a decoy.",

    "content": "The nearly hysterical Sun Kewang was gagged again with a rag by Xu Qinglang. Afterwards, Xu Qinglang lit a cigarette and walked to the doorway, where Zhou Ze was already standing, puffing out clouds of smoke.\n\n\"It's hard to imagine. He actually killed his own mother over something like this.\"\n\n\"The walking corpse that appeared first, his nickname in the village was San'er. He was always happy to help people. And yet, he helped with that too. He helped this man, Sun, kill his own mother. Some 'great guy of the village' he turned out to be.\"\n\n\"What's so hard to imagine about it?\" Zhou Ze flicked his ash. \"Isn't this perfectly normal? You think only the rich and powerful care about their reputation?\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"In ancient times, the imperial family would do anything to cover up their scandals. Killing people to silence them was just child's play. But while we might not condone it, we can at least understand it.\"\n\n\"But in reality, the more humble a family is, the more they care about their public image,¹ even if, to outsiders, they don't seem to have much of an image to speak of. The more backward a place is, the more it cares about these kinds of rules.\"\n\n\"In this country, to this day, there are still many places where women aren't allowed to eat at the main table, especially when guests are over. A family whose women are submissive and know their place is actually considered to have a lot of face.\"\n\n\"His mother getting pregnant, to Sun Kewang, was no less than his 'royal bloodline' being sullied. To you, an outsider, it might not seem like a big deal, but from his perspective, it could make him the laughingstock of the village, affecting his authority and dignity here.\"\n\n\"Because for his entire life, his world has only been the size of this village. His sky is only as big as the one above this village.\"\n\n\"You can understand it?\"\n\n\"I can't understand it, but I can get used to it. Don't forget how Yingying died. Wasn't it just because she went on a date with some poor scholar? When her family found out, she was drowned in a pig cage.\"\n\n\"Wasn't that also for the sake of the family's reputation, for the sake of face? Tell me, is there any fundamental difference between these two incidents?\"\n\n\"Let's put that aside for a moment. There's something that's been bothering me.\"\n\n\"Go on.\"\n\n\"Last night, how did that old man Cui manage to hit you with a crossbow bolt? I remember you have a suit of armor, don't you?\"\n\nHearing this, Zhou Ze paused, a strange look on his face.\n\n\"What's wrong?\" Xu Qinglang pressed.\n\n\"I need to think about how to catch that zombie tonight. And that corpse fetus. If that old woman eats it, things will get even trickier than before.\"\n\n\"Hey, don't change the subject,\" Xu Qinglang persisted.\n\n\"You're so annoying.\"\n\n\"Answer my question. A dignified Underworld Emissary, taken down by an ordinary person with a crossbow from an amusement park. Aren't you ashamed?\"\n\n\"How was I supposed to know that after throwing an axe at me, he could pull out a crossbow?\"\n\n\"And then?\"\n\n\"And then...\"\n\nZhou Ze reached up and touched his forehead.\n\n\"I think maybe I've been getting too much sun lately, and I've been lazing around like a salted fish for long enough... I actually forgot I had armor on.\"\n\n\"...\" said Xu Qinglang.\n\n\"Alright, let's not dwell on this anymore. If you keep harping on it, I'll feel more and more foolish about how I acted last night.\"\n\nXu Qinglang walked up to Zhou Ze, suddenly clamped his hands around Zhou Ze's neck, and said viciously:\n\n\"So you're saying, if you hadn't been hit by that crossbow bolt yesterday, they wouldn't have escaped, and we could have been done with this whole thing today!\"\n\n\"The only reason we're still stuck here, with the zombie and old man Cui still on the loose, still having to waste our time here scratching our heads in frustration... the root cause...\"\n\n\"Is that you forgot about your own abilities?\"\n\n\"Let go, Old Xu, let go.\"\n\nAt first, Zhou Ze thought Xu Qinglang was just joking, but he didn't expect the grip to get tighter and tighter, choking him to the point where he could barely breathe.\n\nIn an instant,\n\na black ripple emanated from Zhou Ze's body. A suit of mysterious and majestic black warrior armor materialized, protecting his neck.\n\nZhou Ze felt the pressure on his neck ease as the armor absorbed much of Xu Qinglang's force.\n\nOnly then did Xu Qinglang retract his hands. He found a stool and sat down, burying his face in his hands, and said apologetically:\n\n\"I'm sorry, I got emotional. When I think about that family that died last night, my heart aches.\"\n\n\"Sun Kewang deserves to die, but he's still alive. Yet, the ones who least deserved to die were his wife and son.\"\n\n\"If we don't deal with that zombie tonight, more people in the village might die. I don't think old man Cui can control that zombie, even if she was his lover in her past life.\"\n\nZhou Ze let out a long breath, and the armor on his body slowly faded away.\n\n\"Don't worry, there won't be any more problems tonight. I'm going to lie down for a bit. Wake me up when it gets dark. Also, Old Xu, have you been secretly going to the gym lately? Your grip's gotten a lot stronger.\"\n\nWith that,\n\nZhou Ze turned and walked toward the bedroom.\n\nXu Qinglang sat alone on the stool.\n\nHe lowered the hands covering his face,\n\nand stared at his palm in a sort of horror.\n\nJust now,\n\nthat violent, murderous intent had felt impossible to restrain. It was an instinctual impulse rising from within him, a desire to utterly ravage any life he could kill before him.\n\nAnd then,\n\nXu Qinglang extended his tongue,\n\nand licked his palm.\n\nHis scent still lingered on it.\n\n*So delicious.*\n\n***\n\nNight fell.\n\nPerhaps because they had burned spirit money, the news of the deaths at Sun Kewang's house hadn't gotten out. Added to that, the villagers lived far apart, and Sun Kewang usually hung out with a bad crowd, so no one thought to check on him when he didn't appear in the village for a day.\n\nBecause of this, the theme in the village that night remained one of peace.\n\nSun Kewang had been tied to the locust tree by Zhou Ze, his mouth still stuffed with something.\n\nZhou Ze himself was standing below, leaning against the tree. He was waiting. Waiting for last night's old woman to reappear.\n\nHaving turned into a zombie, driven by the grudges of her past life and the impulse for blood-kin revenge, the old woman had an irrepressible obsession with killing her son.\n\nShe would come.\n\nShe would definitely come.\n\nZhou Ze had used his fingernails to make several cuts on Sun Kewang's body. Blood dripped continuously—not enough to be fatal, but it was like chumming the water to attract a shark.\n\nXu Qinglang stood to the side, his face looking somewhat grim under the night sky.\n\nIn the second half of the night,\n\nthe wind slowly picked up.\n\nFrom the distant vegetable fields, a stooped figure approached. Old man Cui walked over alone, stopping less than ten meters from Zhou Ze.\n\nThis time, he carried no axe, nor was there a crossbow on his back.\n\nThis brought a sliver of disappointment to Boss Zhou. He had been hoping old man Cui would shoot a few more bolts at him so his armor could materialize and perfectly block the attack, allowing him to redeem himself for yesterday.\n\nBut old man Cui's posture today was just short of waving a white flag.\n\n\"Let's talk,\"\n\nCui Laotou said calmly, looking at Zhou Ze.\n\n\"There doesn't seem to be much to talk about.\" Zhou Ze shook his head. \"Have you trapped that old woman? But how long can you hold her? She won't be able to resist. Believe me, there really aren't many people in this world who know zombies better than I do.\"\n\n\"Let her kill him.\"\n\nOld man Cui pointed at Sun Kewang, who was hanging from the tree, and continued:\n\n\"He deserves to die.\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't speak, waiting for Cui Laotou to continue.\n\n\"Let her fulfill her wish. Then, our family will take care of things ourselves. I've already prepared the firewood pyre, and the gasoline is ready. We've just been waiting for this day.\"\n\n\"That corpse fetus... she really is your daughter.\"\n\n\"I hate that I have these Yin-Yang Eyes! I'd rather have been ignorant this whole time!\" Cui Laotou roared, his face contorting. \"But I can see. I saw it. I saw our daughter crying all alone at her grave. I saw her crying down there.\"\n\n\"How I wish she had died of an illness! How I wish she had died of an illness!\"\n\nPeople often say that the human world has a beautiful appearance, but at least it *has* an \"appearance.\" Zhou Ze actually felt that ghosts were simply the most fundamental aspect of human nature, revealed after the hypocritical disguises of society were torn away.\n\nHe could understand Cui Laotou's feelings; you could even say he empathized with him.\n\n\"You could have called the police.\"\n\n\"The police? Tell the police I can see ghosts? Tell the police his dead mother told me he killed her?\"\n\nCui Laotou retorted with a laugh.\n\n\"You should get out of the way,\"\n\nCui Laotou said to Zhou Ze.\n\nAt the same time,\n\na figure appeared behind the old man, crawling on the ground. Next to that figure, a little girl stood dazedly. She was the most confused and ignorant of them all.\n\nThe wound on the old woman's chest was still clearly visible, making her much slower today. But the hatred in her eyes was still just as intense, especially when she saw her son hanging from the tree.\n\nYour enemy was preparing to surrender. They were preparing to end themselves after fulfilling one last wish.\n\nSuddenly,\n\nZhou Ze felt this was all so boring. The punch he had been winding up, the mental preparation to wash away his shame from last night—it had all become useless.\n\n\"I'm sorry. I have a duty to fulfill. I can't just watch you kill someone.\"\n\nZhou Ze took a step forward.\n\n\"Do you have to be so pedantic?\"\n\nCui Laotou ground his teeth as he watched Zhou Ze approach. \"I can still control her for now. If I die first or she escapes, do you have any idea what kind of trouble that would be?\"\n\n\"I also have my duty. Sorry about that.\"\n\nSaying this,\n\nZhou Ze raised his fist and punched Cui Laotou.\n\nCui Laotou took the punch, stumbling back two steps, but he also subconsciously kicked out at Zhou Ze. Zhou Ze didn't dodge, and the kick landed squarely on his shin.\n\n\"Aiyah...\"\n\nZhou Ze fell to the ground with a cry, clutching his chest, looking like he was in terrible pain and had been gravely injured.\n\n\"...\" said Cui Laotou.\n\n\"...\" said Xu Qinglang.\n\nXu Qinglang walked over at that moment, looked at Zhou Ze on the ground, and reminded him in a low voice, \"He kicked your leg. You're clutching your chest.\"\n\nZhou Ze shot Xu Qinglang a look and explained with theatrical flair:\n\n\"This old man... his internal energy is so profound!\"\n\n***\n**Footnotes:**\n1.  **Public image (門面):** Literally \"door-front\" or \"facade.\" It refers to a person's or family's reputation, honor, and social standing, a concept often referred to as \"face.\"",

    "content": "The bonfire,\n\n  was slowly lit.\n\n  It didn't erupt into a towering inferno in an instant like in the movies, but rather, began to burn gradually.\n\n  Old Man Cui lay on the pyre, holding the blood-soaked old woman. She was struggling constantly; she could sense the fear, and she knew the harm fire could do to her. But Old Man Cui, like a boyfriend comforting his young girlfriend, kept patting her shoulder, humming a song to her, and murmuring words of solace and affection.\n\n  The little girl lay beside them. But she was a ghost; she wasn't afraid of fire. She didn't know why she had to lie here, nor did she know why her grandpa and her mother were lying here.\n\n  Grandpa told her to lie here,\n\n  so she lay here.\n\n  It was Zhou Ze who lit the fire. Old Man Cui had honored their agreement. After the deed was done, he soothed the old woman and ascended the \"pyre\" with her.\n\n  All heterosexuals deserve to be burned at the stake,\n\n  but this heterosexual couple, even while lying on a burning pile of firewood, wouldn't stop showering everyone with their PDA.¹\n\n  It transcended age,\n\n  one could even say it had transcended the boundaries between species.\n\n  An Eastern version of *Ghost*.\n\n  \"Is this what love is?\"\n\n  Xu Qinglang remarked with a sigh.\n\n  People always sigh over things that exceed their expectations,\n\n  like a moving love story.\n\n  Because for most people, a husband and wife are merely birds of the same forest; those who can stay together until death do them part are, after all, a minority of minorities.\n\n  Most vows of eternal love,\n\n  can only guarantee that when the man and woman were under the moon and among the flowers, they were speaking from the heart at that moment.\n\n  Whether they can truly honor such promises and grand wishes as time goes on is not something one should take too seriously, nor can one really.\n\n  \"Before they start screaming from the flames, you can still get up there, take a selfie with the bonfire, and post it on Weibo or Moments. The caption could be:\n\n  *So happy, I witnessed true love tonight.*\n\n  Or,\n\n  *When will I find a man who treats me like this?*\"\n\n  Xu Qinglang ignored Zhou Ze's sarcasm, but still replied:\n\n  \"I'm surprised you actually compromised.\"\n\n  \"If I didn't compromise, what else could I do?\" Zhou Ze shook his head and continued, \"If compromising can lead to the best outcome, I'm willing to compromise.\"\n\n  \"The best outcome?\"\n\n  \"This is the best outcome. It gives everyone a sense of closure,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\n  \"Closure?\"\n\n  \"Sun Kewang killed his own mother, an unforgivable sin. But the old woman also killed many people whose crimes didn't warrant death. If the final outcome is that they all die, at least no one can complain about it being unfair, right?\"\n\n  \"That logic of yours...\"\n\n  \"I'm not a judge, nor am I a cop. My only duty is to make sure this old woman who's turned into a jiangshi² gets burned and dealt with, saving me the trouble of her running around causing problems for me later. This ending is already the most perfect one possible.\"\n\n  The fire began to grow larger,\n\n  gradually engulfing Old Man Cui and the old woman together.\n\n  Blood-curdling screams and the silhouettes of struggling figures came from within. It was hard to tell if it was Old Man Cui screaming or the old woman.\n\n  \"That wife, and that son, they really didn't deserve to die,\" Xu Qinglang lamented. \"That might be the biggest regret.\"\n\n  A revenge,\n\n  a cycle of karma,\n\n  because it involved strangers,\n\n  it never felt quite as satisfying.\n\n  It was like a stain on a piece of art; much like how many famous paintings passed down through the ages are marred by Emperor Qianlong's self-satisfied commentaries, it spoiled the mood.\n\n  People always expect their heroes to be absolutely pure and flawless, from their personal character to their private lives, but reality is often not so;\n\n  Martin Luther King Jr. hired prostitutes and even had threesomes all along his campaign trail,\n\n  and it didn't stop his speeches from getting into textbooks.\n\n  Zhou Ze knew that Xu Qinglang's attitude was that of a pure spectator, always hoping the show on stage could be performed to absolute perfection.\n\n  \"Should I perform a ritual for that mother and son?\" Xu Qinglang asked.\n\n  \"There's no need.\"\n\n  \"But they died so pitifully.\"\n\n  \"Maybe when the old woman was alive, she found out she was pregnant. She didn't dare tell her son, so she told her grandson or her daughter-in-law, and they were the ones who reported her.\"\n\n  \"You asked?\"\n\n  \"I didn't.\"\n\n  \"Then what makes you say that?\"\n\n  \"I'm just trying to make you feel better.\"\n\n  The fire began to die down. Zhou Ze stopped wasting his breath on Xu Qinglang, walked forward to check. Ashes to ashes, dust to dust. Old Man Cui, a man with Yin-Yang Eyes his whole life, had come to such an end. It was hard not to feel a bit wistful.\n\n  The little girl stood on the ashes, still looking at Zhou Ze with a blank expression.\n\n  \"Come, I'll send you to the place you're supposed to be, to find your da... your grandpa and your mom.\"\n\n  With that,\n\n  Zhou Ze opened the Gates of Hell.\n\n  Regardless of right or wrong,\n\n  it was time for all of this to come to an end.\n\n  The little girl walked dazedly towards the Gates of Hell. A new beginning awaited her.\n\n  People often think of reapers as the end of everything, yet they can also be seen as the prelude to a new symphony.\n\n  \"Mister, Grandpa said his diary is under the wooden block beneath the stove. If you want it, you can go get it.\"\n\n  \"Okay.\" Zhou Ze smiled, gesturing for her to go in.\n\n  \"Mister, Grandpa also said, Mom wasn't supposed to be like this. He said, it was because of the sound of the flute.\"\n\n  After saying this, the little girl walked through the Gates of Hell.\n\n  Zhou Ze clapped his hands together. The Gates of Hell vanished. He turned to look at Xu Qinglang.\n\n  \"What did she just say, the sound of a flute?\"\n\n  \"*Thump...*\"\n\n  Xu Qinglang didn't answer.\n\n  Instead, he collapsed straight onto the ground.\n\n  \"Hey, Old Xu?\"\n\n  Zhou Ze immediately rushed over and saw that Xu Qinglang, lying on the ground, had a bluish complexion, his lips slowly beginning to protrude.\n\n  Prying open Xu Qinglang's lips,\n\n  Zhou Ze saw two small fangs, just beginning to show their menace!\n\n  \"Fuck.\"\n\n  Boss Zhou started to panic.\n\n  He immediately tore off the bandages that were wrapped tightly around Xu Qinglang's neck.\n\n  The flesh on his neck had practically rotted into a pulp.\n\n  ...............\n\n  Xu Qinglang didn't know how long he'd been unconscious. He only knew that in his dream, he could faintly hear the sound of the flute from that night, seeming both near and far, impossible to pinpoint.\n\n  He had once thought that the walking corpse was the old woman's doing, that she was the one who had reawakened him.\n\n  But he later thought of a suspicious point: at that time, the old woman was with Zhou Ze at Sun Kewang's house. It was impossible for her reach to extend so far. Besides, the old woman was just a jiangshi with very low intelligence, only barely controllable by Old Man Cui; she didn't possess that kind of ability.\n\n  He thought for a long time,\n\n  and had many dreams.\n\n  Xu Qinglang dreamed of his childhood,\n\n  dreamed of his days as a street punk,\n\n  dreamed of meeting the old Bureau Chief and being sent to the noodle shop to learn a trade.\n\n  This dream,\n\n  was very, very long.\n\n  It looped endlessly, repeating over and over, tormenting his nerves back and forth.\n\n  Finally,\n\n  he dreamed he was placed in a large wok.\n\n  \"What's this for?\"\n\n  Xu Qinglang asked.\n\n  The wok started getting hotter and hotter,\n\n  the water began to boil.\n\n  Xu Qinglang desperately tried to climb out of the wok, but he could never get out.\n\n  And just then,\n\n  the Old Taoist ran out from a dark corner,\n\n  holding his phone and filming him furiously:\n\n  \"Alright folks,\n\n  tonight we're livestreaming 'Iron Pot Stews Himself'!\"\n\n  \"*Hah... hah...*\"\n\n  Xu Qinglang shot up. He found himself sitting naked in a wooden bathtub. The water was hot, and steam was swirling around him.\n\n  Across from him, Zhou Ze sat there, trimming his nails, with incredible focus.\n\n  \"Boss, need more hot water?\"\n\n  the Old Taoist asked from nearby.\n\n  \"Yes, keep adding it.\"\n\n  \"You got it.\"\n\n  The Old Taoist took the bucket to go boil more water.\n\n  A moment later, Bai Yingying walked over, holding a bag of dark, mushy stuff. Not noticing that Xu Qinglang in the tub was already awake, Bai Yingying untied the bag and poured its contents into the tub.\n\n  \"What is this!\"\n\n  Seeing this thick, black, sludge-like substance being poured in,\n\n  Xu Qinglang, whose fastidiousness was second only to Zhou Ze's, immediately yelled.\n\n  \"Ah!\"\n\n  Bai Yingying's mouth dropped open in pleasant surprise. \"Lady Xu,³ you're awake?\"\n\n  \"What?\" Xu Qinglang was confused. \"How long was I out?\"\n\n  \"Three days and three nights.\"\n\n  Saying this, Bai Yingying covered her mouth and giggled, \"Hehehe.\"\n\n  \"You scared me to death. When the boss brought you back to the bookstore, I thought you were deliberately trying to turn yourself into a jiangshi to vie for his favor with me.\n\n  *Sob sob sob.*\"\n\n  \"...\" said Xu Qinglang.\n\n  If he weren't naked at that moment,\n\n  Xu Qinglang really wanted to grab a hammer and pry open Bai Yingying's head to see what on earth was inside.\n\n  Of course,\n\n  if Yingying really got mad,\n\n  he'd be scared too.\n\n  \"You're awake.\"\n\n  Zhou Ze put down his nail clippers and walked over, then reached out and stroked Xu Qinglang's chin.\n\n  Xu Qinglang immediately recoiled,\n\n  but the tub was only so big.\n\n  Where could he retreat to?\n\n  \"What happened to me?\"\n\n  \"What happened? You were bitten by a jiangshi, why didn't you tell me sooner? You think being a jiangshi is fun? Let me tell you, most jiangshi end up like the one downstairs.\"⁴\n\n  \"You weren't in a good state at the time, I didn't want to add to your...\"\n\n  \"Alright, stop, stop.\"\n\n  Zhou Ze held his forehead.\n\n  \"Old Xu, we have enough jiangshi in this shop. I have no desire to change the bookstore's sign to 'Jiangshi House' in the future.\n\n  With everything so gloomy and cold, we could save a fortune on air conditioning.\"\n\n  \"So what about me now?\" Xu Qinglang gestured to himself.\n\n  \"I don't know, and Yingying doesn't know how to cure corpse poison either. We could only guess blindly. I was originally going to have the Old Taoist suck the poison out for you, but he refused no matter what.\n\n  It's not like you could have me or Yingying suck it out. I'm afraid that would just be adding poison to poison.\n\n  I've been skipping meals and sleep, digging through all sorts of materials,\n\n  and found some folk remedies and methods. We started using them on you first. What was just poured in was mud mixed with monkey pee. We're not sure which one will work, so we're just trying everything.\n\n  This tub also has aged sticky rice, the Old Taoist's paper talismans, toads, and water snakes. Oh right, I was worried the smell would be bad, so I added some sour plum juice for you.\"\n\n  Only then did Xu Qinglang feel something tickling him from below.

    "content": "Early the next morning was the most refreshing time of day for most people with regular schedules. For those without, however, this hour was often the hardest to endure.\n\nQu Zhenzhen emerged from the upper floor of the internet cafe, carrying a clay pot. She was very reluctant, but she had to do as her brother had instructed: deliver medicinal cuisine to the bookstore owner across the street.\n\nIn Qu Zhenzhen's opinion, there was no need for their two families to interact at all. She had been impulsive last time, but her brother had already given the other party an explanation.\n\nWhen it came down to it, the other guy had been a bit of a meddler.\n\nBut her own brother seemed unusually attentive to that shop owner. He was just some ground-burrowing, dirt-digging mouse. Sometimes, Qu Zhenzhen truly didn't understand her brother's way of thinking.\n\nPushing open the bookstore's door, she found business to be very slow, unlike their internet cafe, which had quite a few customers even this early in the morning.\n\nA Daoist priest was sitting behind the counter. Dressed in Daoist robes, he was engrossed in a book with a yellow cover, occasionally dabbing his finger on his lips to wet it before turning a page.\n\nSeeing a customer enter, the old Daoist looked up, somewhat puzzled.\n\n\"Looking for someone?\"\n\nHe had, after all, never seen anyone come to read a book while carrying a large clay pot.\n\n\"Where's your boss?\" Qu Zhenzhen asked, her attitude nonchalant.\n\n\"Just went out. To buy groceries.\"\n\nThe old Daoist wasn't lying. The boss had gone out early with Yingying to buy groceries, planning to scrounge up some more snakes, insects, rats, and ants to add a few more ingredients to Lao Xu's bathtub.\n\nSometimes, the old Daoist felt quite sorry for Lao Xu, having actually been infected with corpse poison. Thinking back on how he himself had once wanted to become a jiangshi¹ to live a long life, the old Daoist now felt a considerable sense of relief. The boss had said that over ninety-nine percent of those who become jiangshi end up with the intelligence of an idiot, even forgetting who they are, left with nothing but instinct.\n\nBai Yingying was special only because of the two centuries of nourishment from Lady Bai.\n\n\"I'll wait for him to come back then.\"\n\nPlacing the clay pot on the counter, Qu Zhenzhen found a place to sit down.\n\nThe initial stewing of the medicinal cuisine was already done, but there were several subsequent herbs that she needed to add personally while controlling the heat. She really couldn't just drop it off and leave. Her brother had spent a long time simmering it; no matter how much she disliked the bookstore owner, she didn't want to see her brother's hard work go to waste.\n\nThe old Daoist said nothing and went back to his book.\n\nAfter sitting down, Qu Zhenzhen began to subconsciously survey the bookstore. The layout was quite nice, and the decor was fresh and refined, showcasing the designer's taste.\n\nIt was just that opening this kind of bookstore on South Street was a surefire way to lose money.\n\nStretching lazily, her peripheral vision caught the Deadpool figure sitting in the corner of the bookstore, and Qu Zhenzhen's expression immediately hardened.\n\nThat guy in the cosplay costume, was he a real person or a mannequin?\n\nQu Zhenzhen's first instinct was that it was a mannequin, because it was completely motionless. But for some reason, the insects inside her body reacted to that thing with a palpitating restlessness.\n\nWith a light flick of her fingertip, a small insect the size of a common ladybug fell from Qu Zhenzhen's body and began to crawl rapidly across the floor, its target aimed straight at Deadpool.\n\nHowever, just as the insect passed the counter, a small, cute, furry paw suddenly shot out, grabbing it with extreme speed.\n\nThen, the sound of \"crunch, crunch\" came from behind the counter.\n\nQu Zhenzhen's brow furrowed slightly as she looked toward the counter.\n\nThe old Daoist had just bent down and, seeing the little monkey peeling an insect to eat, immediately slapped it on the head and pointed a finger at it.\n\nThe gesture meant: *You're eating filthy things like this!*\n\nThe little monkey was aggrieved but could only sit back down next to the old Daoist's leg, leaning against it while playing on its phone.\n\nDuring the day, the monkey knew to be discreet, trying its best not to appear in public.\n\nHaving reprimanded the monkey for eating whatever it pleased, the old Daoist looked up and saw the girl who had brought the clay pot looking at him. In response, he offered a smile.\n\n*Is he... provoking me?*\n\nThe same smile can have different meanings to different people.\n\nIn Qu Zhenzhen's eyes, the old Daoist had discovered her probing attempt. This was a warning!\n\nHer brother had said that most tomb raiders were highly skilled, and they rarely acted alone, with each having their own role in the group. They were truly not to be trifled with.\n\nBefore, Qu Zhenzhen hadn't taken it seriously. This time, she was.\n\nQu Zhenzhen slowly bent over, pretending to be taking a short nap on the table. A small, multicolored snake about the size of an earthworm slithered out from her left ear, which she had deliberately used to block the line of sight.\n\nThe originally vibrant, five-colored snake changed to match the color of the table upon landing on it, and then to the color of the floor after dropping to the ground. Like a chameleon, it could change its color according to its surroundings to achieve the best camouflage.\n\nThis time, the snake did not go past the counter but chose to take a detour.\n\nThe little monkey playing on its phone under the counter suddenly twitched its ears. It immediately stood up, wanting to go supplement its protein intake again.\n\nBut the old Daoist was quick-witted, grabbing the monkey's tail directly.\n\n\"Trying to catch bugs again? Am I not feeding you?\"\n\nAs he spoke, the old Daoist gave the monkey a flick on the head with his finger.\n\nThe monkey was very aggrieved. It covered its head with its paws. Although its eyes were still scanning in that direction, it didn't defy the old Daoist's will and run out.\n\nThe snake continued to crawl. It was fast, and its color changed quickly to match its environment. The monkey had heard the sound, but that idiot Daoist had absolutely no reaction.\n\nCloser.\n\nCloser.\n\nQu Zhenzhen lay on the table, her eyes closed, but she could vaguely perceive the snake's senses in her mind. It wasn't a clear picture, but she could feel things through other means.\n\nThis was a connection between a host and a Gu-insect, a profound and mysterious link.\n\nHowever, just as the little snake slithered in front of Deadpool, the previously motionless figure suddenly lowered its head.\n\n*This is a...*\n\nHe was thinking.\n\nHe was discerning.\n\nIt took him several seconds.\n\nDeadpool concluded that this was trash.\n\nTrash was not allowed in the bookstore!\n\nThen, Deadpool opened his mouth.\n\nHis whole body bent over as quickly as a toad. While still sitting in the chair, his hands rapidly braced against the floor, his mouth opened, and his tongue shot out, directly swallowing the snake on the ground, which had thought its stealth skill was maxed out and was about to get cocky.\n\nThen, in the next instant, Deadpool sat back in his original position, bolt upright, as if he hadn't moved at all.\n\n\"Ssssssssssssssssssssssssss...\"\n\nQu Zhenzhen felt only an intense, acidic pain, as if she were rolling around in a pool of sulfuric acid. She immediately opened her eyes and severed the last shred of connection with the snake.\n\nLifting her head, her forehead already beaded with sweat, Qu Zhenzhen looked again towards the counter in disbelief.\n\nThe old Daoist was holding a copy of *A Golden Scaled Dragon is No Creature of the Pond*², reading it with great relish.\n\nHaving just finished a long section, the old Daoist subconsciously lit a cigarette, closed his eyes, and tapped his fingers lightly on the tabletop.\n\nScenes from the book surfaced in his mind as he savored them in detail.\n\nReading required digestion. The old Daoist called this process \"rumination.\"\n\nBut in Qu Zhenzhen's eyes, the old Daoist's posture was one of mockery and disdain.\n\nHe had completely seen through her tricks, seen through her probes, and had managed to neutralize them each time with a speed she could hardly imagine. And with his ethereal, master-like aura, it was as if everything was under his control.\n\nEach tap of his fingers on the tabletop, especially, felt like a blow against her chest, making it so oppressive she could hardly breathe.\n\nThe old Daoist had no idea the girl had built him up into something so formidable in her mind.\n\nHe was just thinking that when the boss and Yingying got back, he would have to ask for the afternoon off to go comfort some people. It was tough for those young ladies, earning a living all alone out here.\n\nFor a moment, a look of pity and concern actually appeared on the old Daoist's face.\n\nQu Zhenzhen couldn't sit still any longer. She stood up. In this place, she felt the humiliation of a mouse being toyed with by a cat, and she refused to endure it.\n\n\"Excuse me, when will your boss be back?\"\n\nInitially, Qu Zhenzhen hadn't been nearly so polite. Now, with one of her insects and one of her snakes dead under mysterious circumstances, her attitude had transformed.\n\n\"Oh, probably soon,\" the old Daoist replied.\n\n\"Then where is your kitchen? I'd like to go ahead and cook the remaining herbs.\"\n\n\"Herbs? Is this a medicinal brew?\" the old Daoist immediately asked, intrigued.\n\n\"It's a medicinal cuisine.\"\n\n\"Medicinal cuisine? What's it for?\"\n\n\"To tonify the kidneys and strengthen yang.\"³\n\n\"Ooh...\" The old Daoist instantly lit up.\n\nWhen a man gets old, he inevitably finds himself somewhat lacking in strength when helping others. The old Daoist often felt guilty that his limited abilities prevented him from helping more people; he had always possessed a heart that wished to deliver all living beings from suffering.\n\nHe immediately said, \"The kitchen's upstairs. Come on, I'll take you.\"\n\n\"Alright.\"\n\nThe old Daoist led Qu Zhenzhen to the second floor. On her way up, Qu Zhenzhen made a point to cast another glance at the Deadpool figure sitting in the corner.\n\n\"Here you go, miss. This is the kitchen. You can use it.\"\n\nThe old Daoist opened the kitchen door.\n\nAfter Qu Zhenzhen went inside, she found that it was very well furnished, with all kinds of utensils and equipment.\n\n\"Say, miss, is this medicinal cuisine our boss ordered?\" the old Daoist asked.\n\n\"That's right.\"\n\n\"Can someone my age drink it?\"\n\n\"Yes, you can. This medicinal cuisine is very gentle and nourishing.\"\n\n\"That's great, that's great.\"\n\nThe old Daoist beamed.\n\n\"Um...\"\n\nWhen Qu Zhenzhen tried to open the cabinet under the stove, she found it was locked.\n\n\"Hah, this is the kitchen our shop's cook uses. We don't usually go in. If he's not here, we just get takeout since no one else cooks. You wait here, I'll go get the key from him. That's just how he is, thinks the kitchen is his territory, hardly lets us touch anything.\"\n\nThe old Daoist said this as he walked out of the kitchen and knocked on the door to Xu Qinglang's bedroom.\n\n\"Lao Xu, I'm coming in! Need to grab the key to the kitchen cabinet.\"\n\nQu Zhenzhen subconsciously followed behind the old Daoist. When he went inside to get the key, she turned sideways and glanced inside the room.\n\nThere was a bathtub inside.\n\nAnd in the bathtub, it looked like a man was sitting.\n\nThrough the white steam rising from the tub, Qu Zhenzhen saw something with a greenish face and fangs on either side of its mouth slowly raise its head.\n\nQu Zhenzhen was instantly so frightened her face turned deathly pale.\n\n*Holy mother of god!*\n\n*They...*\n\n*This group of tomb raiders...*\n\n*In this bustling city...*\n\n*In this bookstore...*\n\n*Are raising a jiangshi!*\n\nAt that moment, Qu Zhenzhen finally understood why her brother had been so intent on currying favor with them.\n\nThis was truly a group of terrifying, deeply hidden madmen!\n\n---\n¹ **Jiangshi:** Often translated as \"hopping vampire\" or \"Chinese zombie,\" a type of reanimated corpse from Chinese folklore.\n² ***A Golden Scaled Dragon is No Creature of the Pond***: The first half of a famous Chinese proverb meaning a great person will not be confined to a humble place forever.

    "content": "Chapter 2\n\n---\n\nWhile brewing the medicinal soup, Qu Zhenzhen was on pins and needles. She suddenly felt as if she had willingly walked into a den of wolves.\n\nHere,\n\nthere was an unfathomable Taoist priest,\n\nand in a room diagonally across from her on the second floor,\n\nthere was a zombie taking a bath!\n\nNo matter how hard she forced herself to calm down, Qu Zhenzhen found it impossible to remain composed. She nearly messed up the timing for adding the herbs.\n\nFinally, the last step of the medicinal soup was complete. It was done.\n\nShe let out a long sigh of relief, turned off the stove, and then fled downstairs as if escaping.\n\nThe old Taoist was still downstairs mixing cocktails. Seeing the girl run down, he immediately called out:\n\n\"Is it ready?\"\n\n\"It's ready.\"\n\nQu Zhenzhen replied as she walked quickly toward the bookstore entrance.\n\nThe bookstore was as deep as the sea;\n\nshe had to get home,\n\nto her brother!\n\n\"Hey!\"\n\nThe old Taoist called after her.\n\nBut the girl was dead set on leaving; no amount of shouting could stop her.\n\nThe old Taoist shook his head and sighed. He took a sip of the cocktail he had originally prepared for the girl, then chuckled to himself, \"Heh heh,\" and immediately ran upstairs to the kitchen, planning to sneak a drink.\n\n---\n\nAt the internet cafe's counter,\n\nQu Mingming was sitting and sipping tea. His family had just called again, telling him to come home. He'd brushed them off. He was truly fed up with his family.\n\nHe had a whole bunch of relatives, but in this generation, very few had truly mastered the Qu family's artistic legacy.\n\nAfter all, times were changing. The market share and demand for traditional Chinese medicine were constantly shrinking; people were more accustomed to going to the hospital for shots and pills when they got sick.\n\nHowever, in the area of wellness and health maintenance, the market for TCM had been booming for several years.\n\nSo, that bunch from his family, both his peers and many from the older generation, had basically all started using the Qu family's TCM reputation to get into the wellness product industry.\n\nCapitalizing on the public's mystical belief in traditional Chinese medicine, they naturally made a killing.\n\nThe year before last, at a family gathering, the elders were still laughing at the martial arts industry, which had been hit by a scandal exposing fakes. Who would have thought that fortunes would turn so quickly? This year, the herbal supplement industry was also in turmoil, and the market had begun to destabilize. His family wanted to ask him back to hold down the fort, but he didn't want to go.\n\nJust thinking about the cure-all insoles his family had created,\n\nand the nourishing, body-fortifying sanitary pads,\n\nQu Mingming found it all disgusting. He would rather run this internet cafe and study his insects at night than go back home.\n\n\"Brother! Brother!\"\n\nHis sister's voice interrupted Qu Mingming's thoughts.\n\n\"What's wrong? Did you deliver the medicinal soup?\"\n\n\"I did. That place, their... their place is...\"\n\nQu Zhenzhen pointed in the direction of the bookstore.\n\n\"That place... it's terrifying! They're actually keeping a zombie there.\"\n\n\"A zombie?\"\n\nQu Mingming was exasperated. \"Are you serious?\"\n\n\"It's true! It was in a bathtub.\n\nThe zombie was taking a bath!\"\n\nQu Zhenzhen said with a completely serious expression,\n\nher face screaming, \"If you don't believe me, I'll bite you!\"\n\n\"Uh... hold on, let me get this straight.\"\n\nQu Mingming was truly at a loss for whether to laugh or cry. He casually took out a silver needle, pricked his sister's fingertip, and then began to gently rotate it.\n\nQu Zhenzhen's agitated emotions began to slowly subside, and she entered a state of peace.\n\n\"Thank you, brother.\"\n\n\"Heh, it's nothing. Come on, let's sort this out. You're saying their shop has a zombie, and that zombie was taking a bath?\"\n\n\"Yes. My worms sensed it. It can't be wrong. When I got near that person, the worms inside me all started to get scared. They usually get excited when they see living people, but this time, they were afraid!\"\n\n\"I think there must be some kind of misunderstanding,\"\n\nQu Mingming said, still unconvinced.\n\nHe came from a long line of physicians, a family with a deep heritage. Of course, it wasn't some clichéd ancient family out of a fantasy novel. In the end, it was just generations of doctors passing down their knowledge. Qu Mingming, however, was a special case. Although it's said that medicine and Gu¹ are inseparable, very few TCM practitioners dabbled in it anymore, to the point that people now only associated Gu worms with the Miao people of the borderlands.\n\nHe was an exception; he loved to study this stuff.\n\nTherefore, he was still fundamentally an ordinary person. He didn't see ghosts or gods, knew nothing of hell—oh, wait, he'd even joined the Party in college. By all rights, he should be a staunch atheist.\n\n\"Hey.\"\n\nSomeone called from behind him.\n\nQu Mingming turned around. When Qu Zhenzhen saw Zhou Ze and the girl, she was so scared she nearly jumped out of her skin, immediately hiding behind her brother.\n\nThe last time Zhou Ze had come, Qu Zhenzhen had dared to be sulky with him and give him the cold shoulder. But this time, fresh from her half-day tour of the bookstore, she truly didn't dare to act that way toward Zhou Ze again.\n\nAfter all,\n\nthat unfathomable, terrifying old Taoist\n\nwas just a subordinate of this young man!\n\n\"Here. The Dragon Boat Festival is here, so we went to the market and bought some *zongzi*.\"\n\nAs he spoke, Zhou Ze had Bai Yingying place the *zongzi* on the counter.\n\n\"Thank you,\"\n\nQu Mingming replied.\n\n\"Don't mention it.\"\n\nWith that, Zhou Ze prepared to leave with Bai Yingying. This gesture of reciprocity was simply in return for the medicinal soup they had treated him to last time. Zhou Ze hadn't returned to the bookstore yet, so he didn't know they had sent another batch of soup today.\n\nThe old Taoist was too busy sneaking a taste to call and inform Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Did you buy all this?\"\n\nQu Mingming pointed at the two large bags Bai Yingying was carrying. He could clearly smell the scent of Chinese herbs.\n\n\"Oh, a friend of mine is sick. I bought some medicine to help him recuperate,\" Zhou Ze answered.\n\n\"What kind of illness?\" Qu Mingming asked, then smiled. \"You know, since Chinese herbs are involved, and I happen to be a TCM doctor, why not let me take a look?\"\n\nZhou Ze pursed his lips. \"I'm afraid this is one illness you might not have much luck treating.\"\n\n\"Feel free to tell me.\"\n\n\"He's been poisoned.\"\n\n\"What kind of poison?\"\n\n\"Corpse poison.\"\n\nHearing this, Qu Mingming deliberately glanced at his sister behind him. He figured she must have been mistaken.\n\nSince the man was in the tomb-raiding business, it was perfectly normal to get corpse poison after entering a tomb. Besides, a zombie taking a bath? It was probably just someone with corpse poison using the tub to detoxify.\n\n\"I can give it a try,\" Qu Mingming said confidently.\n\n\"Alright then. I'll have to trouble you.\"\n\n---\n\nJust as Zhou Ze pushed open the bookstore door, he saw the old Taoist running out in a panic. Seeing Zhou Ze was like seeing a savior.\n\n\"Boss, you're finally back! This humble Taoist is just stepping out to get a package!\"\n\nAnd with that,\n\nwithout waiting for Zhou Ze's reply,\n\nthe old Taoist shot right out of the bookstore.\n\nBut his running posture was a bit uncoordinated, as if he were clamping a third leg between his two.\n\n\"Heh heh, the atmosphere in our shop has always been pretty relaxed,\" Zhou Ze explained.\n\nQu Mingming smiled without a word. As the old Taoist passed him, he had caught a whiff of medicinal soup. He figured this employee had snuck a drink of the soup he had brewed, and the effects were certainly potent.\n\nBut he remembered that when he gave Zhou Ze the same medicinal soup last time,\n\nZhou Ze had drunk it with a perfectly calm expression,\n\nand left peacefully,\n\nwithout any reaction at all.\n\nFor a time, Qu Mingming had even thought his medicinal soup wasn't effective enough.\n\nBut seeing the contrast now,\n\nit seemed that Zhou Ze was... critically ill.\n\n\"Please.\"\n\nZhou Ze invited the Qu siblings to the second floor. Qu Zhenzhen was terrified, but she still followed her brother, worried that something might happen to him here.\n\nWhen they pushed open Xu Qinglang's door, Xu Qinglang, who had been sleeping, opened his eyes. Seeing strangers, he complained with some dissatisfaction:\n\n\"Am I a tourist attraction now? Are you charging people for viewings?\"\n\n\"Sure. We can split the ticket sales. Men prettier than women are rare, but not nonexistent. But a zombie prettier than a woman? Now that's truly one in a million.\"\n\nQu Mingming walked over to the tub, observed Xu Qinglang's condition, and frowned. \"This isn't ordinary corpse poison. This is the truly contagious kind...\"\n\nOrdinary corpse poison wouldn't cause such changes to the body.\n\n\"Can you treat it?\" Zhou Ze asked. He only cared about the result.\n\n\"I've only read about cases like this in ancient texts. There are methods, and actually, the method you're using is very ineffective.\"\n\nQu Mingming dipped his hand into the tub,\n\nthen brought his hand to his nose and sniffed.\n\nHe seemed to have discovered something and looked puzzled.\n\nHe immediately stuck out his tongue and licked Xu Qinglang's bathwater from his palm.\n\nXu Qinglang's face turned red.\n\n\"This flavor... there's a sour, gamey tang to it. What is this? It's a top-tier supplement for invigorating blood circulation and treating internal and external injuries.\"\n\nZhou Ze thought for a moment and understood. Classmate Mingming was talking about the monkey urine mixed with mud.\n\n\"First, tell me how to treat him. What do we need to prepare?\"\n\n\"My method is to first rapidly cultivate a special Gu worm, then use this worm to enter the patient's body and consume the corpse poison, thereby solving the problem at its root.\n\nBut the problem is,\n\nI have a suitable Gu worm here.\n\nI'm just missing something to cultivate it.\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"For that, you'll need to make another trip to that tomb. And it will be very dangerous.\"\n\n\"Tomb?\" Xu Qinglang looked completely bewildered. How did a tomb get involved in this?\n\n\"Which tomb?\" Zhou Ze couldn't recall what he meant either.\n\n\"The place where he contracted the corpse poison. We need to find a *zongzi*.\"\n\n\"*Zongzi*?\"\n\n\"Yes. A zombie from a tomb. In your line of work, isn't that what you call a *zongzi*?\" Qu Mingming asked curiously.\n\n\"You're the *zongzi*! Your whole family are *zongzi*!\" Bai Yingying immediately snapped.\n\n\"Yingying, no fooling around,\" Zhou Ze reminded her.\n\n\"*Ying ying ying*.\"\n\nInstantly obedient.\n\n\"Alright. We find that *zong*... *zi*. Then what?\"\n\n\"I need a lock of its hair as a catalyst. A zombie's hair, mixed with certain specific herbs, to cultivate the Gu worm. A worm cultivated this way will have a natural craving for the components of corpse poison. It's the best way to detoxify him.\"\n\n\"Oh, is that it? You should have just said so.\" With that, Zhou Ze turned to Yingying. \"Hair.\"\n\n\"You got it, Boss.\"\n\nBai Yingying used her fingernail to snip off a lock of her hair and handed it to Qu Mingming.\n\n\"Don't be shy, go ahead and use it,\" Bai Yingying said magnanimously. \"If you need more, just ask.\"\n\nQu Mingming looked at the hair in his hand,\n\na look of bemusement on his face,\n\nand said:\n\n\"I don't need your hair, I need...\"\n\nAs he spoke,\n\nQu Mingming seemed to be struck by a sudden thought.\n\nHis face went deathly pale.\n\n*Holy shit!*\n\n---\n¹Gu: A venomous creature or poison derived from it, often featured in Chinese folklore and fantasy.",

    "content": "This bookstore…\n\n...was truly terrifying.\n\nQu Mingming suddenly remembered what his sister had told him before.\n\nShe had said:\n\n“Bro, that bookstore is so scary, they’re actually raising zombies!”\n\nAt first, he hadn’t believed it.\n\nNow, not only did Qu Mingming believe it, but he had also made an even more horrifying discovery:\n\nThis bookstore…\n\n...wasn't a group of people raising zombies.\n\nInstead…\n\n...it was a group of zombies raising one or two living people!\n\nQu Mingming was a pretty brave person; otherwise, he wouldn’t have dared to play with Gu-insects. But at this moment, he admitted, he was a little scared. Truly scared.\n\nThis was a reality that went beyond his entire worldview. No matter how miraculous Gu-insects were, no matter how incredible they seemed to outsiders, even if they were mythologized in movies and TV shows, in Qu Mingming’s eyes, Gu-insects could still be explained and understood from a biological perspective. They could still be categorized within the scope of normal scientific reasoning, not some far-fetched tale.\n\nBut…\n\n...zombies.\n\nZombies, ah.\n\nA living, breathing zombie standing right in front of you.\n\nA zombie who even cut off a lock of its hair for you, ah.\n\nHow could science possibly explain this?\n\n“You’re not kidding, are you…” Qu Mingming asked, testing the waters one last time.\n\n“Boss, he doesn’t believe it,” Bai Yingying said, pointing at Qu Mingming as she looked to Zhou Ze.\n\n“Let’s make him a believer first. We’re counting on him for the antidote,” said Zhou Ze.\n\n“You got it.”\n\nBai Yingying lowered her head.\n\nThen she snapped her head up to face Qu Mingming.\n\nThe temperature in the entire room dropped in an instant.\n\nA bone-chilling cold permeated the air.\n\nAt the same time,\n\nBai Yingying’s beautiful hair began to float, her hands spread open to reveal long, purple fingernails, and from the corners of her mouth, sinister fangs emerged!\n\nDeep within her eyes brewed a reddish-brown glint like that from the depths of magma.\n\n“Roar!”\n\nQu Mingming’s body trembled.\n\nHis legs went soft with fright, and he collapsed directly onto the floor.\n\nBai Yingying curiously touched her own head.\n\n“Huh, he didn’t even faint.”\n\nThat counted as a compliment.\n\nWhen an ordinary person saw a zombie’s true form, forget fainting, they could be scared to death. But Qu Mingming’s legs had merely gone weak.\n\nMeanwhile, Qu Zhenzhen, who had followed her brother to “re-enter the tiger’s den,” was also frightened, but she immediately opened her mouth, and a swarm of moths prepared to fly out.\n\n*Smack!*\n\nZhou Ze was faster. To be precise, Zhou Ze had noticed this sister’s peculiarity long ago. The moment she opened her mouth to spit out those poisonous moths, Zhou Ze slapped her right on the jaw, forcing her mouth shut.\n\nBut the moths immediately changed their route, trying to emerge from Qu Zhenzhen’s nostrils and ears. The human body has plenty of holes, after all.\n\nIf you really want to,\n\nyou can always find a way.\n\n“Stop it, Sister.”\n\nMingming, still sitting on the floor, shouted.\n\nQu Zhenzhen immediately closed her eyes, and the moths that were about to fly out promptly went back inside.\n\nQu Mingming struggled to his feet, leaning on the bathtub. He pointed at Xu Qinglang inside the tub and asked:\n\n“Can I ask one last question?”\n\n“Ask.”\n\n“Was he… bitten by you all?”\n\n“What difference does it make if he was or wasn't?” Zhou Ze retorted.\n\n“As a man of medicine, I don't seek to serve the powerful, only to have a clear conscience. I will not help a villain do evil.”\n\n“We didn't bite him. He's a living person, but there was an accident. He was bitten by another zombie,” Zhou Ze said, a bit impatiently. “I say, Doctor, can you treat my friend now?”\n\nQu Mingming nodded. He glanced at the lock of hair clutched in his hand.\n\n“Let me be alone for a moment.”\n\n………………\n\n“Boss, is what he said really reliable?”\n\nOn the first floor of the bookstore, Bai Yingying asked while massaging Zhou Ze’s shoulders.\n\n“Well, Old Xu is already in this state. Nothing left to lose, might as well go for broke.”\n\n“Hehe, if Lady Xu¹ heard you say that, he’d probably be willing to turn into a zombie and come down here to fight you to the death without any treatment.”\n\n“Heh, oh, right. The old Daoist said he was going out to get a package. What’s taking so long?”\n\n“No idea.”\n\n“Meow.”\n\nThe sound of a cat came through.\n\nZhou Ze’s eyes narrowed.\n\nThe bookstore did have a pet, but it was a golden snub-nosed monkey. There were no cats in the store.\n\n“Boss, there’s a cat meowing.”\n\n“Bring me the Yin-Yang Tome,” said Zhou Ze.\n\nBai Yingying immediately went to get Zhou Ze’s Yin-Yang Tome and placed it on the coffee table in front of him.\n\nThe Yin-Yang Tome looked like an old-fashioned notebook. However, the black cat on its cover was currently shifting its position constantly, looking very anxious, and letting out “meow meow meow” sounds from within the notebook from time to time.\n\n“Where’s that snake?” Bai Yingying noticed something was wrong. She remembered that Zhou Ze had sealed that Eighth Grandma deity inside, and a black cat and a small snake had appeared on the cover.\n\nBut now, only the black cat remained. The small snake was gone.\n\nZhou Ze flipped the Yin-Yang Tome over. On the back of the notebook, he saw a small black snake repeatedly probing the edges.\n\nThe feeling was like one of those old flip-books, creating an animation effect by flipping the pages.\n\nThe little snake had already escaped its cage and even shaken off the dumb cat, but it still couldn’t get out.\n\nZhou Ze reached out and poked the little snake with his finger.\n\nThe little snake on the cover suddenly shuddered, as if it had sensed something.\n\nThen,\n\nA wisp of green smoke slowly rose up. Zhou Ze waved his hand, dispersing the smoke to reveal the face of an old woman. This must be Eighth Grandma's original appearance.\n\nZhou Ze didn’t understand matters concerning shamans, nor did he know a thing about spirits and the like, but he found the current scene rather interesting.\n\nA snake spirit, likely worshipped as a great immortal by people somewhere, had ended up as a caged bird here with him.\n\n“Young man, isn’t this enough? Let me out.”\n\nEighth Grandma's voice carried a gloomy chill. This wasn’t a plea, but more like she was joking with a junior.\n\nZhou Ze tilted his head slightly, looking at the old woman’s face without speaking.\n\n“My people are almost here. Young man, even if you’re an underworld official, you’ll be in over your head. If you let this Grandma out now, we can still talk things over.”\n\nZhou Ze still said nothing.\n\nTo be honest,\n\nwhether in TV shows or novels, it seemed like these villains were all cut from the same cloth. They insisted on making threats that were completely useless against the person in question, and they even seemed to relish saying them.\n\n“Young man, the Underworld manages the reincarnation of humans and ghosts, but we demon cultivators jumped out of that cycle long ago. You have no authority to take me!”\n\n“Has the takeout arrived yet?” Zhou Ze asked Bai Yingying.\n\n“It should be here soon, Boss.”\n\n“Oh.”\n\nWith that, Zhou Ze tossed the Yin-Yang Tome back onto the coffee table. The old woman's face distorted and then dissipated.\n\nPreviously, Zhou Ze had thought this Eighth Grandma was about to break out. Now, it seemed that although she had escaped her cage inside, trying to leave the Yin-Yang Tome was pure fantasy. There was no need to worry anymore.\n\n“Meow!”\n\nThe black cat called out again.\n\n“Squeak squeak squeak!!!”\n\nThe little monkey ran over just then, jumping onto the coffee table, its bright red little—face right in front of Zhou Ze’s.\n\nZhou Ze gave the monkey’s butt a slap. The little monkey turned its head to look at Zhou Ze, very displeased.\n\n“How many times have I told you? I know your butt is red, but don’t always show it off in people’s faces.”\n\nThe monkey puffed out its cheeks. It held an innate annoyance toward Boss Zhou, which, of course, had its reasons. They truly had a grudge from a past life; the demon monkey that was the monkey’s predecessor had been killed by Zhou Ze.\n\n“Meow!”\n\nThe black cat in the Yin-Yang Tome meowed again.\n\nThe little monkey couldn’t be bothered to be angry with Boss Zhou anymore and continued to stare at the cover of the Yin-Yang Tome.\n\n“What’s wrong? This cat is useless, getting cornered by a snake. Don’t you learn from it,” Zhou Ze said, reaching out to rub the little monkey’s head.\n\n“Squeak squeak squeak!”\n\nThe little monkey made a motion to open the notebook with its paw but was caught by Zhou Ze.\n\n“Don’t touch it. You can look, but if you touch it, you’ll have to go inside.”\n\nAlthough that mysterious woman had once said this Yin-Yang Tome could be used to collect seductive ghosts for happy-fun-time diversions, Boss Zhou had witnessed its mystery and power. It was really easy to get lost in it, and once you were trapped inside, whether you could wake up and realize you were in a notebook was really a matter of luck.\n\nIf the monkey went in, Zhou Ze himself had no confidence he could get it back out.\n\nQu Zhenzhen came down from the second floor just then. When she looked at Zhou Ze and Bai Yingying, she had a very cautious expression, as if she was afraid they would suddenly open their gaping maws and eat her.\n\nTo be honest,\n\nthis girl,\n\nin the eyes of an ordinary person, probably wasn't much more “cute” than a zombie. She was practically a human-shaped, mobile insect nest.\n\n“Where’s your brother?” Zhou Ze asked.\n\n“He’s already started conditioning the Gu-insects. He can begin extracting the poison by tonight,” Qu Zhenzhen replied.\n\n“So are you heading back to the internet cafe?” Bai Yingying asked Qu Zhenzhen.\n\n“Mhm. Even though the cafe has employees, a family member should be there to watch over things,” Qu Zhenzhen answered in a small voice.\n\nActing like this, she really had the air of a well-bred young lady.\n\n“Boss…”\n\nBai Yingying pulled on Zhou Ze’s shoulder, rubbing against him coquettishly.\n\n“Go on. It’s not like you need to eat anyway.”\n\n“Yay, Boss!”\n\nBai Yingying was thrilled. She walked over and took Qu Zhenzhen’s hand. Qu Zhenzhen flinched in fear; she had been right there watching when Bai Yingying revealed her true form to reassure her brother.\n\n“Come on, little sister, I’ll go to your place and play some games. Do you play PUBG²? How’s your sniping?”\n\n“I usually like to read. I don’t really play games.”\n\n“Aww!” Bai Yingying was very disappointed, and said playfully, “Then I’ll just have to eat you.”\n\nQu Zhenzhen shuddered.\n\nTwo large, multi-legged centipedes immediately crawled out of her palm.\n\nSeveral grubs began to squirm in her eyeballs.\n\nAnd worms peeked their heads out of her ears.\n\n“They can enhance my dynamic visual acuity, hearing, and game controls beyond the scope of an ordinary person.\n\nIt’s just like having cheats on.\n\nThat’s why I rarely play games; there’s no challenge.\n\nIf you want to play,\n\nI can carry you.”\n\n***\n**Footnotes:**\n1.  **Lady Xu (許娘娘):** \"Niangniang\" is a term for an empress or imperial consort.

    "content": "The takeout arrived.\n\nFirst, he drank two mouthfuls of the Lycoris Radiata Oral Solution.\n\nZhou Ze began to eat with relish.\n\nBoss Zhou was busy with work in his past life and wasn't particular about his food. In this life, eating was a chore at first, but now that he could enjoy the pleasure of a meal, he naturally wasn't too fussy about what he was actually eating.\n\nOf course,\n\nwho could he blame but the sick house cook?\n\n\"Life is not just the drudgery before your eyes, but also poetry and distant fields,\nYou came into this world with your bare hands, for that sea you have yet to find, you'd risk it all...\"\n\nA singing voice came from the bookstore's entrance.\n\nThe voice was slightly hoarse, the emotion suffused with the vicissitudes of life.\n\nAnd to be honest,\n\nit was quite good.\n\nBoss Zhou, holding his food container, walked to the bookstore entrance. He saw a young busker with a guitar, standing by the roadside, playing and singing. The young man wore a T-shirt, dirty black canvas shoes, and ripped jeans, completely absorbed in his singing.\n\nA small crowd quickly gathered nearby.\n\nWhile he sang, people would also put some money into the guitar case in front of him.\n\nBoss Zhou was like a migrant worker,\n\nsquatting on the curb,\n\ntaking a couple of bites of his boxed meal,\n\nthen looking up at the singer,\n\nbefore lowering his head to continue shoveling rice into his mouth.\n\nPerhaps, this was life: having food, drink, and the leisure to listen to a song.\n\nYingying was playing games at the internet cafe across the street.\n\nA solution had been found for the poisoned Old Xu.\n\nThe Old Daoist was happily receiving his delivery.\n\nHe himself had the appetite to eat.\n\nIt was wonderful.\n\nIf the Zhou Ze of the past were to see himself now, he would probably snort with disdain, expressing his contempt for this \"salted fish\"¹ lifestyle.\n\nBut his present self,\n\nfound it sweet as nectar.\n\nQu Mingming came out of the bookstore, saw Zhou Ze squatting there, and squatted down beside him. He pulled out a cigarette and handed it to Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze lit it, took a puff, and frowned slightly. The flavor was strong, but it hit the spot.\n\n\"I grow the tobacco myself. It's specially cultivated, and I even designed the filter. Smoking this has the effect of Qingkailing or Banlangen.\"²\n\n\"Smoking can improve your health?\" Zhou Ze picked up the lit cigarette, looked at it, and took another drag. \"Got any more? Give me a few cartons.\"\n\n\"Haha, I don't have that many. Medicinal herbs are expensive these days, and the cost of these is already high. A single cigarette is about two or three hundred.\"\n\n\"That's not too expensive...\"\n\n\"Pounds.\"\n\n\"*Hiss...*\"\n\nZhou Ze asked, a little curious, \"Is your family, like, super rich?\"\n\n\"Actually, my family isn't what you'd call wealthy. Although our lineage dates back to the Tang Dynasty, being a doctor isn't exactly a profession for the rich and famous. It's only in recent years that money has become easier to make.\n\n\"The things my uncles and other elders do... cure-all insoles,\n\n\"fire therapy that can treat cancer...\n\n\"These things might sound absurd to you, but the market for them is really good. I just don't like the feeling of it.\n\n\"Once, I went to visit one of my uncle's companies. They were holding a meeting. A group of elderly people, my grandparents' age, were gathered together waving flags, like some kind of pyramid scheme.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"So, I think things are pretty good now. I like playing with Gu insects, so I can indulge myself. I like playing video games, so I opened an internet cafe. Occasionally, I make house calls for a few dignitaries and nobles to help them regulate their health. I'm not short on money, and life is actually quite comfortable.\"\n\nTwo salted fish,\n\ninadvertently,\n\nhad found a kindred spirit!\n\n\"By the way, I'm already cultivating the Gu insects. They'll be ready in another eighteen hours. We should be able to start extracting the poison late tonight. Your female employee is a jiangshi,³ are you one too?\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"My eyes have really been opened today.\" Qu Mingming seemed to have come to terms with it, even reaching out and putting an arm around Zhou Ze's shoulders.\n\nZhou Ze had always hated physical contact with strangers.\n\nPeople with mysophobia,\n\ncan't stand it.\n\nBut he caught a faint, clean scent from Qu Mingming's arm. Plus, his hands were very fair, his nails neatly trimmed. This was a man who understood cleanliness, truly like a famous physician from an ancient illustration, possessing a natural transcendent BUFF.\n\nEven if you had mysophobia,\n\nit would be very hard to feel any aversion.\n\n\"I feel like my life has become interesting again. I've already done deep research into Gu insects, and you've given me a new research topic.\"\n\n\"Actually, I feel quite guilty. You may have only ever seen the 'white' side of this world. It has a 'black' side too, and seeing too much of it isn't necessarily a good thing.\"\n\n\"I know, I know.\"\n\n\"Today I, in the cold night watch the snow drift by, with a heart grown cold, I drift afar, chasing through wind and rain, losing your trail in the fog...\"\n\nThe song ended, and the busker switched to another one.\n\n\"He's not a bad singer,\" Qu Mingming commented.\n\n\"Has a weathered feel to it. At least, it sounds that way,\" said Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Weathered?\" Qu Mingming smiled. \"His shoes, his jeans, the guitar in his hands... all together they're worth over a hundred thousand.\"\n\nZhou Ze was stunned.\n\nHe had thought the busker was out here to earn money; turns out he was just \"experiencing life.\"\n\nAt the same time, he felt a bit embarrassed. Standing next to a genuine rich kid, he felt as if his own judgment was being looked down upon.\n\n\"I'll go sing a song too.\"\n\nQu Mingming stood up, dusted off his hands, and walked over to the busker. There was a microphone hanging nearby, welcoming passersby to sing along—he would provide accompaniment, but a tip afterward was unavoidable.\n\nZhou Ze watched from the side.\n\nBut the moment Qu Mingming picked up the microphone,\n\nZhou Ze suddenly smelled a strange odor.\n\nIt was very faint, but it was definitely there.\n\nZhou Ze's gaze hardened. He dropped the boxed meal in his hand, immediately covered his nose, and rushed back into the bookstore.\n\nQu Mingming, who was just about to sing, saw Zhou Ze leave without even listening.\n\nHe lost interest, put the microphone back, pulled a few hundred yuan from his pocket, and placed it in the busker's guitar bag before heading toward his own internet cafe.\n\nMeanwhile, Zhou Ze, who had rushed into the bookstore, pushed open the door and began to scan his surroundings.\n\nThe smell,\n\nThat smell!\n\nYes,\n\nIt was inside the bookstore,\n\nand it was getting stronger!\n\nSomething had come in.\n\nIt's really here!\n\n\"*Squeak squeak squeak!!!*\"\n\nThe monkey's cries came from the eaves. Zhou Ze looked up and saw the monkey standing on a roof beam. One hand was holding a piece of clay to its nose, while the other held the Book of Life and Death, looking very anxious.\n\nSeeing Zhou Ze enter, the monkey immediately leaped down from above, pounced toward Zhou Ze, and, for the first time ever, struck a \"please hug me\" pose.\n\nBut while the monkey was in mid-air, a cloud of yellow smoke suddenly billowed up, sweeping directly toward it.\n\nThe monkey shrieked and actually did a backflip in the air.\n\nOne could only say it was a monkey's natural talent, something not to be envied.\n\nHaving dodged the yellow smoke, the monkey landed on the counter and pointed in one direction, chattering \"squeak squeak squeak\" at Zhou Ze incessantly.\n\n\"*Hooo... hooo...*\"\n\nOver there,\n\na weasel was actually lying there,\n\nand it was sleeping.\n\nIt would be difficult for a person to sneak into the bookstore, but for a small animal, it was very hard to guard against.\n\nAnd this was definitely no ordinary small animal.\n\n\"*Hooo... hooo...*\"\n\nThe weasel was still snoring, but the cloud of yellow smoke swirled around it, dense and undispersed.\n\nIn many parts of the Northeast, the weasel is also known as Huang Daxian.⁴ The one before him had likely become a spirit, and its purpose here was self-evident.\n\nZhou Ze just hadn't expected it to arrive so quickly.\n\nAt the same time, he thought that Eighth Aunt was a real fool. If she had just held back a little longer instead of showing off prematurely, the black cat wouldn't have cried out, he wouldn't have told Yingying to take out the Book of Life and Death, and the monkey wouldn't have gotten curious and started looking at it like a picture book.\n\nJust a moment ago,\n\nthe Old Daoist wasn't home—of course, it made no difference whether he was or not;\n\nYingying was playing games at the internet cafe across the street, Old Xu was soaking in the tub upstairs, probably dazed from too much steaming,\n\nand he himself was sitting at the entrance, listening to a song and eating his boxed meal.\n\nIt had been the perfect time for this weasel to sneak in and make its move. If the Book of Life and Death hadn't happened to be in the monkey's hands, it might have really been stolen.\n\n\"*Creeak...*\"\n\nThe bookstore door was pushed open.\n\nThe young busker walked in, a warm smile on his face. A very sunny young man.\n\n\"*Thud...*\"\n\nHe dropped his guitar bag on the floor.\n\nInside was some of the money he had just earned from busking.\n\nIf you looked closely,\n\nyou could also find some wild ginseng and precious game, and even a piece of leather, who knows what animal it was skinned from.\n\nThe young busker bowed slightly to Zhou Ze.\n\nA gesture of respect.\n\n\"Greetings, Your Excellency. We've come to take Eighth Aunt home. This is payment for the trouble Eighth Aunt has caused you during her stay. Please accept it.\"\n\nTo be honest,\n\nthese great immortals were more polite than the last.\n\nThe previous Eighth Aunt had taken the initiative to avoid conflict with Liu Chuyu.\n\nThis one had even brought a gift.\n\nIt made Zhou Ze wonder if he was being too harsh.\n\nThey were being so tactful,\n\nand she held no real grudge against him.\n\nShould he just let her go?\n\nZhou Ze noticed a yellow light flickering in the young man's eyes from time to time. He glanced at the sleeping Huang Daxian in the corner and understood.\n\nThis one was also possessed.\n\nTheir original plan was to steal it directly, but when that failed, they had to resort to courtesy, a different approach.\n\n\"You're too kind,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"It's only right,\" the other replied, bowing to Zhou Ze again.\n\nZhou Ze smiled and beckoned to the monkey. \"Come, give me the book. Let's send her home.\"\n\nThe monkey shook its head furiously.\n\nOn what grounds!\n\nZhou Ze realized the monkey had really been corrupted since following the Old Daoist.\n\nHow pure it had been before, in its past life.\n\nNow it was another one who hated losing out and only thought of taking advantage.\n\n\"They've come to the door and even brought gifts.\"\n\nAs he spoke, Zhou Ze took an old ginseng root from the guitar bag.\n\n\"A 300-year-old wild ginseng. You don't see these often anymore,\" the young man introduced.\n\n\"Here, take this to eat.\"\n\nZhou Ze tossed the old ginseng directly to the monkey. The monkey caught the ginseng, then sullenly ran over and handed the Book of Life and Death to Zhou Ze.\n\n\"She's right in here.\"\n\nWith that,\n\nZhou Ze handed the Book of Life and Death to the young man.\n\n\"Your Excellency is most magnanimous. On behalf of the immortals of the old forest, I thank you. If Your Excellency ever has business in the old forest, please let us know in advance, and we will be sure to give you a fine reception.\"\n\n\"You're too polite, too polite.\"\n\nZhou Ze bent down and continued to inspect the other gifts in the guitar bag.\n\nA yellow light flashed in the young man's eyes. He didn't care about the gifts; they were rarities to ordinary people, but common items to them.\n\nThe next moment,\n\noverjoyed, he opened the Book of Life and Death.\n\n\"Eighth Aunt, come on out...\"\n\nAnd then,\n\nhe stopped moving.\n\nZhou Ze stood up, his back to the young man, and began to back away.\n\nBacking up until he was beside the young man,\n\nhe reached his hand back, not looking at the Book of Life and Death. After fumbling for a long time, he finally managed to close it.\n\nThe Book of Life and Death in his hand,\n\nthe cover now featured a very angry weasel, in addition to the black cat and the small snake. Clearly, it knew it had been tricked.\n\n\"Don't blame me. You were the ones who were too foolish, right?\"\n\nThe monkey, gnawing on the precious wild ginseng at the side, couldn't stop nodding.\n\nZhou Ze patted the Book of Life and Death in his hand, trying to suppress a smile,\n\nbecause he felt like a major villain in a movie,\n\nbut he still couldn't help but say:\n\n\"Are there any more great immortals coming? I'd like to put together an Animal World.\"\n\n***\n\n¹ **Salted fish (鹹魚)**: Chinese internet slang for someone who is lazy, unmotivated, and has no ambitions, like a salted fish just lying there.\n\n² **Qingkailing (清開靈), Banlangen (板藍根)**: Common over-the-counter traditional Chinese medicines used for treating colds, fevers, and sore throats.\n\n³ **Jiangshi (殭屍)**: A creature from Chinese folklore, often translated as a \"hopping vampire\" or \"zombie.\"\n\n⁴ **Huang Daxian (黃大仙)**: \"Great Immortal Huang.\" In Chinese folklore, particularly in the Northeast, certain animals that live a long time can gain spiritual powers and become \"immortals\" or spirits, with weasels being one of the most common.

    "content": "\"Here, it's yours. Don't be an idiot and open it. Just look at what happened to that weasel, got it?\"\n\nZhou Ze reached out and petted the monkey, which was gnawing on a wild ginseng root, and tossed the Yin-Yang Ledger to it.\n\nThis monkey was very sharp. Although it didn't have the divine abilities it possessed in its past life as a demon monkey, leaving the Yin-Yang Ledger with it was actually very safe. The reason Yellow Weasel Immortal hadn't managed to steal the Yin-Yang Ledger before was precisely because the monkey had it in its hands.\n\nBesides, maybe it was a case of taking advantage of a known softy. Zhou Ze knew the monkey's true nature better than anyone. If it was the one keeping the ledger, no matter what, it would never harm him.\n\nMost importantly, Zhou Ze didn't want to carry this thing around with him. It was a constant, annoying reminder of who around him was about to die.\n\nTaking down the Yellow Weasel Immortal was just something Zhou Ze did on the side. Although the weasel's attempt to negotiate politely after its failed theft was indeed a bit hypocritical, Boss Zhou himself had been just as nasty when he'd picked up the Yin-Yang Ledger and, without a second thought, challenged Eighth Auntie with, \"I dare you to answer to your name.\"\n\nIt was a case of the pot calling the kettle black. From Boss Zhou's perspective, he had the Yin-Yang Ledger, which was the perfect counter to this gang of immortals who liked to play around with \"out-of-body experiences\" and possession for fun.\n\nEven if Boss Zhou didn't know what use there was in collecting this \"animal kingdom,\" it was like a squirrel tirelessly gathering pinecones, or like Bai Yingying happily spending half an hour looting in a game of *PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds*, only to get headshotted the moment she stepped outside.\n\nThe thrill and satisfaction of collecting is a common human failing—oh, no, it's an instinct for any intelligent life form.\n\nDifferent standpoints, different ways of thinking, I suppose. If they were human, Boss Zhou wouldn't do this, but in Zhou Ze's eyes, this gang of immortals wasn't human. And since they weren't human, he couldn't be bothered to discuss things like benevolence and morality with them.\n\nJust collect them first and ask questions later. Who knew if they might be useful someday?\n\nOld Zhou had never claimed to be a good person, nor could he ever be one.\n\nThe young street singer hadn't woken up yet for some reason. He just stood there, motionless, as if in a daze. Zhou Ze paid him no mind and went straight up to the second floor.\n\nXu Qinglang was still soaking in the bathtub. He had been in for a long time, but his skin wasn't pruney, nor were there any other issues. Zhou Ze figured this was probably due to the monkey's mud.\n\nMany hotels nowadays like to advertise a hot spring theme, but a lot of them are just fooling people. For instance, if your skin starts to get pruney after just half an hour, it means that \"hot spring water\" has zero sincerity behind it.\n\nNext to Old Xu was a small tea table. On it was a bowl filled with a red liquid. Beside the bowl, a long stick of incense, wrapped in hair, was slowly burning.\n\nInside, a whitish thing that looked like an insect egg was gently wriggling.\n\nZhou Ze stood by the tea table, observing the egg.\n\n\"What are you looking at?\" Xu Qinglang said irritably.\n\n\"The thought that tonight this bug will burrow into your body, crawl all over you, giving both your A-side and B-side a complete, slimy tour...\n\nI'm just so filled with anticipation.\"\n\n\"...\" said Xu Qinglang.\n\nZhou Ze passed Xu Qinglang a cigarette and sat down by the tub.\n\nThey didn't chat any more. The two men sat in silence. Before the cigarette was finished, Zhou Ze's phone rang. It was an unknown number.\n\n\"Hello,\" Zhou Ze answered.\n\n\"Is Lu Fangweng¹ an employee of your establishment?\"\n\n\"Who's Lu Fangweng?\" Zhou Ze asked, looking at Xu Qinglang.\n\n\"The Old Taoist,\" Xu Qinglang reminded him.\n\n\"Oh, yes.\"\n\n\"He's been a customer here, but he has no money to pay the bill. Please come settle it for him.\"\n\n\"No money to pay?\"\n\n\"That's right, no money to pay.\"\n\n\"What kind of place are you?\"\n\n\"The Azure Water Blue Sky SPA Club in Gangzha.\"\n\n\"Let me talk to him to confirm,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nThe other end of the line went quiet.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. He never thought the Old Taoist would be one to skip out on paying for a prostitute.\n\n\"Boss, Boss...\" the Old Taoist's voice came through, but then it sounded as if his mouth had been covered, and he couldn't say anything else.\n\n\"I need to speak with him,\" Zhou Ze demanded.\n\nPaying for the Old Taoist was no big deal. Boss Zhou might be poor, but he was generous enough with his own employees. However, Zhou Ze had to confirm that the Old Taoist was safe.\n\n\"Just come over and pay in person. Look up the address on a map yourself. You have one hour to get here. Otherwise, we can't guarantee his safety.\"\n\nThe voice on the other end was laced with unconcealed menace.\n\n\"Just give me your Alipay number and I'll transfer the money directly,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Sorry, this bill must be settled by you in person.\"\n\n\"Are you after money?\" Zhou Ze could read between the lines; it seemed they wanted more than just money.\n\n\"Beep... beep...\"\n\nThe other party hung up.\n\n\"What's wrong?\" Xu Qinglang asked.\n\n\"They hung up.\" Zhou Ze shrugged. \"Something's not right.\"\n\n\"You should go check it out then.\"\n\n\"Yeah.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded. He went downstairs, and before leaving the bookstore, he sent a message to Bai Yingying, telling her to stop playing games and come back to watch the store.\n\nThen, Zhou Ze took a taxi to the club.\n\nThe club was across from the RT-Mart. It was quite large and, at least on the surface, looked rather high-class. After getting out of the car, Zhou Ze wasted no time and took the elevator directly to the fourth floor.\n\nThe elevator doors opened.\n\nThe interior was resplendent and magnificent. The receptionists all bowed to Zhou Ze in unison.\n\n\"Welcome to Azure Water Blue Sky. We hope you have a pleasant time.\"\n\nZhou Ze wanted to laugh. He knew the Old Taoist's tastes; he only liked to spread his love at street-side hair salons or foot massage parlors. The Old Taoist didn't care for high-class establishments like this.\n\nHe was looking for a big sister, not a granddaughter.\n\n\"Sir, are you here for a foot massage or for wellness?\"\n\nA tall receptionist took the initiative to walk up to Zhou Ze and ask.\n\nZhou Ze remembered the Old Taoist had educated him on this.\n\nUsually, when you go to a place like this and they ask if you want a \"foot massage\" or \"wellness,\" it's industry jargon. A \"foot massage\" means you get a legitimate technician for a foot massage. If you answer \"wellness,\" you still get a very legitimate technician, but the latter comes with some services not suitable for minors.\n\nHowever, before you can enjoy the not-suitable-for-minors services, they'll force you to top up a membership card.\n\n\"I'm here to find someone. Someone from here called me,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\nThe female receptionist nodded, asked someone over her walkie-talkie, then smiled and bowed to Zhou Ze. \"Sir, please follow me.\"\n\nShe led the way, and Zhou Ze followed her. After several turns, the receptionist pushed open the door to a small private room and gestured for Zhou Ze to enter.\n\nZhou Ze walked in. Inside was a bathtub, a sofa, a large TV, and a round bed draped with a light gauze canopy.\n\n\"What's the meaning of this?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Sir, this is the Emperor's Package your friend ordered for you. The technician will be in shortly.\"\n\n\"I'm here to pick up my friend.\"\n\n\"I'm not clear on the specifics,\" the receptionist said, turning to leave.\n\nBut Zhou Ze reached out from behind and hooked an arm around her neck.\n\n\"If you don't explain, you're not leaving.\"\n\n\"Sir, I'm for hire too, but my rates are higher than the technicians',\" the receptionist said, her expression unchanged.\n\nThe next moment,\n\nZhou Ze felt a sudden itch in his lower body. A fluffy tail sprouted from behind the receptionist, carrying a bewitching fragrance that made one's blood boil.\n\nA pair of soft, boneless hands suddenly climbed onto Zhou Ze's body and began to wander, each touch seemingly hitting the most sensitive G-spot.\n\nAt that moment,\n\nIt felt as if you were riding tempestuous waves, the intense sensory input constantly stimulating your central nervous system.\n\nThis was a temptation that any man—no, any male creature—would find difficult to resist.\n\nThe receptionist was very confident in this. She had never failed.\n\nBut soon, she froze.\n\nBecause a sharp fingernail was now pressed against her delicate neck. Another fraction of an inch, and it would draw blood.\n\n*How is he not reacting?*\n\n*How can his self-control be this strong?*\n\nThe receptionist's face was a mask of shock. At the same time, she had no choice but to retract her tail and remove her hands.\n\n\"A fox spirit?\"\n\nZhou Ze stared at the receptionist, his gaze fixed on the long tail behind her.\n\n\"Now, can you take me to my friend?\"\n\n\"Of course. He's right next door,\" the receptionist replied calmly.\n\nKeeping the receptionist under his control, Zhou Ze walked with her to the adjacent room.\n\nInside,\n\nThe Old Taoist was lying on the bed, embracing a technician with a look of blissful intoxication. Even when Zhou Ze entered, he didn't seem to notice. This technician also had a tail.\n\nClearly, the Old Taoist had been hypnotized, lost in some sort of indescribable fantasy, and was constantly talking in his sleep.\n\n\"Mr. Zhou, we demon cultivators of the Old Mountain Forest value rules above all, and we especially value the concept of 'politeness.' Otherwise, so many households in the Northeast wouldn't worship us.\n\nPerhaps, Mr. Zhou, you aren't from the Northeast, so you don't have that sentiment. Or perhaps you've read too many fantasy novels and have some misunderstandings about us demon cultivators.\n\nYour friend is fine. We haven't done anything to him.\n\nEven now,\n\nwe are still reasoning with you.\n\nEighth Auntie entered your domain without permission and was captured by you. That's perfectly justifiable. Trespassing on another's domain without notice is a major taboo.\n\nThe Yellow Weasel Immortal attempted to steal from your domain and was also captured by you. That is equally justifiable.\n\nWe admit our mistake, and we accept the punishment. Their skills were inferior, yet they still acted recklessly in the mortal world. It's only right that they paid the price.\n\nWe hope Mr. Zhou, in your magnanimity, will be forgiving and go easy on them.\n\nThis little lady would be endlessly grateful. Furthermore, I have been settled in Tongcheng for some time now. If Mr. Zhou needs anything in the future, you need only give me a call.\"\n\n\"Does this mean that if I don't agree, I'll have rat spirits and hedgehog spirits coming to bother me in the future?\"\n\n\"The Old Mountain Forest is one family.\"\n\n\"Fine. I can release them. Just come back to the bookstore with me.\"\n\n\"Hehehe, this little lady wouldn't dare. Your bookstore is extremely uncanny. I'm afraid I might not be able to leave if I go. That's why I invited your friend over so I could then invite you.\"\n\n\"Then I'll make a call and have them sent over.\"\n\n\"That would be wonderful.\"\n\n\"Mmmph... mmmph...\" The Old Taoist, still on the bed, continued to blissfully grope while mumbling in his sleep, \"Hehehe, to die beneath a peony flower, one becomes a romantic ghost.² But even as a ghost, I can't be like the boss's kind of ghost. That would be so boring. You can't even be romantic if you want to.\"\n\nThe receptionist covered her mouth and giggled softly.\n\nShe deeply empathized.\n\nZhou Ze took a deep breath.\n\nJust as he took out his phone, he looked at the receptionist and asked, \"Can I refuse now?\"\n\n\"Hm?\"\n\n\"I suddenly think it would be fine if you guys just killed this old bastard.\"\n\n***\n\n¹ **Lu Fangweng:** The style name of Lu You, a famous poet from the Song Dynasty. It's used here as a nickname for the Old Taoist.\n² **To die beneath a peony flower, one becomes a romantic ghost:** A famous Chinese saying that means dying in the pursuit of a beautiful woman is a worthy and romantic death.",

    "content": "In the end, Zhou Ze made the call. After all, the old Taoist's life was in her hands. His earlier talk of collecting an \"animal world\" was just an itch he wanted to scratch for fun; there was no real objective behind it.\n\nA salted fish can occasionally flip over when it's bored, but if you ask it to have any long-term plans, that's really too much to ask of it.\n\nBesides, this incident had shown Zhou Ze just how troublesome the old forests of the Northeast were. You catch one, and the rest come out of the mountains one after another to find you. It was truly an endless annoyance.\n\nSitting in the private room, the female receptionist brought him a cup of Longjing tea, then stood generously behind Zhou Ze and began to massage his shoulders.\n\nThe old Taoist had already woken up. He was squatting naked in the corner, hands clasped over his head, a look of utter grievance on his face, like a john caught in a police raid.\n\nBoss Zhou smoked cigarette after cigarette without a word, but this silent atmosphere was what tormented the old Taoist the most.\n\nAnd he had a point. Boss Zhou was indeed a bit displeased. He'd just captured two Great Immortals, and before he could even get them properly settled, he had to give them up.\n\n\"Are you feeling upset?\"\n\nThe female receptionist leaned in close to Zhou Ze's ear and asked softly.\n\nThis fox spirit was truly born with seductive charm. Even Zhou Ze had to admit that she was very attractive.\n\n\"You own this club?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Hehe, yes. It's been open for almost three years. Business has always been good.\"\n\n\"You opened it to make money?\"\n\nZhou Ze suddenly felt that life seemed to be hard even for Great Immortals. Was it because fewer and fewer people were superstitious these days, so the offerings to the immortals had decreased?\n\n\"Make money?\" The female receptionist covered her mouth and chuckled \"hehehe\" for a long time, laughing so hard that tears almost came to her eyes. \"Mr. Zhou, that's a really funny joke you've told.\"\n\n\"People like you and me, would we be short on money?\"\n\n\"...\" said Zhou Ze.\n\nBoss Zhou felt a deep-seated malice from the world.\n\nBefore,\nit was Yingying with her burial antiques,\nOld Xu with his twenty-something properties,\nthe old Taoist with his considerable live-streaming income,\nand the guy who ran the internet cafe across the street was clearly a rich second-generation kid, whose cigarettes cost over a thousand yuan a piece.\n\nAnd now he runs into a fox spirit, and she's rich too?\n\n\"Sister here even ran a brothel over a hundred years ago. Brothels were legal back then, you know.\"\n\n\"If not for money, what are you doing it for?\"\n\n\"Then why do you run a bookstore?\"\n\nZhou Ze fell silent, not knowing how to answer.\n\nThe female receptionist loosened her hair, gestured around, and said:\n\n\"Decadent music fills the ears, orioles and swallows linger about,\nThe love of men and women intertwines, a ceaseless indulgence in sensual pleasures,\nPassion, ah, desire, ah,\nThe ugly, the filthy, the vulgar,\nThe base, the sycophantic, the perverted,\nPeople treat the word 'sex' as a taboo,\nYet they can never leave it, get around it, or bear to part with it.\nWatching, listening, and comprehending here,\nTo cultivate beyond the Three Realms from within the mortal world,¹\nMr. Zhou,\nThis is Sister's path of cultivation.\"\n\nHearing this, Zhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"After the founding of the nation, becoming a spirit was forbidden.\nThe path for demon cultivators is getting harder and harder, and our incense offerings are dwindling. Those old fogeys are still hiding in the old forests like cowards; Sister, for one, looks down on them.\nBut it can't be helped. After all, two hundred years ago, we were all cute little animals.\nEven if the bone is broken, the sinew remains connected. This time, since they've fallen into your hands one after another, the old forest sent someone with a message, so I can't just ignore it. It's such a headache.\"\n\n\"How many more spirits are there in the old forests?\" Zhou Ze asked, a bit curious.\n\n\"Not many, not many at all. Only our old batch still has some power. As for the rest, very few can even achieve sentience.\nHehe, Mr. Zhou, to be perfectly honest, you've caught those old things, and that's that. There's no need to feel guilty or talk about principles. If they deserve to be skinned and have their tendons pulled, then skin them and pull their tendons. If they deserve to have their souls refined, then refine their souls.\nIf that doesn't work, even making them into puppets to serve as your door gods would be perfectly justifiable. Although I was reasoning with you earlier, in reality, there's no reason to be had in this matter.\nYou're strong, you have your methods, you have them dead to rights, so they can only take it.\nThat Eighth Granny and Brother Huang, back when they first became spirits, which of them didn't cause trouble in the forest or even come down the mountain and take human lives? None of them have clean hands or pure hearts.\nLater, when their cultivation level rose and the times changed, they learned to be a bit more reserved, but their fundamental nature is still the same as before.\nIf you don't know those techniques, Sister can teach you. But you have to promise not to use those tricks on Sister. And in the future, if any other clueless spirits come looking for trouble with you, or if you happen to see one, you might as well capture it. Put everything to good use, right?\"\n\nZhou Ze looked at the fox spirit with some surprise and asked, \"Why are you doing this?\"\n\n\"Why?\" The female receptionist hooked her arms around Zhou Ze's neck, her body practically sitting on his lap as she spoke affectionately, \"Sister has taken a fancy to you, is that reason enough?\nThere really aren't many who can remain composed in the face of Sister's powers, so Sister thinks highly of you.\nWith that kind of composure, even if you're just a ghost emissary now, in a few years, maybe ten, you could become a Head Constable or an Inspector. It's even possible you might one day pick up the Judge's Brush and become a Judge.\nRight now, Sister is doing you a favor. When you make it big in the future, don't forget about Sister.\nBesides, Third Brother Huang and Eighth Granny are no pushovers. The fact that you could capture both of them already speaks to your ability.\nThis is a kind of investment for me. Back when Sister was running a brothel in Henan, I invested in Yuan Weiting. It almost succeeded, you know.\"\n\nZhou Ze frowned slightly. Who was Yuan Weiting?\n\nAt that moment, the old Taoist, who had been squatting in the corner without daring to speak, chimed in:\n\"Boss, that's Yuan Shikai.\"\n\nZhou Ze's frown deepened.\n\nThe old Taoist, having just shared his knowledge, wanted to slap himself.\nHe cursed himself internally:\n*Just you and your big mouth,*\n*Just you and your cleverness,*\n*You just couldn't resist showing off, could you!*\n\n\"It's a pity. His fortune was too thin; he couldn't support that yellow robe. He kicked the bucket not long after. Sister almost had the chance to become the mother of the nation.\"\nAs she said this, the female receptionist began to laugh to herself, then started to cry, as if she'd touched upon a painful memory.\n\n\"Where's our boss? I'm here to find our boss!\"\n\n\"Boom! Boom! Boom!\"\n\nA series of loud bangs came from outside.\n\nThe female receptionist got off Zhou Ze, stood up, and walked outside. Zhou Ze followed her, and the old Taoist quickly threw on his robes and went out with them.\n\nBai Yingying stood in the middle of the main hall with a small monkey perched on her shoulder. Around her, five or six security guards lay scattered on the floor.\n\n\"Boss, Yingying is here!\"\n\nThe female receptionist and Zhou Ze happened to walk out just then. The receptionist's gaze first fell on the Yin-Yang Register in the monkey's hands. She pursed her lips, inwardly shocked:\n*No wonder Eighth Granny and Third Brother Huang were both taken down. So it was this thing.*\n\nAt this moment, the way the female receptionist looked at Zhou Ze was completely different. The Yin-Yang Register was an item wielded by a Judge. Don't think for a second that the underworld and hell don't have nepotism.\n\nNow, the female receptionist clearly saw Zhou Ze as an \"underworld princeling,\"\nwho was just serving as a ghost emissary to gild his resume.\n\n\"That thing...\" the female receptionist said, pointing at the Yin-Yang Register in the monkey's hand.\n\nBefore she could finish her sentence,\nYingying shouted, \"What 'thing'? This grand-auntie has plenty of money!\"\n\nWith that, Yingying took out the case she was carrying and began throwing out stacks upon stacks of cash.\n\nAn overwhelming display of wealth!\n\nIt had the same flair as a scene from the movie *God of Gamblers*, with Chow Yun-fat dancing with a girl amidst a flurry of fluttering banknotes.\n\n\"So my boss slept with a few women here, so what? That's your honor!\nTo be graced by my boss's presence is a blessing you couldn't cultivate in several lifetimes!\"\n\nBai Yingying continued to throw money as she yelled.\n\n\"You thought my boss was out of money? That he couldn't pay this little sum?\nI, Yingying, have it! Come on, you want money, don't you? You want to force my boss to pay his debt with a treasure?\nI'm telling you, no way!\nHere's the money, take it!\nBoss, have you had your fun yet? If not, we'll keep going. Have them bring out all the women in the club!\nYou can inspect them one by one. Don't worry, with Yingying here, I'll make sure you get your fill of whoring!\"\n\nZhou Ze took a deep breath and suddenly felt a pain in his liver.\n\nThe female receptionist was also dumbfounded.\n\nThe old Taoist, watching from the side, was practically drooling. He made up his mind that after this was over, he would secretly ask Bai Yingying if she had any sisters in her past life, and where they were buried. He had to dig up a zombie just like Yingying for himself.\n\nShe acts as a maid and a thug, and when you go whoring, she even brings the money to pay the bill!\n\nDamn it,²\nWhy don't I ever meet someone like that?\n\nIn fact, after Zhou Ze had given Bai Yingying the address over the phone, she had asked Old Xu about it and assumed that her boss, just like the old Taoist, had been detained for soliciting a prostitute without the money to pay.\n\n\"Yingying.\"\nZhou Ze beckoned to Bai Yingying.\n\n\"Yes, Boss.\"\nBai Yingying immediately ran over like an obedient little bird, still carrying the large bag.\n\n\"Is this bag full of money?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Ah, not just money. Yingying heard this place might not be very clean, so I brought you the best 'Blue Sprites.' I wasn't sure which flavor you'd like,\nso there's ribbed,\nand chocolate-flavored,\nand ultra-thin.\nOh, and there's lubricant and disinfectant. I also brought a big bottle of Fuyanjie,³ because washing makes you healthier.\"\n\n\"...\" said Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Little sister, I think there might be a misunderstanding between us,\" the female receptionist said at this point.\n\n\"A misunderstanding?\" Bai Yingying froze for a moment, then a look of horror crossed her face. She grabbed the receptionist's arms and started shaking them. \"It absolutely can't be a misunderstanding!\"\n\nShe had been worrying herself sick over her boss's carnal affairs and truly hoped he could prove himself and get on the road normally.\n\n\"Yingying.\"\n\n\"Yes, Boss, I also brought Indian God Oil and Viagra...\"\n\n\"Shut up.\"\n\n\"Mmph...\" Bai Yingying immediately fell silent.\n\nZhou Ze felt a headache coming on. He reached out, took the Yin-Yang Register from the monkey's hand, and handed it to the female receptionist. \"They're inside. You can let them out.\"\n\nThe female receptionist was so frightened she kept backing away, waving her hands. \"Are you joking, sir? This is... this is...\"\n\nThe female receptionist didn't even dare to say the words \"Yin-Yang Register.\"\nThe authority of a Judge of the Underworld was enough to make even mortal demon cultivators keep a wide berth.\n\nZhou Ze shrugged his shoulders\nand said:\n\n\"Well, that brings us to the problem. I don't have an instruction manual for this thing. So far,\nI only know how to put things in.\nI still don't know how to get things out.\"\n\n\"...\" said the female receptionist.\n\n---\n**Footnotes:**\n\n1.  **Three Realms (三界):** A concept in Buddhist and Taoist cosmology, referring to the realms of desire, form, and formlessness that constitute the mortal world (`samsara`).

    "content": "The situation, all of a sudden, became a bit awkward. Zhou Ze was now willing to release the captives, but he truly didn't know how to open the book. The direct consequence of casually opening the Yin-Yang Scroll was getting sucked in himself, and having had that thrilling experience once, Zhou Ze was not keen on a repeat performance.\n\nThe female receptionist massaged her forehead at his side. She had a genuine headache, and from her skill in judging people, she could tell that Zhou Ze wasn't deliberately playing games.\n\nThere was no way. It was just impossible.\n\nNo matter how you sliced it, there was still no way.\n\n\"How about this, Mr. Zhou,\" the female receptionist began, deciding to let him go. \"You promise me that in the future, if you find a way, you will release them. You can go for now.\" In truth, the old Daoist priest had long since regained his freedom. When it came to handling people, the fox spirit was an absolute master.\n\nShe had \"kidnapped\" the old Daoist, but it was the kind of sensual kidnapping that a normal man would find very difficult to get angry about. Moreover, from start to finish, she had been flawless in both word and deed.\n\n\"So if any more great immortals come looking for me, do I have to keep collecting them?\"\n\nBoss Zhou was still a tiny bit reluctant to part with his *Animal World*.\n\n\"I will have a word with the folks in the Old Mountain Forest. They will behave themselves.\"\n\nWith that, the fox spirit walked up to the Yin-Yang Scroll. She didn't dare touch the object, only looking at the small snake and weasel illustrations on the cover from a short distance.\n\nIt seemed she was trying to compose herself, planning to offer them some comfort.\n\nBut as she composed herself, she suddenly burst out laughing with a \"pfft.\" And once she started, she couldn't stop. She bent over, clutching her flat abdomen, the waves on her chest rolling as the black stockings deep within her short skirt flashed tantalizingly in Zhou Ze's direction.\n\n\"Hahahaha... This is killing me! Two hundred years of cultivation, and in the end, you've both become this adorable again.\"\n\nThe small snake and weasel on the cover grew angry, constantly shifting through various expressions. But thanks to the cartoonish rendering, no matter how much rage they displayed, they only ended up looking adorable and goofy.\n\n\"Just stay in there peacefully for a while longer. Think of it as a change of scenery for your secluded cultivation. You used to do it all the time anyway, so it's no big deal. Mr. Zhou has promised me he won't make things difficult for you. When he has the ability in the future, he will let you out.\"\n\nAfter she finished speaking, the female receptionist wiped away her tears. She had genuinely laughed so hard she cried.\n\nZhou Ze turned to leave. The female receptionist handed him a business card, upon which she had purposefully left a lipstick print. The old Daoist priest followed closely behind Zhou Ze. If this were an ordinary club, the old priest wouldn't have minded staying to indulge a little, but he knew full well this was a den of foxes. Ten kidneys wouldn't be enough for what they could do to him.\n\nBai Yingying picked up all the money from the floor, and, huffing and puffing with her large bundle, followed her boss into the elevator. Before the doors closed, she even shook her fist at the fox spirit.\n\nAfter Zhou Ze and his group had left, the female receptionist's smile vanished. She sat down on the sofa, and a well-built female attendant handed her a glass of red wine.\n\n\"Mama, that little girl just now has quite the temper. Even before we sisters gained sentience, none of us were that wild, were we?\"\n\n*Smack!*\n\nThe receptionist flung the red wine in the attendant's face, shot her a look, and said:\n\n\"You have the gall to call her a little girl? She's about the same age as your Mama. And who the hell are you?\"\n\n\"Yes, I was wrong, I was wrong.\"\n\nThe female attendant immediately knelt to admit her mistake.\n\n\"Heh, she was holding back. If she had really gone on a killing spree, do you think you lot could have actually stopped her?\"\n\n\"Yes, ma'am.\"\n\n\"I told you, I brought you all out here so you could cultivate better. If you allow yourselves to become degenerate, that is your fate. If you can't break free, then so be it. This world is vast, truly vast. Men... heh... don't be so pathetic as to only have eyes for a few men.\"\n\n\"Thank you for your teachings, Mama.\"\n\nAll the surrounding attendants, male and female, bowed to the female receptionist.\n\n\"Alright, I'm tired too. Draw a bath for me. I'm going for a soak.\"\n\nThe female receptionist stretched lazily.\n\nAt the same time, she waved her fingers disdainfully.\n\n\"That bunch of old fossils in the forest told me he was just a minor underworld runner. The man has the Yin-Yang Scroll in his hands, is he a *minor* underworld runner?! They nearly tricked me, of all people, into falling into a trap.\"\n\nAt this, the female receptionist couldn't help but feel a lingering fear. If she hadn't always conducted herself in a way that left people with no leverage or weakness to exploit, if she had tried some of her tricks on the old Daoist earlier... like dripping wax, using whips, or severing his tendons to drain his yang qi... it was hard to say if she would still be standing here so securely right now.\n\nThe most important point was that the man named Zhou Ze had appeared confident from beginning to end. This confidence wasn't an act. He truly had a trump card, a trump card that allowed him to disregard hers.\n\n\"Mama, the bath is ready.\"\n\n\"Good.\"\n\nThe female receptionist walked into her own private reserved room. The furnishings inside were antique and elegant, far more luxurious and spacious than the other rooms.\n\nIn the center was a large pool, flanked by rose petals. Layer upon layer of beaded curtains hung down, resembling the boudoir of a noble lady from ancient times.\n\nShe slipped out of her clothes and walked into the bath.\n\nShe needed no one to attend to her.\n\nShe slowly submerged herself.\n\nA pristine, silky white tail floated to the surface. She groomed it meticulously. A woman treasures her face; a fox treasures its tail.\n\nAmidst the swirling mist, having been tense all day, her mood finally began to relax.\n\nAt that moment, the faint sound of a xiao flute drifted from nearby.\n\nThe melody was winding and graceful, like a hand gently stroking the timid deer in your heart.\n\nIf Xu Qinglang had been here, he would have instantly recognized the flute music as the same he'd heard that night. And after the music played, the reanimated corpse that Zhou Ze had already killed suddenly rose again and bit him.\n\nThe female receptionist initially thought it was just a change in the lobby's music, but she soon realized something was wrong. A fox's sixth sense was not to be doubted.\n\nIn an instant, the water's surface erupted.\n\nThe female receptionist, wrapped in a robe, stepped onto the platform.\n\nThe flute music seemed to be playing hide-and-seek with her, at times distant, at times near, making it impossible to pinpoint.\n\n\"Which friend has come to grace my establishment? Please, come out into the open, so that this humble hostess may show you some proper hospitality.\"\n\nThe flute music stopped.\n\nA black silhouette appeared by the door of the private room. The figure was somewhat stooped, its true face hidden, but the jade flute in its hand was dazzlingly conspicuous in the dim light.\n\n\"Heh heh heh... Host you... A slut like you is worthy?\"\n\nThe female receptionist's expression turned cold.\n\nShe was angry.\n\nAlthough she ran this kind of business, given her status and standing, she had long since transcended the trade itself. This person before her was utterly contemptuous!\n\n\"Mountain spirits and rogue cultivators, instead of staying put in the old forest, you love to run around causing trouble. The world's gone to hell, and people aren't what they used to be.\"\n\nAs he spoke, the jade flute suddenly flew up and shot directly at the female receptionist.\n\nThe receptionist held out her hands, blocking the jade flute and sending it back. But in the next moment, her face froze. Her hands had instantly turned a deathly black.\n\n\"Corpse poison!\"\n\n\"You have a keen eye.\"\n\nThe black silhouette once again melted into the darkness.\n\nThe flute music began anew.\n\nOnly this time, it carried a murderous tone, like an ambush from ten sides!\n\nAnd its range began to expand, enveloping the entire club.\n\nIn an instant, male customers who were in the middle of receiving services suddenly noticed their alluring and highly skilled female technicians had all sprouted furry tails.\n\nSome who were drunk or hadn't yet realized what was happening even joked, \"The service here is great, you even provide 'tail plug' service.\"\n\nBut when they saw the technicians' faces also transforming into those of foxes, they immediately screamed in terror.\n\nEven unluckier were those customers in the midst of their carnal endeavors.\n\nThe beauty beneath them had instantly turned into a fox.\n\nAnd the fox herself hadn't realized she had revealed her true form, still chirping and squeaking in concert with the act.\n\nFor the man on top of her...\n\nSurprised?\nThrilled?\nGetting a rise out of it?\n\nIn a flash, the entire club erupted into chaos. The sounds of screaming and crying were endless.\n\nAnd after their initial confusion, the foxes who had revealed their true forms began to bleed from their eyes, ears, mouths, and noses. The male and female attendants at the front desk all collapsed to the ground, clutching their throats and wailing in agony. The female technicians fared no better.\n\nSome of the male customers who had hastily run out even saw the corpses of several foxes in the hallway. The entire club reeked of a musky odor, as if they had stumbled into a fox den.\n\n\"You scoundrel, how dare you harm my disciples and their children!\"\n\nIn the private room, the female receptionist, ignoring her blackened hands, lunged at the black silhouette.\n\n\"Heretics and demons, everyone has the right to execute them!\" a stern cry came from within the black silhouette.\n\nThen, the silhouette took the initiative and lunged at the female receptionist.\n\nThe two met in mid-air.\n\nThe receptionist's claws pierced straight through her opponent's chest.\n\nBut in the next instant, she realized she had pierced nothing but a sheet of human skin. The skin was that of an old man, but moments before, it had looked exquisitely lifelike, just like a real person!\n\nAnd in a flash, the human skin tightened, seeping into the receptionist's arm like sulfuric acid.\n\n\"Ahhhhhhhhhh!!!\"\n\nThe female receptionist let out a blood-curdling scream and fell back into the pool.\n\nThe jade flute descended from the sky, smashing straight down!\n\n*BANG!*\n\nThe floor must have cracked, and the water in the pool began to leak down to the level below.\n\nAnother black silhouette emerged.\n\nHe walked to the edge of the nearly empty pool and saw his jade flute pinned there.\n\nExcept, what was pinned beneath it was not a complete fox, but a long, white fox tail.\n\n\"Tsk, tsk, tsk... A fox severing its tail... You actually managed... to get away.\"\n\nThe black silhouette pulled out the jade flute.\n\nHe reached out and stroked the body of the flute, sighing:\n\n\"It's only been ten years since I left Tongcheng... How did this place become so... wretched and corrupt.\"",

Upon entering the store, he picked up a broom and mop and prepared to head out.\n\n\"Lao Dao, where are you off to?\" Yingying asked, a little curious.\n\n\"To contribute to the creation of a Civilized and Sanitary City. Lucid waters and lush mountains are invaluable assets, you know.\"\n\nSaying this, Lao Dao didn't even dare to look at Zhou Ze and immediately slipped away.\n\nIt was like a game. Don't be fooled by Lao Dao's usual timid and shrinking demeanor in front of Zhou Ze; in reality, he had long since figured out Zhou Ze's temperament. He'd already maxed out his score in this game.\n\nBoss Zhou had a lazy personality and a knife's mouth with a tofu heart.¹ He'd gone out to party and caused trouble this time, angering the boss, but it wasn't a huge problem. He just needed to keep a low profile tonight, and by tomorrow, it would all blow over.\n\nLao Dao, who was always wildly testing the limits on the verge of a 404,² had accumulated a wealth of experience.\n\nIf anyone else had tempted fate as relentlessly as Lao Dao, Boss Zhou would have long since packaged them up and express-shipped them to Hell. The fact that Lao Dao was still alive and kicking was the best proof of this.\n\nIn truth, Zhou Ze wasn't that angry with Lao Dao. The fox spirit had been coming for him in the first place. Even if Lao Dao had been out volunteering instead of partying, he still would have been captured and brought back.\n\nIn the end, the root of the problem was that he'd gotten an itch that night and, having nothing better to do, used the Yin-Yang Register to capture Eighth Great-Aunt. And now, he couldn't release her even if he wanted to.\n\nHe went upstairs to check on Xu Qinglang. Lao Xu was staring at the bug on the coffee table. He was being very cautious about this thick and sturdy object that was about to enter his body.\n\nZhou Ze glanced into the bowl. The egg had hatched, revealing a beetle, crimson all over. It wasn't small, either—about the size of a baby's fist.\n\n\"Mingming will probably be in soon to administer the antidote,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Mm,\" Xu Qinglang nodded.\n\n\"He told me to prepare some things for an enema, just in case.\"\n\n\"What?\" Lao Xu was horrified. Down below, he probably clenched tight as well.\n\n\"This thing has to go in through the back door. You don't expect to swallow it directly, do you? Clean out your backside first; it'll be more comfortable for it, and more comfortable for you.\n\nThink about it, we'll all be here when you're getting the antidote. What if you're lying there, or sitting there, and you just can't hold it in and directly…\n\n*Ahem*, how awkward would that be?\"\n\nEnemas were not unfamiliar to Zhou Ze. They could be used to treat ulcerative colitis, uremia, paralytic ileus, and bronchial asthma, as well as relieve constipation. Of course, most people tended to let their minds wander, turning it into a euphemism for a certain kind of ritual.\n\nLao Xu's mouth hung open.\n\nFrom his expression, Zhou Ze could tell that Lao Xu was probably thinking, \"I'd rather stay a zombie\" than go through with this treatment.\n\n\"That's too much blame for me to carry.\" Qu Mingming had already reached the doorway and heard Zhou Ze's joke. He immediately walked in to set the record straight.\n\nXu Qinglang instantly grabbed Zhou Ze's arm. He had intended to curse him out, but as if by reflex, he simply bared his fangs at Zhou Ze.\n\n\"HROOAR!\"\n\nBecause of the corpse venom, this had almost become an instinct for Xu Qinglang, one that had formed without him even realizing it. He had meant to yell at him.\n\n\"Heh heh.\"\n\nBoss Zhou's expression didn't change.\n\nA joke.\n\nWould Boss Zhou, who slept with a two-hundred-year-old zombie every night, be scared by a fledgling zombie like you?\n\nHe reached out, touched one of Xu Qinglang's fangs, and leaned in for a closer look.\n\n\"These fangs aren't sharp enough. I'll have Yingying buy you a whetstone tomorrow. You should give them a good sharpening.\"\n\nXu Qinglang really, really wanted to devour the guy in front of him in one bite.\n\n\"Alright, I'm going to administer the antidote.\" Qu Mingming picked up the red beetle as if stroking his own little kitten and carefully brought it to Xu Qinglang's face.\n\n\"Good boy. Open your mouth and let it in.\"\n\nXu Qinglang silently opened his mouth and swallowed the beetle.\n\n\"See? You still have me to thank. Originally, you would've found swallowing this bug disgusting, painful, and unacceptable.\n\nBut after my little 'back door' suggestion,\n\ndon't you now feel that swallowing it with your mouth is a truly wonderful and blissful experience?\"\n\n\"...\" Xu Qinglang.\n\nIf the bug weren't still moving around in his stomach, Xu Qinglang really would have climbed out of the tub to fight Zhou Ze for three hundred rounds.\n\n\"Don't be rash. Focus on the antidote. Even as a zombie, you're no match for me. Yingying was so impressive back then, making an entrance like a queen, wasn't she? You don't want me to poke you with my fingernails until you turn into a docile little kitten too, do you?\"\n\nIn the end, Xu Qinglang managed to control his emotions, quietly waiting as the bug traveled through his body, sucking out the venom.\n\n\"This will probably take all night. Let's go. How about a drink downstairs?\" Qu Mingming invited.\n\n\"Alright.\"\n\nZhou Ze went downstairs with Qu Mingming. When Bai Yingying saw Zhou Ze heading toward the internet cafe, she also looked at him expectantly.\n\n\"You can come too,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nIt seemed Qu Mingming, the humanoid cheat, had really given Yingying a taste of victory. Her gaming experience was maxed out.\n\nBut before leaving, Zhou Ze snapped his fingers at the Deathsworn over there.\n\nThe Deathsworn stood up and walked over to Zhou Ze.\n\n\"If anyone or anything you don't recognize tries to go upstairs, stop them.\"\n\nThe Deathsworn silently nodded, walked to the foot of the stairs, and sat down on a step.\n\n\"Where's the monkey?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"He went with Lao Dao to sweep the streets,\" Bai Yingying answered.\n\nZhou Ze said no more and followed Qu Mingming to the internet cafe, to the same office as before.\n\nQu Mingming took out a bottle of *baijiu*, which he said was a medicinal wine he had brewed himself.\n\nZhou Ze raised his glass, took a sip, and nodded.\n\n\"Tastes pretty good.\"\n\nQu Mingming scratched his head, looking a bit dejected.\n\n\"What's wrong?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"I forgot to get any snacks to go with the drinks.\"\n\n\"It's fine, I'm not hungry.\"\n\n\"Mm.\"\n\nQu Mingming stared blankly at the glass in front of him for a moment. The medicinal meal hadn't had any effect on Zhou Ze. This wine, however, had been meticulously brewed and aged with a variety of precious, virility-boosting herbs, plus a tiger's penis.\n\nBut watching Zhou Ze down two glasses with still no reaction, Qu Mingming fell into a deep state of self-doubt.\n\nIt was like a mountaineer who enjoys the challenge of a peak yet unconquered.\n\nAs a doctor,\n\nwhen faced with a patient who was incomprehensible or, you could say, beyond saving,\n\nthe ingrained habit of having to solve the problem, no matter how difficult, constantly spurred him on, and at the same time, tormented him.\n\nQu Mingming's thoughts turned.\n\nHe was a healer; treating humans and beasts was common sense. But in all of history, he was likely one of the few doctors who could treat a ghost. What a tremendous honor, what a grand experiment this was.\n\nAs he thought about it,\n\na heroic spirit surged within him.\n\nQu Mingming subconsciously raised his own glass,\n\nand drained it in one gulp.\n\nA hot current flowed down his throat,\n\nand with extreme ferocity, converged in that unspeakable place below his waist.\n\nOnly then did Qu Mingming realize,\n\nhe had just drunk the wine he'd specially prepared for Zhou Ze.\n\nIn an instant,\n\nQu Mingming's face turned beet red. He shot up from his chair and rushed out of the office. He had to go upstairs and mix a remedy for himself to counteract this state of arousal.\n\nWatching Qu Mingming flee in disarray,\n\nZhou Ze smiled.\n\nHe raised his glass,\n\nand took another sip. The wine was mellow and fragrant, with a lingering aftertaste.\n\n\"Still so young. What a lightweight, can't even handle one glass.\"\n\n...\n\nBack in the bookstore, it was now very quiet. The Deathsworn sat alone on the stairs, motionless.\n\n*Whoosh...*\n\nIt seemed a wind had kicked up.\n\nThe Deathsworn slowly stood up.\n\nHe seemed somewhat dazed, a bit bewildered.\n\nIt was as if he had sensed something,\n\nyet at the same time, as if he had noticed nothing at all.\n\nThen,\n\nhe began to walk.\n\nHe ascended the stairs.\n\nHe would unconditionally carry out the task his father had given him, although, in the past few months, his father had only given him one task: to clean.\n\nIn the bathtub, Xu Qinglang's expression alternated between pain and relief. The feeling of a bug crawling around inside your body was truly beyond description.\n\nAt the same time, the ghastly green hue on his face was slowly fading, and his fangs were gradually receding. Clearly, the corpse venom was being continuously drawn out.\n\nFinally,\n\nXu Qinglang clutched his own throat and dry-heaved several times. A bug, now swollen to several times its original size, was spat out from his mouth.\n\nOnce crimson, it was now pitch-black. It didn't die after hitting the floor but wobbled over to a corner and squeezed into it.\n\nAt that moment, Xu Qinglang had no energy left to clean up. He leaned against the side of the tub, taking deep breaths.\n\nThe feeling of being human again...\n\nit was so good.\n\nBy the windowsill, a piece of paper as thin as a cicada's wing slipped in through a crack. It fluttered up gracefully, like a painting, and hung itself before Xu Qinglang.\n\nIt was a human skin. Whether it was made from real human skin was unknown, but it was exquisitely lifelike.\n\nIt depicted a beautiful young woman with red lips, white teeth, and an entrancing gaze.\n\nXu Qinglang, who had been drowsily planning to take a nap, saw this and his body shuddered violently. His hands gripped the edge of the tub, his eyes wide with disbelief at the scene before him!\n\n\"Master...\"\n\n\"You've truly disappointed me...\"\n\nThe woman's form spoke with a man's voice, raspy and ancient.\n\n\"Master, you've returned? Is it really you, Master?\" A look of joyous surprise appeared on Xu Qinglang's face.\n\n\"Yes, I've returned. But how is it that you've made no progress at all since I left?\" the old voice sounded again.\n\n\"I... Master... After you left, I started a new life. My cooking skills are very good now. I can cook for you, Master. Just let me rest a bit, and I'll let you taste my cooking.\"\n\n\"Foolish!\"\n\nA sharp rebuke echoed.\n\nXu Qinglang immediately fell silent.\n\n\"Back then, I saw your aptitude and passed my Daoist arts on to you. I thought I was leaving behind a promising seedling, something to look forward to.\n\nAnd the result?\n\nThe result you show me is this?\n\nI return,\n\nand the promising seedling I was hoping for has become a cook?\"\n\n\"Master...\"\n\n\"Do not call me Master.\"\n\n\"Master, your disciple has disappointed you. This is the path I have chosen for myself. I feel this is the life that suits me...\"\n\n\"Your life? Are you worthy of the sacrifices I made for you?\"\n\n\"Master... I'm not wor...\"\n\n\"Are you worthy of the pains I took back then to enlighten you, to have you learn the art of Painted Skin Soul-Luring, by deliberately arranging for your parents to die in an accident just to stimulate you!\n\nTo set you on the right path, to ensure you had no worldly ties, I made your parents die, made you an orphan so you could cultivate with a single mind, and one day promote the righteous path, slaying demons and defending the Dao!\n\nAfter all my painstaking efforts,\n\nare you worthy of them?\"\n\n***\n**Footnotes:**\n¹ *Knife's mouth with a tofu heart*: A common Chinese idiom equivalent to \"his bark is worse than his bite,\" describing someone who speaks harshly but is actually soft-hearted.\n² *On the verge of a 404*: A modern Chinese slang term referencing the \"404 Not Found\" internet error code.

    "content": "Qu Mingming's breathing grew faster and faster. He could feel the changes becoming more and more obvious. At this point, he was already on the verge of losing control.\n\nDamn it,\n\nWhy was *he* so calm and composed after drinking it!\n\nQu Mingming had originally thought the drug wasn't potent enough, but now he was feeling a bit of retroactive fear.\n\nAs a doctor, especially a doctor of traditional Chinese medicine, prescribing medicine is all about balance and harmony. One would never resort to a potent drug unless it was absolutely necessary. But the effects of this dose had clearly reached the absolute limit of what an ordinary person could endure.\n\nIf Zhou Ze were an ordinary person, something would have definitely gone wrong by now.\n\nThere was no time to brew an antidote. Qu Mingming selected a few medicinal herbs and put them directly into his mouth to chew. At the same time, he lifted the curtain to his \"workshop,\" revealing many small jars inside, containing all sorts of *Gu*-insects.\n\nHe took out a jar. Inside was a soft, limp insect that looked like a caterpillar. Without a word, Qu Mingming stuck his arm inside and pressed his finger directly onto the insect.\n\nIts body provoked, the insect immediately had a reflexive reaction and bit Qu Mingming's finger.\n\nAn icy sensation instantly spread through his entire body,\n\nbut Qu Mingming found it exceptionally comfortable.\n\nThe fiery heat in his body was finally suppressed.\n\n\"Detestable... and yet...\"\n\nA voice suddenly rang out.\n\n\"Who's there!\"\n\nThe hairs on Qu Mingming's body suddenly stood on end. This was the third floor of his internet cafe, his personal forbidden ground. In a martial arts novel, this would be the equivalent of a place for secluded cultivation.\n\nHow could an outsider get here so easily?\n\nDid they really think all the *Gu*-insects just sat in their jars like good little babies?\n\n\"What's detestable is that you would actually use a lowly method like *Gu* cultivation,\n\nand yet,\n\nthe methods you use on yourself are from the purest school of ancient Chinese medicine.\"\n\nA black figure slowly emerged from within the wall. Its true appearance couldn't be seen clearly, but it was tangibly present.\n\n\"Senior, may I ask who you are?\"\n\nDoctors weren't considered people of the *Jianghu*,¹ but the special nature of their profession meant they often had to deal with figures from all walks of life.\n\nBesides, after the experience of being intimidated by a room full of *jiangshi* at the bookstore, Qu Mingming's mental fortitude had clearly improved quite a bit. At the very least, he could remain steady when encountering strange things now.\n\n\"In ancient times, medicine and *Gu* were one and the same. Doctors also served as shamans and diviners.\n\nAfter the time of the Yellow Emperor, doctors, conscious of their status, abandoned these mixed practices to focus solely on the medical path of healing the sick and saving lives. Things like *Gu*-insects were long since discarded as dregs.\n\nBut you, junior,\n\nhave actually gone and picked it back up.\n\nNo matter how useful *Gu*-insects are, they are ultimately a heterodox practice. This old man will offer you a word of advice: turn back soon. With your aptitude, you have the chance to become a Great Physician of the Nation. Do not be led astray by heterodox paths.\n\nThe disciple this old man took on ten years ago was also an excellent prospect for carrying on my teachings. Who knew that ten years later, he'd become a good chef.\n\nYou must not follow in his footsteps!\n\nThe righteous path in the human world is one of vicissitudes.²\n\nWe who walk the righteous path should naturally focus on the future of the righteous path and preserve our own integrity.\"\n\nThe black figure spoke eloquently, saying a great deal in the manner of an elder.\n\nFor a moment, Qu Mingming was a bit dumbfounded. In his view, this guy before him was unbelievably foolish, like an old pedant. *The Way has no form, but skills have their specializations.* He could use *Gu*-insects to cure illnesses just the same; the methods were different, but the goal was the same. What need was there for him to be running his mouth off here?\n\nBut Qu Mingming still clasped his hands in a fist-and-palm salute, saying very respectfully:\n\n\"This junior accepts your teachings.\"\n\n\"Mm, the boy is teachable. This old man left Tongcheng for ten years, only to find that it has now become so foul and corrupt. Evil spirits run rampant, and demonic creatures have appeared.\n\nFor now,\n\nthis old man has no time to deal with you. I only hope you will conduct yourself accordingly.\n\nFurthermore,\n\ntonight this old man will purge the demonic miasma and restore a clear sky to this Tongcheng. You are to stay here tonight and not go out. Otherwise, don't blame this old man for being discourteous.\"\n\nQu Mingming was startled.\n\nInstinctively,\n\nwhen the black figure spoke of purging the demonic miasma, he thought of the bookstore across the street. There were several *jiangshi* over there.\n\nBut at this moment,\n\nQu Mingming could only lower his head and agree.\n\nIt's human instinct to be wise and protect oneself. Qu Mingming had only known the people at the bookstore for a few days; naturally, he had no intention of risking his life to protect them.\n\nHe could only hope,\n\nthey would make it through this crisis safely.\n\n\"You're sensible enough.\"\n\nThe black figure sank back into the wall and vanished.\n\nQu Mingming sat down on the floor,\n\nhis expression...\n\na little desolate.\n\n***\n\n\"*Geji geji geji... geji geji!*\nAuntie's sweeping the road!\n*Geji geji geji... geji geji!*\nIkkyū is hiding!³\"\n\nLao Dao hummed the nonsensical song as he swept the road. By rights, this should have been the sanitation workers' job for the next morning. Lao Dao was, in a way, lightening their burden.\n\nOf course,\n\nif the sanitation workers saw a nearly seventy-year-old man helping them sweep the road, their first reaction probably wouldn't be to burst into tears of gratitude, but to wonder if the old man was using it as a pretext to stage an extortion scam.⁴\n\nThe little monkey sat on Lao Dao's shoulder. Lao Dao had bought it a small backpack, which was filled with snacks, dried fruits, and other such things.\n\nLao Dao was truly fond of the monkey. Having no children of his own, he really was raising the monkey like his own grandson.\n\nIn the bookstore, the monkey naturally disliked Boss Zhou, but it was extremely affectionate with Lao Dao.\n\nWhen it came to repaying kindness,\n\nbeasts were sometimes indeed more reliable than people.\n\nAt that moment, the little monkey was shelling peanuts, eating one itself and then stuffing one into Lao Dao's mouth.\n\nOne man and one monkey,\n\nenjoying each other's company,\n\nsweeping the road.\n\nEven late at night like this, it was a warm and happy scene.\n\nAs he swept,\n\nthe wind picked up.\n\nThen, from somewhere, a great heap of trash was blown over.\n\n\"Shit!\"\n\nLao Dao shook his head helplessly. Most of his recent efforts had just been wasted.\n\nThen again, with just him and a single broom, his efforts were a drop in the ocean—not just for the city, but even for this one street.\n\nThe monkey, who was eating peanuts, suddenly trembled, and the peanut in its little paw fell to the ground.\n\n\"Are you trying to make trouble for me too, you little rascal?\"\n\nLao Dao said irritably.\n\nThe monkey grabbed Lao Dao's ears with both its fleshy paws and turned his face to the left. Lao Dao looked in that direction.\n\nUnder the dim yellow light of a streetlamp,\n\na stooped figure was slowly approaching.\n\nThat gust of wind had centered on him, like how important characters always make their entrance with scattered flower petals and a gust of wind.\n\n\"Shit, what the hell is this?\"\n\nLao Dao had served two ghost bosses. He who often walks by the river... oh no, that's not it. He who is near ink gets stained black... that's not right either. In short, Lao Dao was no longer the uninitiated bumpkin he once was; his sensitivity to certain auras had become much sharper than before.\n\nHe could feel,\n\nthat this figure, approaching step by step, was anything but ordinary.\n\nSubconsciously,\n\nhe reached into his crotch,\n\nand pulled out a bright yellow talisman, on which were stuck several curly black hairs.\n\n\"Heh heh.\"\n\nThe stooped figure let out a soft laugh.\n\n\"Your ancestors were once illustrious, but their descendants are a disappointment, actually consorting with evil demons and monstrous creatures. Truly a disgrace to your forefathers, a disgrace to your forefathers!\"\n\n\"I'll fuck your ancestors' mothers!\"\n\nLao Dao yelled back.\n\n\"Hmph. For your ancestors' sake, you may leave. Conduct yourself properly in the future and walk the righteous path. Although you are advanced in years and have no further prospects on the path of cultivation, you can at least stay away from evil spirits and preserve your integrity. Otherwise, when you go to hell in the future, how will you have the face to see your ancestors?\"\n\n\"I've got a VIP pass to Hell, so you don't need to worry about me!\"\n\nLao Dao knew full well the principle of never losing one's bravado, even in defeat.\n\nBut in the next moment,\n\na few fallen leaves suddenly flew over, striking sparks as they scraped several grooves into the ground in front of Lao Dao. Cracks appeared in the hard asphalt of the road.\n\n\"*Hiss...*\"\n\nThe hand holding the talisman,\n\ntrembled slightly.\n\nFucking hell,\n\nusing fallen leaves like throwing knives? Are you from the *God of Gamblers* school or something, using playing cards as bullets?\n\n\"You think that's enough to scare me?\"\n\nLao Dao took a step forward.\n\nHe was naturally a handsome man, with the bearing of an immortal sage; otherwise, he wouldn't have been so popular during his livestreams.\n\nAt this very moment,\n\nLao Dao's sleeves fluttered,\n\nhis feathered cap stood tall.\n\nHe had the air of one who would say, 'Though I face ten thousand, I will go forth!'\n\nThe monkey on Lao Dao's shoulder also began to drum on his cap—*dong dong dong*—as if beating a war drum to cheer him on.\n\nA trace of appreciation appeared in the stooped figure's gaze.\n\nHe said softly:\n\n\"So you do have a bit of courage...\"\n\nBut in the next instant,\n\nLao Dao suddenly put on a thoughtful expression:\n\n\"I've suddenly realized there's some truth to what you said. This humble Taoist should indeed preserve his integrity. Thank you for your guidance. This humble Taoist will now set off to wander the world. We shall meet again if fate wills it!\"\n\nWith that, Lao Dao turned to flee.\n\nHe knew his own limits. He really wasn't very good at fighting. He wasn't afraid of brawling with ordinary people, but an old monster of this caliber should be left for the Boss and the others to handle. His greatest contribution was to protect his own useful self so he could continue to serve the Boss.\n\nBut who would have thought,\n\nthe stooped figure suddenly flashed,\n\nappearing directly in Lao Dao's path, blocking his escape.\n\n\"What're you doing!\"\n\nLao Dao was so scared he skidded to a halt.\n\n\"You can go.\n\n*It* must stay.\n\nWhen a demonic creature appears in the world, it is the duty of all who walk the righteous path to execute it!\"\n\nLao Dao stopped walking.\n\nThe monkey, terrified, gripped the clothes on Lao Dao's shoulders tightly. It was worried Lao Dao would abandon it.\n\nThis brought back some unpleasant memories from its previous life.\n\n\"You want this humble Taoist's monkey?\" Lao Dao roared. \"Then this humble Taoist wants your balls!\"\n\nNo more running!\n\nIf we run, we run together!\n\nTo abandon the monkey and run alone,\n\nLao Dao couldn't do such a thing!\n\nThe Old Taoist who had always called himself, \"If Heaven had not given birth to me, Lu Fangweng, the eternal path of cowardice would be like an endless night,\"⁵\n\nhad finally found his backbone today.\n\n\"Heh heh. Then you can die with it. Those who refuse to see the light are as guilty as the demons themselves.\"\n\nThe monkey pulled the Yin-Yang Scroll out of its little backpack,\n\nand began to squeak, \"*Zhi zhi zhi*,\" at the stooped figure.\n\nThat's right,\n\nBoss Zhou's Yin-Yang Scroll was still with the monkey.\n\nThis was just Boss Zhou's style—to entrust such an important magical artifact to a monkey for safekeeping.\n\nOnly a \"salted fish\"⁶ like Zhou could be so capricious.\n\n\"Hahahaha...\"\n\nSeeing the monkey holding the Yin-Yang Scroll towards him, the stooped figure burst out laughing.\n\nHe pointed at the monkey and said:\n\n\"Using the register of a former dynasty to arrest an official of the present one? My, what impressive authority you wield, Your Excellency.\"\n\n***\n**Footnotes:**\n1.  ***Jianghu*** (江湖): Literally \"rivers and lakes,\" it refers to the world of martial artists, vagabonds, and the criminal underworld, operating by its own code of ethics outside of mainstream society.\n2.  **\"The righteous path in the human world is one of vicissitudes\"** (人間正道是滄桑): A line from a famous poem by Mao Zedong, meaning the correct path is often difficult and full of hardship.\n3.  **\"*Geji geji...*\"**: A nonsensical parody of the theme song from the popular 1970s anime *Ikkyū-san*. *Geji* (割雞) literally means \"to cut a chicken.\"\n4.  **Extortion scam**: The term used is *pèngcí* (碰瓷), a type of scam where a person feigns injury in an accident to demand compensation.\n5.  **\"If Heaven had not given birth to me...\"**: A self-deprecating parody of the line, \"If Heaven had not given birth to me, Li Bai, the Way of the Sword would be like an endless night.\" The character replaces the famed poet Li Bai with another poet, Lu Fangweng (likely due to his own surname being Lu), and replaces \"Way of the Sword\" (*jiàn dào*) with \"path of cowardice\" (*sǒng dào*).\n6.  **\"Salted fish\"** (鹹魚): Chinese internet slang for someone who is lazy, apathetic, and has no ambition, content to just lie around like a salted fish.",

    "content": "\"Whoa, this guy has an AWM. I'm taking it. You get 100% headshots with the 98K anyway.\"\n\nStaring at the computer screen, Bai Yingying spoke, unable to contain her joy, then swiftly looted the body as if afraid Qu Zhenzhen would change her mind.\n\nIn truth, Qu Zhenzhen playing games with Bai Yingying was rather like a royal tutor accompanying the crown prince in his studies.\n\nA Jiangshi suddenly appears before you.\nBetween being eaten by it and playing a game with it, which do you choose?\nAnyone in their right mind would know which to choose.\n\nFor Qu Zhenzhen, the game was truly of little interest. Hearing, controls, dynamic visual tracking—she could already perform at a level that exceeded the limits of ordinary people, so naturally, there was no challenge to it.\n\nBut just as she killed another lone survivor on the screen with a single headshot,\nshe suddenly found that the screen in front of her had gone black.\n\nDid the computer malfunction?\n\nShe immediately looked to her right,\nonly to find the seat beside her empty.\n\nShe stood up and scanned her surroundings.\nThe internet cafe, which should have been bustling at this hour, was now completely empty, and all the computer screens were black.\n\nQu Zhenzhen stood up. She first ran to the office and found no one there. Then she ran upstairs and found that her brother wasn't there either.\n\nShe started to shout.\nShe started to scream.\nBut she received no response.\n\nIt was as if she were the only person left in the world.\n\nThat terror,\nthat helplessness,\nthat suffocating sense of isolation, was like a swarm of venomous snakes, ceaselessly gnawing at her heart.\n\n...\n\n\"A person's eyes are the purest things in this world; they can see through all illusions.\nA person's hands, a person's hearing, a person's sense of smell—they are all the same. They are the means by which you came to know the world as a child.\nTherefore,\nto use Gu worms to replace your own eyes, to replace your own ears, to replace your own hands—to cast aside real pearls and use those lowly, disgusting insects to perceive the world—\nis, in itself, a laughable case of forsaking the essential for the trivial.\"\n\nA dark shadow appeared beside Qu Zhenzhen. The internet cafe was still bustling, filled with the clamor of voices. Many were shouting loudly, clearly engrossed in their games.\n\nA talisman was pressed against Qu Zhenzhen's chest.\nIt was a very simple paper talisman.\nIt was plain, not the least bit ornate, and emitted no energy fluctuations whatsoever. In terms of quality, it was even inferior to the old Taoist's heirloom talismans.\nIt would have a hard time suppressing a god, a human soul, or a ghost, but it could easily suppress insects.\n\n*A single leaf can block one's sight.*¹\nThat,\nis precisely what it means.\n\nAnd at this moment, Qu Zhenzhen could only remain immersed in the illusion brought on by the talisman. Because the worms inside her body had been deceived, she, too, was deceived.\n\nThe way to break the illusion was actually quite simple: temporarily stop using the worms to perceive the outside world and open her own eyes to see for herself. That would have been enough.\nBut she didn't.\nThe more critical the situation,\nthe more she trusted the power her worms could provide.\n\nThe dark shadow shook its head. \"Not a bad cauldron,² heh.\"\n\nThe shadow then turned to look at Bai Yingying. Bai Yingying frowned slightly; she seemed to have sensed something. But just as she turned her head to look at Qu Zhenzhen beside her,\nthe sound of a flute,\nsuddenly rang out!\n\nThe flute's sound was very close, as if it were being played right against her eardrums. The notes seemed to transform into sharp daggers, piercing directly into the depths of Bai Yingying's heart.\n\n\"Boss!\"\n\nUnder the torment of the flute's song, Bai Yingying felt her vision begin to blur. Many things became indistinct, even Qu Zhenzhen beside her, whom she could no longer see clearly. She only felt the person continuously distorting—of course, everything in her line of sight was distorting.\n\nStretching,\nextending,\nbending,\nthe world around her seemed to have become a giant funhouse mirror.\n\nNausea,\ndizziness,\na pain like being torn apart, washed over her like a tidal wave, frantically submerging her. She couldn't even manage to stick her head out for another breath of air.\n\nThis was despair.\nLike a giant罩子,³\nburying you completely from the very start!\n\nBai Yingying stumbled and fell to her knees. She instinctively covered her ears, but it was useless. The flute's song continued to resound in her heart, tormenting her again and again.\n\n\"Boss...\"\n\nBai Yingying remembered that the Boss was in the office. She had to check on him; she was afraid he was in danger too.\n\nStaggering back to her feet, Bai Yingying stumbled toward the office.\n\nThe dark shadow stood right beside Bai Yingying.\nThe flute's song continued.\nHowever, as Bai Yingying neared the office, the dark shadow let out a sound of \"surprise and doubt.\"\nThat under the torment of his flute, this Jiangshi could still hold fast to her conviction was somewhat unexpected.\n\nOn the office door were three paper talismans: one red, one purple, and one black. When posted on the door together, they effectively isolated the inside from the outside.\nThe person inside could not sense anything happening outside; it seemed as if everything was normal.\n\n\"He is a Hell Tally, an enforcer of the Underworld's order. He gets to live because he is useful.\nYou, an evil Jiangshi...\nwhat use is there in keeping you around?\"\n\nThe jade flute flew over and struck Bai Yingying squarely in the chest.\nPreviously, in the face of the jade flute, the fox spirit receptionist had only managed a desperate escape by severing her own tail. How could Bai Yingying, whose mind was completely focused on the Boss's safety, possibly compare?\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nBai Yingying was sent flying, crashing heavily onto the floor.\n\n\"Roar!\"\n\nBai Yingying let out a furious roar.\n\n\"Who is it! Who is it! I'll eat you! I'll tear you to pieces!\"\n\nBai Yingying frantically looked around, her face filled with rage.\n\n\"You? You think you're worthy?\"\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nThe jade flute appeared once more, striking Bai Yingying again before she could even react.\n\n\"Crash...\"\n\nThe window on one side of the internet cafe was shattered as Bai Yingying was thrown through it, landing on the dimly lit road below.\nThe people playing games inside the cafe seemed not to have heard a thing. Only one person muttered to himself with some confusion, \"Was that thunder outside?\"\n\n\"Boss! Boss! Watch out for a sneak attack! Watch out for the flute!\"\n\nBai Yingying climbed up from the road, the corpse qi from her body erupting so violently that the nearby streetlights shattered in an instant.\nShe was trying to tell Zhou Ze that there was an ambush, that someone was attacking the bookstore.\n\n\"Heh.\"\n\nThe dark shadow attacked again. The jade flute, like a phantom, materialized before Bai Yingying once more.\n\n\"This physique... not bad. It must have been nurtured for a long time. Instead of乖乖地⁴ hiding in the deep mountains and old forests to continue your cultivation, you dare to appear so brazenly in a bustling city. Do you really think we of the righteous path are nowhere to be found?\"\n\n\"Roar!\"\n\nThis time,\nBai Yingying seized the jade flute with both hands, preventing it from striking her as it had before.\nBut the dark shadow instantly closed in on Bai Yingying and shot upwards, slapping two talismans onto the backs of her hands.\n\n\"Heaven and Earth without limit, Righteous Art of the Mystic Heart, summon lightning!\"\n\nBai Yingying looked at the two talismans on the backs of her hands and subconsciously tried to swat them away. But for some reason, her hands wouldn't release their grip on the jade flute; they felt as if they were glued to it.\n\n\"Sizzle! Sizzle!\"\n\nTwo bolts of lightning erupted,\nstirring up clouds of dust and smoke.\n\nAfter the smoke cleared,\nBai Yingying was kneeling on the ground, her arms hanging limply at her sides. Her once delicate and fair hands were now charred black.\n\nThe dark shadow attacked again.\nHe had thought Bai Yingying would resign herself to capture,\nbut in the next moment,\nBai Yingying shot to her feet and began to charge madly toward the building that housed the internet cafe. She was aiming for one of the building's support pillars.\n\nShe could sense it.\nThe Boss was in the internet cafe, in that office. But she didn't know what method this person had used to prevent the Boss from sensing her calls and warnings.\n*I can't let him get ambushed.*\n*I have to warn the Boss!*\n\n\"Insolent!\"\n\nThe dark shadow instantly shifted its position, appearing in Bai Yingying's path. The jade flute thrust forward, pushing two more identical talismans toward her.\nWith her arms hanging uselessly, Bai Yingying's running form looked somewhat comical. Her aura was already in disarray. The jade flute was imbued with an extremely potent righteous energy, the very nemesis of the baleful energy within her.\n\nAnd yet,\neven so,\nBai Yingying continued to charge with an uncoordinated gait toward that pillar, toward the dark shadow blocking her way.\n\nShe was going to knock down the pillar.\nThat way, the Boss upstairs would surely be alerted.\nThere was something wrong with that flute song.\nShe absolutely could not let the Boss fall for its trick!\n\n\"You don't know... when you're beaten!\"\n\nThe jade flute struck Bai Yingying's body once more, and the two lightning talismans were triggered simultaneously. For a moment, countless snakes of lightning danced across Bai Yingying's body. Cracks appeared all over her skin, and drops of her Jiangshi blood fell to the ground.\n\n\"How much cunning can a beast possess? It only serves to... hmm?\"\n\nThe dark shadow's form froze.\nFrom within the dust, a girl with disheveled hair opened her mouth, revealing two terrifying fangs, and bit down on the jade flute with hysterical desperation. Then, the immense inertia of her body carried her forward.\nThe dark shadow was shattered on impact,\ndissolving into a flurry of human skin fragments.\n\nBut the jade flute, clamped in Bai Yingying's teeth, suddenly emitted a cyan glow, and streams of cyan fire began to burn across her body.\n\nNot far away,\na new dark shadow began to coalesce.\nIt was merely a sheet of human skin.\nHe,\nhad plenty more.\n\nThe dark shadow didn't move again.\nIt just watched as the burning girl continued to stumble toward the pillar.\nIn the shadow's eyes,\nthis Jiangshi had gone mad.\n\nFinally,\nBai Yingying reached the pillar.\nBut she had no strength left.\nThe baleful energy in her body was rapidly draining away.\nBesides her wounds, the skin elsewhere on her body was also rapidly cracking and wrinkling.\n\nBut in the end,\nshe still made it to the pillar.\nShe no longer had the strength to knock it down.\nBut she stubbornly lifted her forehead and, with her very last bit of strength,\n\n*thud*\n\nstruck it with everything she had left.\n\nThe pillar didn't collapse, nor did it crack. The building didn't even shake. The force, equivalent to a normal person's slap, meant nothing to the pillar or the building as a whole.\n\nThen,\nher body slid down against the pillar,\nand she collapsed in a heap.\n\n...\n\nIn the office,\nZhou Ze, holding a glass of wine, suddenly gasped.\nHe set the glass down and clutched his chest tightly with his left hand.\nHe had clearly eaten his own heart,\nbut right now,\nit suddenly began to throb with excruciating pain.\nIt hurt so much,\nhe couldn't even breathe...\n\n***\n\n**Footnotes:**\n1.  **一葉障目 (yī yè zhàng mù):** A Chinese idiom meaning to be so focused on a minor detail that one fails to see the bigger picture.\n2.  **爐鼎 (lú dǐng):** Literally \"cauldron\" or \"furnace.\" In this context, it refers to a person used as a vessel or tool by another practitioner to advance their own cultivation or power, often in a parasitic or exploitative way.\n3.  **罩子 (zhàozi):** A cover, shield, or bell jar.

    "content": "On an asphalt road in the countryside, a young man was riding his bicycle home, a schoolbag on his back.\n\nThe young man wore a blue shirt and jeans. He had a short buzz cut and no excessive accessories; in an era where the *shamate*¹ trend was all the rage, he seemed a bit too simple.\n\nBut the young man was handsome, quite refined, somewhat resembling the members of the Korean boy bands that would become a sensation in the country a few years later. Except those Korean male idols had to wear makeup for the camera to accentuate their androgynous charm, whereas the young man had no need for such things. This was his natural state.\n\nBeside him, several other bicycles rode up. The leader was a long-haired guy with ridiculously exaggerated bangs.\n\n\"Little Xu, your back looks so good, you know? Better than the prettiest girl in our class, hahahaha!\"\n\n\"Yeah, damn. I was riding behind you just fine, but then I saw your back and it got me hard. Now I don't even know how to ride my bike.\"\n\n\"Right, right, make Little Xu take responsibility for you. Have him help you cool off.\"\n\n\"They say all women are the same with the lights off. With Little Xu, you don't even need to turn off the lights to think he's no different from a woman.\"\n\nThe young man called Little Xu kept riding his bicycle, paying no mind to the words of those around him.\n\nHe was already used to it.\n\nFrom kindergarten until now.\n\nHe was used to it, and he had learned to ignore it, so that these flies wouldn't affect his mood.\n\nBut just then, someone next to him deliberately swerved his bike, forcibly blocking Little Xu's way.\n\n\"What are you doing?\" Little Xu asked with a frown.\n\n\"What am I doing? You ran into me, and you're asking me what I'm doing?\"\n\nWith that, the boy got off his bike and grabbed Little Xu's shoulder.\n\n\"Damn, you even smell good. You must be wearing perfume. I mean, what's the point? A perfectly good man, making himself up like a woman.\n\n\"Since you want to be a woman, I'll let you experience what it feels like to be one!\"\n\nThe provocation...\n\n...was really just an excuse.\n\nTeenagers of this age have no intuitive concept of doing evil. No, to be precise, they have no clear understanding of the potential consequences of their actions.\n\nAnd because of that...\n\n...they act with even more impunity.\n\nBesides, in their eyes, and even in the eyes of the public, bullying a girl would earn them a bad reputation if it got out, but bullying a guy didn't seem to matter.\n\n\"Let go of me. Get lost!\"\n\n\"Ooh, feisty, are we!\"\n\nThe boys started fighting—of course, it was several against one. Little Xu was quickly pinned to the ground. The boys' hands began to wander over his body without restraint. He clenched his teeth, silently enduring it all.\n\nFortunately,\n\nat this age, not many had truly developed a taste for the cut sleeve.² These boys were just getting their handsy kicks, having a bit of fun, and then they each got on their bikes and went home.\n\nLittle Xu stood up, straightened his clothes, and picked up his bicycle. He was very calm. Being bullied a little wasn't something to make a fuss over. This was life, the life of an ordinary person.\n\n\"It's not your fault you look like a woman.\"\n\nAn old voice came from behind him.\n\nThe young man paused, glancing back. It was an old farmer wearing Liberation shoes, his coat bearing several distinct patches.\n\nThe young man ignored the old man, got on his bike, and prepared to head home.\n\n\"Don't you want the power to protect yourself?\" the old man continued to ask.\n\n\"Are you going to teach me the Eighteen Dragon-Subduing Palms?\" the young man retorted. \"My parents are waiting for me to come home for dinner. I don't have time for you.\"\n\nAt the time, Stephen Chow's movie *Kung Fu Hustle* was a massive hit, and some of its jokes and gags were widely known.\n\nThe old man stood where he was,\n\nwatching the young man's receding figure on the bicycle,\n\nand mused:\n\n\"Oh. So if your parents were dead, you'd have the time for me then.\"\n\nThe next day,\n\nthe young man was called out of class by his paternal uncle from the village, who told him the news that his parents had drowned in the fishpond.\n\nThe young man's parents were part of an enterprising generation, especially in a rural area like this. Having the guts to take out a loan, buy land, and start a large-scale aquaculture farm was not something an ordinary person would dare to do.\n\nThe story was that while tidying up the fishpond, his mother had fallen in first. When his father went in to pull her out, he fell in too. The two of them, both excellent swimmers, had died just like that, inexplicably.\n\nLeaving the young man all alone.\n\nIn a daze, he began to arrange the funeral with the help of so-called friends, relatives, and fellow villagers. The young man was like a string puppet, manipulated into doing all the things a \"filial son\" was supposed to do.\n\nKowtowing,\n\nsmashing the funerary jar,\n\nreturning the bows,\n\nwearing sackcloth and mourning.\n\nThe only silver lining was that his parents' loans had been more or less paid off over the past two years. The awkward thing was, just as the aquaculture business had recouped its costs and was about to turn a profit, his parents had their accident.\n\nWhat path the future held, the young man didn't know.\n\nNor could he have known,\n\nthat thanks to the country,\n\nthe subsequent real estate boom would bring him a heavenly windfall from land acquisition. His parents' efforts over the better part of their lives had, in fact, left him an incredibly rich inheritance.\n\nMore than twenty properties, even if not in a top-tier city like Beijing, Shanghai, or Guangzhou where every inch of land is gold, was still enough to be called a huge asset.\n\nOf course, who can predict the future?\n\nAt least on the night of the wake,\n\nthe young man was still lost. About his life, about his future, about everything that was to come, he was at a complete loss.\n\nThen,\n\nthat old man appeared.\n\nHe was still wearing his Liberation shoes,\n\nstill wearing his patched clothes.\n\nHe walked to the offering table, lit three sticks of incense,\n\nthen turned around,\n\nlooked at the young man,\n\nand asked:\n\n\"I have a way to bring your parents back to you. Are you willing?\"\n\nThis time,\n\nthe young man nodded.\n\nEven if this old man was a great swindler, a huge charlatan, or even a human trafficker,\n\nthe young man would still have nodded without hesitation.\n\nA drowning person will grab at anything. Even if someone comes specifically to save him, the drowning person will cling to him desperately, even if it means dragging his rescuer down to drown with him.\n\nHe will never let go.\n\n...\n\n\"That night, I saw you. I had originally intended for you to be bitten to death by that walking corpse, but you were lucky and somehow survived.\"\n\nThe black shadow was still talking.\n\nXu Qinglang's eyes were bloodshot, like a beast driven mad.\n\nXu Qinglang had always presented a calm demeanor to the world. His most frequent activity was putting cucumber slices on his face after a meal to care for his skin. No matter what happened, he would deliberately maintain his myriad charms.\n\nBut at this moment,\n\nhe was nearly insane,\n\ncompletely submerged in hatred!\n\nHe...\n\n...had been calling his parents' murderer \"Master\"!\n\nAnd for all these years, he had been grateful to him, missed him, and even prayed for his well-being during every holiday!\n\nXu Qinglang felt like a joke,\n\na colossal joke.\n\n\"Heaven and Earth are boundless, the Mystic Heart's True Law!\"\n\nHe formed a seal with his hands,\n\nand recited the incantation.\n\nIn an instant,\n\nthe wind and water stirred.\n\nBut just then, the sound of the flute suddenly stopped. A wave of energy immediately swept over. In the bathtub, Xu Qinglang felt the water around him instantly turn into a thick, viscous liquid that began to pour into his eyes, ears, mouth, and nose.\n\nAt that moment,\n\nhe felt he wasn't in a bathtub,\n\nbut trapped deep in a terrifying swamp.\n\n\"Using what I taught you against me?\n\n\"Let's not even mention you haven't mastered it. Even if you had, in front of me, what do you amount to?\"\n\nXu Qinglang struggled desperately in the bathtub, his expression pained. Having just been cured of the corpse poison, he was already weak, let alone facing a situation like this.\n\n\"For the sake of upholding the righteous path, your master once invested a great deal of effort in you;\n\n\"But not only did you fail to persist on the righteous path of cultivation, you are now consorting with heretics and evildoers in the same room;\n\n\"If I hadn't taught you back then, your master could have taught someone else. You wasted resources. You have failed the righteous path!\n\n\"You have failed your master.\n\n\"Today, your master,\n\n\"will clean up the sect!\"\n\nThe black shadow's voice was a little slow.\n\nHe seemed to be weaving reasons for himself,\n\nthinking and speaking at the same time,\n\nfinding excuses while acting.\n\nThe Xu Qinglang before him was not a zombie. Perhaps, that night, he had reanimated the walking corpse killed by Zhou Ze to bite Xu Qinglang, precisely so he would become a zombie, giving himself a suitable excuse to kill him later.\n\nAnd now that Xu Qinglang had been successfully detoxified, he had become a person again.\n\nSo,\n\nthe black shadow had to find a new excuse to support killing Xu Qinglang.\n\nBecause he really wanted to kill him, to kill this disciple who he felt had disappointed him.\n\nBlood began to seep from Xu Qinglang's eyes, ears, mouth, and nose, gradually staining the water in the tub red. It was a miserable sight.\n\n*CRASH!*\n\nJust then, the bedroom door was pushed open. The Dead Attendant stood in the doorway.\n\nHis gaze swept back and forth over the black shadow.\n\nHe remembered what Zhou Ze had ordered before he left.\n\nAnything that shouldn't be here, can't be here.\n\nHe walked toward the black shadow,\n\nreached out, and grabbed it.\n\nHe caught a human skin as thin as a cicada's wing,\n\nand then,\n\nripped it to shreds!\n\nBut in the next moment,\n\na new black shadow appeared behind the Dead Attendant.\n\nIts hand, like paper yet incomparably sharp,\n\npierced straight through the Dead Attendant's chest and lifted him into the air.\n\nThe Dead Attendant's feet left the ground,\n\nyet he didn't die instantly.\n\n\"Don't be hasty.\n\n\"Next,\n\n\"it's you.\"\n\n*WHOOSH!*\n\nThe Dead Attendant's body suddenly shot backward, sliding down the black shadow's arm, ignoring his ever-widening wound, and once again came face-to-face with the shadow.\n\nHe opened his mouth,\n\nand bit down!\n\nA human skin, like a thin pancake, was swallowed in one gulp.\n\nHe chewed,\n\nand swallowed.\n\nFor trash,\n\nthis was the Dead Attendant's usual method of disposal.\n\nBut in the next moment,\n\ntwo hands burst out from the Dead Attendant's stomach.\n\nThe thing that had just been devoured,\n\nwas now attempting to crawl back out,\n\nlike a newborn baby,\n\nwelcoming its own birthday.\n\n\"ROAR!\"\n\nThe Dead Attendant let out a roar, his hands pressing down with all his might, trying to force the thing back into his stomach.\n\nHowever,\n\nthe force of the thing inside grew stronger and stronger.\n\nAnd,\n\nin this tug-of-war,\n\nthe cracks on the Dead Attendant's body were widening,\n\nlike a carriage,\n\nabout to fall apart...\n\n---\n¹ **Shamate (殺馬特):** A Chinese transliteration of the English word \"smart.\" It refers to a youth subculture from the 2000s known for eccentric and exaggerated hairstyles, heavy makeup, and flamboyant clothing, often drawing comparisons to Western emo or visual kei styles.\n\n² **Taste for the cut sleeve (斷袖):** A classical and literary Chinese euphemism for male homosexuality, originating from the story of an emperor who cut off the sleeve of his robe rather than wake his male lover who was sleeping on it.",

    "content": "The old Taoist had never considered himself a hero. In fact, most of the time, he even forgot he was a Taoist priest.\n\nAfter all, he was the kind of guy who would sometimes even chant \"Amitabha\"¹ instead of \"Immeasurable Heavenly Lord.\"²\n\nHe was self-aware; he knew he was just a minor character, and minor characters have their own way of living. He understood this well.\n\nServing as the butt of a joke to liven things up was fine.\n\nIf there was no joke, he was self-aware enough to create one himself.\n\nHe knew he was pretty useless. Aside from his family's heirloom paper talismans, he had nothing to offer.\n\nEven the death-knight who now worked as a janitor in the bookstore, in the old Taoist's eyes, was on the level of the sweeping monk in the Shaolin Temple's sutra library—a figure who could be dragged out and beat the crap out of him.\n\nBut being a minor character had its advantages. You could slip away when it was time to run. When trouble arose, no one expected you to hold the line, so you didn't have to. You could preserve your precious life, avoid being a hero. How delightful, and you live longer.\n\nThis was the old Taoist's way of survival.\n\nLet the world laugh at him, slander him, mock him, scorn him.\n\nBut after seventy years, he had seen through life, living, and work. Those who laughed at him, in reality, didn't see things as clearly as he did, nor did they live as practically.\n\nThe little monkey was behind him, still wearing that small bookbag, its eyes filled with tears.\n\nThe old Taoist leaned one hand against a utility pole, barely managing to keep himself standing. His body was already covered in wounds.\n\nOn his knees, shoulders, calves, and other areas, some gashes were so deep you could see the white bone within.\n\nEven when he was possessed by Cao Ding last time, the old Taoist hadn't been this seriously injured.\n\nFor an ordinary person, a minor character, suffering such a severe injury was truly hard to bear. Don't be fooled by how Boss Zhou used to go on a rampage, often getting knocked unconscious for half a month, his body a gruesome mess of open wounds. Boss Zhou's constitution was different; after waking up and resting for a while, he'd be back to his lively self.\n\nThe old Taoist didn't have that luxury.\n\nBut he still held on, standing in front of the little monkey.\n\nIt wasn't clear if it was because the shadow intentionally wanted to torment him slowly, or because the paper talisman the old Taoist had stuck to his own forehead made it somewhat wary.\n\nIn any case,\n\nthe shadow didn't finish him off cleanly and efficiently.\n\nInstead, it fell into a war of attrition, inflicting a new wound with each attack.\n\nAnd the old Taoist,\n\nin all of this, was merely the one passively taking the abuse.\n\nThe shadow attacked again.\n\nThe old Taoist took a heavy punch to the chest. He flew backward like a broken kite, then crashed to the ground. Blood began to seep uncontrollably from the corner of his mouth, and he nearly passed out.\n\n\"Dammit... either just... kill this poor Taoist... or what's the point... of doing this... bit... by bit?\n\n\"Constantly back and forth, in and out...\n\n\"Do you take this poor Taoist for a bitch?!\"\n\nEven after being beaten into such a miserable state, the old Taoist's mouth was as sharp as ever. He was usually quite meek in front of Zhou Ze, even bringing out a broom and mop to contribute to the \"Campaign for a Sanitary City\" after making a mistake.\n\nBut this time, the old Taoist wasn't meek at all. He even seemed a bit stubborn.\n\nIt was just like that time in Rongcheng when a guy named Sun Xiaoqiang advised him to stop sponsoring that bunch of ungrateful students in the mountains.\n\nBut the old Taoist had insisted on doing things his way.\n\nIt seems that a person who appears to have no principles has simply not yet encountered something they want to stand for.\n\n\"Alright then... let this 'bitch' tell you... your 'performance'... is way worse than... than my master's...\"\n\nThe little monkey squatted beside the old Taoist, so anxious it was scratching its ears and head. It even dug up a handful of dirt from the flowerbed, intending to pee on it.\n\nBut at that moment, the little monkey couldn't urinate. The more it couldn't, the more anxious it got, and the more anxious it got, the more it couldn't.\n\nIt began to hop around frantically, trying to find a solution but failing. If this were its past life, with its ferocious appearance, it could have put up a fight. But in this life, it was still too small, and at this moment, it seemed far too helpless.\n\nThe shadow began to walk over slowly, as if watching to see if the old Taoist would get back up. Its behavior was indeed rather strange. Just as the old Taoist had guessed, it seemed to be wary of something.\n\nWas it wary of my paper talismans?\n\nBut didn't he claim to be a righteous figure?\n\nMy talismans,\n\nthey work on him?\n\nThe old Taoist was also a little confused.\n\nBut confusion or not, he still had to get up.\n\nSince he regarded the little monkey as his own grandson, he couldn't possibly die in front of him. But the old Taoist tried with all his might and still couldn't stand.\n\nThe shadow arrived.\n\nIt seemed to let out a long sigh of relief.\n\nThen it raised its hand.\n\nThe hand was narrow.\n\nYes,\n\nvery narrow.\n\nAs narrow as a sheet of paper, yet extremely sharp, as if it could easily tear through any obstacle.\n\nThe little monkey, holding the Yin-Yang Tome, slammed it viciously onto the ground and even started stomping on it with its feet.\n\nBoss Zhou had entrusted this thing to the little monkey for safekeeping.\n\nThe little monkey, of course, knew it must be a treasure.\n\nBut this treasure was useless at a critical moment.\n\nThe feeling was like being trapped in a desert with several chests of rare treasures but not a single drop of water.\n\nBut as it stomped,\n\na cat's meow suddenly came from within the Yin-Yang Tome.\n\nImmediately after,\n\nthree beams of light of different colors shot out from inside, landing in the surrounding area.\n\nThe black one was a black cat.\n\nThe cyan one was a python.\n\nThe yellow one was a yellow weasel.\n\nBoss Zhou's *Animal World* had finally made its grand entrance.\n\nThe voice of Teacher Zhao Zhongxiang seemed to echo in his ears:\n\n\"In this forest, summer has arrived. The yellow weasel begins to forage for food, the snakes have ended their hibernation, and the hunter's cat is lazily lacking in spirit.\n\n\"Here, you can see many animals. They inhabit this place, live here, and together create the harmony and beauty of nature.\n\n\"Here, you can even see—FUCK YOUR MOTHER………………\"\n\nThe shadow paused for a moment.\n\n\"Squeak squeak squeak!!!!\"\n\nThe little monkey screeched desperately at the three figures. No one knew what it was yelling, but among animals—no, among aberrations—there should be their own ways of communication and language, so they should be able to understand the little monkey's \"squeak squeak squeak.\"\n\nAt that moment,\n\nthe black cat crouched, ready to attack the shadow.\n\nAfter all, the Yin-Yang Tome had long been bound to Zhou Ze. Although Zhou Ze, its master, still didn't know how to use it, the black cat, as the artifact spirit, knew what it should do.\n\nBut Eighth Aunt-Grandmother and Huang Ah-San showed an indifferent attitude. The two of them even actively retreated a distance, signaling that this had nothing to do with them.\n\n\"Heh heh, you actually want to ask this Aunt-Grandmother to save you at a time like this?\n\n\"Why should this Aunt-Grandmother save you?\n\n\"You should all die.\n\n\"It would be best if everyone in that bookstore died!\"\n\n\"Hooo... hooo... hooo...\"\n\nHuang Ah-San continued to sleep. Although it was moving, the snores continued, also indicating a stance of 'none of my business.'\n\nThe monkey appeared very angry and continued to screech \"squeak squeak squeak.\" Judging from its experience of knocking around with the old Taoist, when it came to haggling and reasoning, it was surely a cut above other aberrations.\n\nBut Eighth Aunt-Grandmother and Huang Ah-San remained unmoved.\n\nEighth Aunt-Grandmother even sneered twice more and said to the shadow:\n\n\"Fellow cultivator, you do your business. This Aunt-Grandmother guarantees she won't interfere.\"\n\nThis was a clear statement that she intended to watch the fire from the other side of the river, and perhaps even cheer it on.\n\nThe shadow tilted its head slightly, glanced at the two aberrations trying to leave the battle, and a strange laugh came from its throat as it said:\n\n\"Aberrations, all of them must die!\"\n\nThe next moment,\n\nthe sound of a flute arose.\n\nThe black cat collapsed to the ground in pain, its once high and proud tail now limp.\n\nHuang Ah-San and Eighth Aunt-Grandmother were the same, falling to the ground in extreme pain.\n\n\"You... you're being unreasonable...\" Eighth Aunt-Grandmother cursed in a fit of rage.\n\nAt the same time,\n\nEighth Aunt-Grandmother felt very wronged.\n\nShe had come out of the mountains this time to solve a junior's problem.\n\nHow did she end up so unlucky?\n\nFirst, she was captured by that bookstore owner in a bizarre reenactment of the Golden and Silver Horned Kings plot from *Journey to the West*. Now that she had finally gotten out, she ran into a \"righteous\" figure who couldn't tolerate a single grain of sand in his eyes.\n\n\"Aberrations, all of them must die!\"\n\n\"Pfft!\"\n\nA crack appeared on the black cat's body. It was a wound, meaning its soul form had been torn open. But in the next instant, the black cat lunged forward fiercely, turning into a bolt of black lightning that pierced directly through the shadow.\n\nBut the flute music did not stop.\n\nThe shadow reappeared in another direction.\n\n\"Let's go! We have no choice. He's locked onto our auras and has no intention of letting us escape!\"\n\nHuang Ah-San, who had been in a \"great dream,\" spoke in a low voice, then pounced at the shadow. Eighth Aunt-Grandmother no longer hesitated and charged forward to attack as well.\n\nWhen you have no choice,\n\nyou really have no choice.\n\nYou have to fight for your life, even if you don't want to!\n\nThe three aberration souls engaged in a chaotic fight against the shadow, and the scene became extremely turbulent.\n\nBut every time the shadow was torn apart or pierced, it would always reappear quickly.\n\nOne human skin was one of him.\n\nMany human skins meant he had many avatars.\n\nHis true body was surely nearby but had not yet shown itself.\n\nAnd from the beginning until now, he had been controlling several human skins, simultaneously attacking and attempting to exterminate multiple parties.\n\nThis was a kind of boldness,\n\nand also a kind of calm confidence.\n\nHe had taught this technique to Xu Qinglang back then,\n\nbut Old Xu was content to cultivate it only to the point where he could house his parents' souls in human skins to accompany him.\n\nLater, he even became a chef.\n\nThe flute music suddenly intensified.\n\nThe quality of the shadow also seemed better than before.\n\nThe black cat was swatted away, its soul form nearly transparent.\n\nHuang Ah-San and Eighth Aunt-Grandmother's souls were also on the verge of shattering.\n\nIf they could have escaped, they would have long ago, but their opponent had no intention of letting them go. This feeling was incredibly frustrating for them.\n\n\"Where's that Ghost Emissary? Where the hell did he go!\"\n\nEighth Aunt-Grandmother suddenly shouted.\n\nIt was laughable.\n\nAt this moment,\n\nEighth Aunt-Grandmother was actually calling for Zhou Ze, the very guy she wished she could eat alive.\n\n\"Buzz!\"\n\nThe shadow attacked again.\n\nThe three weakened aberrations had to grit their teeth and meet the charge once more.\n\nAnd on the side,\n\nthe old Taoist was continuously coughing up blood.\n\nThe little monkey was beside him, wiping it away with its fleshy paws.\n\nAt the same time, its other paw held a phone, frantically trying to call Zhou Ze. But for some reason,\n\nthe voice on the other end was always:\n\n\"Sorry, the number you have dialed cannot be connected at the moment. Please redial later.\n\nSorry! The subscriber you dialed can not be connected for the moment, please redial later…………\"\n\n***\n\n**Footnotes:**\n\n1.  **Amitabha:** A common chant in Pure Land Buddhism.\n2.  **Immeasurable Heavenly Lord (無量天尊):** A common salutation in Taoism.

    "content": "\"The meat isn't fresh today.\"\n\nThe woman complained, poking her head out from under the covers.\n\n\"It must be because I've been too tired lately. Too much going on at work. I'll go to the farmer's market tomorrow and pick the freshest meat for you.\"\n\n\"Mhm, I want to eat fresh meat.\"\n\nThe woman pulled her head back under the covers.\n\nAfter a while, the woman threw off the covers. She was hot.\n\n\"The meat isn't firm, either,\" the woman complained again. \"Tonight's meat was limp and soft, with no texture at all. There was no kick to it.\"\n\n\"It'll be better tomorrow.\"\n\nThe man got out of bed and walked out of the bedroom.\n\nAt the end of the hallway, he lit a cigarette.\n\nA post-coital cigarette.\n\nIt was a habit for many men, just like lighting one up after a satisfying meal. After intense gratification, one always needed a cigarette to calm the emotions.\n\nWang Ke never smoked in the bedroom, nor did he ever bring any food into it. His life, like his work, was organized by him in a neat and orderly fashion.\n\nTurning his head, he saw that the light in his daughter's room was still on.\n\n\"Knock, knock, knock...\"\n\n\"Rui Rui, still not asleep?\"\n\nThere was no response from the room.\n\n*She must have fallen asleep but forgot to turn off the light.*\n\nFrom outside, Wang Ke turned off the light in his daughter's room, then turned and headed to the second-floor bathroom, preparing to take a shower.\n\nWhat he didn't know was that his daughter was not, as he imagined, sound asleep in her bed.\n\nInstead, she was standing on the balcony in a slip nightdress.\n\nThe evening breeze blew, carrying a slight chill.\n\nThe hem of her nightdress danced lightly along with the curtains.\n\nThe little loli's gaze was fixed on the distance, in the direction of Zhou Ze's Bookstore.\n\nShe could sense it.\n\nAfter all, it really wasn't far.\n\nHowever, in the woods before the little loli stood a black figure. He, too, was staring at her.\n\nThis was a warning.\n\nThis was also a threat.\n\nThe little loli knew he had the confidence to back it up. She had heard of this person from the previous Ghost Emissary of Tongcheng. This was a very terrifying and self-absorbed person.\n\nHe was a product of that era's campaign to \"overthrow all monsters and demons.\"¹\n\nHe was an extremist forged by the zeitgeist of the time.\n\nHe was... a freak.\n\nEven the previous Ghost Emissary couldn't say what this person's true identity was, and the information he had was very limited. But the little loli had some knowledge of the things he had done.\n\nHe would disappear without a trace from time to time, and then suddenly reappear to do certain things.\n\nNews about him would circulate within the Ghost Emissary circle every so often. Wherever he appeared, the local Ghost Emissary would tremble in fear. This was no exaggeration.\n\nBut he also abided by his own rules. He killed demons and slayed devils, continuing the work of the Heavenly Masters of old, and he wouldn't interfere with the Ghost Emissaries' official duties. Everyone minded their own business.\n\nThe little loli knew he was from Tongcheng, but she hadn't expected him to actually return after being away for ten years.\n\nWas this black shadow intentionally sent to remind her not to meddle?\n\nThe little loli smiled faintly.\n\nShe knew very well that he wouldn't kill Zhou Ze, because Zhou Ze was a Ghost Emissary. But at the same time, she also knew that the group around Zhou Ze—oh no, that bunch of existences that couldn't be called human—would likely become his cleanup targets.\n\nHe was warning her not to make a move.\n\nBut the little loli had no intention of making a move in the first place.\n\nHis not killing Zhou Ze meant that the little loli herself wouldn't be in danger, so she naturally couldn't be bothered to move.\n\nShe lifted her head, wanting to look at the starry sky, but the weather tonight wasn't good; no stars were visible.\n\nHowever, the little loli still wanted to know...\n\nWhen that salted fish found out that the people around him were suddenly being purged one by one by an obstinate crusader, how would he react?\n\nAt this thought, the little loli's gaze toward the black figure below couldn't help but carry a trace of pity.\n\nHis principles, his laws, his beliefs, his standards—they were all built upon his inconceivable level of Taoist arts.\n\nBecause the demons and ghosts he encountered were weaker than him, he could enact justice on behalf of Heaven, could shout his grand principles, could endlessly propagate his ideals and creeds.\n\nJust like when Li Kui killed a child, he too shouted, \"Enacting justice on behalf of Heaven.\"\n\nThe heroes of Liangshan drank wine and ate meat in great mouthfuls up on their mountain, but they produced nothing. Where did the wine and meat come from?\n\nAnd yet, they still called themselves heroes, flying the banner of \"Enacting justice on behalf of Heaven.\"\n\nBut that was only because their fists were bigger.\n\nOnce he encountered someone whose fist was even bigger than his own, would his principles still make sense?\n\nStill, something was a little strange.\n\nWhy was that guy still so calm?\n\nWhy hadn't that aura manifested?\n\nThat salted fish... what was he doing?\n\nHad he not noticed anything, not realized anything at all?\n\nOr... was he drunk?\n\n...\n\n\"I'm not drunk...\"\n\nZhou Ze looked at the glass and bottle in front of him. The sharp pain in his chest was making it hard to bear. For a moment, he even began to suspect he had some kind of heart disease.\n\nDamn it.\n\nEver since possessing Xu Le's body, Zhou Ze hadn't gone for a full physical check-up. Thinking about it now, he suddenly felt a pang of fear. What if this Xu Le guy had some hereditary disease? Wouldn't he have gotten a raw deal?\n\nQu Mingming had been gone for a long time and still hadn't returned. Zhou Ze felt a bit bored drinking alone in the office; besides, he wasn't much of a drinker.\n\nForcing himself to endure the sharp pain in his chest, Zhou Ze stood up and pushed open the office door.\n\nOutside the door was the bustling internet cafe.\n\nBai Yingying and Qu Zhenzhen were sitting together, playing a game very happily.\n\nSeeing Bai Yingying's back, Zhou Ze unconsciously smiled. It seemed the sharp pain in his chest wasn't so unbearable anymore.\n\nThis feeling was like a husband seeing his wife doing chores, parents watching their child playing with toys, an old farmer watching the heavy-laden crops in his field swaying in the wind.\n\nIt was a very pure joy that came from the bottom of his heart.\n\nSeeing her happy, your own mood would also inexplicably improve.\n\nHe didn't call for Bai Yingying to pour him tea or to leave with him. Since she was having so much fun, he'd let her play a while longer.\n\nZhou Ze braced one hand against the wall and walked out of the internet cafe. After crossing the street, as he was pushing the door to the bookstore, he saw an old guy in a Taoist robe at the far end of the street, humming a tune as he swept the road.\n\nA cute little monkey was perched on the old Taoist's shoulder, seemingly shelling peanuts or something similar.\n\nThe man and the monkey seemed to be enjoying a harmonious evening.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. If he enjoyed it, so be it.\n\nHe pushed open the door and entered the bookstore.\n\nThe Death Knight sat there silently, exactly the same as always. If the bookstore wasn't dirty, he could sit there for a whole day without moving.\n\nZhou Ze poured himself a glass of ice water and drank it in one go. The sharp pain in his chest continued, but it had already become somewhat numb.\n\nAny pain, any discomfort, once you start getting used to it, its presence will slowly diminish.\n\nHe went upstairs and pushed open the bedroom door on the second floor.\n\n\"Was the detoxification successful?\" Zhou Ze asked Xu Qinglang, who was leaning against the side of the bathtub.\n\nXu Qinglang, with his back to him, was leaning against the tub's edge. Faint snores could be heard. Zhou Ze saw a pitch-black insect in the corner of the room.\n\nThe insect's body was full of corpse poison. The detoxification must have been a success. Old Xu was tired and sleeping soundly.\n\nWithout disturbing him further, Zhou Ze gently closed the bedroom door. He went back down to the first floor, picked up a magazine, and settled into his most customary and familiar spot, lying down on the sofa.\n\nThe familiar posture.\n\nThe familiar atmosphere.\n\nThe familiar soft background music of the bookstore.\n\nBut for some reason, Zhou Ze felt in his heart as if something was missing.\n\nUsually, he could lie like this for an entire day, not wanting to move at all.\n\nHe enjoyed this tranquility, enjoyed this beauty, enjoyed this laziness.\n\nBut today, something seemed off.\n\nYingying was playing games at the internet cafe.\n\nThe old Taoist and the monkey were strolling down the road.\n\nOld Xu was sleeping upstairs.\n\nWhat was wrong?\n\n...\n\n\"For this body to have been nourished so well, it truly is rare. Who on earth spent so many years nourishing a jiangshi?²\n\nHeh heh, so, if I peel your skin off, it should be very useful.\"\n\nBai Yingying was hung up by a jade flute. Her arms hung limply at her sides, and her head was bowed low. She looked utterly pitiful.\n\n\"You heretics still have a little value on you. This can be considered a way for you to atone for your sins against this world.\n\nI represent the righteous path.\n\nTaking things from you is also a way of accumulating merit for you. If there is a next life, don't be born on the wrong side.\"\n\nThe black shadow stretched out his hand. It was still that very sharp, narrow hand, like a saw.\n\nBut he quickly hesitated.\n\n\"Before taking the skin, I should take out your inner core first. This should be more useful.\"\n\nAs he spoke, he placed his hand on Bai Yingying's neck and slowly pierced it.\n\nBai Yingying's originally tough and formidable physical body, at this moment, seemed so fragile, as easy as splitting soft tofu with a chopstick.\n\nIt must be because her injuries were too severe.\n\nThis physique was already on the verge of collapse, like a candle guttering in the wind, like a tattered leaf, helpless against the wind's abuse.\n\nThe black shadow's hand began to slowly drag downwards.\n\nThe wound, starting from her neck, was also slowly being cut further open, like a fish being gutted for a deep cleaning.\n\n\"Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!\"\n\nBai Yingying raised her head and let out an incomparably shrill, miserable scream.\n\n...\n\n\"Ahhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!\"\n\nIn the bookstore, Zhou Ze suddenly began to convulse violently from pain, rolling right off the sofa and smashing a nearby coffee table.\n\n\"It hurts... So painful... My heart hurts so much...\"\n\nZhou Ze finally realized something.\n\nSomething was wrong.\n\nSomething was definitely wrong somewhere.\n\nHe looked at the Death Knight.\n\nHe called for the Death Knight in his mind, but the Death Knight remained seated right where he was.\n\nZhou Ze immediately rushed out of the bookstore, shouting for the old Taoist sweeping the road at the end of the street.\n\nBut the old Taoist continued to sing his song, continued to sweep the road, even ignoring his boss's shouts as if they were nothing but wind.\n\nZhou Ze immediately rushed back into the internet cafe opposite.\n\nHe charged up to the second floor like a madman, rushing to Bai Yingying who was playing her game.\n\n\"Yingying! Yingying!\"\n\nZhou Ze reached out and grabbed Bai Yingying's shoulders.\n\n\"Boss... what's wrong... Do you need Yingying to pour you some tea?\"\n\nBai Yingying turned her head to look at Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze's pupils contracted violently.\n\nThe Bai Yingying before his eyes was covered in blood, her body riddled with gruesome, bloody wounds.\n\nAnd the wound on her neck was still continuously being pulled downwards, constantly extending.\n\nIt was a scalp-numbing sight.\n\nAnd Bai Yingying seemed completely unaware.\n\nSeeing the boss staring blankly at her, she even gave a playful smile.\n\n\"Ying ying ying...\"\n\n\"What is going on? What the hell is going on!\"\n\nZhou Ze clutched his head tightly with both hands, his nails digging into his skin, drawing blood.\n\nWhat was happening to all of this!\n\n...\n\nThe three talismans of different colors pasted on the office door began to tremble at this moment.\n\nSuddenly, the first talisman fell from the door.\n\nThen the second.\n\nAnd right after that, the third.\n\nAnd the man sitting in the office, clutching his head in extreme pain, slowly... raised his head!\n\n---\n**Footnotes:**\n\n1.  **\"overthrow all monsters and demons\" (打倒一切牛鬼蛇神):** A political slogan widely used during China's Cultural Revolution (1966-1976) to target perceived class enemies, intellectuals, and those associated with old traditions.\n2.  **jiangshi (殭屍):** A type of reanimated corpse in Chinese folklore, sometimes translated as \"hopping vampire\" or \"Chinese zombie.\"",

    "content": "If one looked closely,\n\none could see ten bloody marks on Zhou Ze's head. In some spots, fresh blood was still trickling out, dripping down past his ears and chin.\n\nBoss Zhou, who usually adopted a hands-off attitude toward everything, to the point of practically plugging his ears just to get through the day, had rarely ever been this flustered and frantic.\n\nIn his past life,\nhe had been diligent, cherishing every moment and opportunity, striving to climb his way up.\n\nIn this life,\nhe was content to be a salted fish¹;\nhe originally felt he could continue living this way, detached and carefree, and believed he had nothing left to worry about or cherish.\n\nThis kind of life was pretty good, too.\n\nPeople scorned vagrants because they were poor, yet they envied those who could afford a luxurious, spontaneous trip at a moment's notice.\n\nBoss Zhou belonged to the latter category.\n\nBut right now,\nhe was desperate,\nhe was frantic,\nas if a precious piece of his life\nwas gradually slipping away from him.\n\nJust as the song goes, you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone. This was a common flaw in most people—oh, in most men.\n\nZhou Ze couldn't forget the mischievous sight of Bai Yingying sneaking downstairs to stir his water glass with her tongue.\nNor could he forget the faint sweetness he tasted when he drank the water.\nEven less could he forget the feeling of falling asleep with his head on her lap as she massaged it carefully.\nHe had even accidentally discovered, while using the computer once, the various styles of bamboo beds Bai Yingying had designed for him for the next Cold Clothes Festival.\n\nThe day before yesterday,\nBai Yingying had taken her money to the club to pay the bill for his \"solicitation,\" and although it made Zhou Ze's liver ache a little, he also felt immensely gratified and touched.\n\nThis,\nadorable,\nsilly girl.\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nHe shoved open the office door.\nZhou Ze saw three talisman papers scattered on the floor.\n\nLifting his head, he scanned the room. Qu Zhenzhen was sitting motionless in front of the computer, while Bai Yingying, who should have been sitting next to her playing games, was nowhere to be seen.\n\nZhou Ze rushed to Qu Zhenzhen and tore the talisman from her chest.\n\n\"Ahhhhhhhhh!!!!!!\"\n\nQu Zhenzhen began to scream hysterically.\nShe was like a woman driven mad by solitary confinement, starting to vent her inner turmoil and terror in this way.\nIn her current state, it was impossible to get any answers from her.\n\nMany people in the internet cafe stood up to see what was happening. Most of them assumed Zhou Ze had done something to the girl at the counter. Two men in tank tops even stood up and walked over, intending to be heroes saving a damsel in distress.\n\n\"Hey, buddy, who do you think you are, picking on a woman?\"\n\nZhou Ze turned, intending to leave.\n\n\"Hey, you're just leaving? That cowardly? You want to go? No way. Explain what...\"\n\nZhou Ze spun around abruptly and stabbed straight into the man's arm. The man immediately crashed to the floor, foaming at the mouth.\n\nThe other two men who had intended to play the hero were collectively stunned by this scene. No one dared to take a step forward.\n\nZhou Ze rushed out of the internet cafe and onto the street.\n\nHe could vaguely sense that Yingying was somewhere nearby, but there had to be a very advanced illusion spell here.\n\nHis fingernails grew out rapidly.\nHe then stabbed them violently into the ground.\nWisps of black mist began to emanate from his fingertips, seeping into the ground. Then, in a spot diagonally in front of Zhou Ze, the black mist seemed to hit a barrier, unable to penetrate.\n\nIt's right there!\n\nAt this moment, Zhou Ze had no time to think about the old Taoist and the monkey, nor the capacity to think about Xu Qinglang and the Death-Servant upstairs. His mind was filled with only one person: Bai Yingying.\n\nIt wasn't favoritism,\nit was instinct.\nPeople always cling to what their heart truly depends on in the most critical moments.\n\nZhou Ze charged in that direction, raising his claw-like hand and swiping down!\n\nThere was nothing in front of him,\nat least for now,\nnothing was visible.\nBut Zhou Ze knew a barrier was blocking the way. Boss Zhou was no longer the greenhorn he once was; he had been through his fair share of these things.\n\nHis nails tore through a seemingly nonexistent membrane.\nThe scene before him distorted,\nand things changed.\n\nA row of streetlights had long been shattered.\nOn the ground,\nbloodstains and scorch marks were everywhere.\nA jade flute had impaled Bai Yingying, pinning her in place.\nShe was crying mournfully.\nThe horrific wound, in particular,\nwas a shocking sight.\n\nA dark figure stood beside Bai Yingying. He turned his head to look at the suddenly-appeared Zhou Ze.\n\nHe was somewhat surprised,\nbecause he knew the power of those three talismans.\nUnless the building collapsed, it was impossible for the person sealed inside the room to perceive the situation outside.\nHe didn't kill Ghost Emissaries,\nwhich was why he had deliberately isolated Zhou Ze.\nBut Zhou Ze had come anyway.\n\nHe felt a bit displeased.\nHis gaze toward Zhou Ze was like looking at something ungrateful that didn't know when to accept a favor.\n\nHe didn't want to kill a Ghost Emissary,\nbut that didn't mean he couldn't kill a Ghost Emissary, nor did it mean he didn't dare to kill a Ghost Emissary.\nIf a Ghost Emissary was truly determined to associate with demons and heretics,\nthen he too should rightfully become a target for those \"enacting justice for Heaven,\"\nto be eradicated!\n\nYes,\nthat's right.\nWith a grand principle to back it up, it was justifiable.\n\nThe dark figure felt a weight lift from his heart, and his gaze became resolute.\n\n\"You came here... to say something to me?\"\nthe dark figure asked.\n\nZhou Ze ignored him and rushed toward Bai Yingying.\n\nFor the first time ever,\nthe dark figure did not stop Zhou Ze, allowing him to run to Bai Yingying's side.\n\nZhou Ze's hand rested on Bai Yingying's face.\nHe looked at it all in disbelief. The girl who had always been so innocent and bubbly, who loved to \"ying-ying-ying\"² at him, was now being tortured into such a state.\nAnd while she was enduring this agony,\nhe,\nhe,\nhe had been upstairs drinking!\n\nShame,\nguilt,\nfury,\nrelentlessly tormented Zhou Ze's heart, filling it with an unimaginable self-reproach.\n\nHe was the one who wanted to live like a salted fish, the one who wanted to drift aimlessly through life, the one who liked this lazy, muddle-through existence.\nHe had mentally prepared himself with the attitude of \"a dead pig isn't afraid of boiling water.\"\nNo matter what happened in the future,\nhe would bear it himself. As long as he could live comfortably and freely in the present, nothing else mattered.\n\nBut why,\nwhy wasn't this coming for him,\nbut for the people around him?\n\nBai Yingying weakly opened her eyes. Her gaze was somewhat murky, not bright like before. She saw Zhou Ze.\nShe didn't cry, didn't throw a fit, nor did she aggrievedly ask for protection or blame Zhou Ze for taking so long to arrive.\nShe simply used what little strength she had left to warn him:\n\"Boss... be careful of his... flute's sound...\"\n\nZhou Ze's gaze carefully swept over Bai Yingying's body.\nEspecially when he saw the massive wound on her neck,\nhe nearly let out a roar of fury!\n\n\"Are you looking for this?\"\nThe dark figure smiled and held out his hand.\nIn his palm, a perfectly round and translucent corpse core floated gently.\n\n\"You kept her by your side for this, I presume.\nMy apologies. This old man was enacting justice for Heaven. This thing belongs to this old man now.\nAs a Ghost Emissary, you neglect your duties and instead raise a jiangshi, sheltering evil. This loss is this old man's punishment for you. That's not too much to ask, is it?\"\n\nZhou Ze turned to the side, looking at the old man.\nHe wanted to ask \"why,\" wanted to ask \"who are you,\" wanted to ask \"how did I offend you,\" wanted to ask \"why are you doing this.\"\n\nBut when the words reached his lips,\nhe didn't ask them.\nBecause at this moment,\nany words,\nany excessive speech,\nany redundant explanation,\nseemed utterly meaningless.\n\nYingying had already been tortured like this.\nWhat else did he need to ask?\nThere was no need to ask,\ntruly no need to ask.\n\n\"You can go. Focus on your own duties from now on. This jiangshi stays here. I still need to skin her for other uses.\nShe was born of filth. Being able to contribute to the righteous path can be considered this old man's way of accumulating merit for her.\"\n\n\"Accumulating merit?\"\nZhou Ze stared blankly at the dark figure.\nThen,\nhe took a step,\nand began walking toward him.\n\n\"What... is the meaning of this...\"\nthe dark figure asked.\n\nZhou Ze didn't answer,\nand continued walking toward him.\n\n\"The demons in your bookstore have nearly been purged by me. I am... helping you.\"\n\n\"Helping me?\"\nZhou Ze continued walking forward.\n\n\"Heh heh, it seems you're very angry.\"\n\n\"Angry?\"\nSeeing Zhou Ze continuously approaching, the killing intent radiating from his body was so thick it could have condensed into droplets. The dark figure was somewhat puzzled,\npuzzled that this Ghost Emissary was so tactless.\nThen he became somewhat angry,\nangry that this minor Ghost Emissary refused the face he was being given.\n\nHe was dead set\non siding with demons and heretics.\n\n\"What do you think you are, to dare speak to this old man with such an attitude?\"\n\nThe sound of the flute rang out,\ninstantly piercing Zhou Ze's eardrums.\nAn expression of extreme agony appeared on Zhou Ze's face.\nIn that instant,\nthe world seemed to spin.\n\nBai Yingying had warned Zhou Ze to be careful of the flute's sound.\nHowever,\nZhou Ze hadn't taken it to heart at all,\nnor had he paid it any mind.\n\nIt wasn't that Zhou Ze had disregarded Bai Yingying's warning,\nnor was it because he had been careless in his overwhelming rage.\nIt was because the moment he saw Bai Yingying's miserable state,\nZhou Ze already knew what he had to do.\n\nFear?\nDread?\nWorry?\nA watchdog?\nDog meat soup?\nTo be replaced?\nA sacrificial pawn?³\n\nTo hell with all of it!\n\nAt this moment,\nZhou Ze had only one thought in his mind.\nUse any means necessary, pay any price,\neven if it meant damning himself to Avici Hell for all eternity,\nhe had to make this dark figure,\nthis old bastard,\nbe ground to dust and his ashes scattered,\nhis soul devoured whole,\nand return the torment Yingying had just suffered at his hands,\ntenfold,\na hundredfold,\na thousandfold,\nten thousandfold!\n\nUnder the extreme agony created by the flute's sound,\nZhou Ze stopped walking.\nHe silently placed his left index finger on the spot between his eyebrows.\nVery calmly,\nas calmly as if he were knocking on his next-door neighbor's door,\nto say:\nIt's about to rain, please help me bring in the wheat drying in the threshing field.\n\nAt the same time,\nZhou Ze closed his eyes.\n\nThe next moment,\nZhou Ze slowly opened them.\nThe corners of his mouth curved into a smile, and his entire demeanor underwent a cataclysmic change in that instant.\nHe sneered:\n\"Heh heh... Weren't you... afraid of me... waking up... and also... doing everything you could... to prevent me... from waking up...\"\n\nFaced with this change, the dark figure\nwas at first confused.\nBut soon,\nhe seemed to understand something.\nHe immediately said:\n\"Right. He doesn't know what's good for him, but you should, right?\"\n\nZhou Ze tilted his head in puzzlement, looking at the dark figure before him.\nThen he pointed at the man,\nand asked in utter disbelief:\n\"What do you think you are, to dare speak to me with such an attitude?\"\n\n---\n**Footnotes:**\n1.  **Salted fish (鹹魚):** A popular Chinese internet slang for a lazy, unmotivated person who has no ambitions, content to just \"lie there.\"\n2.  **\"ying-ying-ying\" (嚶嚶嚶):** An onomatopoeia for whimpering or a cute, plaintive cry.

    "content": "With no foreshadowing,\n\nand with no warning,\n\nthe shadow simply appeared,\n\nbringing with it its ideals, bringing with it its principles,\n\nand almost,\n\nvery nearly,\n\nbrought utter ruin upon the entire bookstore.\n\nIf, in the end, Boss Zhou was the only one left, a commander with no troops,\n\nthen what meaning would the bookstore have left?\n\nPerhaps,\n\nthis was life,\n\nthis was human existence.\n\nEven if you were already dead,\n\neven if you were a Netherworld Emissary,\n\nyou could not escape this kind of fate.\n\nAs long as you were still \"alive,\"\n\nyou had to be ready to accept the surprises life threw at you at any moment.\n\nOr perhaps,\n\nthe terrors!\n\nZhou Ze’s gaze was extremely calm. This wasn't the wild fury from before; this was a true calm, because the Zhou Ze at this moment was not the original Zhou Ze.\n\nIt was like a group of children fiercely playing a game of marbles, staring each other down.\n\nThen, an adult joins in.\n\nThat in itself is already a shameful thing.\n\nIf you then start staring them down with the same intensity,\n\nFuck,\n\nhave you no shame?\n\nHis body slowly began to shrivel, but this time the degree of withering wasn't severe. His overall form basically retained its original appearance, but the fangs at the corners of his mouth grew ever more profound.\n\n\"Congratulations, you have angered me. Therefore, I shall enact justice upon you on behalf of Heaven!\"\n\n\"Annoying.\"\n\nZhou Ze used his long fingernails to gently pick at his ear, then flicked his finger.\n\n\"Voom!\"\n\nThe shadow vanished from its spot,\n\nwithout a trace!\n\nHowever,\n\nZhou Ze suddenly reached out and grabbed,\n\nas if casually waving his hand.\n\nBut in the very next instant,\n\nthe shadow, as if actively delivering its own neck into Zhou Ze's palm, appeared before him, its neck delivered right into his hand.\n\n\"Crack!\"\n\nClean.\n\nCrisp.\n\nNo blabbering like the shadow,\n\nand no interest in spouting nonsense about enacting justice on behalf of Heaven or preaching principles.\n\nJust like that, Zhou Ze snapped the shadow's neck. The shadow's body twisted in tandem, then friction sparked it into flames. It burst into combustion, turning into a sky full of embers—a fleeting moment of brilliance.\n\nBefore,\n\nthe shadow had been fast, true, but its movements had long been seen through by Zhou Ze, who could even play the game of waiting by a stump for the hare to come to him.¹\n\nNot just strategically, but tactically as well, Zhou Ze held it in contempt.\n\nHowever,\n\none human skin was gone,\n\nand the next one immediately appeared.\n\nThe shadow walked out again, appearing to Zhou Ze's left.\n\nZhou Ze's earlobe twitched slightly.\n\nHe was listening,\n\ndiscerning.\n\nIt was like a puppet show; no matter how lifelike the puppets were, there was at least one string controlling them from behind.\n\nIf you don't find that string,\n\nyou can only destroy his human skins one after another.\n\nWho knew how many of these the guy had in stock?\n\nHe gently smacked his lips.\n\nHe had only determined a general direction.\n\n*Didn't hear it clearly.*\n\nZhou Ze murmured softly to himself. Just then, the sound of a flute began to play.\n\nThe flute music,\n\nit had practically become the theme song for tonight, like an intangible nightmare looming over everyone in the bookstore, bringing with it oppression and terror.\n\nZhou Ze stood where he was,\n\nmotionless,\n\nbut his brow furrowed slightly.\n\n\"This sound...\n\nis a bit annoying.\"\n\nImmediately after,\n\nZhou Ze's two fangs began to rub against each other.\n\n\"Kacha... kacha... kacha...\"\n\nIt was the sound of teeth grinding.\n\nMany people have the habit of grinding their teeth in their sleep. It's very common, very often heard.\n\nFaced with this terrifying flute music,\n\nZhou Ze began to grind his teeth.\n\n\"Woooo... wooooo... wooooo...\"\n\nThe flute's melody was winding and graceful, twisting and turning a thousand times, plucking at the heartstrings.\n\n\"Kacha... kacha... kacha... kacha...\"\n\nThe sound of teeth grinding, er, was still the sound of teeth grinding. It had no rhythm; it seemed he was purely and simply grinding his teeth.\n\nThis seemed like a very uncoordinated confrontation, a somewhat whimsical one.\n\nBut gradually,\n\nas a crisp cracking sound came from the jade flute,\n\na fissure,\n\nactually appeared on its surface!\n\n\"Kacha... kacha... kacha...\"\n\nZhou Ze continued to grind his teeth, a smile playing on his lips, as if he were chewing gum, or perhaps watching a play from the sidelines.\n\n\"Kacha... kacha... kacha...\"\n\nThis was no longer the sound of teeth grinding,\n\nbut the sound of the jade flute cracking again and again,\n\ncarrying with it a heart-palpitating aura.\n\n\"Clack!\"\n\nZhou Ze suddenly bit down hard.\n\nAfter the most intense collision between his two fangs,\n\nthe jade flute completely shattered, breaking into two pieces!\n\nThe shadow was almost completely stunned.\n\nThen, Zhou Ze appeared in front of the shadow. The shadow didn't even resist before Zhou Ze pierced straight through its body.\n\nImmediately,\n\nit was ripped apart!\n\n\"Hsss...\"\n\nZhou Ze's earlobe trembled slightly again.\n\n*The sound, I've caught it.*\n\n*Hiding there, are you?*\n\nThe third shadow quickly appeared.\n\nBut after appearing, it was bewildered,\n\nbecause it discovered its opponent,\n\nthat Netherworld Emissary,\n\nwas no longer here.\n\nBecause Zhou Ze had already appeared by a trash can on a distant street corner,\n\nand kicked it with all his might!\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nThe trash can exploded. A person leaped out from within, taking Zhou Ze's kick head-on.\n\nThis person wore a tattered old green jacket, their figure extremely hunched. A piece of white paper was stuck to their face, but they should be an old man.\n\nThere were two holes in the white paper, perfectly allowing a pair of eyes to see out.\n\n\"Who in the world are you? You are not a Netherworld Emissary!\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't answer.\n\nHe had no interest in playing dialogue games with a dying man.\n\nAfter charging over,\n\nit was a simple and direct... steamroll!\n\nZhou Ze's body slammed into the old man. The old man's body began to retreat, crashing through one wall, but his momentum didn't cease, and he crashed through another, followed by a series of walls!\n\nOne could imagine that the next day, when those people came to work and open their shops, they would be utterly horrified to find their storefronts had been forcefully connected to the one next door. Perhaps they would even wonder what kind of audacious burglary ring would be so blatant!\n\nThe shadow appeared, landing behind the old man. The two swapped places like grafting a flower onto a tree; the old man shifted to the other side while the shadow disintegrated once more.\n\nThe two returned to their original positions,\n\nunder the shattered streetlight,\n\nfacing each other across the small road.\n\n\"Who in the world are you!\"\n\nThe old man began to ask again.\n\nZhou Ze still ignored him and charged forward once more.\n\nThe old man's body suddenly swelled up. Sheets of red paper talismans floated out from his sleeves, sticking to his body.\n\n\"Down with %￥#@% cut %% Serpent God!\"\n\nWith that great roar,\n\nthe old man's strength seemed to receive a sudden boost.\n\nThis was a superstition, and also an obsession. It could even be called a faith.\n\nWhy did the old man always like to reason and talk about the righteous path in his words and deeds? Because he needed to maintain this faith. It was his foundation, even his reason for existence, and also the source of his power.\n\nEven if he was a hypocrite, this formality, this process, this facade and slogan still had to be shouted. And it had to be shouted loudly, shouted beautifully, even to the point of hypnotizing himself.\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nTheir fists slammed into each other.\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nImmediately after,\n\nanother punch!\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nThe two exchanged several blows in a row.\n\nAfter the final exchange of fists,\n\nZhou Ze stood his ground, unmoving.\n\nThe old man, however, slid backward for more than ten meters, sparks flying from the soles of his feet. His Liberation shoes² had even caught fire, turning to ash, leaving deep grooves in the road.\n\nBut Zhou Ze was very dissatisfied.\n\nAlthough he had the upper hand,\n\nthe fact that his opponent could actually trade punches with him,\n\nmade him very uncomfortable.\n\nAt this moment,\n\nhe slightly closed his eyes,\n\nas if speaking to himself:\n\n\"Drop your guard against me. If you want my help to kill the person before you, then release all vigilance against me. Let me act a little more freely.\"\n\nAs soon as he finished speaking,\n\nan expression of enjoyment appeared on Zhou Ze's face.\n\nIt was very obvious,\n\nBoss Zhou had agreed.\n\nAs long as he could kill the old man before him,\n\nslaughter him sadistically,\n\nget revenge on him!\n\nBoss Zhou was willing to pay any price, without the slightest hesitation!\n\n\"Hssss...\"\n\nZhou Ze let out a soft moan.\n\nHis body shriveled rapidly,\n\nand the black in his eyes rippled out like thick ink.\n\nAt the same time,\n\nhis entire body slowly bent over,\n\nhis mouth opened,\n\nhis fangs and tongue,\n\nlike the most perfect and harmonious pairing.\n\nHe had entered the state he loved most, the most comfortable state.\n\n\"Roar!\"\n\nA low roar sounded,\n\nand Zhou Ze vanished from his spot.\n\nAnd at that moment,\n\nthe old man shouted: \"The righteous path in the human world is full of vicissitudes!\"³\n\nHis figure also vanished from its spot.\n\nThe next second,\n\nthe two met mid-air.\n\nFollowing that,\n\nwas:\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nIt was no longer an exchange of fists like before,\n\nnor was it an evenly matched fight.\n\nInstead, Boss Zhou had directly grabbed his opponent's ankle,\n\nand was swinging the old man around like a sandbag, smashing him into the ground relentlessly!\n\nThe speed was unimaginably fast!\n\nThis absolute suppression in both power and speed,\n\nwas something even the old man himself had never anticipated!\n\n...\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nIn the second-floor bedroom of the bookstore,\n\nthe shadow disintegrated.\n\nThe disemboweled Deathsworn knelt on the ground, his body doing nothing more than trembling lightly.\n\nXu Qingniang's face slowly emerged from the water. The bathtub was filled with his blood, but his chest still rose and fell faintly.\n\n...\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nOn another street,\n\nthe shadow shattered.\n\nThe three demon souls were almost completely transparent, with only a faint halo of light remaining.\n\nThe old Daoist, lying on the ground, struggled to lift his head,\n\na vengeful smile on his face, before his head slammed back onto the ground and he fell unconscious.\n\nThe little monkey, wiping away tears, picked up the Yin-Yang Scroll and pointed it at the demon souls.\n\nThe black cat was the first to return to the Yin-Yang Scroll.\n\nEighth Auntie and Huang Asan exchanged a look before also entering the Yin-Yang Scroll. They were too weak now; if they left this place, even wandering ghosts could pose a threat to them. So they had to bow their heads and choose to re-enter the Yin-Yang Scroll. This was also for survival!\n\nThe animals from the old mountain forest, having grown up in that environment, knew that as long as they could live, there was nothing they couldn't submit to.\n\n...\n\n\"I'll give you 'human world'!\"\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\n\"I'll give you 'righteous path'!\"\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\n\"I'll give you 'vicissitudes'!\"\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nOn both sides of the road, two pits several meters deep had been smashed out by Zhou Ze. As for the old man's body, it was already a mangled mess of flesh and blood. In most places, the white bone was completely exposed. It was truly a miserable sight.\n\n\"Back then... even... the Lord of Mount Tai... wouldn't dare... to talk to me... about... the righteous path in the human world...\"\n\nZhou Ze released his grip.\n\nThe old man, like a pile of mud, was pinned under his foot.\n\n\"Boss... is the best... boohoohoo...\"\n\nBai Yingying, hanging from a telephone pole, her breath as faint as a thread,\n\nactually forced her eyes open at this moment, shouting with joy.\n\nZhou Ze was stunned for a moment.\n\nHe turned his head,\n\nand looked at this female zombie.\n\nIn terms of life hierarchy, the gap between the two was immense. In his eyes, Bai Yingying was merely an ant. He didn't even want to be classified as a zombie alongside her; it was a form of blasphemy against him.\n\nBut looking at this high-school-girl-like zombie, whose Corpse Core had been taken out,\n\nwho was in such a state,\n\nand was still cheering him on.\n\nFor some reason,\n\nZhou Ze, as if possessed, reached out his hand,\n\nand gently tapped Bai Yingying's nose,\n\nrevealing an uncharacteristically normal smile:\n\n\"You're a cheeky one.\"\n\n---\n*Author's Note:*\nFive chapters today, the Dragon has been squeezed dry.\nEveryone, learn from the old Daoist,\ncheck your crotches,\nsee if you have any monthly tickets or cash left?\n\n***\n**Footnotes:**\n1.  **Waiting by a stump for the hare to come to him (守株待兔):** A Chinese idiom that means waiting for a stroke of luck or waiting for something to fall into one's lap without effort.\n2.  **Liberation shoes (解放鞋):** A type of sturdy, simple canvas and rubber shoe, common in China for decades, especially among laborers and soldiers.\n3.  **The righteous path in the human world is full of vicissitudes (人間正道是滄桑):** A famous line from a poem by Mao Zedong.

    "content": "Under the cover of night,\n\n  A petite figure ran swiftly through the greenbelt by the road, her form as light as a low-flying swallow.\n\n  Not long ago,\n\n  From that direction, an aura that made her heart pound had finally emerged.\n\n  Immediately after,\n\n  The dark shadow downstairs from her apartment had directly dissipated.\n\n  The little loli knew,\n\n  The matter should be over, or at least, in its final throes.\n\n  Now,\n\n  She could go and have a look.\n\n  On the street outside the bookstore,\n\n  She saw the old Daoist lying on the ground, and a monkey smearing mud all over his body.\n\n  The monkey recognized the little loli. It immediately began waving its claws and chittering, “Squeak, squeak, squeak,” then grabbed the old Daoist's clothes, trying to drag him with all its might, but to little effect.\n\n  The little loli couldn't understand its words, but she could guess what it meant.\n\n  Bending down,\n\n  She hoisted the old Daoist onto her shoulder,\n\n  As if lifting an old spicy gluten stick.¹\n\n  The scene,\n\n  Was a little hard on the eyes.\n\n  A shabby old man, being carried by a little loli like a dockworker hauling a sack of sand. The old man looked like he didn't have long to live, while the loli wore a cold, calm expression.\n\n  After carrying the old Daoist into the bookstore and placing him on the sofa, the little loli went upstairs.\n\n  Pushing open the bedroom door,\n\n  On the floor, the Deathsworn was still writhing. She remembered that at General's Mountain, the Deathsworn had also been gravely injured. This time, it was even worse; its entire body was practically torn to pieces. But like the body of a snake that had been skinned, gutted, and beheaded, it was still squirming.\n\n  This exuberant vitality,\n\n  Was truly a bit startling.\n\n  There was even a hint of envy.\n\n  Unless it was thrown into an incinerator right now, it would very likely grow back on its own, slowly but surely.\n\n  It was a very enviable ability,\n\n  But creating such a freak could only be attributed to luck.\n\n  The mysteriousness of the Japanese priest, combined with Zhou Ze's ashes from his past life mixed with rice, had inexplicably created this oddity.\n\n  Stepping around the writhing Deathsworn, the little loli saw Xu Qinglang in the bathtub. She frowned slightly, but still reached in, grabbed him, and tossed him onto the bed beside it.\n\n  Looking at the naked Old Xu, his face was pale and his breathing was faint. But as the little loli gazed at his smooth skin, for some reason, her frown deepened.\n\n  She even,\n\n  Felt an impulse to give him a Thai-style SPA with sulfuric acid.\n\n  She also bathed.\n\n  She also looked at herself in the mirror.\n\n  This body of hers was very, very young.\n\n  Still a little girl.\n\n  But his skin,\n\n  Was actually better than hers?\n\n  Thank goodness this was a civilized society. In ancient times, a man who looked like this would have probably been snatched away by some prince or nobleman to warm their bed.\n\n  Zhou Ze wasn't here. The little loli quickly jumped down from the second-floor window.\n\n  She had come looking for Zhou Ze.\n\n  Although she didn't feel she was here specifically to curry favor, since she had come, she couldn't just leave without seeing Zhou Ze.\n\n  The situation was still very serious, but it was much better than the little loli's worst-case scenario. The people in the bookstore were basically all heavily injured, but not a single one had actually kicked the bucket.\n\n  On the street on the other side, where the internet cafe was, the little loli's figure slowly materialized. She stopped. The air was thick with the smell of gunpowder and blood. And not far away, she saw Zhou Ze standing there, and Bai Yingying still hanging from the utility pole.\n\n  Oh,\n\n  She also saw the mangled, bloody thing being stepped on by Zhou Ze.\n\n  Taking a deep breath,\n\n  The little loli hesitated for a moment.\n\n  Her figure took a step forward,\n\n  And then appeared next to Zhou Ze.\n\n  Using a low, subservient posture she rarely adopted, she asked softly:\n\n  \"Is it over?\"\n\n  *Smack!*\n\n  The little loli's pupils instantly constricted.\n\n  A hand had already clamped around her neck, then pressed her down onto the road and dragged her for a distance.\n\n  And then,\n\n  Stopped.\n\n  \"What... are you... doing...\"\n\n  The little loli asked with great difficulty.\n\n  She could sense that the Zhou Ze at this moment was not Zhou Ze. But when she truly stood before this other \"Zhou Ze,\" even though she had already lowered her posture and was no longer trying to \"show off her personality\" like before, what happened next was still beyond her expectations.\n\n  \"Urgh...\"\n\n  Zhou Ze gripped the little loli's delicate neck.\n\n  His head slowly bent down.\n\n  The tip of his nose gently rubbed back and forth against her neck, as if sniffing a freshly cooked plate of crispy pork.\n\n  The little loli didn't even dare to look into Zhou Ze's eyes.\n\n  It was a gaze that made even a veteran ghost emissary like her feel her scalp tingle.\n\n  Beneath that bottomless darkness,\n\n  It felt like layers of magma could erupt at any moment.\n\n  \"I...\"\n\n  The little loli wanted to say something, but under this oppressive aura, she was at a loss for words.\n\n  On her skin,\n\n  Came a slick sensation.\n\n  He,\n\n  He was using his tongue.\n\n  The little loli tried to struggle,\n\n  But the consequence of struggling was the hand on her neck tightening much more than before.\n\n  When a dish is served,\n\n  First, you observe its appearance, then you savor its aroma.\n\n  Next,\n\n  Is to taste it!\n\n  He,\n\n  _He's going to eat me!_\n\n  A monumental sense of terror washed over the little loli's heart. At this moment, she felt as if she had returned to that night in Rongcheng, or perhaps something even worse.\n\n  \"I'm... his... subordinate...\"\n\n  The little loli explained with difficulty.\n\n  She had always looked down on that person, had never thought much of him.\n\n  Even though circumstances had forced her to become his subordinate and him her Chief, she still looked down on him from the bottom of her heart.\n\n  Only,\n\n  At this moment,\n\n  She had no choice but to bring that person up,\n\n  Hoping that it could... save her life.\n\n  The slick sensation disappeared.\n\n  Zhou Ze raised his head,\n\n  And continued to stare at her with an icy gaze.\n\n  The little loli even felt that the look in Zhou Ze's eyes was colder and more dreadful than before.\n\n  Could it be,\n\n  That bringing that person up had instead provoked this consciousness?\n\n  Then she had really just rushed headlong to her own death.\n\n  The little loli's heart plunged into an icy abyss. At the same time, she felt the hand gripping her neck continue to tighten.\n\n  *It's going to break...*\n\n  *My neck...*\n\n  \"Bang!\"\n\n  The next moment,\n\n  Zhou Ze abruptly grabbed the little loli from the ground,\n\n  And flung her into the distance.\n\n  Like a piece of stinking dog shit,\n\n  That he never wanted to see again,\n\n  Hurriedly thrown as far away as possible.\n\n  The little loli's small body slammed into a utility pole. If not for her tongue darting out to shield herself, she would have at least suffered a severe fracture.\n\n  But even so, the utility pole was snapped by the impact, and she tumbled several times in the dirt of the greenbelt.\n\n  Retracting her tongue,\n\n  The little loli struggled to her feet.\n\n  She reached up and touched the bruise on her neck.\n\n  She felt like crying but had no tears.\n\n _Goddammit,_\n\n _Do you have to be so unreasonable!_\n\n  Zhou Ze slowly walked back. It was his habit to eat something to replenish his energy after each awakening, and then turn over and go to sleep.\n\n  He walked up to the mangled body, bent down, and reached a hand underneath, fumbling around for a moment.\n\n  Then,\n\n  He pulled out a corpse pearl that glowed with a dark luster.\n\n  This was the corpse pearl the old man had just extracted from Bai Yingying.\n\n  It was the essence of Bai Yingying's life.\n\n  Looking at the thing in his hand,\n\n  Zhou Ze stuck out his tongue and licked his lips, like a starving man who had rummaged through his house for a long time and finally found something remotely edible.\n\n  He opened his mouth,\n\n  And brought the corpse pearl towards it.\n\n  To the side, Bai Yingying pursed her dry, pale lips, smacking them faintly.\n\n  That was her corpse pearl,\n\n  But she didn't dare say a thing.\n\n  The hierarchy of bloodlines,\n\n  The suppression of her lineage,\n\n  The status of her boss,\n\n  All prevented her from demanding anything from Zhou Ze, nor was she in any position to do so.\n\n  Besides,\n\n  She knew very well,\n\n  That the one standing before her now,\n\n  Was not her boss, Zhou Ze,\n\n  But another person.\n\n  Zhou Ze's hand suddenly stopped.\n\n  Then he lowered the corpse pearl.\n\n  He opened his mouth again,\n\n  And again brought it towards his lips,\n\n  But he stopped again.\n\n  In the distance, the little loli saw this and was baffled. *Why isn't he eating it?*\n\n  She knew the effects of a two-hundred-year-old corpse pearl; it worked wonders for nourishing the soul.\n\n  But such a thing was incredibly hard to find. First, jiangshi of that age were extremely rare. Second, even if you found one, it would almost certainly self-detonate its pearl rather than let its essence fall into your hands to benefit another.\n\n  Therefore, the little loli also coveted the corpse pearl. She wanted to eat it, too—like, *really* wanted to.\n\n  But she just watched Zhou Ze,\n\n  One moment bringing the corpse pearl to his lips,\n\n  The next, lowering it.\n\n  One moment bringing it to his lips again,\n\n  The next, lowering it again.\n\n  *What is he doing?*\n\n  *Is he trying to tempt someone?*\n\n  *Showing off the snack in your hand like a little kid?*\n\n  *What the hell is this?!*\n\n  Zhou Ze went back and forth several times.\n\n  Then,\n\n  He turned his head,\n\n  And looked at Bai Yingying, who was still hanging on the utility pole. He held the corpse pearl out to her.\n\n  \"Ying...\"\n\n  Bai Yingying froze for a second.\n\n  Then,\n\n  Zhou Ze brought the corpse pearl back to his own mouth.\n\n  *Uh...*\n\n  But he still didn't eat it.\n\n  He held it out to Bai Yingying's mouth again.\n\n  \"Boss... are... you... telling me... to... eat... it...\"\n\n  Zhou Ze pulled the corpse pearl back again.\n\n  He seemed very lost,\n\n  And very confused.\n\n  There was even a sense of dissonance and conflict, as if he were angry with himself.\n\n  The next moment,\n\n  Zhou Ze once again held the corpse pearl to Bai Yingying's mouth.\n\n  \"Really... giving it back... to me...\" Bai Yingying asked tentatively.\n\n  \"ROAR!\"\n\n  Zhou Ze swiftly grabbed Bai Yingying's mouth and pried it open.\n\n  Then, he forcibly stuffed the corpse pearl inside.\n\n  After stuffing it in, he raised her chin with lightning speed, forcing her to swallow.\n\n  \"Mmmph mmmph... ying ying ying...\"\n\n  Happiness coming so suddenly was one thing,\n\n  But even though the corpse pearl was her own,\n\n  To have it shoved back in such a simple and crude manner...\n\n  Bai Yingying, hanging from the utility pole, began to choke so hard her eyes rolled back in her head.\n\n  She was almost choked to death by this sudden wave of bliss.\n\n  Choking, Bai Yingying's legs instinctively straightened,\n\n  And began to kick and swing wildly.\n\n  Immediately after,\n\n  Zhou Ze opened his own mouth, revealing his fangs,\n\n  And began roaring at Bai Yingying with great dissatisfaction.\n\n  \"...\" said Yingying.\n\n  \"Boss... how about... I spit it back out... for you?\"\n\n  Hearing this, Zhou Ze seemed to become even more incensed.\n\n  He turned around,\n\n  And once again lifted the mangled body of the old man beside him.\n\n  Left, right, left,\n\n  Left, right, left,\n\n  ?\n\n  ?\n\n  ?\n\n  \"BAM!\"\n\n  \"BAM!\"\n\n  \"BAM!\"\n\n  \"BAM!\"\n\n  He smashed it viciously...\n\n***\n\n**Footnotes:**\n\n1.  **Spicy gluten stick (辣條, làtiáo):** A popular, cheap, and savory Chinese snack made from wheat gluten.

    "content": "After swallowing her Corpse Pill, Bai Yingying, though still heavily injured, had at least secured her \"source of vitality.\" As long as her core essence remained, she could slowly recover in the future.\n\nThump...\n\nBai Yingying fell from the utility pole, slowly closed her eyes, and drifted into a deep sleep. A faint luster flowed over her wounds; this was the power of the Corpse Pill slowly repairing her body. Although the process was slow, and might even come at the cost of her cultivation, things were at least heading in the right direction.\n\nZhou Ze set down the old man’s almost shapeless corpse, tossing it to the ground. He sat down as well, slowly lowering his head.\n\nThe evening breeze blew past relentlessly, ruffling Zhou Ze's hair. He just sat there, silent and still, as if he had fallen into a trance-like state.\n\nThe little loli, in the distance, remained hesitant.\n\nShe felt that the other consciousness had probably fallen into a deep sleep again, and the real Zhou Ze should be back now. But she didn't dare to go forward and confirm it. Last time, even when she had adopted a position of utter subservience, that guy had almost eaten her. And even though he didn't eat her in the end, he had still tossed her aside like a piece of trash.\n\nThis time, the little loli truly didn't dare to take the risk.\n\nBecause she could feel that when that consciousness looked at her, she saw nothing in its gaze but the pure appraisal of food. It was merely considering whether this food was tasty, whether it suited its palate. It didn't care about her identity at all—or perhaps, her identity was so insignificant that it wasn't even worth its notice.\n\nFor example, would you consider a lobster's status to be so much higher than a small yellow croaker's that you'd decide not to eat one of them?\n\nOf course, there was one thing that deeply puzzled the little loli: when that consciousness awoke, why did it give the Corpse Pill to Bai Yingying to consume?\n\nIt made no sense!\n\nCould it be the old saying, \"Stay long in a fish market and you'll no longer notice the smell\"?¹\n\nOr perhaps, when you gaze into the abyss at a salted fish, that salted fish also gazes back at you?\n\nHalf an hour passed.\n\nThe little loli stood in the flowerbed by the roadside, letting the wind blow on her for a full thirty minutes.\n\nThat goofy female zombie she had always looked down upon had long since fallen into a deep sleep, but Zhou Ze just sat there, motionless.\n\n*Have you woken up or not, for fuck's sake?*\n\n*This lady is getting real antsy waiting over here!*\n\nThe little loli bit her lip, her internal struggle growing more intense with each passing moment.\n\nShe wanted to examine the old man, to examine his corpse, to see who on earth he was. For years, he had been appearing in various places, and many Underworld Officials had reported sightings of him.\n\nHis identity had always been a mystery—where he trained, for instance, and how he had reached his current state.\n\nJust then, Zhou Ze silently reached into his pocket and took out a cigarette.\n\nHe stuck it between his lips and began fumbling for a lighter.\n\n\"!@#$%^&!!!!\"\n\nThe little loli let out a stream of curses. He was clearly awake, yet he was still sitting there striking a pose!\n\nBoss Zhou finally found his lighter.\n\nThe hand holding the cigarette trembled slightly.\n\nThat other consciousness had fallen asleep again, and he was back in control of his own body.\n\nThe only difference was that this time, he hadn't actually passed out, and he didn't seem to have many injuries.\n\nBut Zhou Ze didn't feel particularly happy about it. This meant that the other consciousness's awakenings were becoming more mature, its own self-completion more and more perfect.\n\nFortunately, the matter was resolved.\n\nYingying was fine.\n\nAs long as she was fine.\n\nBefore he could even take a puff, a wet, sloppy thing whipped over, extinguishing his cigarette and soaking the entire thing.\n\nZhou Ze was a bit stunned. He turned his head to see the little loli stomping toward him, her cheeks puffed out in anger.\n\nOnly then did he realize what had just soaked his cigarette. He immediately threw the cigarette butt away with a hint of disgust. Boss Zhou's functions in *that* department... ah, no, at least his interests in that department were still quite normal; he had no particular fetish for a \"loli flavor.\"\n\n\"Hey, Zhou Ze!\"\n\nThe haughty little loli's personality was on full display. Perhaps because she had been so thoroughly put in her place by the other consciousness, she was now all the more eager to regain some face.\n\nIt was a bit self-deceiving, but it was also human nature.\n\nEvery Underworld Official has their own personality, and this was the little loli's.\n\nZhou Ze made a \"shushing\" motion, signaling her to keep her voice down.\n\nThe little loli took a deep breath and managed to hold back her outburst.\n\nZhou Ze looked at Bai Yingying beside him and gently brushed the hair away from her earlobe. Her injuries were still severe. Even with the Corpse Pill, she wouldn't be able to recover quickly. Looking at these wounds, Zhou Ze felt a pang of heartache.\n\nEvery time he woke up after unleashing his god mode, she was the one by his side, massaging him while \"ying ying ying\"-ing, and carrying him to the bathroom for a bath.\n\nShe knew he had an obsession with cleanliness, so she was always meticulous in this regard.\n\n\"She's not going to wake up right now,\" the little loli reminded him.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head.\n\nHe pointed at the almost shapeless thing next to him and said, \"Don't wake him up.\"\n\n\"...\" The little loli.\n\n*Poof!*\n\nThe little loli's body slumped down, falling into Zhou Ze's arms, while her soul instantly flew into the distance.\n\nThe old man... he wasn't dead?\n\nIn this situation, the little loli instinctively prioritized her own life.\n\nZhou Ze's other consciousness was terrifying when it awoke, but wasn't this old man terrifying in his own right?\n\nIf even the Zhou Ze with that other consciousness couldn't kill this old man... it was too horrifying, truly too horrifying.\n\nThe old man didn't kill Underworld Officials, but now that the Underworld Official Zhou Ze had beaten him to a pulp, couldn't he make an exception?\n\nZhou Ze laid the little loli's body aside and slowly stood up. The feeling of weakness in his body was still distinct, but he walked over to the old man anyway.\n\nAt this point, you could hardly distinguish the old man's head from his legs.\n\nAfter being slammed around countless times, you could probably carve meat off him and make incredibly Bouncing Beef Balls,² because the flesh had been pounded until it was extremely sinewy.\n\nBut Zhou Ze remembered that as the other consciousness fell back into slumber, it had left him a very brief message:\n\n\"He's not dead yet.\"\n\nThis confused Zhou Ze, and it was the reason he had sat there in a daze for half an hour after waking up.\n\nFor the first twenty-nine minutes, Zhou Ze had been cursing that consciousness inside him.\n\nAs the saying goes, if you're going to help someone, see it through to the end. You beat the guy to a pulp, so why didn't you finish him off? What did you leave him here for?\n\nDon't you know that most villains in movies die because they talk too much and show off at the last moment? As a villain, if you have the chance to kill the hero, you must do it quickly, without wasting a single second running your mouth.\n\nBoss Zhou had never considered himself to be on the side of justice, so he'd been in a bit of a panic ever since he woke up.\n\nIn the final minute, Zhou Ze had finally sighed, preparing to light a cigarette to calm his nerves.\n\nThe little loli stood in the distance, her form somewhat ethereal. She was a tall, slender woman—this was her true form. To be honest, she was quite beautiful, just a bit skinny, not as voluptuous as Bai Yingying.\n\nOnly those young punks like the skin-and-bones type of young girl.\n\nA truly mature man understands just how wonderful a type like Yingying—slightly full but not cloying—really is.\n\nZhou Ze was deeply familiar with this marvelous flavor bestowed by Mother Nature.\n\nZhou Ze wasn't sure why his mind was wandering to such things at a time like this, but he still reached out and turned over the old man's body.\n\nHe was puzzled.\n\nThe old man was clearly dead.\n\nDeader than dead.\n\nWhy did *That One* specifically tell him he wasn't dead?\n\nWas it a joke?\n\n*That One* probably wasn't that bored.\n\nThe little loli mustered her courage and walked over again.\n\n*Poof.*\n\nShe returned to that small body.\n\n\"He's dead, right?\" the little loli asked.\n\n\"Yeah,\" Zhou Ze replied. \"He's definitely dead.\"\n\nWith that, Zhou Ze began to rummage through the pockets of the old man's clothes. It was a disgusting process; the old man had been beaten into \"Bouncing Beef Balls,\" and his clothes were practically fused with his flesh.\n\nBut Zhou Ze remained calm, tearing away the shredded meat and slowly feeling around until he found a pocket.\n\nOh, there was actually something inside.\n\nHe took it out. It was a household registration book and a unit introduction letter.\n\n\"The concept of an ID card only started in the eighties,\" the little loli explained from the side. \"For a long time after the Liberation, there were no ID cards. People relied on household registration books and unit introduction letters to prove their identity.\"\n\nIgnoring the fact that she had just revealed her age, the little loli snatched the documents from Zhou Ze's hand to examine them.\n\nOf course, Zhou Ze wasn't surprised by the little loli's age. Although she inhabited the body of a little girl and her soul appeared as a young woman, she had told him before about that business of \"passing from the left hand to the right hand.\"³ Considering the era she was talking about, she had to have been at least thirty at the time.\n\nTherefore, the little loli's real age likely made her a... mature lady.\n\n\"Liu Yuanfang, born in '42, which means he'd be seventy-six this year. The unit introduction letter is blurry... looks like he was an employee at some farm. An employee of a farm turned into... this?\"\n\n\"Don't be hasty.\"\n\nZhou Ze spoke as he pulled something else from the old man's body. It was a black and white cover, somewhat like a notice. He flipped it to the front, revealing a line of text.\n\n\"What's that?\" the little loli asked from the side.\n\n\"A death certificate. Liu Yuanfang, died of illness.\" Zhou Ze scratched his head, continuing with disbelief, \"According to the date of death on here, this old man has been dead for forty-two years.\"\n\nA man who had been dead for forty-two years had just nearly wiped out the entire bookstore. He had come within a minute or two of turning Boss Zhou into a commander with no soldiers.\n\n\"Could this thing be a fake?\"\n\n\"Carry a fake around with him? To take the high-speed rail?\" Zhou Ze retorted.\n\nAt this moment, Boss Zhou began to stroke his chin, pondering the words *That One* had left him before falling asleep:\n\n*He's not dead yet...*\n\n---\n**Footnotes:**\n\n1.

    "content": "The morning sun sprinkled down, bringing with it the initial warmth and beauty of a new day.\n\nBy the window on the first floor of the bookstore,\n\nfor the first time ever, no one was lying there.\n\nOn the coffee table, there was no coffee or tea that would have otherwise been a certainty at this time of day.\n\nNor was there a neatly ironed newspaper spread out.\n\nThere was no old man in a Taoist robe following the long legs and perky butts of a fitness video, huffing and puffing along with the exercises.\n\nNor was there a man prettier than any woman, sitting there performing his “morning wake-up” skincare routine.\n\nThere was no maid bustling back and forth.\n\nNor were there any of those adorable, heart-tickling, coquettish \"ying-ying-ying\" sounds.\n\nAnd in the corner,\n\nthere was no heavy-duty cosplay enthusiast sitting motionless, yet ever-watchful of the bookstore’s surroundings.\n\nThis bookstore,\n\nit seemed to be missing something.\n\n…………\n\nOn the other hand,\n\nBoss Zhou was busy.\n\nVery, very busy.\n\nHis \"salted fish\"¹ life had to be put on pause, not because he was inspired to strive for greatness, but because ever since that night, his bookstore had been reduced to a one-man operation.\n\nOh,\n\nwait,\n\nthere was also a little monkey.\n\nDonning the white doctor's coat he hadn't worn in ages and holding a scalpel that felt slightly unfamiliar in his hand, Boss Zhou carefully cleaned the old Taoist's wounds and changed his bandages.\n\nThe old Taoist had several broken bones and severe external injuries. Although the monkey's mud was keeping him alive, treating his other injuries was still rather complex.\n\nFortunately, while Boss Zhou was long out of practice, he had, after all, been an exceptionally skilled surgeon in his past life. With him personally handling the treatment, the problems weren't too great.\n\nThe old Taoist had woken up before. A while back, he had woken for a moment before immediately falling back asleep. When the body needs to recover, sleep is in fact very important. Sometimes, when the old Taoist woke in the middle of the night, whimpering and groaning in pain, the little monkey would run over to give him some water or feed him small pieces of fruit.\n\nToday, when Zhou Ze was changing his dressings, the old Taoist was awake. It seemed his recovery was going well.\n\nThe old Taoist had always raised the little monkey like a grandson, and the monkey was now repaying the favor. At the very least, it made the old Taoist feel that he had someone to serve and accompany him on his sickbed, so it wasn't a loss.\n\nHmm,\n\nanother thing was that Zhou Ze had recently answered several calls for the old Taoist. They were all from students in the mountains he sponsored, or their parents, asking why this month's sponsorship money hadn't arrived yet. After taking a few of these calls, Zhou Ze simply turned the phone off.\n\nOld Xu was lying in his room, receiving an IV drip. He didn't have many external wounds, but some of his internal organs had suffered varying degrees of damage. To a large extent, this kind of damage was irreversible; at least, modern medicine had no way to actively repair or restore it.\n\nFor his problem, Zhou Ze had only adopted a conservative treatment method. Everything would have to wait until he woke up.\n\nDeadpool was placed in a glass container, squirming on his own. Zhou Ze wasn't too worried about him. Walking past, he picked up a nearby bottle of glucose and poured half of it in. Watching those chunks of flesh constantly writhing and squeezing against each other was truly enough to make one's scalp tingle.\n\nFortunately, Boss Zhou was already used to it. He drank the remaining half of the glucose as he walked. Even after a week, Zhou Ze still wasn't accustomed to starting work so early in the morning.\n\nBai Yingying's sickroom was the most meticulously arranged. The furnishings inside had been redone in a pink theme, with many paper cranes and other such things hanging from above.\n\nFor her, there was no need for surgery or similar treatments. Modern medicine taught how to treat human problems; there was no discipline for treating zombies.\n\nPutting down the glucose bottle, Zhou Ze sat down beside Bai Yingying. His fingernails had grown out a tiny bit. He began to give her physical therapy massage.\n\nOnly his own fingernails could produce any stimulation for her, a technique somewhat similar to acupuncture. A normal massage wouldn't even count as scratching an itch for her.\n\nThe massage lasted for about forty minutes. Sweat beaded on Zhou Ze's forehead. He then covered Bai Yingying with a blanket, went downstairs to the bathroom, and took a shower.\n\nAfter changing his clothes, Zhou Ze came back up carrying a towel and a plastic basin. He returned to Bai Yingying's bedroom, first removing her clothes, then dipping the towel in hot water to wipe down her body.\n\nIn the past, Bai Yingying had always done this for him. This time, it was his turn to do it for her.\n\nYingying's injuries, at least from the outside, appeared to have healed. But the internal damage and the loss of vital energy were still immense.\n\nRegarding this, Zhou Ze could only try to transfer some baleful qi to her while holding her to sleep each night, but for some reason, he hadn't succeeded for several nights in a row.\n\nThe girl's body was beautiful, like a work of art from the Creator. Boss Zhou wasn't exactly Liu Xiahui,² so it would be a lie to say he wasn't moved at all, but he was able to restrain the wild thoughts in his mind and get done what needed to be done.\n\nHe made rounds on each patient twice a day. By the time he finished, it was already afternoon. Boss Zhou truly felt as if he were back working at the hospital again.\n\nAnd besides, the feeling of returning to his old profession wasn't bad. Zhou Ze even found himself wondering if he should open a clinic someday.\n\nReturning to the first floor, he poured a glass of iced water, sipped it slowly, and half-reclined to rest for a bit.\n\nA taxi pulled up outside, and the little loli hopped out and walked into the bookstore.\n\nDuring this time,\n\nZhou Ze was in charge of looking after the patients, so the task of investigating the old man's affairs had been given to the bear loli to carry out.\n\nAs for the old man's \"Pissing Beef Ball\"³ corpse, aside from keeping a few scraps of flesh as samples, Zhou Ze had it cremated directly. He couldn't risk leaving a complete body behind; it would be troublesome if any more unexpected problems arose.\n\n\"Find anything?\"\n\nZhou Ze lit a cigarette and exhaled a smoke ring.\n\n\"Same as before. The old man was indeed long dead, and his household registration was canceled. I also visited some elderly folks, and they could confirm it. As for whether his identity was borrowed, although the old man had no direct descendants, I found a nephew of his. I used the flesh scraps you kept to extract DNA for comparison, and it proves they are indeed related by blood.\"\n\n\"So, his identity wasn't borrowed. It really was him?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Now that's interesting. A major figure in the world of metaphysics, always carrying his old identification, with a well-documented first half of his life. What on earth was he planning by arranging things this way?\"\n\n\"I don't know either.\"\n\nJust then, the little monkey suddenly scampered downstairs, grabbed the hem of Zhou Ze's clothes, and started chittering, \"Squeak, squeak, squeak.\"\n\n\"What is it?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nThe little monkey just kept pulling at Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze nodded and followed the little monkey up to the second floor, into the old Taoist's room.\n\nThe old Taoist's eyes were open, and his complexion was decent. Seeing Zhou Ze enter, he said with a solemn face:\n\n\"Boss, please forgive your subordinate for being injured and unable to perform the proper salutations.\"\n\nThe corner of Zhou Ze's mouth twitched.\n\nHe suddenly felt the urge to go over and beat him up again.\n\n\"What is it?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Boss, this humble Taoist wishes to get out of bed for a walk. I've been lying here for almost a week and want to go out for some fresh air.\"\n\nThis was a very normal request from an old man.\n\nWhether in a hospital, a nursing home, or in front of one's own children,\n\nit was the most normal of requests.\n\nHowever,\n\nZhou Ze was not a nurse, a caregiver, or the old Taoist's son.\n\nTo ask Zhou Ze to push the old Taoist out for a stroll, make small talk, and lament how beautiful the setting sun is,\n\nthat was really asking too much of Boss Zhou.\n\n\"Fine.\"\n\nZhou Ze agreed.\n\nThe old Taoist was stunned.\n\nHe had only tentatively made the request, but he never expected the Boss to actually agree!\n\nFor a moment,\n\nthe old Taoist was overcome with the urge of \"a scholar who would die for one who truly knows him.\"\n\nIndeed,\n\na long road tests a horse's strength; time reveals a person's heart.\n\nThe Boss was actually a very kind-hearted person. His own bleeding and sweating for the bookstore had not been in vain!\n\nZhou Ze helped the old Taoist up from the bed and slowly led him downstairs, first settling him down to lie on the sofa.\n\nThe old Taoist was deeply gratified.\n\nAs he stroked the monkey's head and watched Zhou Ze's back,\n\nin a daze,\n\nhe felt as if his own son and grandson were right there by his side.\n\nOf course,\n\nthe old Taoist didn't dare say such a thing out loud, or he'd probably get beaten up by Zhou Ze and sent right back to bed.\n\nBut what happened next,\n\nleft the old Taoist dumbfounded.\n\nHe saw Zhou Ze push a wheelchair out from the storeroom.\n\nThis wheelchair,\n\nit looked so damn familiar!\n\nIt looked like the very same wheelchair he had specially bought for the Boss.\n\nNo way.\n\nIt can't be.\n\nThis is impossible…\n\nZhou Ze walked over and lifted the old Taoist.\n\n\"Boss, this... this...\"\n\n\"What's wrong?\"\n\n\"This humble Taoist suddenly feels that resting properly in bed is better. I shouldn't go out and cause trouble, and I wouldn't want to distract you and make you worry, right?\"\n\n\"Getting out for some fresh air will be good for your recovery.\"\n\n\"Er... Boss, really, there's no need. Let's not go to all this trouble,\" the old Taoist's face was twisted like a pretzel.\n\n\"It's fine, it's no trouble.\"\n\n\"Please don't, Boss! This is improper, truly improper! This is the wheelchair this humble Taoist bought for you as a sign of respect. How can I sit in it so presumptuously? It's not appropriate, not appropriate at all.\"\n\n\"It's fine. Don't be so polite.\"\n\nWith that,\n\nZhou Ze placed the old Taoist onto the wheelchair.\n\n\"Lin Ke, open the door,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nLin Ke, standing by the entrance, opened the bookstore's door.\n\n\"Don't... don't... don't do this... Boss... You can't... It's not allowed... I... I refuse...\"\n\nZhou Ze ignored the old Taoist's words.\n\nHe pressed the button for him.\n\nThe next moment,\n\nthe wheelchair started up with a \"doot-doot-doot\" sound, and at the same time, began to play a lovely tune:\n\n\"I have a little donkey, I never, ever ride.\nOne day on a whim, I rode him to the fair.\nWith a little whip in my hand, I was feeling so proud...\"\n\nThe old Taoist's face turned beet red, the same color as the monkey's ass. He was truly on the verge of tears. He himself had bought this model of wheelchair back then, bought it for Zhou Ze to use.\n\nBut he had never imagined,\n\nthat he himself would one day be sitting in it.\n\n\"Doot-doot-doot-doot...\"\n\nThe electric wheelchair carried the old Taoist straight out of the bookstore.\n\nAnd just like that, the old Taoist sat in the electric wheelchair playing a children's song as it entered the bustling South Street pedestrian mall in broad daylight,\n\nto be reviewed by the people.\n\n***\n\n**Footnotes:**\n\n1.  **\"Salted fish\" (鹹魚):** A popular Chinese internet slang for someone who is lazy, unmotivated, and prefers to just lie around, much like a dried, salted fish.\n2.  **Liu Xiahui (柳下惠):** A famous official from the Spring and Autumn period of China, renowned for his impeccable moral character.

    "content": "\"So, what now?\"\n\nTo get back to business, after the Old Taoist left in his electric wheelchair, the little loli sat down behind the bar, still very much concerned about the matter with the old man.\n\nThe old man didn't usually kill Hell's Envoys, but Zhou Ze's conflict with him had basically become a fight to the death. If the old man really wasn't dead, it would be a very tricky problem if he came looking for trouble again later.\n\nThere's no sense in guarding against a thief for a thousand days, and the little loli considered herself and Zhou Ze to be grasshoppers on the same string.¹ She had no choice but to be concerned, no choice but to take this matter to heart.\n\nBecause, knowing Zhou Ze's personality, if the day ever came when he was about to die, he definitely wouldn't mind dragging her down with him.\n\n\"I don't know what to do either. Surely you don't expect me to wake him up again right now just to ask for details?\"\n\nThe little loli remained silent.\n\nTo wake that consciousness again just to ask about this… Zhou Ze wouldn't do that. It would be too extravagant, too much of a waste.\n\nBesides, Zhou Ze had a feeling that since that consciousness had chosen to return to its slumber, it must have at least dealt with the immediate trouble. It wouldn't have left him a ticking time bomb set to go off in the short term.\n\n\"I'm heading back. You be careful. If you need anything, you can call me.\" The little loli hopped off her seat. Seeing that she couldn't get any more information out of him, she decided to go home.\n\n\"Don't worry, I won't be a stranger.\"\n\nThe little loli pouted.\n\n\"My mom is going for a new round of psychotherapy today. I have to be there to watch, or something might really go wrong.\"\n\n\"What kind of wrong?\"\n\n\"She might kill my dad, then roast and eat him,\" the little loli said with a helpless air.\n\n\"You're really getting into character,\" Zhou Ze remarked with curiosity.\n\n\"Well, that's something that's very hard to control,\" the little loli said, unconcerned. \"Especially when you're willing to immerse yourself in the role, to enjoy the feelings it brings you, you subconsciously sink into it. But I'll find a way to solve it before I get too deep and cause a real problem. For example, by switching to a different post.\"\n\nWith that, the little loli looked at Zhou Ze and pleaded, \"So, I really hope you can get your act together and become a Chief Constable soon. That would give me more room to maneuver.\n\n\"I really don't want to end up a tragedy like your little sister-in-law, who foolishly lost all sense of self.\"\n\n\"Mhm.\"\n\n\"Oh, right, speaking of which, I almost forgot. How are things between you and that doctor of yours? Did you sign the divorce papers?\n\n\"Seeing you lazing around the bookstore like a contented salted fish, forgetting all your troubles,²\n\n\"I almost forgot you're a man with a leading lady.\"\n\n\"Just go home and keep an eye on your mom. Don't let her chop off your dad's junk and serve it up as cold-tossed gluten.\"\n\nThe little loli walked to the door.\n\nShe held up her two small fists toward Zhou Ze.\n\nOne fist she shook back and forth.\n\nFrom the other, she slowly raised her middle finger.\n\nFinally, she gave Zhou Ze the finger.\n\n\"Scumbag.\"\n\n\"I never even slept with her,\" Zhou Ze retorted.\n\n\"Heh heh.\"\n\nThe little loli's gaze slowly drifted downward,\n\nlocking onto the indescribable delta region.\n\nThen she narrowed her eyes,\n\nas if she had seen through everything.\n\n\"Your mind is so unhealthy for someone so young. Looks like the government's internet crackdown isn't strict enough. Look at you kids, so precocious.\"\n\nZhou Ze was showing her the door.\n\nThe little loli shook her head, clasping her hands behind her back with the air of a little adult. She was still endearingly cute, but as she pushed open the bookstore door, she stopped again and said:\n\n\"Zhou Ze, you said I'm being influenced by this vessel. I admit that.\n\n\"What about you?\"\n\n\"Xu Le's influence?\" Zhou Ze asked. \"He ceased to exist a long time ago.\"\n\nPerhaps there was a little influence in the very beginning, but Zhou Ze had long since erased it. The person he was now was just Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Oh.\"\n\nThe little loli acknowledged.\n\n\"What if… it isn't Xu Le?\"\n\n\"What are you trying to say?\"\n\nThe little loli pursed her lips. That night a week ago, when Zhou Ze had entered that \"zombie\" state, he had held the Corpse Pill, hesitating, bringing it first to her lips, then to Bai Yingying's, back and forth. Did that mean something, too?\n\nOne body,\n\ntwo consciousnesses.\n\nIs it really possible for them not to influence each other?\n\nIn the end, the little loli said nothing more and walked out of the bookstore.\n\nZhou Ze lit another cigarette and smoked for a while.\n\nJust then, his phone suddenly rang. He picked it up and saw it was a call from the Old Taoist.\n\nSpeaking of which,\n\nthe Old Taoist had been out for quite a while now, cruising around in his children's-song-playing electric wheelchair. Why wasn't he back yet?\n\nCould he have gotten lost in the thrill of showing off his ride to the world?\n\n\"Hello.\"\n\n\"Boss, do me a favor, will ya? My wheelchair is stuck.\"\n\n\"Then find a kind person nearby to help you push it out, and then you can 'doot doot doot' your way back.\"\n\n\"Er, I'm too embarrassed,\" the Old Taoist said shyly.\n\n\"A man who sells Hell money as real currency can be too embarrassed?\"\n\n\"That's not it. Uh, Boss, there's something else I need your help with. If it were nighttime, I'd have sent the little monkey, but it's still broad daylight, so it's not convenient for him to come out.\"\n\n\"Where are you?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nThe Old Taoist was still recovering from his injuries, so Boss Zhou had no choice but to look after him.\n\n\"Boss, I'll share my location with you. I'm not far from the bookstore.\"\n\nThe Old Taoist was indeed not far. Zhou Ze only had to walk about seven or eight hundred meters before he saw him.\n\nThe wheelchair's wheel was stuck in a sewer grate. Zhou Ze walked over, gave it a lift and a hard push, and the wheelchair came free.\n\n\"Heading back?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Over there.\"\n\nThe Old Taoist pointed to an ATM up ahead.\n\nZhou Ze nodded and pushed the Old Taoist into the ATM booth.\n\nThe Old Taoist took out a piece of paper, on which was a long list of names and multi-digit numbers.\n\n\"Want me to type it in for you?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Uhm…\"\n\nThe Old Taoist clutched the card in his hand and gave Zhou Ze an embarrassed look.\n\nThe meaning was clear.\n\n*I don't trust you.*\n\n*Who asked you to be the poorest person in the entire bookstore?*\n\nZhou Ze licked his lips. He wasn't angry about it. Instead, he opened the booth door, planning to go buy a pack of cigarettes.\n\nJust then, as the Old Taoist reached for the ATM, his phone fell out from under his armpit.\n\nZhou Ze bent down to pick it up for him.\n\n\"I'm going to buy a pack of cigarettes.\"\n\n\"Okay, Boss.\"\n\nWalking to the convenience store across the street, Zhou Ze asked for a pack of cigarettes. As he was paying, a phone rang. He glanced at his own phone first and saw it wasn't his, then remembered he was holding the Old Taoist's.\n\nZhou Ze answered the call.\n\n\"Hello, he's not here right now. Please call back later.\"\n\n\"What do you mean he's not here! What kind of excuse is that! Does a swindler need to put on a virtuous act now?\"\n\nZhou Ze frowned slightly and asked back, \"Did he scam you out of money?\"\n\nThe Old Taoist had always been a bit unscrupulous in his dealings, like selling Hell money during his livestreams. It wasn't impossible that a customer had come to their senses and was now looking for trouble.\n\nOf course, the people willing to spend money on Hell money in a livestream were mostly just joining in on the fun and novelty. It was unlikely anyone took it seriously.\n\n\"Of course he did! He scammed me out of twenty thousand!\"\n\n*You bought that much Hell money?*\n\n*Are you an idiot?* Zhou Ze thought to himself.\n\nWhile thinking, Zhou Ze paid for the cigarettes and walked out of the convenience store. The Old Taoist was still at the ATM, checking the paper as he keyed in the numbers.\n\n\"Are you going to pay up or not! Don't you go back on your word! I'm telling you, you can't be like this!\"\n\n\"I'm his friend. He's not here right now. I'll have him call...\"\n\n\"Damn it, still lying, still trying to fool me!\n\n\"It was that old bastard who promised!\n\n\"He said he'd sponsor my kid's education, that as long as my kid got into college, he'd provide another twenty thousand a year!\n\n\"Now the scores are out, my kid made the cutoff for a second-tier university. Where's the money? Where is it?\n\n\"Where's the twenty thousand he promised?\n\n\"Ten thousand for tuition, and ten thousand for living expenses.\n\n\"Where's the money?\"\n\n\"What did you say?\"\n\n*So it's not about being scammed?*\n\n\"What are you playing dumb for? Tell that old bastard that if he doesn't send the money, he'll have ruined me!\n\n\"I was originally planning to have my kid go to work after middle school.\n\n\"Look at the other kids who went to work back then.\n\n\"They've already built new houses, gotten married, and had kids of their own.\n\n\"Only my kid is pitiful, and I'm pitiful too.\n\n\"I was a fool back then, blinded by greed,³ believing that old bastard's words. He sent sponsorship money every month and tricked my kid into going to high school for three years.\n\n\"And now, after all this, the college entrance exams are over, the scores are out, and he's backing out!\n\n\"That son of a bitch old bastard.\n\n\"His phone won't connect, and no one's answering. He's trying to disappear, isn't he?\n\n\"If you can't play the part of a Bodhisattva, then don't. If you can't be a good person, then don't. I hate hypocrites like that most of all—the kind who want a monument to their virtue after acting like a whore.\n\n\"Isn't it just because college costs twenty thousand a year? He can't bear to part with it, can he? Why didn't he say so earlier!\"\n\n\"He's your child. If he got in, just let him go,\" Zhou Ze's tone had turned cold.\n\n\"Go my ass! I'm up to my eyeballs in gambling debt myself! Where am I supposed to get the money for him to go to college!\n\n\"Besides, what's the use of being a college graduate these days? The streets are full of college grads who can't find jobs. What's the point of going to this money-losing college!\n\n\"You tell that old bastard,\n\n\"If the money doesn't arrive, I'm burning my kid's acceptance letter and sending him out to work!\"\n\nZhou Ze hung up the phone.\n\nHe wanted to curse someone out.\n\nBut then he decided against it.\n\nHe had come from an orphanage. His tuition up to middle school had been waived by the local government. After starting high school, he and Wang Ke had worked every winter and summer break. Even in college, he had gritted his teeth and worked his way through with part-time jobs.\n\nBack then, Zhou Ze\n\nhad never met a kind person who would sponsor him.\n\nHe pulled open the door to the ATM booth.\n\nHe looked at the Old Taoist, who was sitting in his wheelchair, enduring the pain in his body while transferring money to one account after another. The guy's story about wanting to get some fresh air was a lie; the truth was he wanted to come out and send money.\n\nA sudden surge of anger rose in Zhou Ze, and he said directly:\n\n\"Are you sending money to the students you sponsor?\"\n\n\"That's right. I'm late this time. Usually, I send the money at the beginning of the month so the kids can get it early and focus on their studies.\n\n\"There are seven more who got into college this year. I promised them I'd cover their tuition and living expenses.\n\n\"I've been delayed for a long time this round. The kids must be getting anxious.\"\n\n\"You don't have any children of your own. Why are you raising a bunch of ungrateful brats?\n\n\"If you have money, you'd be better off buying more snacks for your monkey. Look who's been by your bedside taking care of you these past few days while you've been injured.\n\n\"And another thing, those bastards call you up like debt collectors. Not a single one asked if you were injured or sick or if something had happened.\"\n\nThe Old Taoist didn't dare to talk back. He just continued keying in the next account number.\n\n\"What's wrong with you?!\"\n\nZhou Ze reached out and slapped the paper right out of the Old Taoist's hand.\n\nOn the paper that fell to the floor, from top to bottom, were over a hundred names, which also meant over a hundred accounts that needed transfers.\n\nZhou Ze finally understood why the Old Taoist, despite earning so much from his livestreams, was always so stingy. It'd be a miracle if anyone could live comfortably with so many bloodsucking leeches on their back!\n\n\"Sigh.\"\n\nThe Old Taoist still didn't dare to argue with Zhou Ze.\n\nHe just tried his best to bend down and pick up the paper.\n\nZhou Ze's anger turned into a sneer. The Old Taoist was usually such a clever and worldly person; how could he be so stupid at a time like this?\n\nStepping outside the glass door, Zhou Ze lit a cigarette and took a heavy drag.\n\n*Clang!*\n\nTrying to pick up the paper, the Old Taoist fell out of his wheelchair. He clutched his chest in agony with one hand while still reaching for the paper with the other.\n\nGrinding the cigarette butt under his heel, Zhou Ze gritted his teeth,\n\npushed the door open, and walked back in.\n\nFirst, he helped the Old Taoist up.\n\nThen, he picked up the white paper and handed it back to him.\n\n\"Go on, send it! Go on!\n\n\"Back when I was in school,\n\n\"how come I never ran into a fucking idiot like you!\"\n\n---\n**Footnotes:**\n1.  **Grasshoppers on the same string:** A Chinese idiom (一根繩上的螞蚱) meaning to be in the same boat or share the same fate.\n2.  **Contented salted fish, forgetting all your troubles:** A combination of two Chinese slang/idioms. \"Salted fish\" (鹹魚) refers to someone lazy and without ambition. \"Forgetting all your troubles\" is a loose translation of `樂不思蜀` (lè bù sī shǔ), an idiom about being so happy in a new place that one forgets their home and responsibilities.\n3.  **Blinded by greed:** A loose translation of the idiom `吃了豬油蒙了心` (chīle zhūyóu méngle xīn), which literally means \"to have one's heart covered by lard,\" implying being foolishly avaricious.",

    "content": "The money belonged to the Old Daoist; he could spend it however he pleased. Zhou Ze didn't comment on it, nor did he have any right to.\n\nAfter all, while the Old Daoist was technically his employee, he had never drawn a single cent of salary from him. Sometimes, when going on \"business trips\" with Zhou Ze, the Old Daoist even had to pay out of his own pocket.\n\nBesides, discussions about things like \"ungrateful wretches\"¹ or whether it was \"worth it\" were pointless with the Old Daoist.\n\nHe was a man who had lived to seventy; he'd traveled far and wide—what kind of storms hadn't he weathered?\n\nHe'd met people from all walks of life—what kind of person hadn't he encountered?\n\nHe wasn't some credulous old man or woman falling for a lottery scam to get a small advantage. Perhaps, the man himself knew everything perfectly well and was simply practicing the rare art of playing the fool.\n\nOnce the Old Daoist finished wiring the money, transfer by transfer, Zhou Ze pushed his wheelchair and took him back to the bookstore. On the way, the Old Daoist stopped by a convenience store to buy some snacks for the monkey.\n\nBack at the bookstore, Zhou Ze washed and disinfected his hands, then changed into a white coat. He checked on the physical conditions of the Old Daoist, Old Xu, and Bai Yingying one by one. By the time he was done, it was already evening.\n\nHe took off the white coat, let out a long breath, and went into the bathroom to wash his face.\n\nAfraid? Of course, he was afraid.\n\nThat night, a week ago, he had truly been on the verge of becoming a \"lone survivor.\" His past life had already been mostly reduced to ashes. In this life, he had finally managed to find his rhythm again, but that old man had nearly forced him to \"start from zero\" all over again.\n\nFeeling the cold water stinging his face, Zhou Ze shook his head and reached for a towel to dry himself.\n\nBut just then, Zhou Ze saw a black shadow appear in the mirror. The towel in his hand instantly fell.\n\nHe spun around, but there was no one behind him.\n\nHe turned back, and the black shadow in the mirror was also gone.\n\nIt wasn't a hallucination, nor could it be. Zhou Ze was very confident in his \"strong heart\" now; he wasn't so fragile as to be spooked by shadows.\n\nHe pushed open the bathroom door. Before he could even step out, a familiar, aged voice came from within the bathroom:\n\n\"Are you looking for me?\"\n\nThis time, Zhou Ze didn't turn around. Instead, he angled his body slightly and said:\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nHe...\n\n...wasn't dead after all.\n\nThe one inside him had been right. He wasn't dead.\n\nHe had appeared again.\n\nZhou Ze was somewhat astonished. He had originally thought that even if the one inside him hadn't managed to kill the old man completely, he would at least have ensured the man wouldn't reappear for a short while. Who would have thought that after only a week, he would return like a \"lingering ghost\"?\n\nHowever, this time, it seemed a little different.\n\nThat night, when facing this old man, he could clearly sense the extreme, fanatical obsession emanating from him. This time, however, the other man seemed excessively clean and pure, as if he had been purified.\n\nWhat was once a jar of aged vinegar was now a pool of clear water.\n\nBut the old man was still the old man. His appearance was a mystery, his history was a mystery, and even his death was a mystery.\n\nThe fact that the one inside him could only leave behind the words \"he's not dead yet\" before falling back into slumber was proof enough of his peculiarity. Otherwise, given that one's nature, he would have surely eradicated him, root and stem.\n\nHe couldn't be bothered with stirring up too much trouble, even while he was still recovering. But that \"I'm the most awesome being in the universe\" adolescent-delusion aura of his was practically off the charts; he didn't give a damn about anyone, even less tactful than the Monkey from *Journey to the West*.\n\n\"You killed me, so I thought I'd come and see you. But it's a bit strange. You don't seem surprised at all that I'm not dead.\"\n\n\"You really are a piece of sticky toffee,\"² Zhou Ze said with a sigh.\n\n\"Heh heh.\" The old man chuckled, and then his voice changed, moving from near to far.\n\nZhou Ze looked up and saw the old man's figure standing at the bookstore's entrance. He seemed to be waiting for Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze walked over and pushed open the bookstore door.\n\n\"I died a long time ago. I was already dead before you killed me,\" the old man said calmly.\n\nHe was still wearing the green overcoat, and on his feet were the same mud-stained Liberation Shoes. He seemed slightly ill at ease, his face carrying a kind of innate honesty and shyness.\n\nBut it was this very same old man who,\na week ago,\nhad nearly killed everyone in the bookstore except for Zhou Ze.\n\nIf Zhou Ze had been just an ordinary Emissary of Hell, perhaps none of it could have been changed.\n\nZhou Ze walked out of the bookstore.\n\n\"I died forty-two years ago.\"\n\n\"Nineteen seventy-six,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Yes, the year the turmoil ended.\"\n\nThe old man turned, took two steps forward, and walked to a bus stop, standing with the people waiting for the bus home from work.\n\nZhou Ze glanced back at the bookstore, hesitating. Was this a ploy to lure the tiger from the mountain?\n\nBut after a moment, Zhou Ze followed him.\n\nThe old man's appearance this time felt very different. Besides, he didn't need to lure the tiger from the mountain. The fact that he could suddenly appear in the very bathroom Zhou Ze was in meant that if the old man still had the ability to \"kill,\" Xu Qinglang and Bai Yingying wouldn't be safe whether Zhou Ze was at the bookstore or not.\n\nSome things, ultimately, had to be asked and understood.\n\nZhou Ze couldn't live the rest of his life like a character in a detective novel, where everyone in the bookstore had to eat, live, and travel together, never separating, lest the killer be given an opportunity.\n\nThat kind of life was too exhausting,\n\nand also unrealistic.\n\nA bus pulled up. Some people got off, but more got on. This was South Street, the city center, and it was always crowded, especially now at the peak of the evening commute.\n\nThe old man looked back at Zhou Ze, smiled, and got on the bus.\n\nZhou Ze followed him, dropped two coins into the fare box, and walked further in. His eyes remained fixed on the old man, wanting to know what tricks he had up his sleeve this time.\n\nThe bus was crowded, so Zhou Ze stood, just like the old man.\n\n\"That night, I lost. The one inside you is too powerful,\" the old man said peacefully, as if he could take victory and defeat in stride.\n\n\"But... no matter how powerful you are, you can't kill me,\" the old man stated. There was no trace of smugness in his words; he was as calm as if he were merely stating a fact.\n\nHe wasn't like a person anymore.\n\nHe really wasn't like a person.\n\nThe old man who loved to lecture, who saw himself as a purveyor of truth, who liked to place himself on a moral high ground in every matter—\n\nthe man before him now and the one who had appeared a week ago...\n\n...were like two completely different people.\n\n\"What exactly are you?\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't ask who he was, but *what* he was.\n\nClearly, Zhou Ze had noticed something unusual, as if he was beginning to understand.\n\nThe old man...\n\n...didn't seem to be a person.\n\n\"What exactly am I?\" The old man pointed a finger at himself. \"I am a thing that, though already dead, continues to exist.\n\nMy appearance was an accident, so accidental that I myself have forgotten how I came to be.\n\nMy end has come many times, including the last time at your hands. After so many times, I've also forgotten when the true end will be.\n\nI'm not showing off, nor am I flaunting. I myself am tired of it, but every time I die, I can come back, and sooner or later, I will.\n\nOf course,\n\nthe next time I come back, I probably won't look like this.\"\n\nThe bus stopped at the next station, and another wave of people got on.\n\nAn old woman, probably in her sixties, got on the bus, walked further in, and stopped in front of Zhou Ze.\n\nThe bus started moving again, and the cabin began to sway.\n\n\"Move. Let me sit. My legs are killing me.\"\n\nThe old woman standing before Zhou Ze pointed at a girl in the seat.\n\nThe girl seemed to have heard, but she had been keeping her eyes closed. She kept them closed as the old woman approached. She didn't want to give up her seat, but she also felt bad about not giving it to an elderly person, so she pretended not to see.\n\nBeside the girl was a plastic bag, which likely contained the work uniform of a salesclerk from a nearby mall. She had probably been on her feet all day and was just heading home, exhausted herself.\n\n\"Hey, I'm talking to you!\"\n\nThe old woman reached out and pulled the girl's hair.\n\nThe girl's eyes snapped open, looking baffled. She clearly hadn't expected the old woman to be so direct.\n\n\"Do you know what manners are?\n\nDo you know what it means to respect the old and care for the young?\n\nI'm this old, I walk all the way over to you, and you still pretend to be asleep and not see me? What's the point of that?\n\nDon't you have elders at home?\n\nDidn't your family teach you how to be a decent person when you were little?\"\n\nThe girl's face flushed bright red, but she still got up and moved out of the way.\n\nThe old woman, like a victorious rooster, held her head high as she sat down and began to rub her calves. But her mouth didn't stop:\n\n\"I'm educating you on behalf of your parents, teaching you how to be a person.\n\nYou're not married yet, right? I guess I'm helping your future in-laws teach you a lesson.\n\nYoung people these days,\n\nevery single one of them doesn't know what manners are, doesn't know how to respect the old and care for the young. What's going to happen to society if this keeps up?\"\n\nMany people on the bus glanced over. The girl standing nearby turned an even deeper shade of red.\n\nWhen the bus reached the next stop, the girl fled as if escaping. Her eyes were red-rimmed; she was clearly struggling to hold back tears.\n\n\"Hmph.\"\n\nSeeing the girl get off, the old woman seemed unsatisfied, as if she were deeply disappointed the show was over.\n\nThe bus started moving again.\n\nZhou Ze suddenly realized the old man was gone. Where did he go?\n\nZhou Ze swore he had been staring at the old man the entire time, yet the man seemed to have vanished in an instant.\n\nHe hadn't even finished what he was saying.\n\nDid he lure him onto the bus just for this to be the end?\n\nNo beginning, no end...\n\nWhat on earth was he trying to say?\n\n\"Hey.\"\n\nThe old man's voice sounded.\n\nZhou Ze followed the sound and saw that it came from the old woman.\n\nAt that moment,\n\nthe old woman turned her face to look out the window.\n\nAnd the sparse hair on her head parted,\n\nand there, on the back of her head, was the old man's wrinkled face.\n\nThe old man was smiling,\n\nrevealing a set of yellowed teeth.\n\nHe was smiling happily,\n\nlaughing heartily,\n\nand at the same time, he said:\n\n\"Now you understand,\n\nwhy I died, yet am not dead, right?\"\n\n***\n\n¹白眼狼 (báiyǎnláng), literally \"white-eyed wolf,\" is an idiom for an ungrateful and treacherous person.\n\n²牛皮糖 (niúpítáng), literally \"cowhide candy,\" is a type of very chewy, sticky toffee. It's used metaphorically to describe someone who is persistent and hard to get rid of.",

    "content": "\"The first snow of 2002,\n\n  Came a bit later than in years past,\n\n  The number 2 bus, stopped on the eighth floor...\"\n\nFrom a shop on the street outside, a sound system was blasting this song by Dao Lang.\n\nAt the same time,\n\nZhou Ze saw through the bus window,\n\nthat it had actually started to snow.\n\nBy the roadside,\n\nthe ground had already turned a snowy white.\n\nToday was June 27th, the height of summer,\n\nand it was snowing.\n\nThe bus reached another stop and halted.\n\nThe old man suddenly appeared on the curb outside, his hands stuffed in the pockets of his green army coat, his Liberation shoes stepping into the accumulated snow. His body was trembling slightly, and puffs of white breath escaped his mouth continuously.\n\nBefore the doors closed, Zhou Ze leaped off the bus, startling the driver into yelling several curses of \"You got a death wish?!\"\n\n*Whoosh...*\n\nCold.\n\nIt was truly cold.\n\nIt was clearly the middle of summer,\n\nyet it had suddenly become winter.\n\nHowever, Zhou Ze, dressed in his thin clothes, didn't find it too hard to bear. He was, after all, a man who had to sleep cuddling a female jiangshi every night, and had even slept in a freezer before.\n\n\"Young people have so much inner fire. How nice.\"\n\nThe old man sized up Zhou Ze, speaking with great envy.\n\n\"What is going on?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"It's fake. It's all fake.\" The old man reached out a hand, catching a few snowflakes. He continued, \"It's a very simple illusion. Since you weren't willing to wake up and wanted to keep watching, I decided to show you a little more.\n\nAfter all these years,\n\nI've been wanting to find someone to talk to.\n\nYou killed me,\n\nso you've earned the right to chat with me.\n\nHow about it? Shall we walk a little further?\n\nIf you don't want to, this simple environment isn't strong enough to hold you.\"\n\nAs he spoke, the old man lowered his head and began walking forward on his own.\n\nHe was right.\n\nThis was an illusion of the simplest kind.\n\nThe transition had been abrupt. Compared to the subtle, imperceptible great terror of the Yin-Yang Scroll, this scene seemed overly simple and crude.\n\nBut just as the old man had said,\n\nthe value of a student's oil painting isn't necessarily determined entirely by the quality of the painting itself, but also by her father's status.\n\nThis illusion couldn't trap Zhou Ze, but he simply lowered his head, faced the falling snow, and continued following the old man.\n\nHe wanted to see, he *had* to see.\n\nThis thing that even the one inside his own body couldn't completely kill,\n\nthis fellow who dared to proactively seek him out for a chat after being killed,\n\nwhat was his true form?\n\nWhat was he, really!\n\nAlthough in his heart, Zhou Ze,\n\nactually already had an answer, he still needed more proof.\n\nThe old man seemed to be opening his heart to him, and Zhou Ze wasn't one to turn someone away.\n\nThe snow grew heavier.\n\nAfter walking for a while, the old man seemed unable to go on. He squatted down by the side of the road, pulled out a long-stemmed tobacco pipe, fiddled with the tobacco leaves, and then began puffing away with a smacking sound.\n\nSeeing Zhou Ze standing beside him, he even offered the pipe toward Zhou Ze, motioning for him to have a smoke, not to be polite.\n\nZhou Ze also squatted down, took out his own cigarettes, and lit one.\n\nOne old, one young,\n\njust squatting by the side of the road,\n\nletting the snowflakes fall on their heads, their shoulders, their faces,\n\nsmoking silently.\n\nThe old man didn't speak, and neither did Zhou Ze.\n\nBut what was to come,\n\nwas bound to come.\n\n\"I really want to die, I do.\" The old man spat a thick glob of phlegm onto the ground, then coughed several more times. \"I'm tired, really.\"\n\nThe old man's two \"reallys\" betrayed a kind of helplessness.\n\n*I want to die, but I can't.*\n\nThis kind of helplessness,\n\nin the eyes of most people, was the kind of complaint made by someone who doesn't know how good they have it—a complaint that would make countless others envious!\n\nThroughout history, how many have dreamed of immortality? How many emperors were obsessed with it? How many nobles and aristocrats were willing to sacrifice everything for it?\n\nBut the strange thing was,\n\nZhou Ze could tell that the old man was speaking from the heart.\n\nHe wanted to die,\n\nbut he couldn't.\n\nThis wasn't some affectation, but the deepest and most genuine helplessness buried in the old man's heart.\n\n\"What exactly are you?\" Zhou Ze asked again.\n\n\"Oh, you haven't figured it out yet?\" The old man smiled, tapping his pipe on the curb. \"Or is it that you've already figured it out, but you don't dare to believe it, is that right?\"\n\nJust as the old man's voice fell,\n\na crowd of people appeared from across the road.\n\nThey held banners,\n\ncarried signs,\n\nand chanted slogans.\n\nMore and more people joined them.\n\nThe shouts, echoing to the heavens, dispelled the winter chill, making it feel scorching hot, as if the blazing sun was in the sky and summer had returned.\n\n\"%%￥￥@!\"\n\n\"%%...&!\"\n\nThe slogans were uniform.\n\nThe few people leading the group looked like they were on steroids, their faces flushed, overcome with excitement.\n\nThis procession marched right past Zhou Ze and the old man. Some of them saw the two squatting there smoking, and their eyes showed contempt.\n\nIt was as if they were looking at a group of numb-witted compatriots, a group of fossilized peers.\n\nMourning their misfortune, resenting their lack of resistance!\n\nZhou Ze scratched his head.\n\nThe old man roared with laughter.\n\nAfter laughing, he continued:\n\n\"I want to die, damn it. Why can't that person inside you kill me either? No, he *can* kill me, but he can't kill me *now*, or maybe he just isn't willing to expend that much energy to kill me.\"\n\nAs he spoke, the old man stood up,\n\nand swung his long-stemmed pipe at a nearby tree.\n\nThere was no earth-shattering cataclysm, no water flowing backward.\n\nNor was there the霸气¹ of \"Lu Zhishen uprooting the willow tree.\"\n\nInstead, the old man jolted his own hand so hard that the webbing between his thumb and forefinger stung with pain.\n\nHe clutched his fingers and hopped around on the ground comically for a few circles.\n\n\"There's another possibility. He saw that I want to die but can't, so he's deliberately letting me live, letting me continue to suffer this torture!\n\nDamn it,\n\nI never offended him.\n\nHe's really ruthless. If I don't die completely, I'll come back after some time, and more people will die because of me. That person doesn't care. He doesn't care about human lives, he just finds me unpleasant and would rather let me continue suffering like this.\n\nHow vicious. He shows a complete disregard for human life.\"\n\nThe old man continued his tirade.\n\nZhou Ze, meanwhile, saw a few people break off from the back of the procession. They walked over to a car on the side of the road and began peering at a Mitsubishi.\n\nThe car doors opened, and two tall, sturdy men got out. The two groups looked at each other for a moment, then the first group walked away. The two men who had gotten out got back into their car.\n\nThat group walked a little further before stopping again, this time next to a Toyota.\n\nThey seemed to have seen who was sitting inside the car.\n\nThey started pointing at the people inside through the windows and cursing.\n\nThey started shouting.\n\nThey started lecturing.\n\nThey even started spitting.\n\nThey were full of righteous indignation, they gestured with fervor, they were brimming with passion—even if they didn't look very young themselves, with their balding heads, potbellies, and old-fashioned tattoos on their shoulders.\n\nAs the shouting and cursing continued,\n\nmore and more people began to gather. Some watched, some filmed, some cheered.\n\nThe few men who had first surrounded the car became more and more agitated. The encouragement from the crowd seemed to grant them infinite strength.\n\nThey felt that the public's hopes rested on them.\n\nThey felt they were advocating for the highest ideals.\n\nThey even felt,\n\nthat they were glowing!\n\nFinally,\n\none of them couldn't restrain the impulse any longer.\n\nHe leaped directly onto the roof of the car and began to jump.\n\nHe stomped and shouted, jumped and cursed.\n\nHe was lost in the moment.\n\nHe was self-absorbed.\n\nHe was unstoppable!\n\nNot to be outdone, another man picked up a wrench he had prepared earlier and, to the gasps of the crowd, smashed it directly against the car's windshield!\n\n*CRACK!*\n\nA large web of cracks spread across the windshield.\n\nThey vented their anger, even if their enemy was thousands of miles away, even if the people sitting inside had ID cards designed exactly like their own.\n\nBut they felt glorious, they felt great. Amid the jeers of the crowd, he felt that he wasn't waving a wrench, but a great broadsword, like a character from one of the ludicrous war dramas that every TV station airs late at night.\n\nIt was as if all around him,\n\nbullets were whistling,\n\ncannons were roaring,\n\nand gunpowder was burning.\n\nHe was resolute,\n\nunyielding,\n\ncomposed.\n\nAgain and again, he raised his wrench and smashed it against the window, against the car door,\n\nas if he wasn't smashing a car,\n\nbut an enemy's armored tank.\n\nHe was the Polish cavalry,\n\nsounding the charge, protecting his country, protecting his people, launching a great offensive against the steel tide!\n\n*Though I face a million, I will go forward.*\n\nThis was his conviction at this moment!\n\nThe surrounding crowd cheered and applauded nonstop,\n\nas if they were about to witness a great victory.\n\nThe dawn,\n\nwas right before them!\n\nThey would prove their courage, bare their chests, and declare their integrity!\n\nThey were excited, they were fervent, their spirits soared!\n\nFinally,\n\nthe car door was pushed open from the inside.\n\nThe terrified occupants got out.\n\nIt was a woman, plainly dressed. On the other side, a young girl also got out. The girl was crying, shouting, and cursing.\n\nThe woman, however, pleaded incessantly with the men.\n\nBut once the bow is drawn, the arrow cannot be recalled. On the battlefield, there is only charging forward, no retreat!\n\nThey pushed the woman aside and continued to smash the car, shouting at her, pointing at the car's logo, and condemning her for her depravity, her shamelessness, her baseness.\n\nStanding nearby, Zhou Ze watched this scene and took a deep breath.\n\nThe old man refilled his pipe with tobacco and continued to smoke.\n\n\"Is this interesting?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"The answer you want is right here.\" The old man blew a smoke ring. \"I want to die.\"\n\nThe old man kept repeating this, like Sister Xianglin,² who would tell everyone she met: \"I only knew that when it snowed, the beasts in the mountain hollows couldn't find food and would come to the village; I didn't know they would come in spring too...\"\n\nThe woman got up and tried to stop the men smashing her car.\n\nBut the man with the wrench,\n\nswung it straight down!\n\n*THUD!*\n\nThe sound of a skull cracking open.\n\nIt was crisp,\n\nand also muffled.\n\nThe woman fell to the ground.\n\nBlood flowed out unceasingly.\n\nIn this winter scene of endless white snow,\n\nthis splash of red,\n\nwas incredibly glaring.\n\nZhou Ze pressed his lips together, telling himself that this was an illusion.\n\nTurning his head, Zhou Ze was surprised to find that the old man who had been standing next to him smoking was gone again.\n\nAnd then,\n\nwhen Zhou Ze looked back toward the car,\n\nhe saw in the pool of blood,\n\nthe old man's figure was reflected.\n\nHis face was haggard,\n\nhis gaze was chaotic.\n\nHe was crying,\n\nhe was shouting,\n\nhe was making a scene.\n\nHe was begging at the top of his lungs:\n\n\"I want to die!\n\nWhy won't you let me die!\"\n\n***\n\n**Footnotes:**\n\n1.  **霸气 (bàqì):** An aura of dominance, power, or aggression.

    "content": "The snow was still falling, endlessly.\n\n  The people all around,\n\n  began to dwindle,\n\n  like a movie theater after the show,\n\n  growing ever more desolate.\n\n  Zhou Ze remained standing where he was, letting the snow slowly cover him, gradually building him into a \"snowman.\"\n\n  The people smashing the car were gone.\n\n  The onlookers were gone.\n\n  The person on the ground was gone.\n\n  Slowly,\n\n  the car was gone, too.\n\n  Between heaven and earth, only this vast whiteness remained, so utterly clean;\n\n  the only glaring sight was still that crimson pool on the ground.\n\n  It was like a stain that couldn't be washed or wiped away,\n\n  t stubbornly existed,\n\n  so unsightly, so discomforting.\n\n  From within the crimson,\n\n  the old man was shouting nonstop,\n\n  as if venting a long-suppressed anguish.\n\n  \"Now, you know what I am, don't you?\"\n\n  As if he had vented his fill,\n\n  as if he were tired,\n\n  or perhaps just finding it all boring and pointless,\n\n  the old man walked out from the crimson.\n\n  He was still dressed in that same green overcoat, still wore those muddy Liberation shoes,¹ still had the image of an old farmer. He even sniffled, wiped his nose with the back of his hand, and flicked it onto the ground.\n\n  Zhou Ze nodded.\n\n  \"You're already dead. That old man.\"\n\n  \"Right, he's dead. But I can't die. Every time I die, I have to come back, find a new person, and start over.\"\n\n  The old man put his hands on his hips, as if he wanted to keep cursing, but it seemed he no longer had the energy.\n\n  The old man was dead, but he still existed.\n\n  Xu Qinglang's master was dead, but in the future, his master would continue to appear.\n\n  He was a demon, drifting in the sky. He would descend, he would enter a person's body. Xu Qinglang's master was the previous one, and it was because of this that the man was able to attain profound understanding, to have such deep-seated obsessions, to become a Heavenly Master who roamed the mortal realm—so much so that even the local ghost messengers dared not touch him.\n\n  A week ago, he appeared here and was killed by Zhou Ze—truly killed. But the one who died was only Xu Qinglang's master. The true evil, the demon that had created all of this, he was merely wiped clean of everything.\n\n  He hid in dark corners, slowly licking his wounds.\n\n  He concealed himself among the crowds, silently gathering his strength anew.\n\n  He was waiting for time to pass, seeking his next host. This was his fate, his cycle of reincarnation, the same principle by which ghost messengers like that little loli had to find a host body after entering the mortal world from Hell.\n\n  He,\n\n  needed one too.\n\n  \"Do you know how old I am?\" the old man asked Zhou Ze.\n\n  Zhou Ze shook his head.\n\n  \"So old, so very old. So old I've almost forgotten what I originally looked like. Storytellers say, every blade of grass, every tree, all is the will of Heaven!\n\n  But I just can't figure it out, can't understand it, and can't for the life of me find it—what the hell is the meaning of my existence?\"\n\n  As the old man spoke,\n\n  to his left, the heavy snow vanished, and a stretch of old street appeared.\n\n  On the street were the cries of vendors and various small shops.\n\n  There was also a platform, upon which a person knelt.\n\n  \"The furthest back I can remember, the one I recall most clearly, is this time.\"\n\n  Caishikou.²\n\n  The crowd grew larger and larger.\n\n  Before he knew it, Zhou Ze found himself surrounded by people. Their clothes were mostly a drab gray, and at the back of their heads hung long, braided queues,\n\n  greasy,\n\n  and slick.\n\n  The scene felt familiar.\n\n  An executioner escorted a man onto the platform. The blade was already sharpened, the man already kneeling.\n\n  The onlookers below began to weep and sob.\n\n  Some covered their eyes, unable to look.\n\n  Some covered their ears, unable to listen.\n\n  Some simply turned away, not even daring to face it.\n\n  A desolate autumn wind swept fallen leaves across the ground. The executioner took a swig of wine and heard the chorus of weeping from below the stage.\n\n  The condemned man did not cry. He continued to kneel, his back ramrod straight, while the crowd below wept for his misfortune, shaking their heads, lamenting, filled with sorrow, grieving for the passing of a life.\n\n  Before Zhou Ze,\n\n  the old man's gaze was vacant.\n\n  He walked up to Zhou Ze,\n\n  and reached out to straighten his collar, like a kindly elder. He grinned, revealing a set of yellowed teeth, and continued:\n\n  \"I came to find you to ask for a favor.\"\n\n  \"Speak.\"\n\n  \"I'm dead, and I won't be back for a while. But maybe in a few years, or ten-odd years, or perhaps a few decades, I'll still have to return.\n\n  So, I'm begging you, the next time I come back, please kill me, alright?\n\n  That fellow has some family heirlooms. I'll tell you where they are. Go take a look; you should be able to scrounge up some good stuff. If you see anything you like, take it and have fun with it. He's already dead anyway, isn't he?\"\n\n  \"You shouldn't be saying this to me,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\n  He should be saying it to the one inside him.\n\n  A strange smile appeared on the old man's face. He looked at Zhou Ze, licked his lips, and said:\n\n  \"It's all the same.\"\n\n  \"How long until you return?\"\n\n  \"Soon.\"\n\n  The old man wore an expression of someone for whom life had lost all meaning.\n\n  With a wave of his right hand,\n\n  a large bridge appeared.\n\n  A single line,\n\n  divided two worlds.\n\n  On the left, Caishikou from a hundred years ago.\n\n  On the right, a modern bridge.\n\n  On the platform at Caishikou, an executioner held a blade, and a condemned man knelt.\n\n  On the bridge, a man was perched on the railing, ready to fall at any moment.\n\n  A single line divided a hundred years of time.\n\n  \"People always say time can change everything,\" the old man said with a bitter smile. \"But there are some things that even time is powerless against. I have a feeling my next return won't be too long from now. You just wait.\n\n  Perhaps after I come back, I'll come looking for you again.\"\n\n  Below the bridge, a large crowd had gathered to watch, so many that the traffic on the bridge had been brought to a standstill.\n\n  The police arrived to maintain order. They set up a cordon, telling the onlookers to move back, further back, but the people at the front pushed forward, and the people at the back shoved ahead. The crowd was impossible to disperse.\n\n  Everyone was as eager and energetic as people in the old days rushing to the cinema, squeezing onto a bus, or charging into a supply cooperative to buy things.\n\n  The firefighters had already set up their ropes, preparing to risk their lives to rescue him.\n\n  \"Jump! Go on, jump!\"\n\n  \"Damn it, still not jumping? The sun is killing me!\"\n\n  \"Hey, buddy, are you jumping or not? Give us a sign! If you're not jumping, I've got to go home and cook dinner.\"\n\n  \"Hurry it up! Make your form perfect, keep the splash small, that's how you get a high technical score!\"\n\n  As they shouted from below, urging him on and venting their dissatisfaction, they held up their phones, taking pictures and videos, then posting to Weibo and Moments:\n\n  \"So worried about him. Why would he want to jump? Please come down!\"\n\n  \"Life is so precious, everyone only gets one. I hope the brother up there can see things in a better light and come down soon!\"\n\n  \"Come down! Life is full of setbacks, there's nothing you can't get over. You still have family and friends who will continue to support you, and you have us down here worrying about you!\"\n\n  \"My heart aches for the brother up there. Don't jump! Go, firefighter uncles, you have to save him!\"\n\n  After posting their updates,\n\n  they put down their phones,\n\n  and, enduring the scorching sun,\n\n  they began to incessantly urge the man above to hurry up, get a move on, make it quick. The sun was too hot, and there were no umbrellas, nor was there a convenience store where they could buy an ice-cold Coke.\n\n  \"A hundred years,\" the old man smiled, licking his lips.\n\n  *Thwack!*\n\n  To the left of the line, the executioner's great blade fell, and a head went rolling.\n\n  *Splash!*\n\n  To the right of the line, the man leaped from the bridge and plunged into the water.\n\n  At that moment, the world seemed to fall into a kind of silence,\n\n  an eerie silence.\n\n  And then,\n\n  on both sides of the line,\n\n  everything erupted into a frenzy.\n\n  At Caishikou, a group of people holding steamed buns rushed forward to dip them in the blood. Those who succeeded shouted, \"Human-blood buns cure all ills!\"³\n\n  At the bridge,\n\n  while the firefighters and police mourned the loss of a life, some even crying out and shedding tears,\n\n  several busybodies secretly slipped past the cordon and rushed to the newly recovered body, flipping up the white sheet that covered it,\n\n  to gaze upon the face of the drowned man.\n\n  This would all become fodder for their future conversations. For instance, while drinking with friends, they could boast about how the man who jumped from the bridge the other day died a miserable death, and they had seen it with their own eyes.\n\n  On both ends of the line,\n\n  chaos reigned,\n\n  and began to grow ever more disordered.\n\n  In the end,\n\n  the old man's figure also grew fainter and fainter. He spread his hands, helpless and lost, as if his sorrow was greater than death itself:\n\n  \"I want to die.\"\n\n  This was his final lament.\n\n  Then, he waved to Zhou Ze.\n\n  \"Goodbye. When I come back next time, I beg you... kill me for good.\"\n\n  \"Omm..................\"\n\n  All around,\n\n  light and shadow began to tremble.\n\n  Zhou Ze slowly lifted his head.\n\n  He was still standing in the bookstore's bathroom, still holding the towel he'd been about to use to wipe his face. Before him was still the same mirror.\n\n  Behind him, there was no dark figure, no old man.\n\n  Zhou Ze didn't feel dizzy, nor was he disoriented. There was no discomfort whatsoever.\n\n  The old man had said it was a simple illusion, so simple that Zhou Ze himself could easily awaken from it.\n\n  Such a simple illusion would naturally have no physiological effect on him.\n\n  He lifted the towel again,\n\n  and wiped his face.\n\n  But the water on his face had long since dried.\n\n  What he was wiping now,\n\n  was sweat.\n\n  Cold sweat.\n\n  Walking out of the bathroom, Zhou Ze sat down in his favorite spot by the window. The afterglow of the sunset shone in, casting a long shadow.\n\n  The once-lively bookstore was now quiet, with most of its occupants recovering upstairs. Only Boss Zhou sat alone below.\n\n  For some reason,\n\n  Zhou Ze felt a chill.\n\n  It was a coldness deeper than the one he'd felt that night a week ago,\n\n  one that was even comparable to the feeling of walking the Yellow Springs Road⁴ for the first time.\n\n  Because this was the first time Zhou Ze had encountered something like this.\n\n  It wasn't a lost soul.\n\n  It wasn't a living creature.\n\n  It had no form; even it itself didn't know what it was.\n\n  But it was like a demon, its eyes wide open,\n\n  up in the heavens.\n\n  Whether in wind or rain, or under a clear, bright sky,\n\n  it was always watching everything below,\n\n  always ready to flap its demonic wings,\n\n  and descend.\n\n  This gaze,\n\n  had already lasted for a hundred years.\n\n  Below,\n\n  it would likely continue,\n\n  and who knows for how many more centuries it would persist.\n\n  Just as the one inside him had deliberately left that parting message after killing it:\n\n  \"He's not dead yet...\"\n\n***\n\n**Footnotes:**\n\n¹ **Liberation shoes:** A type of simple, sturdy canvas and rubber-soled shoe that became common in China after the 1950s, often associated with soldiers, workers, and farmers.\n² **Caishikou:** Literally \"Vegetable Market Entrance,\" a famous historical execution ground in Beijing during the Qing Dynasty.\n³ **Human-blood buns:** A direct and powerful reference to Lu Xun's famous 1919 short story \"Medicine,\" which uses the folk belief that a steamed bun dipped in the blood of an executed person could cure tuberculosis as a metaphor for the ignorance and apathy of Chinese society at the time.\n⁴ **Yellow Springs Road:** In Chinese mythology, the path the souls of the dead must walk to reach the underworld.",

    "content": "Boss Zhou had been feeling down all night. He wasn't one to easily fall into a low mood; as a salted fish, you had to have your own kind of resilience.\n\nWhen the salt is constantly slapped onto your body, when the moisture inside you is squeezed out bit by bit, you should be fearless and carefree.\n\nThat's how it should be, that's what's comfortable.\n\nLiving a carefree life was much happier than being like Sister Lin,¹ who would get so depressed she'd cough up blood from time to time.\n\nZhou Ze felt that a good night's sleep would fix everything.\n\nNo matter the issue, it could all be turned over to a new page the next day.\n\nWhen Zhou Ze, lying in bed, opened his eyes the next morning,\n\nHe was certain,\n\nThat yesterday's gloomy mood had truly been turned over to a new page.\n\nBecause he saw a pair of large, glistening eyes looking at him.\n\nThe distance between them was probably only a few tenths of a millimeter.\n\nHer eyelashes seemed to be editing his every word and action.\n\n\"You're awake?\"\n\nZhou Ze spoke. Those two words held a tremor; it was one of excitement. Yingying was finally awake.\n\n\"Mhm,\" Bai Yingying responded.\n\nZhou Ze suddenly felt as if the sky had cleared after a storm. It was as if the critical moment from that night a week ago, and all the gloom from yesterday evening,\n\nhad been swept away in an instant!\n\nHe wanted to hug her,\n\nbut seeing her looking at him with such an innocent face,\n\nZhou Ze suddenly felt a little embarrassed, feeling that any action at this moment would be superfluous.\n\nTruly, with the pipsqueak loli-type, Boss Zhou could smack or scold them as he pleased, without fear. But faced with Bai Yingying, who was staring at him with a dazed and cute expression, Zhou Ze felt his hands were tied.\n\n\"Are you hungry?\"\n\nZhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Boss, why are you being so silly?\n\nI don't eat.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded. He'd forgotten.\n\nSitting up in bed, Zhou Ze lit a cigarette. Sunlight streamed in through the window, bringing with it the vigor and warmth of the early morning.\n\nBai Yingying struggled to get up, but the injuries on her body hadn't fully healed. Although she was awake, her body was still at a critical point of self-repair.\n\nShe wanted to sit up and get Zhou Ze's clothes for him, just as she did every day.\n\nBut after pushing herself up, she had no choice but to fall back down with her head thrown back.\n\nShe clenched her fists in anger, pouting.\n\n\"What's wrong?\"\n\nZhou Ze grabbed the clothes hanging on the bedpost and put them on.\n\n\"Yingying is useless. I can't serve the Boss anymore.\"\n\n\"Just focus on resting.\"\n\nZhou Ze reached out and gently tapped her on the nose.\n\nThen he himself paused for a moment.\n\nThis gesture...\n\nWhy did it feel so strangely familiar?\n\n\"I don't want to,\" Bai Yingying said with a pout, very displeased. \"The Boss is too lazy.\"\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze.\n\n\"If Yingying can't serve the Boss, the Boss definitely won't be able to resist and will find another maid.\n\nThen the Boss will definitely continue to be unable to resist.\n\nShe'll probably be warm down there.\n\nAnd then Yingying will be replaced.\"\n\nHearing these words, Zhou Ze almost couldn't stop himself from laughing. In his past life as a doctor, he had seen plenty of postpartum depression in pregnant women, but he had never seen depression caused by an injury.\n\nThis girl must have fried her brain watching *The Self-Cultivation of a Maid* a while back.\n\nAt once, Zhou Ze placed a hand on Bai Yingying's shoulder and said very seriously:\n\n\"You have to trust your Boss.\"\n\n\"Uh-huh, Boss, I get you!\n\n*Sob, sob, sob!*\"\n\nAfter saying this, Zhou Ze suddenly felt that something was not quite right. Why did his words have such a strange flavor to them?\n\n\"Want to go for a walk?\" Zhou Ze asked. \"To clear your head.\"\n\n\"Emmm...\"\n\n\"I'll take you.\"\n\n\"Okay, Boss.\"\n\nReaching out, he picked up Bai Yingying and walked out of the bedroom, heading downstairs.\n\nTo Zhou Ze's surprise, the shop door was already open. The Old Daoist was sitting on the sofa with a pair of crutches beside him. Evidently, after yesterday's \"Little Donkey\" incident, the Old Daoist had wasted no time in ordering a pair of crutches, determined not to give Zhou Ze another chance to \"doot doot doot\" him around.\n\n\"Morning, Boss.\"\n\nThe Old Daoist was eating fried dough sticks on the sofa while the monkey poured him some soy milk. The Old Daoist's movements were still very inconvenient, but as soon as he could move on his own, he had fulfilled his duties and opened the shop early.\n\n\"Oh, Yingying's awake too. That's great, that's great. With everyone well, the bookstore won't be so lonely. By the way, Boss, where are you two headed?\"\n\n\"Out for a walk.\"\n\n\"That's wonderful! This humble Daoist's wheelchair is available...\"\n\n\"No need. I'll carry her on my back for a walk.\"\n\n\"...\" The Old Daoist.\n\nOn what grounds!\n\nWhy!\n\n...\n\nBai Yingying wasn't actually heavy. At least, Zhou Ze didn't feel very tired carrying her. There weren't many people on the street this early in the morning; those out and about were mostly rushing to work. Because of this, no one paid too much attention to the pair.\n\nEven those who did notice probably just thought it was a brother carrying his sister who had sprained her ankle.\n\nThe two didn't go far, stopping at a nearby park. Bai Yingying was placed on a bench by Zhou Ze, who then sat beside her and lit a cigarette.\n\nThere weren't many words exchanged; the two of them just sat there quietly.\n\nThe relationship between them was equivalent to master and servant, and they also knew each other very well. Even just sitting there without speaking, it didn't feel awkward at all.\n\nOn the open space in front of the park, a middle-aged coach was blowing a whistle, leading seven or eight children in a game of soccer. This early in the morning, it added a lot of life to the park.\n\n\"What a coincidence,\" Bai Yingying suddenly remarked.\n\n\"What is?\" Zhou Ze turned to look at her.\n\n\"Boss, back then, the Mistress also sprained her ankle and was carried by that scholar. The Mistress said that was the first time she had contact with a man, and lying on his back, she felt a great sense of security.\n\nYingying just had the same feeling.\"\n\n\"Heh,\" Zhou Ze chuckled.\n\n\"Also, back then, the Mistress and that scholar were just like this, sitting on a hillside, watching a group of people below play `cuju`.\"²\n\nBai Yingying rested her chin on her hand, looking somewhat melancholic.\n\n\"I don't know how the Mistress is doing in Hell now, and I don't know if I'll ever have the chance to see her again.\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't speak.\n\nHe knew.\n\nBai Yingying was aware of the arrangements Madam Bai had left behind. Madam Bai had instructed him to cremate Bai Yingying using bamboo as fuel on the next Cold Clothes Festival. Bai Yingying had even designed the bamboo bed for her own cremation later on.\n\nSometimes, she was indeed very cold, especially when he first saw her awaken. If it hadn't been for his fingernails happening to be her counter, his and Xu Qinglang's fate might not have been a good one.\n\nBut after getting to know her, he discovered she was actually very simple, extremely simple.\n\nZhou Ze lifted his head, leaned his body back, and rested completely against the bench. The sunlight sprinkled over him, giving a warm and comfortable feeling.\n\n\"Yingying, do you think it's wrong for me to always waste time like this?\"\n\n\"Not at all. Every time I see the Boss sitting there reading the paper and basking in the sun, Yingying feels so happy.\"\n\n\"But that time, you, the Old Daoist, and the others almost had a collective accident. If I weren't so... salted fish...\"\n\n\"Boss!\" Yingying suddenly said in a solemn voice.\n\n\"Hmm?\"\n\n\"Yingying will cultivate diligently!\"\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\n\"In the future, Yingying will protect the Boss, so the Boss can bask in the sun, read the paper, and drink tea every day without any other worries.\n\nYingying will provide the Boss with a perfect and comfortable environment, to be your eternal harbor.\"\n\n\"That sounds like something a man is supposed to say.\"\n\nZhou Ze reached out and gently patted her on the head.\n\nCome to think of it,\n\na maid who grew up poisoned by toxic feudal ideologies like \"the husband is the guide of the wife,\"\n\nalas,\n\nhow adorable she was!\n\nThere were some snack shops at the park entrance that had also opened for the day. However, they weren't selling fried dough sticks and buns, but ice cream.\n\nYingying's gaze kept drifting in that direction.\n\n\"Want some?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nTo be honest, since the little girl had been with him, he hadn't really bought her anything. She was the one who was always subsidizing him. Even opening the bookstore was done by mortgaging her burial goods for capital.\n\nIf not for the one million yuan deposit from the Sea God incident, Zhou Ze still wouldn't have been able to pay Bai Yingying back.\n\nYingying fell into deep thought.\n\nShe didn't need to eat to survive,\n\nbut eating things occasionally wasn't a problem.\n\n\"What's wrong?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"The Old Daoist once told Yingying that it's not good for a girl's body to eat too many cold things.\"\n\n\"It's fine to have it once in a while,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"What if I get even colder down there?\"\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Forget it, I'll have it!\" Bai Yingying decided.\n\n\"Alright, I'll go buy it.\"\n\nZhou Ze walked over and ordered an ice cream. Because the shop had just opened for the morning, he had to wait for a long time.\n\nBai Yingying sat on the bench, watching Zhou Ze stand at the shop entrance waiting for the ice cream, and from time to time, she would let out a silly \"hee hee\" giggle.\n\nEven though she was injured,\n\nit didn't feel too bad.\n\nFinally, the ice cream was ready. Zhou Ze walked back with it.\n\n\"Thwack!\"\n\nA soccer ball suddenly flew over and hit Zhou Ze's hand directly, knocking the ice cream to the ground.\n\nThe group of children in the distance also froze.\n\nZhou Ze ignored the kids and made an apologetic gesture towards Yingying up ahead. Wiping his hand and sleeve with a tissue, he said:\n\n\"It's fine, I'll go buy another one.\"\n\nWith that, Zhou Ze turned and walked back toward the ice cream shop.\n\nThe moment Zhou Ze turned his back,\n\nBai Yingying, who until now had been \"as soft as if boneless,\" \"extremely weak,\" and \"unable to care for herself,\" immediately jumped off the bench.\n\nShe was as agile as could be.\n\nImmediately after, she kicked the soccer ball in front of her.\n\n\"BANG!\"\n\nThe soccer ball flew high into the air,\n\nsoaring right out of the park, possibly even into the next city block.\n\nThe crowd of children, including the coach, stood dumbstruck.\n\nBai Yingying clenched her fists and shook them at the group a few times, venting her fury!\n\nSo angry!\n\nThe first time the Boss ever bought me ice cream,\n\nand you guys had to ruin it!\n\nDo you have any idea how hard it is for me to pretend to be sick!\n\n---\n¹ **Sister Lin (林妹妹):** Refers to Lin Daiyu, the tragic heroine of the classic Chinese novel *Dream of the Red Chamber*. She is famously characterized by her delicate health, poetic talent, and melancholic disposition.\n\n² **`Cuju` (蹴鞠):** An ancient Chinese sport recognized by FIFA as the earliest form of football.

    "content": "Zhou Ze returned carrying Bai Yingying on his back. One of Bai Yingying's arms was wrapped around Zhou Ze's neck, while the other held an ice cream cone that she licked from time to time. Zhou Ze could smell the delicate fragrance from the young woman, mixed with the sweetness of the ice cream.\n\n\"Boss, are you tired?\"\n\n\"Not at all.\"\n\n\"Then is Yingying too heavy?\"\n\n\"Not at all.\"\n\n\"Then why do you keep letting Yingying slide down and then hoisting her back up?\"\n\n\"I'm not.\"\n\n\"Yes, you are.\"\n\n\"Yingying.\"\n\n\"Yes, Boss.\"\n\n\"Why aren't you wearing a bra?\"\n\n\"Boss, Yingying has always worn a bra.\"\n\n\"Then why are you wearing a dudou¹ today?\"\n\n\"Boss was the one who changed Yingying's clothes today.\"\n\n\"Oh, my mistake. I thought you were from the Qing Dynasty and were used to wearing a dudou.\"\n\n\"Does Boss like dudous?\"\n\n\"I like them all.\"\n\nAfter casually chatting about some interesting tidbits from \"Paris's latest fashion week,\" Zhou Ze reached the bookstore entrance with Bai Yingying on his back.\n\nA song was playing inside the bookstore.\n\n\"In Guangdong, I've been whoring so much I've gone off the grid?\"\n\nBai Yingying hummed along with the song, then asked:\n\n\"Boss, what song is this? It's so intense.\"\n\n\"It's 'In Guangdong, I've been drifting for ten years.' The song is called 'Guangdong Love Story.' It's sung in Cantonese.\"\n\n\"Oh, like that.\"\n\nPushing open the bookstore door, Zhou Ze discovered a stranger inside. The man was dressed in a set of white clothes and wore thousand-layer cloth shoes. Holding a calligraphy brush, he was flourishing it over a piece of white paper laid out on the bar.\n\nThe old Daoist sat in his wheelchair. With every stroke the man made, he clapped and shouted \"Bravo!\" beside him.\n\nZhou Ze placed Yingying on the sofa and also walked over to have a look.\n\n\"Boss, you're back. This customer is a great calligrapher. He came to our store for a cup of tea but didn't have any money on him. He was carrying his brush, ink, paper, and inkstone, though, so the poor Daoist let him leave a piece of calligraphy as payment for the tea.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded, not saying much about it. A cup of tea didn't cost much, so it was fair for the man to leave a piece of calligraphy.\n\n\"Hah!\"\n\nIt was finished.\n\nHe signed it and stamped his seal.\n\nThe white-robed man, who was nearly fifty, took two steps back to admire his own work.\n\nThe old Daoist also leaned in, repeatedly exclaiming, \"Good characters, what great calligraphy! The meaning is profound, every word is powerful. Boss, how about we frame it and hang it in the bookstore? How about right under your 'Listen with a grain of salt; thus have I heard' plaque?\"\n\n\"Singing fervently in the Yan market, / Calmly I become a Chu prisoner. / To draw the blade is a moment of bliss, / And not betray my youthful spirit.\"\n\nEvery character was written with great spirit; the old Daoist's evaluation that every word was powerful was no exaggeration. Zhou Ze didn't know much about calligraphy, but from a layman's perspective, it was indeed a fine piece of work.\n\nBut when he heard the old Daoist say he wanted to frame it and hang it outside, Zhou Ze said directly:\n\n\"Don't hang it outside. Hang it in your own room.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\nA chill ran down the old Daoist's spine. When something seems off, there's bound to be a catch!\n\nWhen the Boss was suddenly nice to you, it meant he saw a pit in front of you and was getting ready to watch you jump in. This was a lesson the old Daoist had learned from repeatedly testing the limits of the 404 error.\n\n\"Heh heh, this boss is right. This piece is not suitable for hanging in the main hall. It is an excerpt from Wang Jingwei's 'Poem of Fervor.'\"\n\n\"What? A traitor's poem?\"\n\nThe old Daoist immediately pointed at the fifty-year-old man and said:\n\n\"I say, old buddy, that's not very sporting of you, is it? I only agreed to let you trade a piece of calligraphy for the tea because I saw you didn't have any money. Aren't you just cursing me, your old brother, by writing this? Do you know what this place is? Even little ghosts have to leave a toll when they pass by here!\"\n\n\"The characters are good, and that's enough. As for hanging it up, forget it. My calligraphy isn't that cheap. A cup of tea isn't a fair trade.\"\n\nThe white-robed man began to pack up his brush and ink, then turned and walked out of the bookstore.\n\n\"What kind of person was that,\" the old Daoist was still stewing over the matter.\n\n\"She Wenyuan,\" Zhou Ze said, looking at the signature. \"Perhaps he felt that you exchanging one cup of tea for his calligraphy was too much of a loss for him, so he deliberately wrote something you couldn't hang up to show off. That probably made him feel a bit more balanced.\"\n\n\"Petty! Who does he think he is? A guy in a cosplay outfit trying to act cool. No matter how good his calligraphy is, is it worth more than a piece written by a government leader?\"\n\nZhou Ze ignored the still-fuming old Daoist, washed his hands, changed into his white coat, and went upstairs.\n\nOld Xu's condition was also improving, but he hadn't woken up yet. In Zhou Ze's opinion, it was probably Old Xu's own consciousness that was temporarily resisting waking up. Because his own master had become the murderer of his parents, he didn't know how he would face this fact when he regained consciousness.\n\nBut at least his physical condition had recovered quite well.\n\nZhou Ze went to check on the Death Knight in the glass tank, only to find that several blades of grass had actually sprouted on its body.\n\n\"Old Daoist!\"\n\nZhou Ze came down from upstairs.\n\n\"What did you add to the Death Knight's glass tank!\"\n\nThere were very few people who could move about in the bookstore right now. Zhou Ze himself was one, and Yingying had just woken up and been with him the whole time, so the suspect was immediately identified.\n\n\"I didn't add anything,\" the old Daoist said, bewildered.\n\n\"Then why is there grass growing on its head?\"\n\n\"Holy crap, grass on its head?\" The old Daoist was also shocked. \"I don't know, Boss. I didn't do anything.\"\n\nAs he spoke, the old Daoist's gaze suddenly fell upon the monkey who was eating melon seeds nearby. He picked the monkey up directly and interrogated it:\n\n\"Monkey, speak! Did you put something in there?\"\n\nThe little monkey was baffled at first, but under the stares of the old Daoist and the Boss, it pouted and took a handful of seeds out of its little backpack.\n\n\"You put seeds in there?\" The old Daoist was so astonished his jaw nearly hit the floor.\n\n\"Squeak squeak squeak squeak!\"\n\nThe monkey chittered while waving its arms and legs, occasionally pointing at Zhou Ze.\n\nThe meaning was more or less:\n\nHe saw Zhou Ze fertilizing the Death Knight every day,\n\nSo the monkey felt that one shouldn't just fertilize,\n\nOne should also plant something.\n\n\"Keep an eye on your monkey,\" Zhou Ze said, at a loss for words.\n\n\"Yes, yes, I will, I will,\" the old Daoist hurriedly apologized on the monkey's behalf.\n\nDaytime in the bookstore had finally regained a bit of life. Zhou Ze lay on the sofa, flipping through a newspaper. Bai Yingying lay beside Zhou Ze, holding a copy of *The Self-Cultivation of a Maid*, continuing her studies. She would never pass up any opportunity to improve herself.\n\nWhen evening came, Zhou Ze first sent Bai Yingying upstairs, then came down himself to take a shower.\n\nJust then, the shop door was pushed open, and a young man in a cheap suit walked in.\n\nAfter entering, the man looked around everywhere but didn't take a seat, just stood there.\n\n\"Hello?\" the old Daoist, sitting behind the bar, called out, just short of asking, \"Are you human or a ghost?\"\n\n\"Excuse me, does Miss Bai live here?\"\n\nZhou Ze, who had just pushed open the bathroom door, took a few steps back. He sized up the young man, his gaze carrying a hint of scrutiny.\n\n*What are you asking for my Yingying for?*\n\n*And,*\n\n*Why would my Yingying know you?*\n\n\"It's like this, Miss Bai hasn't contacted me in a long time. I was really worried, so I took the liberty of visiting today.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Zhou Ze replied. He sat back down on the sofa, pointed to the spot opposite him, and said, \"Sit.\"\n\nThe young man sat down, looking a little nervous.\n\n*What the hell are you so nervous for!*\n\n*What's with that look in your eyes?*\n\n*Why do you look like a new son-in-law meeting his father-in-law?*\n\n\"What do you need her for?\"\n\nZhou Ze picked up the already cold tea on the coffee table and took a sip.\n\n\"It's like this, the house... I've already picked it out for her.\"\n\n\"Pfft...\"\n\nBoss Zhou sprayed a mouthful of water all over the coffee table.\n\nThe young man immediately stood up, grabbed a tissue, and started helping Zhou Ze wipe up the water.\n\n\"What's wrong?\"\n\n\"How long have you two known each other?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n*Impossible.*\n\nZhou Ze didn't think Yingying had any opportunity to meet other men. He was basically at home all the time, so Yingying had no chance. All she did all day was serve him or play games; where would she find the time?\n\n*Could it be...*\n\n*During the times I was unconscious?*\n\nZhou Ze remembered that he had recently been in a coma for half a month at a time.\n\n*Was it during that time?*\n\n\"We've known each other... for almost a year now, I think,\" the young man said.\n\n*Almost a year?*\n\n*So they met not long after she first woke up?*\n\n*I've been kept in the dark for almost a year?*\n\nZhou Ze's breathing suddenly became ragged.\n\nAt that moment, he felt an impulse to package this guy up and send him to Hell.\n\nNever mind if it was right or wrong, never mind if it was appropriate, never mind if he'd be punished for it—this impulse was growing stronger and stronger.\n\n\"Excuse me, where is Miss Bai?\" the young man asked.\n\n\"Old Daoist, prepare a meal,\" Zhou Ze shouted.\n\n\"What?\" The old Daoist was completely bewildered.\n\n\"Cui's pig head meat, Baipu dried tofu, Xiting crispy cakes, Hai'an dried mantou, Rugao old yellow wine. Serve it all.\"\n\n\"This...\"\n\n*Aren't those the things we used to prepare for passing souls?* the old Daoist thought.\n\n\"You don't have to be so polite, really. I've already eaten, I've eaten,\" the young man said, looking flattered and overwhelmed.\n\nHe had no idea he was about to be served Hell's Set Menu.\n\n\"It's like this, for the townhouse Miss Bai asked me to look at, I've already settled the deal. The price is almost a quarter of the market price. But I came to confirm one last thing with Miss Bai. Because someone died in that villa before, I wanted to ask if Miss Bai herself is aware of this...\"\n\n\"Wait!\" Zhou Ze interrupted him and asked directly, \"What do you do?\"\n\n\"Oh, I forgot. Here is my business card. I'm the sales manager for Tongcheng Lianjia.\"²\n\n\"You sell houses?\" Zhou Ze asked doubtfully.\n\n*This is a real estate agent?*\n\n\"Yes, Miss Bai is a Gold VIP client of ours. Over the past year, she has already purchased over a dozen high-end properties in Tongcheng through our branch.\"\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze.\n\n\"...\" The old Daoist, who had been straining his ears to eavesdrop on the gossip.\n\n\"Is there some kind of misunderstanding here?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n*I know my maid is rich.*\n\n*But I really didn't know my maid was THIS rich!*\n\n\"It's like this. Miss Bai said that her husband has a mistress, who keeps using the fact that she has over twenty properties to seduce him.\"\n\n\"So she plans to surpass the mistress in the number of properties. And Miss Bai said she doesn't want resettlement housing, only properties in mid- to high-end locations.\"\n\n---\n¹ **Dudou**: A traditional Chinese halter-top undergarment, similar to a bodice, often associated with historical periods.\n² **Lianjia**: A major real estate brokerage company in China.",

    "content": "\"Alright, tell me about that villa.\"\n\nZhou Ze, without realizing it, had downed all the cold tea in his hand. He couldn't help it; he was just so parched.\n\nLogically, Yingying shouldn't have had that many grave goods. Even if she sold them all, it would be impossible to buy so many properties, and all of them in mid- to high-end locations at that.\n\nFifteen years ago, it might have been possible. In recent years, the housing prices in Tongcheng had been skyrocketing like crazy. Furthermore, Tongcheng is adjacent to Shanghai, separated only by the Yangtze River, so the influence has indeed been significant.\n\nAs far as Zhou Ze knew, starting a few years ago, many people from Shanghai had been coming to Tongcheng to buy homes. They weren't buying them to live in, but to house their ancestors' memorial tablets. They would only return during the Qingming Festival to sweep the graves.\n\nOne household, one tablet. The entire residential complex might have had more dead residents than living ones.\n\nIt couldn't be helped. After the prices of homes for the living were driven up, the prices of homes for the dead also rose with the tide. A better gravesite could even be more expensive than an ordinary house.\n\nOf course, Lady Bai had been a temple deity in Tongcheng for two hundred years. If she had collected some antiques and such out of boredom, it wouldn't be strange at all.\n\nAfter Lady Bai went to Hell, she certainly couldn't take those things with her. The only person who knew about them would surely be Yingying. Therefore, Yingying's net worth was truly unfathomable.\n\n\"That townhouse is located in the Beihao River Gold Coast Complex, Building 4, Unit 1.\n\nHowever, a family died there five years ago. The mother committed suicide by poison with her two children. Afterward, the villa remained vacant. Its listed price has always been one-third or even less than that of other houses in the vicinity, but it still couldn't be sold.\n\nIt can't be helped. The kind of person willing to spend so much on a villa is definitely going to ask around before buying. And rich people tend to be superstitious; at the very least, they'll investigate if anything happened in the house before. With a price like this, no one would believe it was that low if nothing had happened, right?\"\n\n\"Did she pay?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"The money has been paid, but our company feels obligated to provide our VIP clients with information they need to be aware of. At the same time, we will also provide our clients with the advice we must give.\n\nAlthough the purchase price for this house is very low right now, from a property flipping... oh no, I mean, from an investment perspective, it would be extremely difficult to unload it after purchase. Unless you're willing to offer a huge discount, it will be very hard to sell it in the short term.\"\n\nIn the manager's eyes, Bai Yingying was of course buying houses to flip them. Who would buy so many to live in themselves?\n\nBut in Zhou Ze's eyes, the houses Yingying had bought before were probably just for hoarding, waiting until she had over twenty or thirty properties, then whipping them out to slap Xu Qinglang in the face the next time he got cocky.\n\nBut this haunted house,\n\nwas probably one Yingying intended to live in herself.\n\nWhat was so great about a haunted house?\n\nIt was quiet, peaceful, and came with free air conditioning.\n\nLiving in a haunted house was practically a huge bargain.\n\nAs for whether it's haunted or not?\n\nThat might be a problem for ordinary people.\n\nBut for Bai Yingying and Zhou Ze,\n\n*Knock on the blackboard, people?*¹\n\nIs that a ghost?\n\nThat's leftover performance quota! A free gift with purchase!\n\nSo, a haunted house is a treasure!\n\nTaking a huge step back,\n\nno matter how good a house for the living was, no matter how good the feng shui,\n\nif you let Yingying and himself move in,\n\nit would immediately rival Count Dracula's castle, and could even be nominated for a spot on a \"Top Ten Most Haunted Houses in the World\" list.\n\n\"Since the money's been paid, just go ahead with the paperwork,\" Zhou Ze said, making the decision for Bai Yingying.\n\n\"Uh... well, alright then. How about this, I'll come back in three days to sign the specific contract.\"\n\nThe manager shook his head. He couldn't understand the world of the rich, but a commission earned was a commission earned. The reason he had made a special trip to remind them was also a gesture of goodwill, in the hopes of \"casting a long line to catch a big fish.\"\n\nWatching the man leave,\n\nthe old Taoist hobbled over, leaning on his cane, and said with some envy:\n\n\"Boss, why don't you just take both Old Xu and Yingying? That way, you'll instantly become Tongcheng's real estate tycoon.\"\n\nZhou Ze picked up the empty teacup and pretended he was about to pour.\n\nThere was no tea left in the cup,\n\nbut there were tea leaves.\n\n\"Don't, don't, don't!\" the old Taoist immediately begged for mercy with an apologetic smile.\n\nThe Corpse Attendant was still upstairs with grass growing on his head.\n\nHis own body hadn't fully recovered either, so he was in no shape to be doing any cleaning.\n\nZhou Ze put the cup back down and stretched. He couldn't be bothered to argue with the old Taoist at a time like this.\n\nAfter the manager left, Zhou Ze went on with his life. He didn't specifically go talk to Yingying about the house. No matter what her reason for buying it was, as someone who hadn't contributed a single cent, he was too embarrassed to stick his face in and say anything.\n\nBoss Zhou could only lament that in this world, the people who truly needed a house couldn't afford one, while the people with many houses didn't even have time to live in them.\n\nEven *jiangshi*² had started flipping properties.\n\nIt was hopeless, truly hopeless.\n\n...…\n\nThree days later, Zhou Ze was in the second-floor bedroom checking on Xu Qinglang's condition. Xu Qinglang was recovering well, but still showed no signs of waking up. Zhou Ze was considering whether to take him to a hospital for a comprehensive check-up. After all, the bookstore couldn't possibly have the kind of high-tech medical equipment a hospital did.\n\nBoss Zhou could infer many things from experience, but without concrete test results, he still felt a bit uneasy.\n\nIf a full examination revealed that nothing was wrong with Xu Qinglang and he still didn't wake up, Zhou Ze might have no choice but to poke him with his fingernails, to forcibly stimulate him into waking.\n\nWhether he was willing to face the fact that the old man was both his master and his father's killer, he couldn't just play Sleeping Beauty forever to escape it, can he?\n\nMost importantly,\n\nBoss Zhou had been eating so much takeout lately, he felt like his taste buds were practically dead.³ The Lycoris Radiata Oral Solution was so precious; using it on takeout just felt like a terrible waste.\n\nYingying's body, on the other hand, had \"recovered\" quite well. She could already move around on her own and had started to help manage the bookstore. Boss Zhou was once again living the petit-bourgeois lifestyle of waking up, sunbathing, reading the newspaper, and drinking coffee.\n\nHmm,\n\nOn his way out, he made a point to glance at the Corpse Attendant.\n\nThe grass on his head was already three *zhang*⁴ high.\n\nZhou Ze was genuinely worried the guy might not recover, but on second thought, if he couldn't come back, using him as a potted plant didn't seem like a bad idea.\n\n\"Yingying, someone's here for you!\"\n\nZhou Ze had just walked down the stairs when he heard the old Taoist's shout.\n\nYingying, who was cleaning the bathroom, immediately dropped what she was doing and ran out.\n\nWell, well,\n\nIt was that manager from Lianjia.⁵\n\nYingying pushed the man outside, then immediately ran up to the second floor, and then back down again, holding documents and whatnot. She then dragged the manager to the bookstore entrance and began whispering with him about something.\n\nShe was being all secretive, as if afraid her boss would find out.\n\nYingying still didn't know that while she was resting on the second floor, her boss had already chatted with this manager.\n\nThe manager could only nod, and nod, and nod again.\n\nThe client was rich, the client was willful, the client bought property without much fuss. The manager could only handle such a considerate and good client with caution.\n\nMoreover, the manager was well aware that customers who paid promptly, handled funds decisively, and didn't even bother to view the property usually had extraordinary backgrounds. They were generally from that unspeakable class of society.\n\nJust like this bookstore,\n\nonly someone with water in their brain would open a bookstore on South Street.\n\nDoesn't this indirectly prove that this family has a deep background?\n\nHe figured it was probably another \"Mountain Water Villa,\"⁶ just a front for dealings of power and money. That's how it always played out in the TV dramas, anyway.\n\nZhou Ze chuckled, turned around, and went back upstairs to the bedroom.\n\nThe bottom drawer of the bedroom wardrobe was half-open. Yingying must have opened it to get something and rushed out before she had time to close it.\n\nZhou Ze walked over and pulled it open. At the very bottom lay a stack of files and documents. Of course, the most eye-catching thing was the thick stack of property deeds.\n\nBoss Zhou simply sat down on the floor. While Yingying was still busy downstairs, he began looking through them one by one.\n\nGold Coast model, loft apartment, top-floor garden, semi-detached villa, townhouse...\n\nZhou Ze shook his head as he read.\n\nIn his past life, he had worked so hard for so many years just to finally afford one house, and it wasn't even an expensive one in a good location. But the bitterness and mental pressure of carrying that mortgage were still fresh in his memory. It was like a syringe viciously drawing a huge tube of blood from your body.\n\nThis blood,\n\nit wasn't just drawing from your present,\n\nit was also drawing your share for the next twenty years!\n\nYou were like a sheep whose wool wasn't just reserved for this year—\n\nevery year's wool, until the day you died, was already spoken for,\n\njust waiting to be sheared.\n\nThere was sighing, confusion, and a hint of disbelief.\n\nHis own maid,\n\nhad secretly bought so many houses behind his back.\n\nThis world was so damn magical.\n\nZhou Xianyu,⁷ like a *diaosi*,⁸ looked at every single floor plan, imagining what style of renovation would suit each one. In the end, his head was spinning.\n\nA dizzying sense of bliss.\n\nSo, you see,\n\njust like when Yingying played video games, the other players had no idea if their opponent was a cute girl or a *jiangshi*.\n\nSimilarly,\n\nyou also never know about those property flippers,\n\nare they even still human?\n\nFlipping through the documents, Zhou Ze picked up the last file folder at the bottom.\n\nWhoa,\n\nthis file folder looked much more formal than the others.\n\nIt must be for an even higher-end property, right?\n\nHe unwound the string tie,\n\nand opened it.\n\nThe first things to fall out were several photographs,\n\nphotographs of a villa.\n\nOh, it really was a villa.\n\nZhou Ze then took out the documents inside.\n\n\"Beihao River Gold Coast Complex, Building 4, Unit 1...\n\nDeceased: ......\"\n\nWhat the hell is this?\n\nWhy is this kind of thing in here?\n\nZhou Ze flipped through it again and realized it was actually a case file.\n\nAfter a long moment,\n\nZhou Ze finally remembered.\n\nWhen Zhang Yanfeng had come to see him, he had given him a case file, asking him to take a look and lend his insight on this old case. He had hit him with a three-part volley of rejections, and as soon as Zhang Yanfeng left, he had tossed the file to Yingying, telling her to hide it and never let him see it.\n\nZhou Ze immediately threw the case file back.\n\nNot looking.\n\nAbsolutely not looking!\n\nThen,\n\nZhou Ze pushed the drawer shut,\n\nbut suddenly froze.\n\nWait a second.\n\nBeihao River Gold Coast Complex, Building 4, Unit 1?\n\nThat sounds so familiar.\n\nFuck,\n\nisn't this the haunted house Yingying is about to buy?\n\n***\n\n**Footnotes:**\n¹ A Chinese classroom trope, used like a teacher tapping a blackboard to get students' attention for a key point.

She embezzled the domestic property-owned property-developed family through the reform of the national enterprise. Since then, it has become uncontrollable.\n\n\n\nIf she hadn't died unexpectedly, now she might have a place in Jiangsu.

She just came back from Rongcheng and was seriously injured. Although she knew that Zhou Ze was next to her, she still couldn't help but save Wang Xie.\n\n\n\nShe knew that Zhou Ze had been watching and waiting to see if she had really come back\n\n\n\nShe also knew that Zhou Ze was his father's hair and that the two of them grew up in the orphanage dean together. Zhou Ze would most likely not watch Wang Qi die.\n\n\n\nBut she dared not take a gamble.\n\n\n\nShe didn't dare to use Wang Fu's life to pay for Zhou Ze's \"emphasis on emotions\"\n\n\n\nSo she got off the building,\n\n\n\nShe took action,\n\n\n\nLater, Zhou Ze discovered the fact that she came back, and Zhou Ze successfully \"takes attention in others' danger\" and forced herself to become his subordinateShe also used many reasons to numb herself.\n\n\n\nUse many excuses to perfunctory yourself.\n\n\n\nBut this time,\n\n\n\nWhen the knife stretches over, that instinct,\n\n\n\nLet her start to be afraid\n\n\n\nCan't continue,\n\n\n\nOtherwise,\n\n\n\nShe may become another Zhou Ze's sister-in-law\n\n\n\nShe stood up and no matter what, she should go to the hospital to deal with her injuries first, and then leave this home and go to an independent environment.\n\n\n\nShe has no choice but to give up this body at a time, so she needs a new environment to cut off the relationship with everything\n\n\n\nPrepare to get a car, but I haven't handled it yet\n\n\n\nA car stopped in front of Xiao Luoli. The driver was a middle-aged man with a head, a cheek beard, his eyes were a little small, and his face was covered with oily shimmering on his face.\n\n\n\n\"Little girl, take a car\"\n\n\n\nXiao Luoli clicked her head and got on the car\n\n\n\nShe is not afraid.\n\n\n\nShe has nothing to be afraid of either\n\n\n\n\"Where to go?\" The driver asked Xiao Luoli, and then his eyes kept patrolling Xiao Luoli\n\n\n\nA little bit presumptuous,\n\n\n\nThere are also some overscores\n\n\n\nMaybe other children will not think there is anything to look at this kind of gaze, because they are not so sensitive, but Xiao Luoli is different.

The driver ran over and talked to the doctor for a while. The doctor called Xiao Luoli over.\n\n\n\nSlowly uncovered the cloth on Xiao Luoli's hand, began to disinfect her, apply medicine, and then repack it\n\n\n\nDoctor Bao was staring at the driver, looking helpless.\n\n\n\nThe blood is gone\n\n\n\nThe driver walked out with Xiao Luoli\n\n\n\n\"You're tired\"\n\n\n\nXiao Luli didn't say anything\n\n\n\n\"I'll take you to have something to eat\"\n\n\n\nXiao Luoli still didn't say anything, but she followed the driver to a nearby spicy hot shop\n\n\n\nThe driver ordered three bottles of beer and gave Xiao Luli a glass of sour plum juice.\n\n\n\nCannedXiao Luli looked at the sour plum juice in front of her for a long time.\n\n\n\nThis kind of drink has become so popular\n\n\n\n  Spicy hotpot, Xiao Luoli didn’t want to eat it, but she couldn’t stand the driver’s constant urging. She chose a little, almost thirteen pieces.\n\n\n\nThe driver ordered some of them himself, and most of the time he still drank beer\n\n\n\nThe spicy hot boss comes to talk to the driver every now and then.\n\n\n\nThe driver complained that he had lost money when he was playing the ball and also when he played cards, and he had been using bad news recently.\n\n\n\nI ate spicy hotpot for about 40 minutes.\n\n\n\nThe driver encircled the German team for thirty-nine minutes.\n\n\n\nHe said that no matter how hard the German team could not even beat the stick, he almost went to the rooftop to prepare for the queuing team when he got up this morning.\n\n\n\n  Food,\n\n\n\nThe driver stood up and said to Xiao Luli:\n\n\n\n\"I'll send you home\"\n\n\n\nXiao Luoli looked at the driver.\n\n\n\nStill nothing to say\n\n\n\nShe is in a bad mood.\n\n\n\nVery confused,\n\n\n\nWhen people are confused, they want to find something to do\n\n\n\nMaybe it was because of drinking, the driver's eyes looked at Xiao Luoli with a little redness, and his eyes changed a little.\n\n\n\n\"Go home\" the driver asked again\n\n\n\nXiao Luoli still won't answer\n\n\n\nThe driver immediately slapped his head and said regretfully, \"Mom, I'm drinking, I can't start the car, I can't take you back.\"\n\n\n\nXiao Luoli pulled the corners of her mouth.\n\n\n\n  hehe\n\n\n\n\"Who is there anyone who has a conflict with your father or mother wherever you live?\"\n\n\n\nXiao Luli points the head\n\n\n\n\"Where is your home?\" the driver asked again\n\n\n\nXiao Luoli did not say the address of her home, but the address of the bookstore\n\n\n\n\"Oh, on South Street\"\n\n\n\nThe driver waved immediately, and the nearby three-wheeled motorcycle opened.\n\n\n\nThe driver sat on it first, and then signaled Xiao Luoli to get on the car too\n\n\n\nThe motorcycle begins to sway,\n\n\n\nXiao Luoli closed her eyes, giving people a feeling of falling asleep\n\n\n\nAlong the way,\n\n\n\nThe driver's eyes were staring at her red.\n\n\n\nNever left for a moment\n\n\n\nAfter twenty minutes,\n\n\n\nWhen Xiao Luli opened her eyes again,\n\n\n\nShe saw Mo and actually arrived at the door of the book house.\n\n\n\nThe driver accompanied Xiao Luoli off the car.\n\n\n\n  Thank you to wipe your eyes,\n\n\n\n  oh,\n\n\n\nHe cried\n\n\n\n\"Baby, let's get out with my father and mother.\"\n\n\n\nXiao Luoli did not answer\n\n\n\n\"You also made this wound by yourself.\"\n\n\n\nXiao Luoli still didn't answer\n\n \n\nThe driver took a deep breath and said:\n\n\n\n\"Go back\"\n\n\n\nHe pointed to the bookstore, \"I want to watch you go back.\"\n\n\n\nXiao Luoli turned around and walked to the bookstore. When she arrived at the door of the bookstore, she stopped and turned back again\n\n\n\nA little crooked,\n\n\n\nLooking at the driver unexpectedlyYes,\n\n\n\nVery unexpected\n\n\n\nThe driver and the driver clicked a smoke when he met the motorcycle. When he saw Xiao Luoli looking back at him, he snatched his hands:\n\n\n\n\"Go back quickly, I'm going to see your family pick you up.\"\n\n\n\n\"Car Money\"\n\n\n\nXiao Luoli reached into her pocket and found that she didn't bring a cash bag or mobile phone when she left.\n\n\n\n\"What money do you want? I don't have it anymore, uncle, I have money.\"\n\n\n\nThe driver was swept away and was very proud\n\n\n\n\"You are so generous, haha, I took the little girl to the clinic at my door and ate the spicy hotpot at my door. I haven't paid all the money. It's convenient for you to owe your home neighborhood.\"\n\n\n\nThe motorcycle master spitted a smoke ring and complained.\n\n\n\n\"Tug your balls\"\n\n\n\nThe driver took a photo of the motorcycle door without any worries\n\n\n\nXiao Luoli said with expressionless face:\n\n\n\n  \"Thank you\"\n\n\n\n\"No thanks, little girl, if you have any trouble at home in the future, don't be rude. This is not worth it\n\n\n\nNo matter how conflicted you have with your father, don’t sneak out by one person, it’s too dangerous.”\n\n\n\n  \"oh\"\n\n\n\nXiao Luoli responded and turned around and prepared to leave, but stopped stepping because of the next sentence of the driver.\n\n\n\n\"My daughter, I got married and got married, but then... I didn't have any more.\"",

    "content": "Wang Ke stood at the door, calling out for a long time, but the little loli inside simply wouldn't open up. No matter what he said or how he tried to console her, she remained unmoved.\n\nWith no other choice, Wang Ke could only sigh. He turned around and looked at Zhou Ze. \"Let's do this. I'll leave her with you for now. I'll feel better knowing you're looking after her.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\nWang Ke left, walking away from the bookstore. His retreating figure looked somewhat desolate.\n\nActually, Zhou Ze felt that his childhood friend was quite pitiful. Having come from an orphanage, he had fought his way to where he was now and was, in the eyes of others, a model of success.\n\nBut his wife had a mental illness, and his daughter was possessed by a Hell-official. After all his hard work, he was really more like a man all alone in the world.\n\nAfter Wang Ke left, Zhou Ze reached out and knocked on the door.\n\n\"He's gone.\"\n\n*Creak.*\n\nThe door opened. The little loli stood behind it.\n\nZhou Ze walked in and poured himself a glass of water.\n\nThe little loli sat on the windowsill, looking down at the relatively bustling South Avenue Pedestrian Street below.\n\n\"Who was it that just told me a little while ago they enjoyed this feeling?\"\n\nWith Wang Ke gone, Zhou Ze could speak much more freely.\n\nThe little loli shook her head. \"Things are much more serious than I imagined.\"\n\n\"Exactly how serious?\"\n\n\"Serious enough that I want to kill off the other soul inside this body,\" the little loli said with great earnestness. \"To make myself... just like you.\n\nI originally kept her around just so this body could eat and sleep normally. But you're doing just fine now, aren't you? Eating and sleeping well, just like one of those hogs in a pigsty.\"\n\n\"Then figure it out yourself. Don't think you can come freeloading at my place. This bookstore is supporting enough people as it is. Headcount is expensive, you know.\"¹\n\n\"Heh.\"\n\nThe little loli let out two cold laughs.\n\n\"Why didn't you open the door just now?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"I didn't dare see him.\"\n\n\"Didn't dare?\"\n\n\"He's a very smart person. Even if he's terribly unlucky, you still can't deny that he's smart.\"\n\n\"Mm.\"\n\nZhou Ze had to admit that. Generally speaking, people who clawed their way to the top without family backing were never fools.\n\n\"I was afraid that if I saw him, I wouldn't be able to stop myself from going home with him.\"\n\n\"Hmph...\"\n\n\"His eyes... they seem like they can see right through a person's heart. I even think he's long since seen that something's not right with me, but he's still playing dumb.\"\n\n\"For what purpose?\"\n\n\"The purpose is that he's treating me as his daughter, playing the sympathy card, so I won't harm his real daughter. And so that I'll actually start treating him like my father.\"\n\nZhou Ze lit a cigarette.\n\n\"I'll stay here with you for a while.\"\n\n\"I told you, it's very crowded here...\"\n\n\"You're my Constable. Is there anything wrong with me staying by your side, awaiting your orders?\"\n\n\"Wrong, no, but...\"\n\n\"Do you think I'm not cute enough?\"\n\nThe little loli hopped down from the windowsill and walked right up to Zhou Ze. She tilted her head up with a blank, innocent look, her big eyes blinking incessantly, like the brightest stars in the sky.\n\n\"No, I...\"\n\n\"Do you think that when I really put my mind to pleasing someone, I can't compete with that stupid jiangshi?\"\n\n\"No, I...\"\n\n\"I have the body of a loli, but the heart of a lady.\"\n\n\"That's...\"\n\n\"I'm very experienced.\"\n\n\"N-No...\"\n\n\"I can satisfy that fantasy you male creatures have always secretly craved.\"\n\n*SMACK!*\n\nZhou Ze hoisted the little loli straight up over his shoulder and brought his hand down flat on her stomach and her little backside.\n\nThe little loli was stunned.\n\n*What the fuck.*\n\n*How did it turn out like this!*\n\n\"I'll teach you to be a lady!\"\n\n*SMACK! SMACK!!!*\n\n\"I'll teach you to be experienced!\"\n\n*SMACK! SMACK!!!*\n\n\"I'll teach you to be cheeky!\"\n\n*SMACK! SMACK!!!*\n\n\"Zhou Ze, you bastard, put me down!\"\n\n*SMACK!*\n\n\"Zhou Ze, you're fucking inhuman!\"\n\n*SMACK!*\n\n\"Zhou Ze, you son of a bitch!\"\n\n*SMACK!*\n\n\"Zhou Ze, you impotent, scumbag, limp-dick eunuch!\"\n\n*SMACK! SMACK! SMACK! SMACK! SMACK! SMACK! SMACK! SMACK! SMACK! SMACK! SMACK! SMACK! SMACK! SMACK! SMACK! SMACK! SMACK! SMACK! SMACK! SMACK! SMACK! SMACK! SMACK! SMACK!!!!!!*\n\n\"Haaaah...\"\n\nZhou Ze let out a long breath.\n\nHe glanced at his palm; it was red from the smacking.\n\n\"Zhou Ze... you...\"\n\nThe little loli lay sprawled on the bed.\n\nSnot and tears were streaming down her little face.\n\nShe looked utterly pitiful.\n\n\"A child your age shouldn't use foul language or talk about dirty things all the time.\"\n\n\"...\" said the little loli.\n\n...\n\nAlthough she was very unhappy and very resistant, the little loli ended up staying at the bookstore.\n\nThere was no helping it. In their mundane identities, the little loli was Zhou Ze's niece. In their underworld identities, the little loli was a Hell-official under his command.\n\nBut the good thing was, when he woke up the next morning, seeing one big and one small beauty lying beside him, and then climbing out from between them—the whole process was actually quite pleasant.\n\nHumming a tune, Zhou Ze went downstairs and took a shower. By the time he came out, Bai Yingying was already up. The newspaper was ironed, and a fresh pot of newly bought civet coffee was brewed.\n\nZhou Ze sat down in his familiar sunny spot, picked up the newspaper, and began sipping his coffee.\n\nThe years were tranquil and fine, a moment of pure contentment.\n\nThe little loli came downstairs too. Today she wore denim overalls with a Peppa Pig t-shirt, looking spirited and adorable. She sat down at the bar, a good distance away.\n\nShe tapped her fingers lightly on the counter.\n\n\"Tea!\"\n\nNo one paid her any attention.\n\n\"Coffee!\"\n\nNo one paid her any attention.\n\n\"Breakfast!\"\n\nStill, no one paid her any attention.\n\nThe little loli pouted, looking at the leisurely Zhou Ze on the other side of the room. \"This is child abuse!\" she said, very displeased.\n\nBai Yingying shot her a glance but still didn't acknowledge her.\n\nTruth be told, Yingying's heart was bitter too.\n\nHer grand \"palace intrigue\" plot against Lady Xu was about to enter its most critical phase.\n\nIt was like in *Kangxi's Incognito Travels* when the minister arrives at the last minute with the troops and the emperor's dragon robe.\n\nWho knew that just as she was about to face the final battle, another, smaller one would come to interfere.\n\nAnd this little one insisted on squeezing in, demanding to be held while sleeping just like the Boss, completely destroying her private, intimate world with him.\n\nHow infuriating!\n\nAfter drinking his tea, reading the paper, and basking in the sun, Zhou Ze went upstairs to check on Xu Qinglang again.\n\nAfter all this time, he still hadn't woken up.\n\nDeciding to just get it over with, Zhou Ze hoisted Xu Qinglang onto his back and carried him downstairs.\n\n\"Boss, let me!\"\n\nYingying immediately came over to help Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze didn't refuse.\n\nHe then watched as Yingying grabbed Xu Qinglang by the collar with one hand and simply held him up horizontally.\n\nAlthough Xu Qinglang was unconscious, being grabbed like that cut off his breathing.\n\n\"Hey,\" Zhou Ze couldn't help but remind her.\n\n\"Oh.\"\n\nWith a flick of her hand, Yingying threw Xu Qinglang over her shoulder like she was hoisting a sack of flour.\n\n\"Uh, that'll do, I guess.\"\n\nZhou Ze couldn't be bothered to say more. If anyone was to blame, it was Old Xu himself for stubbornly refusing to wake up. It was only right that he suffer a little.\n\n\"You, stay here and watch the store,\" Zhou Ze said, pointing at the little loli.\n\nThe little loli glared at Zhou Ze but didn't say anything.\n\nOld Xu's car was still parked outside. Zhou Ze drove it around to the front and had Yingying put Old Xu in the back seat.\n\n\"Boss, where are we going?\" Yingying asked from the passenger seat.\n\n\"To get him a full check-up. If there's nothing wrong, we'll find a way to shock him into waking up. It's too much trouble to keep taking care of him while he's sleeping like this.\"\n\n\"Exactly, exactly.\"\n\n\"Boss, this isn't the way to the People's Hospital or the Affiliated Hospital.\"\n\n\"A new private hospital just opened nearby. The medical facilities are supposed to be top-notch. Let's go there.\"\n\nThe car pulled up to the entrance of the private hospital and parked under the direction of a security guard.\n\nWhen they got out, Bai Yingying continued to carry \"Sack-of-Flour Xu.\"\n\nShe followed behind her boss into the building, trailed by the gazes of the security guards.\n\nEven though it was a private hospital, there were quite a few people inside. It couldn't be helped; as a former doctor, Zhou Ze knew just how strained medical resources were in the country.\n\n\"Find a place to put him down first. I'll go register,\" Zhou Ze said to Bai Yingying.\n\nBai Yingying nodded and went to find an empty seat in the lobby, still carrying Xu Qinglang.\n\nWhen Zhou Ze came back from registration, he found Bai Yingying still standing there, seemingly arguing with a man in front of her.\n\n\"Excuse me, could you move your things? I have a patient who needs to sit.\"\n\n\"Move what? These are my things. Do you know how heavy they are?\"\n\n\"Please move them.\"\n\nYingying was entering the prelude to an eruption.\n\nThe female jiangshi's temper, except when directed at Zhou Ze, was generally not very good.\n\nZhou Ze understood. The man was taking up one seat, but his belongings were taking up three. Yingying wanted him to clear one seat, and he was refusing.\n\n\"Buddy, make some room,\" Zhou Ze said, coming over to placate Bai Yingying.\n\nHe had seen how the silly girl had beaten people up at the club last time. This was a hospital; it wasn't a convenient place for that.\n\n\"Hey, I have a lot of stuff, so I put it here. What's the problem? Why should I give my spot to you? You think your family owns this hospital?\" the man scoffed disdainfully.\n\n\"His family does own it.\"\n\nJust then, a woman in a white coat walked over.\n\nThe woman was tall with fair skin. The white coat and her tied-up hair gave her a capable air. Every movement she made possessed a kind of stunning charisma.\n\n\"Doctor, who are you?\"\n\n\"She's our hospital director,\" a female nurse accompanying her answered. Zhou Ze recognized this nurse; he'd forgotten her last name but remembered that the ghost of her aborted child had once visited his bookstore and been taken in by him.\n\nThe nurse pointed at Zhou Ze and said, \"He's our director's husband.\"\n\nThe man finally shut up. He moved his things, but grumbled unhappily, \"Coming to your own hospital for treatment and you still stand in line? What are you doing, an incognito inspection?\"\n\nZhou Ze looked at Dr. Lin and noticed that her complexion had improved a lot recently. She seemed much more energetic, and her previously thin figure had returned to its former, perfectly full shape.\n\n\"You opened this hospital?\" Zhou Ze asked, a little surprised.\n\n\"I resigned. My family opened this hospital for me,\" Dr. Lin said with a smile. She pointed at the unconscious Xu Qinglang and said to the nurse beside her, \"Arrange for a dedicated department to receive him.\"\n\n\"Right away, Sister Lin.\"\n\nOrderlies and doctors immediately came over, placed Xu Qinglang on a gurney, and wheeled him away, opening a VIP fast-track channel for him.\n\n\"Come on, let's go take a look,\" Zhou Ze called to Bai Yingying, then walked over with Dr. Lin.\n\nBai Yingying didn't hurry to follow.\n\nInstead, she stomped her foot lightly.\n\nTook out her phone,\n\nAnd dialed a number:\n\n\"Hello, Miss Bai, hello. The villa has basically been purchased. I was just about to notify you, what a coincidence that you called...\"\n\n\"Cut the crap.\"\n\n\"Uh... Miss Bai, is there something I can do for you? Just give the order, I'll take care of it.\"\n\n\"I want to buy a hospital. Help me see if there are any suitable hospitals for sale.\"\n\n\"...\" said the manager.\n\n***\n\n¹**Headcount is expensive, you know**: The original term `編制 (biānzhì)` refers to the official, limited number of positions available in a government or state-owned entity. It implies a formal, permanent, and costly slot, and Zhou Ze is using it sarcastically to say he has no room for freeloaders.",

    "content": "\"Do a full-body checkup—everything that can be checked—and then give me the results,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Alright,\" Dr. Lin replied. \"Don't worry, if there's a problem, you'll know immediately. Tea?\"\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\nHe walked into Dr. Lin's office. This must have been her personal lounge area. The furnishings were simple, but they suited her crisp, no-nonsense personality.\n\nDr. Lin brewed the tea herself and brought it over.\n\n\"You said you were going to mail me the divorce papers again,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Mhm.\"\n\n\"I didn't get them.\"\n\n\"I didn't mail them.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded and sat down on the sofa opposite her desk.\n\n\"So, interested in picking up your old trade again here?\" Dr. Lin asked, gesturing around the room.\n\nThis hospital… it all belonged to her family.\n\n\"It's very tempting,\" Zhou Ze said, taking a couple of sips of tea. \"But I've gotten used to being lazy. I'm afraid I couldn't get used to the working life like before.\"\n\n\"No problem. You can come when you feel like it and stay away when you don't.\"\n\nZhou Ze licked his lips.\n\nHe was a little moved.\n\nIn this hospital, he wouldn't run into old fossils jealous of his talent, nor would he have colleagues trying to trip him up, and certainly no competitors slandering him behind his back.\n\nYou could enjoy complete freedom and put your abilities to full use.\n\nAfter all,\n\nthe hospital director was your wife.\n\nBut Zhou Ze still didn't agree outright. To be honest, he couldn't bear to part with the bookstore, with the feeling and atmosphere it gave him. At the same time, he couldn't bear to part with Yingying.\n\nWas he supposed to have Yingying get a nursing license and practice medicine with him?\n\nOf course, this wasn't a reason he could tell the woman in front of him. Zhou, ever the bachelor, knew better than that.\n\n\"Besides, it wouldn't be appropriate, would it?\"\n\nZhou Ze pointed to himself.\n\nIn his past life, he was Tongcheng's youngest and most brilliant surgeon, but what the hell was his identity as Xu Le in this life? If he were to pick up a scalpel, it could cause a lot of trouble.\n\n\"Heh, if you're willing, I've recently been looking into investing in some pharmacies. I was planning to take over the storefront next to your bookstore and turn it into one. When the time comes, you can connect it to your shop, and when you have nothing to do, you can go over and sit there for a while.\n\nSome pharmacies still have old barefoot doctors¹ on staff. Seeing minor ailments and prescribing medicine shouldn't be a problem. Besides, I trust your skills. You wouldn't tarnish your own reputation.\"\n\nZhou Ze continued to drink his tea, not wanting to discuss it further. He was afraid he wouldn't be able to control himself.\n\n\"Dr. Lin, emergency!\"\n\nJust then, a nurse ran over, shouting.\n\nDr. Lin immediately stood up and walked out of the office.\n\nZhou Ze set down his teacup and slowly walked out as well, just in time to see Bai Yingying, who had just found her way there.\n\n\"Boss, I feel like she's changed so much.\"\n\nYingying said.\n\n\"Where did you just go?\"\n\n\"Boss, she wasn't this capable before, you know.\"\n\nYingying didn't answer, trying to get away with it by being cute.\n\n\"People always change,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Then do you still like her, Boss?\" Yingying asked.\n\nYingying really wanted to say how tired she was.\n\nAfter dealing with the man,\n\nthen came the young one,\n\nand now an original wife had suddenly appeared!\n\nFor someone like her who wanted to rise up from the status of a little handmaiden, the difficulty level of this palace intrigue was just too high!\n\n\"There's nothing between her and me. Besides, with my identity, getting too entangled with her might not be a good thing for her.\"\n\n\"'Nothing' means what, exactly? Does it refer to the kind of relationship where the neck is led in until friction generates heat and the water gun finally squirts?\"\n\n\"What is all this stuff in your head?\"\n\nZhou Ze reached out and gave Yingying a rap on the head.\n\n\"But the mistress and that scholar didn't have anything going on back then either, so why were they still together and faithful until death?\"\n\n\"Between a man and a woman, it's not just about that kind of relationship. There's also mutual spiritual appr—\"\n\nZhou Ze abruptly stopped talking.\n\nWait,\n\nhold on.\n\nMistress Bai and that scholar never did... *that*?\n\nDoesn't that mean Yingying's body...\n\nshe's still...?\n\n\"Yingying, are you still...\"\n\nBefore Zhou Ze had a chance to finish his question,\n\na commotion erupted from the emergency room.\n\nDid something go wrong?\n\nZhou Ze immediately walked over. It was a professional instinct, almost a conditioned reflex. Moreover, being in a hospital made it easy for Zhou Ze to forget the fact that he was no longer the person he was in his past life.\n\nPushing open the door to the emergency room, Zhou Ze saw an old man lying on a bed. The surrounding monitors showed that the man was gradually losing his vital signs.\n\n\"Charging. Clear.\"\n\nDr. Lin was preparing to use the defibrillator.\n\nBut after one shock, the old man still didn't respond.\n\n\"Who are you? You can't be in here,\" a nurse said when she saw Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Let him stay,\" Dr. Lin said.\n\nShe was the director; naturally, no one dared to object.\n\nZhou Ze walked to Dr. Lin's side.\n\n\"Help me.\"\n\nDr. Lin said to Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Sudden heart attack?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"You keep going, watch the rhythm.\" Zhou Ze didn't presume to interfere with the resuscitation. For one, Dr. Lin was already doing a very good job; whether he joined in or not wouldn't make much of a difference.\n\nThis kind of acute illness had a very high mortality rate, and the patient was so old. For most emergency room doctors, whether he could be saved or not was a matter of doing one's best and leaving the rest to fate.\n\nThe resuscitation continued,\n\nbut the results were poor.\n\nZhou Ze took a deep breath.\n\nAt that moment,\n\nhe saw a gray luster slowly rising from the old man's body.\n\nThe soul is already coming out.\n\nIs he beyond saving?\n\nWhen Zhou Ze was a doctor before, he didn't have this \"golden finger.\" Now, he could see the souls of the dead, so he basically knew that once the soul left the body, it meant the resuscitation had failed.\n\nWatching Dr. Lin, who was still busy with the resuscitation and hadn't given up, and watching so many medical staff around her still earnestly trying to save him.\n\nZhou Ze pursed his lips and reached out, wanting to grab the soul.\n\nJust like when he had saved the little loli from the car crash, he would grab the soul and stuff it back in.\n\nEven if he would suffer a backlash and be in great pain, asking him to just sit here and watch this patient die was truly asking too much of him.\n\nEspecially in an emergency room,\n\nespecially when everyone here was wearing white coats.\n\nThe Zhou Ze of the past had also experienced the despair of a failed resuscitation time and time again. It was a kind of despair that even a seasoned doctor would need at least a week to recover from.\n\nYou gave it your all, exhausted every effort, yet still failed to save the patient's life. That sense of defeat was truly not something an ordinary person could bear.\n\nHis palm touched it,\n\nbut the soul began to distort.\n\nIf grabbing the little loli's soul had been like grabbing a wooden plank, then grabbing this old man's soul was like grabbing a handful of rotten mud.\n\nHis natural lifespan was up?\n\nZhou Ze frowned slightly,\n\nunwilling to give up, and continued to grasp at it.\n\nAn awkward scene unfolded in the emergency room.\n\nWhile everyone was trying their absolute best to save the patient,\n\nthis man, who had been given special permission by the director to be here,\n\nwas...\n\ndancing?\n\nCould it be that the director had invited a shaman to perform a ritual?\n\nWe're medical professionals, hey!\n\nHow can you use such methods to treat a patient!\n\nBut out of respect for the director's position, and furthermore, given the professionalism and skill Lin Wanqiu had always displayed, no one really believed that Dr. Lin would actually invite a shaman to help treat a patient.\n\nSo,\n\nthe atmosphere in the emergency room remained awkward.\n\nUntil,\n\nZhou Ze finally realized there was nothing he could do,\n\nbecause he could see the old man's soul twisting and suffering in his hand,\n\neven begging him to let go.\n\nHe was in too much pain.\n\nHe would rather depart peacefully for reincarnation in Hell than endure this torment any longer.\n\nZhou Ze lowered his arm, somewhat dejected.\n\nA person whose natural lifespan was up... even he couldn't pull them back.\n\nActually, Zhou Ze had tried saving people this way before. Afterwards, he would suffer a certain backlash and be in great pain, but there was no major harm done, nothing that would break bones or tear muscles.\n\nSometimes Zhou Ze also wondered: he had clearly changed whether a person lived or died, so why was the price so small?\n\nLater,\n\nZhou Ze figured it out.\n\nFor example, take two patients with the same illness and in the same condition.\n\nOne receives treatment at the best hospital in America, and he lives.\n\nThe other gets an IV drip and waits it out in a small rural hospital in the country, and he dies.\n\nDifferent medical resources allowed one person to live while the other died. Could you call that changing fate?\n\nA Hell official using his special ability to stuff a soul back into a body to increase the chance of a successful resuscitation was, in principle, similar to using more advanced medical equipment for treatment.\n\nOf course, a Hell official was special, so experiencing some backlash was normal.\n\nBut for those whose natural lifespan was up, they were truly beyond help. Even a Hell official was powerless.\n\nThe resuscitation failed.\n\nEveryone in the emergency room had a look of disappointment on their faces.\n\n\"Notify the family, and prepare the resuscitation report and other documents.\"\n\nLin Wanqiu ordered.\n\n\"Yes, ma'am.\"\n\nThen, Lin Wanqiu looked at Zhou Ze. \"I'm sorry.\"\n\nThis apology was because the incident had affected Zhou Ze's mood.\n\n\"You're being a stranger.\"\n\nI've also seen it all before.\n\nZhou Ze and Lin Wanqiu walked out of the emergency room together.\n\nUpon exiting, they found a crowd of people gathered outside.\n\nA white-haired old lady with a cane stood at the very front. She was short, but her clothes and demeanor were refined. Behind her stood some elderly people and some younger people, more than fifty in total.\n\nZhou Ze's gaze hardened.\n\nDr. Lin also took a deep breath.\n\nMedical professionals were no strangers to scenes like this.\n\nThey must have all been family members.\n\nAt this moment, every one of them wore a solemn expression filled with grief. Many of them had their fists clenched.\n\nZhou Ze took a step forward, shielding Lin Wanqiu behind him.\n\nThe old lady choked back a sob and asked:\n\n\"My old man... he's gone, isn't he?\"\n\n\"I'm sorry. We did everything we could,\" Dr. Lin answered from behind Zhou Ze.\n\nThe old lady nodded.\n\n\"So he's gone.\"\n\nThen,\n\nthe old woman took a step forward,\n\nand bowed to all the doctors and nurses who had come out of the emergency room.\n\n\"Thank you for trying to save him. We're sorry for the trouble. Thank you for your hard work.\"\n\nThe sons, daughters, nephews, and nieces behind the old lady also bent down and bowed,\n\nsaying in a somber tone to all the doctors and nurses there:\n\n\"Thank you for your hard work. Thank you.\"\n\n***\n\n¹Barefoot doctors (赤腳醫生) were farmers who received minimal basic medical and paramedical training and worked in rural villages in China during the 1960s-1980s. They provided basic healthcare in areas where urban-trained doctors would not settle.",

    "content": "Looking at the bowing relatives before them, both Zhou Ze and Doctor Lin found it a bit hard to accept for a moment. It was a strange feeling; mutual respect should be a given, yet it had been disregarded for so long.\n\nIn this world, there are incompetent doctors, but responsible ones are the vast majority. In this world, there are people who rush to profit from the tragedy of their own kin,¹ but most people are reasonable.\n\nAs a result, because these two groups constantly stirred up trouble and grabbed headlines, the two larger communities were slowly driven into opposition.\n\n\"I'm sorry.\"\n\nDoctor Lin walked over and helped the old woman up.\n\nThe old woman placed her hand on the back of Doctor Lin’s. \"Thank you for your hard work, child. My old man's passing should have been relatively peaceful. There was nothing left in the family for him to worry about.\"\n\n*Relatively peaceful?*\n\nAt that moment, Zhou Ze subconsciously looked up at the ceiling.\n\n*Yes.*\n\n*If Boss Zhou hadn't intervened, the old man would have passed very peacefully.*\n\nBack when Zhou Ze had tried and failed to grab his soul, the old man was in so much pain that he was just short of kneeling and kowtowing to Zhou Ze, begging him, \"Stop saving me, just let me die, I'm begging you.\"\n\nOf course, this wasn't something he could tell anyone.\n\nAfter comforting the old man's family and relatives, Doctor Lin returned to her office, picked up her already cold tea, and took several large gulps.\n\nZhou Ze and Bai Yingying followed her. There was no other choice; Old Xu was still undergoing tests, and they couldn't just dump him here and go home.\n\nDoctor Lin sat in her chair, bent over, and gently massaged her calves.\n\nShe was wearing black silk stockings today, and her long, shapely legs, combined with the black silk, were a form of seduction practically unique in the world.\n\nPaired with her white lab coat uniform...\n\nZhou Ze leaned against the office doorway...\n\nand couldn't help but stare for a long time.\n\n\"Ahem...\"\n\nYingying pouted and coughed pointedly.\n\n\"Boss, do not look at what is improper.\"\n\nZhou Ze reached out and ruffled Yingying's hair.\n\n\"We're not divorced yet. It's only right and proper for me to look at my own wife.\"\n\nYingying was exasperated. She said:\n\n\"Boss, why don't you just take Doctor Lin in? Dragging this on is just painful. If it comes to it, she can be the main wife, and I'll be the minor one.\"\n\n\"What are you thinking about?\"\n\nZhou Ze continued to ruffle Bai Yingying's hair, his gaze still fixed on Doctor Lin's legs.\n\n\"Anyway, it's normal for a man to have three or four wives. You could take in Lin Ke too, and Old Xu as well.\"\n\nYingying's feudalistic poisoning was quite severe.\n\n\"Go see if Old Xu is done,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nYingying took something out of her pocket, placed it in Zhou Ze's, and then skipped off to find Old Xu.\n\nZhou Ze was so focused on staring that he didn't even notice.\n\nDoctor Lin surely knew a man was watching her with a fiery gaze, but she paid it no mind. Instead, she stood up and sat on her desk.\n\nLegs crossed,\n\nfigure poised,\n\ncurves alluring.\n\nZhou Ze subconsciously swallowed.\n\nYou had to admit, Doctor Lin was truly beautiful—that sort of aura, that sort of figure.\n\nIt was no wonder that Zhou Ze had inherited Xu Le's obsession:\n\n*How could she not sleep with me?*\n\n\"Still not considering working here?\" Doctor Lin asked.\n\n\"We'll see.\"\n\nZhou Ze sat down in a chair. *If I came to work here, could we add an extra bed in the office?*\n\n\"Okay, let's not mention the divorce papers for now. Just help me stall for a bit. Once I divorce you, my parents will definitely start pushing me to find another man again. It's so annoying.\"\n\n\"You've changed a lot,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nThe old Doctor Lin, though excellent at her job, was like a well-bred lady from ancient times when it came to family and her personal love life, always obedient to her parents. Her marriage to Xu Le was, in fact, a product of such an arrangement by their parents.\n\n\"People always change, don't they?\"\n\nDoctor Lin smiled and pointed at Zhou Ze.\n\n\"The mentor who was once completely devoted to his work now only wants to sunbathe and read the newspaper every day. You're the one who's changed the most.\"\n\n\"True.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded. He could feel that Doctor Lin was constantly changing, transforming from a gentle woman into a strong career woman of the new era.\n\n\"About the pharmacy, if you don't object, I'll go ahead and make the arrangements,\" Doctor Lin said.\n\n\"Fine. I can help keep an eye on it.\"\n\n\"Mm.\"\n\nJust then, Doctor Lin's phone rang. She answered it, then said to Zhou Ze:\n\n\"Your friend's examination is over. There are no issues.\"\n\n\"Good.\"\n\nZhou Ze stood up.\n\n\"Then I'll be going?\"\n\n\"Also, Xiao Yi got into Fudan University.\"\n\n\"She deserves a spanking. Why didn't she get into Tsinghua?\"\n\nZhou Ze waved to Doctor Lin and walked out of the office.\n\nDoctor Lin sat alone on her desk, turned her head, and looked at the two trees in the courtyard outside the window.\n\nOne was a ginkgo tree.\n\nThe other was also a ginkgo tree.\n\n...\n\n\"Boss, the doctor said Old Xu is fine. When are you going to... stick him?\"\n\nBai Yingying came over, still carrying Old Xu like a sack of potatoes.\n\n\"Back home, we'll...\" Zhou Ze couldn't bring himself to say the word. \"We'll deal with it back home.\"\n\n\"Oh!\"\n\nThey got in the car.\n\nAs Zhou Ze started the car and drove toward the exit, a Mercedes suddenly shot out from the side and behind them, trying to cut ahead. It honked its horn frantically, its engine roaring.\n\nZhou Ze ignored it and continued driving, not letting it pass.\n\nThe Mercedes had no choice but to stop behind them, as the exit was only so wide.\n\nBut as Zhou Ze was paying the parking fee at the guard booth, the car behind him started honking nonstop, urging him on. Zhou Ze could even hear yelling.\n\nProbably something like, \"Hurry up and get your crappy Nissan out of the way.\"\n\n\"Boss, that person behind us is so annoying,\" Bai Yingying said, displeased.\n\n\"It's nothing,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"I'll buy you a new car this afternoon, Boss.\"\n\n\"No need.\"\n\nThe car left the hospital and soon got onto the Jianghai Avenue viaduct.\n\nBefore long, that same Mercedes caught up to them again, driving very fast. It sped past Zhou Ze and then deliberately swerved back and forth in front of him. The young man in the driver's seat even stuck his hand out the window and gave him the middle finger.\n\n\"Boss, let me go drag him out and beat him up.\"\n\n\"No need.\"\n\nZhou Ze slowed down, ignoring him.\n\nIn truth, driving is probably something that only people who've just gotten their licenses and haven't driven much really look forward to, thinking it's fun.\n\nIn contrast, old veterans of the road have a kind of reverence for it.\n\nThere's nothing you can do about it.\n\nYou can be driving your car safely and steadily, but you can't guarantee you won't run into a few idiots on the road. And these idiots often don't just get themselves killed; they can drag you down with them.\n\nThat's the most helpless part of it all.\n\nZhou Ze wasn't about to get angry with him.\n\nThe Mercedes drove off.\n\nBut after a short while, Zhou Ze saw it deliberately slow down again, letting him overtake it.\n\nA moment later, the Mercedes was back, following right behind them.\n\n\"Boss, is there something wrong with this guy?\"\n\n*Yes.*\n\n*There is something wrong with him.*\n\n*A Hell Warden is ignoring you,*\n\n*but you're desperately running up to him,*\n\n*doing an awkward dance,*\n\n*trying to get his attention.*\n\n*Even the Old God of Longevity eating arsenic because he's tired of living couldn't top this.*\n\n\"It's fine.\"\n\n\"Boss, you have such great composure. Yingying really admires you!\"\n\nA bit of flattery was served up.\n\nZhou Ze smiled.\n\n\"Do you want to learn to drive?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"No, it's too much trouble,\" Yingying said.\n\n\"If you want to drive, go get a license. But be more careful on the road in the future. In some accidents, you might be fine, but other people are just ordinary humans. They could get into serious trouble.\"\n\n\"Mm, I know, Boss.\"\n\n\"Besides, you're in the car, and Old Xu is lying in the back. I can't possibly get into a spat with someone right now. In fact, getting angry while driving is a very stupid thing to do.\"\n\n\"Mm, Yingying understands.\"\n\nUp ahead was a large truck, with a bus next to it.\n\nZhou Ze chose not to overtake, instead slowing down to follow behind.\n\nJust then, the Mercedes behind them started acting up again. It accelerated abruptly, didn't signal, and began to weave madly through traffic, as if playing a racing game on an old 8-bit console.\n\nAfter a series of overtakes, it pulled up parallel to Zhou Ze.\n\nThen it cut sharply in front of him.\n\nIts front end swerved over, its body squeezing in.\n\nEven though the distance between Zhou Ze and the truck ahead was short—not nearly enough for the car to fit—it didn't care.\n\nWhen faced with this situation, the correct response is to yield speed, not your lane.\n\nBut many new drivers tend to make a mistake here, instinctively swerving out of the way. Many accidents happen exactly at this moment.\n\nMeanwhile, the one who maliciously cut in gets away without a scratch and drives off.\n\nWatching the Mercedes aggressively forcing its way in,\n\nZhou Ze, who had just been praised by Yingying for his great composure,\n\nnot only did not yield his lane,\n\nhe didn't even slow down.\n\nHe actually stomped on the gas pedal!\n\n\"VROOOM!\"\n\nThe Nissan instantly accelerated and shot forward.\n\n\"BANG!\"\n\nIt hit.\n\nThe other car was at an angle.\n\nOnly its front part had crossed the line, with its body still on it. Being rammed like that, the side of the car slammed into the back of the truck, and the vehicle immediately flipped over.\n\nWhat followed was a series of Thomas Flairs,² with near-perfect technical marks.\n\nIt finally crashed into the guardrail...\n\nand came to a stop.\n\nThe car was upside down, roof on the ground, wheels in the air.\n\nLight smoke rose from the chassis, and the windows were shattered all over the ground.\n\nWell, the sort of black smoke and fiery explosions you see in movies and TV shows didn't happen.\n\nZhou Ze also stopped his car.\n\nHe turned on his hazard lights, the double flashers blinking.\n\nThen Zhou Ze said to Bai Yingying in the passenger seat:\n\n\"Get the warning triangle from the trunk, place it down the road behind us, and then call the police. Tell the traffic police to come and assign fault. He's entirely at fault.\"\n\n\"Okay!\"\n\nYingying immediately got out of the car to get the warning triangle.\n\nBoss Zhou was a law-abiding citizen, following the procedures from the driver's theory test³ perfectly.\n\nThen,\n\nZhou Ze looked in his rearview mirror and saw the Mercedes' door being pushed open.\n\nA guy with a bloody head crawled out.\n\nZhou Ze lit a cigarette.\n\nThen he stuck his other hand out the window,\n\naimed it at that punk,\n\nflipped him the middle finger,\n\nblew out a smoke ring,\n\nand said:\n\n\"Idiot.\"\n\n***\n**Footnotes:**\n1.  **\"profit from the tragedy of their own kin\"**: The original text uses the phrase `人血饅頭` (rén xuè mántou), or \"human blood mantou.\" This is a famous literary reference to a story by Lu Xun, where a steamed bun soaked in the blood of an executed person is used as a folk cure.

    "content": "If a car in front forces its way into your lane and you hit it before it has fully crossed the line, it's their fault. But if they've already fully crossed the line and you hit them, it's considered a rear-end collision.\n\nIn his past life, whenever Zhou Ze encountered this sort of thing, he'd always wanted to teach these kinds of dumbasses a lesson. In fact, most drivers have run into similar situations and had similar thoughts, but they were afraid of the trouble, the waste of time and energy, so they could only hold their noses and let it slide, time and time again.\n\nIt was precisely because of the public's tolerance that some dumbasses were able to keep sliding down the path of dumbassery, getting more and more out of control.\n\nThis life,\n\nhe was already a ghost.\n\nThe car belonged to a friend.\n\nA friend with over twenty properties.\n\nHe probably wouldn't care about this one Nissan.\n\nPlus, the other guy kept provoking him.\n\nSo, Zhou Ze decided to just send him on his way.\n\nSince his parents hadn't raised him right, Zhou Ze didn't mind lending a hand.\n\nYingying ran to set up the warning triangle and then ran back.\n\nZhou Ze, meanwhile, got out of the car and watched that fella crawl out of his car window.\n\n\"Heh, lucky to be alive.\"\n\nZhou Ze flicked the ash from his cigarette. The guy was in one piece. Aside from a few scrapes that made his face look covered in blood, they were actually just superficial wounds, nothing serious.\n\nAs a doctor in his past life, Zhou Ze had at least that much of a discerning eye.\n\n\"Fuck...\"\n\nThe other guy pointed a finger at Zhou Ze.\n\n\"I'm going to kill you.\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head, not even bothering to engage with the guy. These kinds of people were the most disgusting. In their own worldview, they were always right.\n\nEveryone else was their parent, obligated to spoil them and give way to them; they couldn't possibly suffer the slightest inconvenience.\n\nThe police and traffic police arrived quickly.\n\nZhou Ze cooperated with the investigation with a good attitude.\n\nThere was surveillance video from above, and his car had a dashcam. The whole process should go smoothly without any problems.\n\nBesides, Zhou Ze wasn't worried about the other party having connections and pulling strings.\n\nAfter the convening of the 19th National Congress of the Party,\n\nall of society and every industry have been deeply studying the spirit of the new era's new thought. The police and traffic police systems have also been implementing the ideological line of serving the people and enforcing the law for the people, strengthening the ideological and political standards of law enforcement officers, and truly becoming a strong shield protecting the people's lives and property and safeguarding the achievements of the reform and opening-up!!!\n\nThe results of the police and traffic police investigation were just as Zhou Ze expected.\n\nAs for Zhou Ze stepping on the gas at the last moment,\n\nwho could prove that Zhou Ze did it on purpose?\n\n*I'm a coward.*\n\n*When he suddenly cut in front of me,*\n\n*I instinctively stepped on the gas.*\n\n*It's not my fault.*\n\nAs a law-abiding citizen, Boss Zhou was truly secure in the knowledge that he had nothing to fear!\n\nHowever,\n\nwhen a traffic officer, as if remembering something at the last second, walked over to Zhou Ze and (｀・ω・´)ゞ saluted,\n\nhe said:\n\n\"Please present your driver's license again.\"\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze.\n\nHoly shit!\n\nIn that instant, ten thousand grass-mud horses¹ galloped through Boss Zhou's mind.\n\nHe'd forgotten the most important thing.\n\nHe didn't have a driver's license!\n\nLast time, when Lao Dao was driving to Yancheng, he got stopped by the traffic police and was taken in. Afterward, Zhou Ze had said he'd go with Lao Dao to get a license, but then things got busy, and Zhou Ze himself had fallen unconscious twice. Where would he have found the time?\n\n*Xu Le,*\n\n*you bastard,*\n\n*you're not even human!*\n\n*Would it have fucking killed you to take some time to get a license before?!*\n\n\"I don't have my license with me,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Not with you?\" The traffic officer paused.\n\nDriving without your license on you was different from driving without a license. If caught by the traffic police, they would usually impound the car first. You could go get your license and then retrieve the car. If you were unlucky, you might get a point deducted and a two-hundred-yuan fine.\n\n\"I'll have my friend bring it now. My house isn't far from here,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nThe traffic officer nodded, while looking at Zhou Ze with a bit of suspicion.\n\nBased on the current situation, the Mercedes was undoubtedly 100% at fault, because the surveillance footage also showed how recklessly the Mercedes had been driving before the accident.\n\nHowever,\n\nif Zhou Ze was driving without a license,\n\nthe nature of the problem would change in an instant.\n\n\"Boss, should I call Lao Dao to burn some joss paper?\"\n\nYingying leaned in behind Zhou Ze and asked in a low voice.\n\n\"What good would burning joss paper do now?\"\n\nZhou Ze was helpless. Burning joss paper could only erase the influence and trouble brought on by things you didn't do or things that had nothing to do with you.\n\nBut Boss Zhou really *was* driving without a license.\n\nYou couldn't exactly tell the traffic police, \"My name isn't Xu Le, it's Zhou Ze.\"\n\n*Officer,*\n\n*I've possessed this body.*\n\n*You can check the records for that Zhou Ze,*\n\n*he definitely has a driver's license under his name.*\n\nIf he explained it like that,\n\nthe consequences would be far more complicated than just causing an accident while driving without a license.\n\nZhou Ze might even be carted off to a mental hospital.\n\n\"Hurry up and call your friend to bring it,\" the traffic officer said. \"We can actually check it here, or I can check for you now...\"\n\n\"No, no, it'll be here right away.\"\n\nZhou Ze took out his phone and dialed Zhang Yanfeng's number.\n\n\"Hello...\"\n\nOn the other end, Zhang Yanfeng sounded like he had just woken up. Sleeping in the middle of the day probably meant he'd just pulled an all-nighter on a case.\n\n\"It's me.\"\n\n\"Oh, what's up?\"\n\n\"I got into a car accident. Could you come bring me my driver's license?\" Zhou Ze said, keeping an eye on the traffic officer.\n\n\"License? Why are you asking me for your license...?\" Zhang Yanfeng woke up completely. As a seasoned veteran detective, his reaction time was very sharp. \"You were driving without a license?\"\n\n\"Yeah. It's in the second drawer under my computer desk. Bring it quickly.\"\n\n\"You got into a car accident while driving without a license?\"\n\n\"Ah, you found it, right? Let me tell you, the other guy is completely at fault. It was just my bad luck.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by calling me? Do you want me to abuse my power for personal gain?\n\nLet me tell you, after the convening of the 19th National Congress of the Party, the entire public security apparatus...\"\n\n\"By the way, that file folder you gave me last time is also in that drawer. I've looked at it, no problem. Bring me the license, and I'll go with you to see that villa, help you with your house-hunting.\"\n\n\"...\" Zhang Yanfeng.\n\nThere was a long silence on the other end of the line.\n\nZhang Yanfeng sighed and said:\n\n\"Put the traffic officer next to you on the phone.\"\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\nZhou Ze handed the phone to the traffic officer in front of him. \"It's for you.\"\n\nThe traffic officer was taken aback.\n\n*What the hell is this?*\n\n*Come on, you're not even the one at fault, do you really need to pull strings?*\n\nThe traffic officer refused to take the phone and said sternly, \"What is the meaning of this? Let me tell you, we handle things by the book. It doesn't matter who you call or what connections you have!\n\nEspecially after the convening of the 19th Party Congress...\"\n\n\"This is Zhang Yanfeng!\"\n\nZhou Ze put the phone on speaker.\n\nThe traffic officer hesitated for a moment, then took the phone.\n\n\"Captain Zhang, what are you... Okay, I get it. I understand. I know. Okay, okay.\"\n\nThe traffic officer handed the phone back to Zhou Ze, saluted him, and then walked away.\n\nZhou Ze picked up the phone again. \"Hey, you're not even in the same department, how did you manage to talk him around?\"\n\n\"I told him you're an undercover agent for our bureau, and your identity can't be disclosed for the time being. I'll send over the paperwork later.\"\n\n\"That formal?\"\n\n\"You're at the accident scene, right? I'm driving over right now.\"\n\n\"You sure you don't want to get some more sleep?\"\n\n*Why is he in such a hurry?*\n\n\"This case has been weighing on my mind for too long!\" Zhang Yanfeng said.\n\n\"You probably didn't rest well yesterday. Driving now would be drowsy driving. You need to be responsible for the lives and property of the public.\"\n\n\"The first thing I need to be responsible for is my case!\"\n\nZhang Yanfeng practically yelled from the other end of the line.\n\n\"I'm coming over right now. If I get there and you're gone, the charge of causing an accident while driving without a license will stick!\"\n\n\"Are you threatening me?\"\n\n\"Go ahead, knock out all the police and traffic cops around you and then flee to the ends of the earth to live as a fugitive. I know you have it in you.\"\n\n\"Tongcheng is my hometown. I love her, and I can't bear to leave her.\"\n\n\"Beep beep beep...\"\n\nThe other end hung up.\n\n\"Boss, how did it go?\"\n\n\"Your boss is about to go play Conan. By the way, take a taxi and get Old Xu back to the bookstore. The police are going to have this car towed. Then have Lao Dao go to your newly bought vi—\"\n\n\"Hm?\"\n\n\"Tell Lao Dao to come out and call me.\"\n\n\"Okay, Boss.\"\n\nThe reason Zhou Ze chose to bring Lao Dao instead of Bai Yingying was that for investigating a case, Lao Dao was more flexible for running errands than Bai Yingying. Besides, that guy Lao Dao always managed to find something, like a blind cat stumbling upon a dead mouse.\n\nYingying obediently carried Xu Qinglang into a taxi and left. Zhou Ze remained at the accident scene, leaning against the guardrail and waiting.\n\nThe dumbass driving the Mercedes had already been sent to the hospital. Before being loaded into the ambulance, he shot Zhou Ze a glare, as if to say, *You just wait, kid.*\n\nZhou Ze completely ignored this idiot's threat.\n\nIf the other party wanted to try some retaliatory action, Boss Zhou really wouldn't mind pushing back.\n\nThe Zombie Bookstore didn't get its reputation for nothing.\n\nZhang Yanfeng did indeed arrive quickly. He parked his car on the side of the road and gestured for Zhou Ze to get in. A few policemen still at the scene saluted and greeted him.\n\n\"Your eyes are so red. I should probably drive.\"\n\n\"You don't have a license.\"\n\n\"The accident wasn't my fault.\"\n\n\"You don't have a license. I can't let you drive.\"\n\nWith that, Zhang Yanfeng started the car.\n\nThe residential complex where the villa was located was quite popular, with a high occupancy rate. Zhang Yanfeng used his police ID to get past the security gate and drove straight in, his familiarity with the route suggesting he came here often.\n\nThe car stopped directly in front of the villa.\n\nThe small yards in front of the other villas were all neatly trimmed, but this one alone was in a state of decay, overgrown with weeds.\n\nPushing open the gate, they walked in. Officer Zhang then took out a key card and opened the door.\n\n\"Heh, if I didn't know better, I'd think this was your own home.\n\nI heard it was a woman and two children who died here, right?\"\n\nZhang Yanfeng froze.\n\nHe stood at the entrance of the foyer,\n\nand said in a heavy voice:\n\n\"Yes. That woman was my sister. My biological sister.\n\nThose two children,\n\nwere my own nephew and niece.\"\n\n\"Sorry,\" Zhou Ze pursed his lips. \"If you had told me sooner, I wouldn't have delayed for so long.\"\n\n\"Thank you.\"\n\n\"Have they found the murderer?\"\n\n\"The suspect... is my own brother-in-law.\"\n\n***\n**Footnotes:**\n1.  **Grass-mud horse (草泥馬, cǎonímǎ):** A famous Chinese internet meme.

    "content": "\"Is your family that rich?\"\n\nZhou Ze asked, passing a cigarette to Zhang Yanfeng.\n\nThere was a reason for his question.\n\nAnd it was a reason Zhou Ze could really relate to, as it was a situation he was all too familiar with, at least for a while.\n\nWhat's the difference between a nephew from your sister's side and one from your brother's side?\n\nA nephew from your sister is the child of your sister and brother-in-law; he doesn't carry your family name.\n\nA nephew from your brother is the child of your brother and sister-in-law; he shares your surname.\n\nThe son of your own family is your brother's son; the son of another family is your sister's son, because your sister marries into another family, and the children she has belong to that other family.\n\nOf course, there is a special exception to this, and that is if the man marries into the bride's family.\n\nIf Boss Zhou hadn't stepped in, Xu Le's status at the time would have been pretty much the same as Zhang Yanfeng's brother-in-law's.\n\n\"My family used to own a small factory. While my parents were still around, they arranged this marriage for my sister. My dad was also a cop; my mom was the one who managed and built up the factory. After my sister got married, the factory's affairs were mostly handed over to my brother-in-law to manage. Anyway, I'm no good at business and couldn't be bothered to waste my energy on it.\n\nAfter that incident five years ago, the factory was shut down. The blow from it also led to my parents passing away one after the other a few years back.\"\n\nZhang Yanfeng spoke of these things as if he were an outsider. This was a professional instinct. He was a veteran detective and naturally understood that bringing emotional baggage into his work was inappropriate.\n\n\"Hold on.\"\n\nZhou Ze raised a hand, looking puzzled.\n\n\"Your brother-in-law is in prison now, right?\"\n\n\"Yes, he is. For abuse.\"\n\n\"Then who listed this villa for sale?\" Zhou Ze asked, finding it strange.\n\nYingying had already completed the transfer for this villa, hadn't she? Which meant that this property, which nominally belonged to Zhang Yanfeng's sister's family, was now technically Yingying's property, and therefore, his, Zhou Ze's, property.\n\n\"It's being sold?\" Zhang Yanfeng frowned. Clearly, he didn't know about this.\n\n\"Yes, and my family has probably already bought it.\"\n\n\"You bought this house?\"\n\n\"Can't I?\"\n\n\"You...\" Zhang Yanfeng was at a loss for words.\n\n\"So, even if you hadn't come to me for help this time, I would have come to take a look. No matter what, it's my own house now. I have to make sure any loose ends are tied up.\"\n\n\"It's probably my brother-in-law's relatives selling it. His name was on the deed, too.\"\n\n\"That's your family's business. All I know is my purchase of the house was completely legal and proper.\"\n\n\"It's just a house. What I want is the truth. The truth behind the deaths of my sister and my two nephews,\" Zhang Yanfeng said in a low voice.\n\n*It's just a house.*\n\nZhou Ze took a deep breath.\n\nAnd looked up at the sky.\n\nThe villa hadn't been cleaned in a long time. Zhang Yanfeng would come by from time to time, but it was unrealistic to expect him to grab a broom, mop, and rag and clean the entire place from top to bottom.\n\nThe sofa was covered in a layer of dust. Zhou Ze blew on a spot before sitting down.\n\n\"Tell me the specific situation again,\" he asked. \"I haven't finished the case file. It was a suicide by poison, right?\"\n\n\"Yes, suicide by poison. At the time, my sister and her two children were found huddled together, dead right there.\"\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"On the sofa you're sitting on right now.\"\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze even turned his head to look, but he didn't see anything. Of course, he didn't jump up in fright, either. What kind of storm hadn't Boss Zhou weathered? Why would he be scared of this?\n\n\"If it was a suicide, how did your brother-in-law get involved?\" Zhou Ze asked, a bit confused. \"Hey, you didn't just frame him out of anger, did you?\"\n\nIt was just a joke. Zhou Ze still believed in Zhang Yanfeng's integrity. He was a good cop; he wouldn't do something like that.\n\n\"This matter involved my relatives, so I was recused. I wasn't the one who personally handled the case.\n\nThe bodies were discovered by the cleaning lady who came to the house every day. She's the one who called the police.\n\nWhen we police examined the bodies, we found that my sister and her two children had obvious marks from being tied up and abused. There were both new and old injuries, proving that the abuse and domestic violence had been going on for a long time.\n\nTherefore, the police investigation concluded that they chose to end their lives because they could no longer bear the long-term domestic violence and abuse. That's why my sister did something foolish and took her own two children with her in a suicide by poisoning.\"\n\n\"Doesn't the case seem pretty clear-cut?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"My brother-in-law won't admit to it,\" Zhang Yanfeng said.\n\n\"But he was sentenced anyway.\"\n\n\"Although not for murder, he was still sentenced to ten years for false imprisonment and abuse, which led to severe consequences,\" Zhang Yanfeng said.\n\n\"So, what's your reason for continuing to investigate?\" Zhou Ze asked, a little curious.\n\nThe case really did seem straightforward.\n\n\"My brother-in-law isn't that kind of person. Even though he married into our family, my family treated him very well. When my parents were alive, they treated him even better than they treated me, their own son.\"\n\nZhou Ze cleaned out his ear.\n\nEvery family said the same thing.\n\nZhou Ze was sure that Dr. Lin's parents, when talking about him to their relatives, would definitely say how well they treated this son-in-law, but now this son-in-law was an ungrateful wolf who wouldn't even come home, and so on.\n\n\"My sister had a great personality, too. She was very gentle and considerate.\"\n\nZhou Ze cleaned out his other ear. Every brother said the same thing.\n\n\"My brother-in-law is a good man, too. I met him myself back then and gave him my approval. He's not that kind of person.\"\n\n\"People change,\" Zhou Ze said reassuringly.\n\nFor some reason, after hearing this whole narrative, Zhou Ze felt that Zhang Yanfeng was acting like a child throwing a tantrum.\n\n*Holy shit.*\n\n*Can you even call those reasons?*\n\n*He was good, I was good, everyone was good.*\n\n*It's like those official statistics on average income—*\n\n*Who'd believe that?*\n\n\"I saw and examined the bodies of my sister and her two children myself.\" Zhang Yanfeng sat down on the floor, not caring if it was dirty. Of course, Zhou Ze felt this guy was even dirtier than the floor, the spitting image of that sloppy cop trope from TV shows.\n\nAnd yet, this type of scruffy cop was always a hit with the young female officers.\n\nZhang Yanfeng wasn't the lead on this case, but given his status, it was no problem for him to look at the case file and the bodies.\n\n\"There were indeed many bruises and wounds on their bodies, and they were severe. There were new injuries and old ones. Some of the injuries looked like they were years old.\n\nEver since my sister got married, she mostly stayed at home to raise the kids and rarely went out. She had very little social contact. She was a full-time writer who liked being a homebody.\"\n\n\"And then?\" Zhou Ze yawned.\n\n\"But, the problem is, a week before the incident, my son had just finished his college entrance exams. I took him to the water park to have fun, and I brought my nephew and niece along.\"\n\nAs he said this,\n\nZhang Yanfeng's eyes suddenly turned red. Like a hungry wolf, he roared at Zhou Ze:\n\n\"I swear, when I saw my nephew and niece then, there wasn't a single injury on their bodies!\n\nThen damn it,\n\na week later, when they were dead,\n\nwhere did all those shocking old injuries on their bodies come from!\"\n\nZhou Ze was stunned.\n\nA week before the incident, Zhang Yanfeng took his own son, his nephew, and his niece to a water park. The two kids would have definitely been in swimwear. His nephew would have been wearing just a small pair of trunks. A veteran detective like Zhang Yanfeng would have been able to tell at a glance if there were any injuries.\n\nHe was sure there were none, which meant there definitely were none.\n\nIf there had been, Zhang Yanfeng wouldn't have waited for the case to happen; he would have gone looking for his brother-in-law with a gun that very day.\n\nThis was strange.\n\nAfter a person dies,\n\ncan new injuries appear on their body? And even old injuries could be fabricated?\n\nZhou Ze had heard that some antiques could be artificially aged, that physical objects could be given a patina, that paintings and calligraphy could be made to look old. But injuries on a dead body, could those be faked too?\n\n\"So, this is why I feel there's something wrong with this case!\" Zhang Yanfeng took a deep breath, then exhaled heavily. \"It's also why I believe what my brother-in-law said, that he didn't abuse my sister and the two kids.\"\n\n\"But what you're saying can't be used as evidence,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nZhang Yanfeng nodded. \"Yes, what I said can't be used as evidence. And the forensic examiner's report confirmed it, saying the two children had endured at least two years of abuse and torture.\"\n\nZhou Ze stood up and looked around.\n\n\"In that case, things are getting a little bizarre.\"\n\n\"I've been investigating this case for a long time but haven't found any leads. It wasn't until I met you that I felt, if you're willing to help me, you could definitely help me find a breakthrough.\n\nThat iron chain tortured me for twenty years, and you were the one who solved it.\"\n\n\"Don't rush to flatter me. You're trying to say that there are inhuman factors at play behind this case, aren't you?\"\n\n*Thump thump thump! Thump thump thump!*\n\nAt that moment, a banging sound suddenly came from upstairs.\n\nZhou Ze and Zhang Yanfeng exchanged a look and immediately rushed up the stairs.\n\n\"That's the bedroom, my sister's bedroom.\"\n\nThe sound was coming from that direction.\n\nZhang Yanfeng directly slammed the door open.\n\nBut inside the bedroom, there was nothing.\n\nHowever, even Zhou Ze was certain that the sound had just come from here.\n\n*Thump thump thump... Thump thump thump...*\n\nThe sound came again!\n\n\"It's under the bed!\"\n\nZhang Yanfeng immediately pulled out his gun and kicked the bed, shifting its position.\n\nUnder the bed,\n\nthere was actually a Teddy poodle, drenched in blood from head to toe.\n\nIt was lying on its side, its paws flailing nonstop.\n\nIt didn't even seem to notice that people had arrived, continuing to writhe.\n\nZhou Ze squatted down and reached out, pressing down on the poodle. The poodle was still struggling painfully, as if it were enduring some kind of torture.\n\nBut soon,\n\nit stopped moving.\n\nIt lay prostrate on the ground, on the verge of death, with little light left in its eyes.\n\n\"Someone else's pet ran in?\" Zhang Yanfeng pointed at the dog tag on the poodle's collar.\n\nThis was clearly someone's pet, definitely not a stray.\n\n\"Hold on, look here.\"\n\nZhou Ze pointed to the wounds on the poodle.\n\n\"These wounds have already healed. They're old injuries.\n\nThese are wounds that just split open. They haven't scabbed over yet.\"\n\nWith that,\n\nZhou Ze turned his head to look at Zhang Yanfeng and asked:\n\n\"Remind you of your sister?\"",

    "content": "\"Found the dog's owner?\"\n\nZhou Ze asked Zhang Yanfeng, who had just returned, as he leaned against the balcony railing.\n\nThe dog had a tag with the owner's contact information on it.\n\nZhang Yanfeng walked into the villa, went up to the second floor, and joined Zhou Ze, leaning against the railing beside him.\n\n\"The owner said the dog had been missing for less than a day. She was about to put up lost dog posters but hadn't gotten around to it yet.\"\n\n\"Only missing for a day?\"\n\n\"That's right. When she saw the dog's condition, if I hadn't shown her my police badge, she probably would have thought I was the one who abused it. She just held the dog and started crying right there.\"\n\n\"So she wasn't the one who abused the dog either?\"\n\n\"But the dog definitely has a lot of old injuries.\"\n\nZhou Ze turned his head, looked back into the house, and shook his head helplessly.\n\n\"This house... it's got big problems. If I'd known, I wouldn't have been in such a rush to pay for it.\"\n\n\"Have you got any leads?\"\n\n\"Nope.\"\n\n\"Boss! This humble Taoist has arrived!\"\n\nLao Dao stood downstairs, waving his hand.\n\nZhou Ze jutted his chin towards the man below. \"The lead has arrived.\"\n\nLao Dao had received a text from Zhou Ze telling him to come to this location to help Yingying check out the house, adding that there would be a room for him here in the future.\n\nLao Dao was ecstatic about this. Although he could earn money, he could also spend it. Not only did he have no children, but he hadn't even managed to save up for a single property.\n\nBut after Lao Dao arrived, he realized something was wrong.\n\nThat old detective was actually here too.\n\nLao Dao, who had just stepped into the foyer, slapped his own forehead.\n\n\"Oh dear, there are still ribs stewing back at the shop! This humble Taoist almost forgot. I have to go back and take care of them now.\"\n\n\"Get back here,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nLao Dao reluctantly stopped in his tracks, turned, and looked at Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Boss...\"\n\n\"Do me a favor.\"\n\n\"Name it.\"\n\n\"Go gather some things—if you don't have them, buy them—and perform a ritual for me here.\"\n\n\"Perform a ritual?\"\n\nLao Dao's eyes went wide.\n\n*Others might not know, but Boss, surely you know my skill level? My rituals can't even fool ghosts; they're purely for fooling people.*\n\n\"Officer Zhang had relatives who passed away here. Help him out and perform a ritual. I'll be watching from the side.\"\n\nLao Dao was ten thousand percent against it, but since Zhou Ze said he would be watching, he could only nod and agree.\n\nAbout an hour later, as the sky began to darken, Lao Dao had finally finished his preparations.\n\nA square table,\n\ntwo long white candles,\n\nan incense burner with ash, bronze coins, and paper talismans.\n\nDressed in a Taoist robe, Lao Dao held a peach wood sword,\n\nwaving and chanting nonstop.\n\nHis voice was at times high-pitched, at times deep,\n\nat times melodious, at times resonant.\n\nPutting aside the actual effectiveness, the whole getup and performance alone was enough to make him seem impressive, even if one didn't know what was going on.\n\nMany things in this world,\n\nare done for the heavens to see,\n\nand many are done for the underworld to see,\n\nbut in reality, most are done for the living to see.\n\nZhang Yanfeng stood to the side, smoking. Meanwhile, Zhou Ze took the opportunity during Lao Dao's ritual to search the villa from top to bottom. To be honest, for a neat freak like Boss Zhou to be rummaging around in this filthy villa was really asking a lot of him.\n\nBut driven by the thought that this house was now his, Zhou Ze endured it!\n\nIn two lifetimes, Boss Zhou had never actually lived in a villa!\n\nZhang Yanfeng found Zhou Ze and pointed to Lao Dao, who was still \"freestyling\" in the living room. \"Is this useful?\" he asked.\n\n\"What do you think?\"\n\n\"I'm a Party member. I don't believe in ghosts and gods.\"\n\nZhou Ze rolled his eyes at him. *If you don't believe in ghosts and gods, what did you come to me for?*\n\n\"This subordinate of mine... don't be fooled by his age. He's actually pretty useless.\"\n\n\"...\" Zhang Yanfeng.\n\n\"But he has good luck—or maybe bad luck. He always manages to stir something up. This house definitely has a problem; what happened to your sister and that poodle both prove it.\n\nBut I'm sorry, I can't find it. That's why I had to call my subordinate over to try his luck.\"\n\nThe two of them then stood at the top of the stairs, smoking and watching Lao Dao's \"spirit dance.\"\n\nThe performance ended—\n\noh, no,\n\nthe ritual ended.\n\nLao Dao was drenched in sweat from the exertion. He looked at Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze nodded, signaling that he could take a break.\n\nOnly then did Lao Dao run to the bathroom to wash his face and change his clothes.\n\n\"Still useless,\" Zhang Yanfeng said.\n\n\"Or maybe our approach is wrong. Your brother-in-law is still locked up in prison, right? Arrange for me to see him tomorrow.\"\n\n\"See him for what?\"\n\n\"We all went through the same nine-year compulsory education, so how did he turn out so special? You all lived in this villa, so why did your sister and two nephews run into problems while he seems perfectly fine?\"\n\n\"Also, was this house bought new?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"No, it was secondhand. The original owner was a house-flipper from Wenzhou. He bought it, never renovated or lived in it, and later sold it to us.\n\nMy dad was also an old cop when he was alive, and my mom specifically had him take the time to investigate the house back then. There were no problems.\n\nAfter all, my mom basically supported our family's business by herself. My dad and I didn't know how to do anything but be cops and solve cases. A villa was part of my sister's dowry and also a way to save face for bringing in a husband to live with us.¹ For our family at the time, it was a huge expense.\n\nThe reason my mom wanted to bring in a husband who would marry into the family was because she knew the two of us men couldn't keep the business afloat. She wasn't about to let the mooncake workshop she'd worked hard on for half her life just close down.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded. \"So you're saying the house should be clean?\"\n\n\"CRACK!\"\n\nThe sound of shattering glass came from the bathroom!\n\nZhou Ze's eyes instantly lit up.\n\nHe remembered Lao Dao had gone into that bathroom and hadn't come out yet.\n\nDamn it,\n\nthis old Taoist really is a human radar, a walking omen!\n\nZhou Ze immediately rushed over, but the bathroom door was locked tight from the inside.\n\nThere was no way to know if it had suddenly malfunctioned or if Lao Dao had deliberately locked it before using the toilet!\n\n\"BANG!\"\n\nZhou Ze slammed into it, but the door didn't budge. The quality was too damn good!\n\n\"Move, let me!\"\n\nZhang Yanfeng motioned for Zhou Ze to get out of the way,\n\nthen kicked the door!\n\n\"CRACK!\"\n\nThe door splintered open.\n\nBut when they went inside,\n\nthe toilet was empty.\n\nWhere was Lao Dao?\n\n\"Ugh... ugh...\"\n\nThe sound came from above!\n\nZhou Ze immediately looked up,\n\nand saw Lao Dao stuck to the ceiling like a gecko.\n\nNo,\n\nto be precise, it wasn't that Lao Dao was stuck there himself,\n\nbut that something was pulling him up.\n\n\"Boss... save...\"\n\nZhang Yanfeng immediately raised his gun.\n\nLao Dao, who had just been begging his boss for help, saw the gun pointed at him\n\nand nearly wet himself in fear.\n\nHoly crap!\n\nZhou Ze reached out and pushed the gun down. The nails on his right hand instantly grew long, and he swiped them upwards!\n\n\"RRRIP...\"\n\nIt sounded like tearing cloth.\n\nLao Dao fell from the ceiling.\n\nLuckily, Zhang Yanfeng caught him.\n\nOtherwise, given the hardness of the tiled floor, the recently recovered Lao Dao would probably have ended up back in bed again.\n\nBut it wasn't over.\n\nBefore Zhou Ze could get a good look at what was up there,\n\nthe toilet below suddenly began to flush crazily. A disgusting mixture of feces and urine, even used sanitary pads, came gushing out with a \"gurgle gurgle,\" the speed of which was astounding.\n\nIf blood had come out, Boss Zhou might have thought nothing of it—that was normal, he could handle it. But with this stuff bubbling up, Boss Zhou chose to make a tactical retreat.\n\nHe really didn't want to get covered in filth and have Bai Yingying give him a bath when he got back.\n\n\"Let's go!\"\n\nZhou Ze shouted.\n\nZhang Yanfeng dragged Lao Dao out of the bathroom, and Zhou Ze followed right behind.\n\nBut when Zhou Ze stepped out,\n\nhe found he was in the wrong place. Zhang Yanfeng and Lao Dao were gone. He should have been in the first-floor bathroom, but he had emerged into the bathroom of Zhang Yanfeng's sister's master bedroom.\n\n\"Haha... haha... Brother... wait for me... wait for me...\"\n\nThe voices of children came from outside.\n\n\"Sister... come on... come and chase me... If you catch me, I'll let you play with it...\"\n\nThe voices of a boy and a girl.\n\n\"Mmm...\" A woman's soft sigh came from behind Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze turned around and looked towards the vanity table behind him. A young woman was sitting there. She had shoulder-length hair and a curvaceous figure, and she was leaning against the vanity, staring at a computer with a Word document open on the screen.\n\n\"Xiao Hua, Xiao Xin, can you two be a little quieter? Mommy's working.\"\n\nThe woman said impatiently.\n\n\"Okay, Mommy.\"\n\n\"Got it, Mommy.\"\n\nThe two children obediently answered and ran off to play somewhere else.\n\nZhou Ze licked his lips, his gaze sweeping around the room before finally settling back on the young woman.\n\nThe woman slammed a key on the keyboard, likely suffering from writer's block. She stood up from the vanity, picked up her phone, and lay down on the bed.\n\n\"Honey, when are you coming home?\"\n\nShe seemed to be sending a voice message to her husband.\n\n\"In a bit, honey. The mooncake factory just got an order, and we're busy shipping it out.\"\n\n\"Mmm... finish up quickly and come home to keep me company. I miss you.\"\n\n\"Be good. I'll be back as soon as I'm done.\"\n\nPutting down her phone,\n\nthe young woman pouted,\n\nsitting up against the headboard.\n\nOne could see that the couple was still very much in love.\n\n\"Oh, honey, you're back!\"\n\nThe young woman suddenly turned her head and looked in Zhou Ze's direction.\n\nZhou Ze was certain,\n\nshe was looking at him!\n\n\"BZZZ!\"\n\nA vibrating sound came from behind Zhou Ze.\n\nNo,\n\nthat wasn't right.\n\nShe wasn't looking at him—\n\nshe was looking behind him!\n\n\"Hiss...\"\n\nSuddenly,\n\nZhou Ze felt something grab his neck,\n\nand begin to pull with all its might.\n\nThe nails on both of Zhou Ze's hands grew out instantly, and he whipped around, clawing at whatever was behind him.\n\n\"AHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!\"\n\n\"AHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!\"\n\n\"Waaahhhh!!!\"\n\n\"Waaahhhh!!!\"\n\nAt first, it was the screams of an adult,\n\nbut then it strangely changed to the sound of children crying.\n\nWhen Zhou Ze turned back around,\n\nhe saw two children standing behind him.\n\nA clear, bloody gash, left by his claws, was etched across their faces.\n\n\"Honey, the whole family missed you so much.\"\n\nAt some point,\n\nthe young woman had appeared behind him,\n\ncoiling around him like a water snake.\n\n\"Come on, Daddy's home. He brought you snacks,\" the woman said to the two still-crying children.\n\nThe children immediately stopped crying.\n\nWith blood-streaked faces, they smiled gleefully and threw themselves at Zhou Ze.\n\nThe boy began to dig into Zhou Ze's stomach.\n\n\"Sister, quick, look and see what snacks Daddy brought us.\"\n\nThe girl started pulling out Zhou Ze's intestines.\n\n\"Brother, Daddy is so stingy. It's all stuff we're tired of eating.\"\n\n***\n\n¹A man who marries into his wife's family and lives with them, often taking on her family name or helping with the family business.

    "content": "The old Taoist was carried out of sanitation by Zhang Yanfeng. For an old detective, a 70-year-old man was basically not worth much, and he was very relaxed when he picked him up.\n\n\n\n  Wipped the sweat beads on the head, and the old Taoist sighed, secretly admiring his cleverness.\n\n\n\nThe boss asked himself to do rituals. There must be a problem here. As for what the problem is, the old man is not clear about it.\n\n\n\nSo, when doing things, don’t look at the old Taoist who is devoted to it. In fact, he always has a mind in his heart and is on guard against it.\n\n\n\nAfraid of suddenly a ghost or a corpse coming out of a position. Although there is a boss pressing his body next to him, his life is always his own.\n\n\n\nHowever, the wind was calm until the ritual was completed. The old Taoist still felt a little strange. The imagined thunder and earth fire did not appear.\n\n\n\nHowever, when I entered the sanitation room to wash my face and change my clothes, the old Taoist, who had many experiences, did not busy using the toilet, but took out the talisman paper from his pants and posted it on the bucket.\n\n\n\nHealth is the place where ghosts appear the most, and it is also the place where things are most likely to cause trouble. The old Taoist also has to be careful\n\n\n\nThis time I really have good luck.\n\n\n\nI just pasted the talisman paper and didn't have time to sit on it. The horse bucket began to shake, and then, streams of black smoke appeared from the head.\n\n\n\nThe old Taoist only thought there was something grabbing and tearing him. He kept resisting, but the thing seemed to be on the top, lifting himself up and sticking it on the ceiling.\n\n\n\n  When things are overwhelming, they always want to rub each other, hoping to rub the other into their own body\n\n\n\nThe old man felt this way at this time, but the other party was thinking about rubbing himself into the ceiling. If the other party succeeded, it would be estimated that he would have been waiting for more than ten years. When he came to decorate this villa, he could see himself who had become dried into flesh.\n\n\n\n\"Huh…………”\n\n\n\nThe old Taoist sipped his breath\n\n\n\n\"Hey, sir, you can put your underworld down now.\"\n\n\n\nIf you are always hugged like this, people will have red faces\n\n\n\nHowever, Officer Zhang did not let himself go, but instead drank something hot and began to lick his face crazy\n\n\n\nThe old Taoist was so surprised that he directly hit a thriller and turned his head to look at it.\n\n\n\nWhat kind of police officer Zhang is here? It is clearly a huge Alaska. At this time, he was actually in Alaski's head, and his tongue kept licking him.\n\n\n\n\"Floor\"\n\n\n\nThe old Taoist immediately kicked this Alaska with two feet and began to retreat desperately\n\n\n\nAlaska was not angry at this moment, just sat there in a daze, looking at the old Taoist, and spitting out his long tongue from time to time\n\n\n\n\"Where is this fucking thing?\"\n\n\n\nThe old man realized that not only was there a problem with the sudden appearance of Greater Alaska, but the place he is now is not right.On the left is a pool full of balls, with colorful round balls inside, and on the right is a place where a group of rag dolls are piled up.\n\n\n\nIt's really... \"The zombie is like a mountain\"\n\n\n\nAnd behind me was a small rotating horse with a light on it and a baby's poem was placed\n\n\n\n\"Fuck\"\n\n\n\nThe old Taoist slapped himself, but it didn't work. Everything in front of him was still the same as before.\n\n\n\n\"Hehe...haha...hehe...hehe...brother...brother...brother...brother...brother...brother...brother...brother...brother...brother...brother...brother...brother...brother...brother...brother...brother...brother...brother...brother...brother...brother...brother...brother...brother...brother's...brother's...brother's...brother's...brother's...brother's...brother's...brother's...brother's...brother's...brother's...brother's...brother's...brother's...brother's...brother's...brother's...brother's...brother's...brother's...brother's...brother's...brother's...brother'\n\n\n\nThe little girl's voice came, bringing a crisp texture like a copper pine\n\n\n\nThe old man rubbed his eyes. I don’t know when, on a whirl of a twirl, a little girl in a princess dress appeared.\n\n\n\nThe girl held the wooden horse in one hand and danced with the other hand, having fun\n\n\n\n\"Sister... I'll come... I'll come\"\n\n\n\nOn the back of the rotating wood, there was a little boy sitting, wearing a small suit, looking particularly fashionable.\n\n\n\n\"Ah Takaha Buddha, the Unrestrained Heavenly Venerable, the Bodhisattva of the Yin, the Grand Lord……………”\n\n\n\nThe old Taoist closed his eyes and kept reciting articles that he didn't know what it was.\n\n\n\n\"Boss, boss, save me, save me.\"\n\n\n\nIn the end, the old Taoist also understood that there was no empty space in the sky, and the immortals had no time to save themselves. The only one who could save themselves was the boss.\n\n\n\nHowever, after shouting for a long time, the boss did not show up with the colorful clouds.\n\n\n\nBut the rotary horse began to grow bigger and bigger. The little girl and the little boy were sitting at this time, dancing on their heads, dancing in circles.\n\n\n\nThe old Taoist was really worried that the thing suddenly fell down and smashed himself to death, so he began to escape instinctively, without walls or boundaries in this place;\n\n\n\n  However,\n\n\n\nWithout a wall is the biggest wall.\n\n\n\nNo boundary is the most terrifying boundary.\n\n\n\nThe old Taoist ran away for a long time until he had to stop and gasp, but he found that he was still surrounding the game venue and was turning around.\n\n\n\nHe ran very far away.\n\n\n\nBut as he kept running away, the game park facilities behind him were also growing\n\n\n\nThe shadows in the sky are like shadows. The shadows projected by the rotating horses that the child sits on almost cover everything and bring a terrifying hope.\n\n\n\n\"Hehe...haha......\"\n\n\n\nThe children's laughter kept coming from above, and they had fun and forgot about it.\n\n\n\nIf you see this lovely child in normal times, the old Taoist said you should not go up and make some food for them. The old Taoist is also a person who likes children.\n\n\n\nBut at this time, the sounds of these two children are like death-hunting sounds, constantly entering and exiting your ears, even if you cover them with your hands, it is useless.The old Taoist sat on the ground, raised his head and looked at it, feeling helpless and desperate.\n\n\n\nWhat kind of ghost place is this?\n\n\n\n\"Gumbling......gumbling......gumbling......gumbling......gumbling......\"\n\n\n\nThe ground under me was like boiled curry at this time, and it began to become thicker, and the old Taoist body began to slowly fall into it.\n\n\n\n  \"I…………\"\n\n\n\nThe fall was too fast. When the old man reacted, he was completely out of the way, and even had no reaction.\n\n\n\nThere was no suffocation as I imagined, and I could even smell a fragrant and sweet smell at the tip of my nose. The taste of curry was very heavy at first, but it was slowly replaced by the fragrance of candy.\n\n\n\nThis is a smell and atmosphere that both young and old will fall into the intoxication. In this smell, the old Taoist seemed to have regained his youth, his sunny day, and his feeling of running under the sunny day that year.\n\n\n\nFree,\n\n\n\n  Highly,\n\n\n\n  easy,\n\n\n\nVitality,\n\n\n\n  Life,\n\n\n\n  good;\n\n\n\nThe original nightmare dream turned into a beautiful dream. The old man dreamed that he was flying and soared in the clouds made of marshmallows.\n\n\n\n\"Hehe...haha...brother...brother...brother...brother...brother...b.\"\n\n\n\n\"Hehe...hehe... sister......\"\n\n\n\nThe child's voice is coming again,\n\n\n\nAt this time, their voices were like naughty children in the high-speed rail without their mothers disciplined, and they were in trouble everywhere.\n\n\n\nThe old man smashed his mouth and opened his eyes a little displeasedly. The dream was awakened. Who can't get up a little bit?\n\n\n\nBut the moment I opened my eyes, the old Taoist was stunned\n\n\n\nHe saw himself flying in the air, he was really flying, and beside him, there were wooden horses, the sound of a child, coming from him\n\n\n\n  Exercise and turn the head,\n\n\n\n\"Driving\"\n\n\n\nThe little boy shouted,\n\n\n\nSitting on the old Taoist body,\n\n\n\nUrge the old Taoist to move forward quickly\n\n\n\nWhat's going on\n\n\n\nThe old Taoist wailed in his heart. He was almost about to collapse. He had also entered a place similar to Sanxiang Village before. It was not a newcomer, but it was really the first time he had encountered such a strange place and scene.\n\n\n\n\"Uncle, come, come, play together, ride horses together\"\n\n\n\n\"Come on, uncle, uncle on...\"\n\n\n\nThe two children shouted to the distance\n\n\n\n Far from afar,\n\n\n\nZhang Yanfeng appeared, and he stood there in a little bit, as if thinking, or conspiring.\n\n\n\nBut the more he thought, the less he couldn't figure out what he was thinking.\n\n\n\nTurning over,\n\n\n\nThat feeling of sincerity is getting strongerThe old Taoist saw a woman standing beside him, a mother standing beside him, watching her child playing\n\n\n\nThis woman was wearing a red dress with a long shawl and a beautiful figure\n\n\n\n\"Brother, come here... come and have fun...\"\n\n\n\nThe woman, like her two children, shouted to Zhang Yanfeng from afar\n\n\n\n\"Don't... Officer Zhang... wake up... wake up.\"\n\n\n\nThe old Taoist shouted,\n\n\n\nBut his voice was integrated into the roving horse's ecstasy and could not be conveyed at all. He is just a wooden horse now, one of the many wooden horses.\n\n\n\nZhang Yanfeng slowly walked and walked over here. He staggered, his expression on his face was a little tangled and nervous.\n\n\n\nBut as his sister and his nephew and nieces shouted over and over again,\n\n\n\nHe also showed a kind smile on his face\n\n\n\nWhy did that case last so long?\n\n\n\nIt is because he can't let go of his sister and his two nephews.\n\n\n\nHe wants to find their true cause of death and want to avenge them. He loves them and cannot let them go.\n\n\n\nAt this moment\n\n\n\nHe is moving faster and faster.\n\n\n\n  No,\n\n\n\nThe faster you run\n\n\n\nIf this is a dream,\n\n\n\nThen let me immerse myself in and never wake up\n\n\n\n\"I'm on your lungs.\"\n\n\n\nThe old Taoist couldn't help but start to break into a big fuss\n\n\n\n\"Uncle, ride the horse together\"\n\n\n\nThe boy jumped onto another wooden horse and waved to Zhang Yanfeng\n\n\n\n\"Good Xiaohua, my uncle is here.\"\n\n\n\nAn indescribable premonition emerged from the old Taoist heart.\n\n\n\nOnly see Officer Zhang suddenly jumped up.\n\n\n\n The skills are as strong as those of young people.\n\n\n\nThen he sat directly on himself\n\n\n\n\"Click...\"\n\n\n\n  waist,\n\n\n\nTwisted...\n\n\n\nThe old Taoist's eyes were leaking out of pain\n\n\n\n\"Uncle, uncle...\"\n\n\n\n  \"elder brother……\"\n\n\n\n\"Hey, hey...\"\n\n\n\n  Rotation horse,\n\n\n\nContinue to rotate,\n\n\n\nIt seems like I never have the end.\n\n\n\nI won't see its end either\n\n\n\n————————\n\n\n\nPS:\n\n\n\nChen Ji Tang Hongdou's \"Nine-level Divine Character\" has been restored and updated.

    "content": "Zhou Ze's body slowly went from tense to relaxed, and beads of sweat dripped incessantly from his forehead.\n\nAnyone who has had a regional anesthetic should have a similar feeling: the part of your body being operated on has lost all sensation, you can't perceive any pain, but when the doctor uses the scalpel on you, you can still have a vague perception. It’s not pain, but the feeling is very strange and uncomfortable.\n\nZhou Ze slowly calmed down.\n\nEven though that woman was still wrapped around him, calling him \"husband.\"\n\nEven though the two children were still cutting open his chest and gutting him—and not only that, they were even being picky about it.\n\nZhou Ze had specifically discussed illusion-like situations with the little loli, and she had told him that illusions were a very low-level existence; a higher form was called a barrier. When encountering an illusion, one's own composure was often the most important thing.\n\nOnly when a person is calm can their eyes truly see things clearly. In an illusion, it will design all sorts of scenes to stimulate you into producing other emotions.\n\nThe most common examples were making your recently deceased wife or parents appear and call out to you, or making you relive a recent setback.\n\nThe little loli had also said that in Hell, there was a specific level where the punishment was to make sinners endlessly relive the most painful and unwillingly remembered day of their lives, with no end and no conclusion.\n\nFrom deep breathing to slowing his respiratory rhythm.\n\nZhou Ze forgot about the woman behind him, and he forgot about the two children in front of him.\n\nGradually, he began to transcend the situation.\n\nBoss Zhou had experienced many illusions already, and he himself possessed a Yin-Yang Tome, which was the pinnacle of illusionary arts.\n\nWhen you encounter something enough times, you become numb to it, indifferent to it.\n\nZhou Ze slowly got up and slowly walked out.\n\nHe saw a man being held by a woman, while two children tore at the things inside his stomach.\n\nThe man was a stranger; Zhou Ze had never seen him before, nor did he have his face.\n\nThe surrounding scenery had a crude, artificial feel to it, a bit like a \"forest\" in a stage play, cobbled together with painted boards, where the audience had to fill in most of the details with their own imagination.\n\nZhou Ze stood where he was and watched seriously for a while.\n\nHe watched their movements, their expressions, their postures, their actions.\n\nAnd you know what?\n\nIt was actually kind of interesting.\n\nBut this illusion was a bit special, to actually allow for a \"third-person\" perspective.\n\nAfter watching for a while, he felt it was getting boring.\n\nZhou Ze took a step back,\n\nyawned,\n\nand lightly scraped his fingernails against the adjacent door panel, producing a low sound.\n\nSlowly,\n\nthe sound began to grow more intense,\n\nmore piercing.\n\nThis sound was like a volley of sharp knives, beginning to pierce through everything around him. In the end, the scene and background before his eyes began to distort and dissipate.\n\nIn the air,\n\nthe smell of incense ash lingered.\n\nStretching lazily, Zhou Ze looked down at his own stomach. It was, of course, perfectly intact.\n\nHe looked over to the other side. On the floor, Zhang Yanfeng was sitting on top of the old Daoist, as if he were riding a horse.\n\nThe old Daoist was pinned underneath, white foam already starting to form at the corners of his mouth.\n\nZhou Ze walked over and gently poked Zhang Yanfeng with a fingernail. Zhang Yanfeng shuddered, the look of fatherly love on his face gradually fading. He shook his head, and upon seeing the person beneath him, he immediately stood up.\n\nFollowing suit, Zhou Ze poked the old Daoist. The old Daoist opened his eyes wearily. When he saw Zhang Yanfeng, he trembled. When he saw Zhou Ze, he was so moved he nearly burst into tears.\n\n\"Boss...\"\n\n*I got ridden like a pony, I feel so wronged.*\n\n\"My apologies, old brother.\"\n\nZhang Yanfeng was also very embarrassed as he helped the old Daoist up.\n\nFortunately, Zhang Yanfeng had been riding a carousel, not truly galloping across the plains. If it had been the latter, it would be hard to say if the old Daoist would have survived.\n\nThe three of them sat down on the sofa in the first-floor living room.\n\nThe old Daoist had suffered a great deal of physical torment, but his mental state was actually fine; it wasn't a big problem. Having served under two ghost bosses, he'd seen his share of storms.\n\nIt was Zhang Yanfeng who still looked somewhat dazed. Indeed, for him, what he had experienced today was yet another demolition of his entire worldview, building on top of the previous incident with the chains.\n\nZhou Ze looked at his right hand.\n\nHands,\n\nthey were the silhouette of his art.\n\nEspecially those five fingernails; even the most skilled manicurist couldn't replicate their aesthetic.\n\nAt his fingertips, a ball of black mist was swirling. Palm facing down, Zhou Ze plunged his fingernails into the floor.\n\nThe black mist began to disperse in all directions. This was Zhou Ze's method for finding ghosts.\n\nSome ghosts were skilled at hiding; even an Emissary of Hell would have a hard time finding them. This method was extremely effective against ghosts, and even against demonic creatures.\n\nHowever,\n\nthis time,\n\nit didn't seem to be working.\n\nThe black mist swirled and hovered. Even after spreading out, it would soon spiral back again.\n\nAs soon as Zhou Ze began using his fingernails to search for the ghost, the old Daoist had adopted a battle-ready stance. This time, he swore that if something happened, he would definitely jump straight onto his boss.\n\nHe'd rather die than let that policeman hold him again.\n\nCatching criminals was his specialty, but when it came to catching ghosts, the boss was more reliable.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head, retracting his fingernails with some confusion. He gently rubbed the palm of his right hand with his left and said,\n\n\"There's nothing wrong with this house.\"\n\nThat's right.\n\nIf there was something here, it would be impossible not to sense it at all.\n\n\"What? Boss, are you running a fever?\n\nNothing wrong?\n\nIf there's nothing wrong, then what just happened to us?\"\n\nZhou Ze lit a cigarette and blew out a smoke ring. \"I experienced that scene too. It was a bit terrifying.\"\n\n\"It was more than a bit.\"\n\nAs the old Daoist spoke, he shot an extremely resentful glance at Zhang Yanfeng.\n\nHis old bones were nearly crushed to death by him.\n\n\"Terrifying is terrifying, and eerie is eerie, but in truth, I didn't detect any ghost qi, nor any demonic qi.\"\n\n\"Then what was it?\"\n\n\"I don't know either.\" Zhou Ze shrugged. \"There are plenty of supernatural things in this world. Who knows, maybe this villa is causing this phenomenon for some other reason.\"\n\nZhang Yanfeng silently lowered his head and ran a hand through his hair.\n\n\"I saw a carousel. I saw my sister and her two children.\"\n\n\"I saw them too,\" the old Daoist chimed in. \"Oh, and a huge Alaskan Malamute!\"\n\n\"Mm, in fact, while I didn't see a carousel, I did see a woman with two kids, but I didn't see any dog.\"\n\n\"A dog?\"\n\nWhen the old Daoist first mentioned a dog, Zhang Yanfeng didn't react. When Zhou Ze mentioned it again, it finally clicked for Zhang Yanfeng. As if remembering something, he took out his phone, opened his photo album, and pointed to a picture, asking the old Daoist,\n\n\"Was it this dog?\"\n\nThe old Daoist leaned in for a look and shook his head. \"This is a small Alaskan Malamute. The one I saw was a giant.\"\n\n\"A giant?\" Zhang Yanfeng narrowed his eyes.\n\nZhou Ze also fell into thought. \"Meaning, the things that appeared in the two scenes we saw all exist in reality.\n\nThe dolls, the family must have had them before.\n\nThe dog was from his childhood, but it's still a dog, still an Alaskan.\n\nThe carousel—actually, did you notice when you came in? Over by the flowerbed at the entrance, there's a small carousel. It's one you have to push, a little toy for kids to sit on and play with. You can't compare it to the ones at amusement parks, but it does exist.\n\nEverything that appeared in the scenes actually originates from real life.\"\n\n\"Boss, what have you figured out? Just say it.\"\n\n\"The problem is, I still haven't figured anything out.\"\n\nZhou Ze flicked his cigarette ash, saying with some helplessness,\n\n\"This is so troublesome. I feel like going back and convincing Yingying to just sell this house. It's too much trouble to live in.\"\n\n\"Is this a dream?\" Zhang Yanfeng suddenly said. \"Because dreams are projections of reality.\"\n\n\"A dream?\" Zhou Ze smiled. \"It's not a dream.\"\n\nA low-level illusion couldn't possibly make him fall asleep. Unless Bai Yingying was by his side, he, Boss Zhou, could pop sleeping pills like crazy and still not be able to sleep. And if he couldn't sleep, there was no question of dreaming.\n\n\"Not a dream, but still a projection of reality. What else could it be?\"\n\nZhang Yanfeng continued to mutter to himself.\n\n\"I'm telling you, old brother, every field has its own experts. You should stay out of this. This business is getting more and more dangerous. You shouldn't come here alone anymore either. Anyway, this house has been sold to my boss, right?\"\n\nThe old Daoist's words were well-intentioned.\n\nEven though Zhang Yanfeng had nearly crushed him to death, the old Daoist recognized that he was a good cop. As an ordinary citizen, everyone still cherished a good cop.\n\nJust then, Zhou Ze's phone rang. It was actually Bai Yingying.\n\n\"Hello.\"\n\n\"*Sob, sob, sob*...\n\nBoss, where are you?\"\n\n\"Helping the police with a case.\"\n\n\"Oh, Boss is working so hard.\"\n\n\"What's up?\"\n\n\"Well, today when I was organizing my property deeds... oh, no, when I was cleaning the house, I found that case file you told me to hide so you wouldn't see it.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Zhou Ze acknowledged. \"What about it?\"\n\nZhou Ze had assumed Bai Yingying was going to say that the villa she just bought was the scene of the murder in the file.\n\nBut Zhou Ze was mistaken.\n\nBai Yingying had no concept of this. She had bought too many houses; she only remembered the number. If she didn't check the property deeds, she had no idea where her houses were.\n\n\"Boss, I recognize the deceased in this case file.\"\n\n\"You recognize her?\"\n\nZhou Ze frowned.\n\n\"Yeah, I see her every day when I'm cleaning the bookstore!\"\n\n*She's in the bookstore?*\n\n\"What exactly do you mean?\"\n\nIf the woman's spirit was in the bookstore, was he, Zhou Ze, blind? How could he possibly not have seen her?\n\n\"She really is in the bookstore. Every day when I clean the shelves, there's a row just for horror and suspense novels, and I've seen her name there.\n\nHer name is Zhang Tianquan. Her pen name is even funnier, it's Shen Gui Er Sao.¹\n\nBoss, every time I clean that bookshelf and see this book, my stomach hurts from laughing.\"\n\n\"Shen Gui Er Sao is your sister's—\" Zhou Ze looked at Zhang Yanfeng. \"No, it's Zhang Tianquan, that's...\"\n\n\"That's my sister's name.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded and asked, \"Yingying, what's the title of her book?\"\n\nZhang Yanfeng had mentioned earlier that his sister stayed at home to raise her kids and write novels, but Zhou Ze never expected she had actually been published.\n\n\"The title?\n\nIt's called,\n\n*I Love My Family*.\n\nBut the title is printed in blood-red font.\"\n\n---\n¹ `深閨二嫂` (shēnguī èrsǎo): Literally \"Deep Boudoir's Second Sister-in-Law,\" an intentionally awkward and slightly cringey name.",

    "content": "\"Bring her books. I'll send you an address.\"\n\n\"Yes, Boss.\"\n\nAfter hanging up and sending the address to Yingying, Zhou Ze yawned and said to the old Daoist and Zhang Yanfeng, \"You two can go back now.\"\n\n\"Go back?\" Zhang Yanfeng was baffled. \"Something like this happened today, and you're telling me to go back?\"\n\n\"That's right, Boss. This humble Daoist can't leave. If I go, who will protect you?\"\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze.\n\n*If you hadn't been bored out of your skull in the bathroom today and stuck a talisman on the toilet lid, none of this would have happened.*\n\n*Officer Zhang has come here to investigate or reminisce countless times over the years, and nothing ever happened.*\n\nOf course, Zhou Ze couldn't say this out loud. His whole reason for bringing the old Daoist here was with the hope that he might be able to rub something together and spark a flame.\n\nThe old Daoist had perfectly completed his mission. Although it resulted in the bathroom toilet being splattered with a gruesome mess of shit and piss, the objective had been achieved.\n\n\"You two go back first. Having you here is a distraction. I'll take another look tonight.\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't plan on leaving tonight.\n\nA man of two lifetimes, this was his first time properly staying in his own villa.\n\nHe was actually a little excited.\n\n\"I can't leave. How can I leave without getting to the bottom of this?\" Zhang Yanfeng showed his stubborn side.\n\nThere was nothing to be done.\n\nThe deceased were his younger sister and his two nephews. Now, with Zhou Ze's arrival, there was a new turn of events. Of course he wasn't willing to leave now.\n\nTo put it bluntly, he would rather die than not find out the truth. As a veteran detective, he had that much grit.\n\n\"Your staying here will only interfere with my investigation. If you want me to find out the truth sooner, you have to listen to me.\n\nWe each have our own areas of expertise.\"\n\n\"But...\"\n\n\"No buts. Legally speaking, this place now belongs to my... my maid. If I don't consent to your presence here, you're trespassing. You're a police officer; you have to obey the law.\"\n\n\"Then be careful.\" Zhang Yanfeng stood up. He wasn't angry at Zhou Ze's insistent refusal; he was magnanimous enough to understand the situation. \"Thanks.\"\n\n\"Don't mention it. If you really want to thank me, figure out a way to get me a driver's license.\"\n\n\"That's against regulations.\"\n\n\"I'm not an ordinary person. I had a license in my past life.\"\n\n\"I'll see what I can do.\"\n\nZhang Yanfeng left.\n\nThe old Daoist quickly gathered his things, bowed and scraped before Zhou Ze for a moment, and followed him out the door.\n\nHe'd shown his loyalty.\n\nOnly an idiot would actually stay!\n\n*Don't be fooled by the boss's calm-and-collected appearance¹, but he's the Boss, a player with cheat codes. I'm just a regular player with only one life to live. Gotta cherish it.*\n\nWith both of them gone,\n\nZhou Ze lay on the sofa alone,\n\nhis eyes half-closed.\n\nSleep was impossible, so out of extreme boredom, Zhou Ze began to imagine scenes of the original family living here.\n\nFor instance, the family of four watching TV together in the living room, or the two kids playing with toys here, or the young wife cooking in the kitchen as her husband dragged his exhausted body home.\n\nAs he was lost in thought, the doorbell rang from the foyer.\n\nZhou Ze walked over, but before opening the door, he saw on the monitor that it wasn't Yingying standing outside, but a young woman in a floral dress.\n\nThe woman looked to be in her early twenties, with a neat ponytail, exuding a gentle, classic charm.\n\nZhou Ze opened the door.\n\nThe other person was startled to see him open it and asked in surprise, \"Sir, you are...?\"\n\n\"That's a question I should be asking you.\"\n\n\"Oh, I know. You must be her husband, right?\n\nShe told me she has a husband who loves her very much. She chose this villa for her husband's convenience.\n\nHer husband's family wasn't well-off when he was growing up, so he always wanted to live in a villa.\"\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze.\n\n*Did that Yingying creature really have to be so honest?*\n\n*And besides,*\n\n*since you fucking think I'm her husband,*\n\n*did you really need to be so honest about it?*\n\n\"Are you from the real estate agency?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Yes, I'm an agent. May I ask, where is your wife? Is she not here?\"\n\n\"She'll be here soon.\"\n\nHearing she was an agent, Zhou Ze couldn't be bothered with pleasantries. He walked straight back to the living room, flopped down on the sofa again in the \"Ge You slouch\"², and said:\n\n\"If you need something, come back tomorrow. It's not convenient today.\"\n\n\"Is that so?\"\n\nThe woman was taken aback for a moment, then said:\n\n\"But your wife asked me to come today. She said she was throwing a party here today and would be inviting some interesting people, and that I absolutely shouldn't miss it.\"\n\n\"A party?\"\n\nZhou Ze frowned.\n\nSomething wasn't right.\n\nHe felt he had misunderstood something.\n\nHe immediately asked:\n\n\"That lady, what's her surname?\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\nThe woman took a few steps back, frightened, and looked at Zhou Ze warily. \"Who on earth are you?\"\n\n\"I'm asking you for the lady's surname. Is it Bai or Zhang!\"\n\n\"Her surname is Zhang. Zhang Tianquan.\"\n\n\"She invited you?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"That's right.\"\n\n\"Miss, are you sure you weren't in a car accident five years ago, fell into a coma, and only just woke up yesterday to remember this appointment?\"\n\n\"Sir, that's just a tired old cliché from novels,\" the woman said scornfully.\n\n\"Oh, so you mean, she just made plans with you a few days ago?\"\n\n\"Yes, she just told me last night.\"\n\n\"Are you sure it was her?\"\n\n\"Of course it was her. She contacted me on WeChat. I've always been a fan of her books. In fact, she's the reason I started writing novels and became an author. She taught me a lot.\"\n\n\"Then did you know that five years ago, Zhang Tianquan died?\"\n\n\"What, dead?\"\n\nThe woman laughed.\n\n\"Sir, are we competing to see who has the better suspense plot?\"\n\n\"Fine, don't believe me.\"\n\nZhou Ze couldn't be bothered with this chuuni³ female author.\n\nHalf-convinced, the woman took out her phone and seemed to search for something. But since the case from five years ago was a suicide, there was little information about it online. After all, it wasn't some horrific familicide that would capture public attention.\n\nHowever, after a quick search, the woman found quite a few related posts on local Tongcheng message boards and forums. The posts were recent, and the topic was about a haunted house that had recently been bought.\n\nThe posts went on to describe what had happened in the haunted house, and some busybody had even managed to dig up the original news articles from back then, like finding a needle in a haystack, and posted them below.\n\nThe more the woman read, the more she felt something was wrong. When she looked up, she saw Zhou Ze still lying on the sofa, calmly smoking. She immediately took a book out of her shoulder bag and said:\n\n\"This joke isn't funny at all.\"\n\n\"Who's joking with you?\"\n\n\"This is impossible, impossible. I get it. Someone must be using her WeChat and QQ, pretending...\"\n\nThe woman muttered to herself, acting strangely.\n\n\"Hey,\" Zhou Ze called out to her.\n\nThe woman ignored him, continuing to mumble to herself, sometimes frowning, sometimes looking melancholic, sometimes brightening up, and even letting out a \"pfft\" of laughter now and then.\n\n\"There's nothing seriously wrong with you. You should go now. Forget her, block and delete her contact information. If she contacts you again, you can either call the police, or you can come find me at my bookstore. It's the one on South Avenue, easy to find.\"\n\nBecause Boss Zhou was the only one who ran a bookstore on South Avenue.\n\n\"Why are you being so nice to me?\" the woman asked, looking at Zhou Ze. \"Are you interested in me?\"\n\n\"Are you nuts?\"\n\n\"Yes, I am sick. I'm sick with lovesickness!\"\n\nAs she spoke, the woman suddenly started dancing. It was clear she had some dance training; she was actually quite graceful.\n\nBut what the hell was this! Running into my house out of nowhere to... have an awkward dance-off?\n\n\"Sorry, but please get the hell out!\"\n\nZhou Ze walked up to the woman, preparing to throw her out.\n\n\"No, I won't go! I'll never leave you, not even in death!\"\n\nWith a *rip*, the woman tore her floral dress, revealing a large patch of skin.\n\n\"Don't...\" Zhou Ze's patience was nearly gone. The nails pinned to his right hand began to slowly extend.\n\n*Knock her out, then call the old Daoist to come back and take this crazy bitch to the hospital.*\n\n\"Then kill me!\"\n\nThe woman suddenly threw her arms around Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Go on, kill me! Let me feel your blood, let you feel my tears, let you touch the warmth I have for you!\"\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze.\n\n*Damn it,*\n\n*lady,*\n\n*did you just escape from a mental asylum?*\n\nZhou Ze's fingers curved around without hesitation and stabbed directly at the woman's neck.\n\n\"*Hiss...*\"\n\nHowever,\n\nat that very moment,\n\nthe woman's arms clutching Zhou Ze suddenly tightened with immense force.\n\nCaught off guard, Boss Zhou felt as if his entire body was about to be snapped in two.\n\n\"Come, let's dance!\"\n\nThe woman held Zhou Ze, lifting his feet off the ground. Like a rag doll, he was forced to dance along with her.\n\nAt this point,\n\nif Zhou Ze still wasn't sure there was something wrong with her, he'd have been a fool all this time.\n\nImmediately,\n\nZhou Ze's nails plunged into the woman's neck without a second thought.\n\nHowever,\n\nas the nails went in, they made a *\"pfft pfft pfft\"* sound.\n\nWhen he pulled them out and looked, his nails were dripping with a white liquid, thick and disgusting.\n\nAnd so the woman, while oozing white liquid,\n\ncontinued to forcibly hold Boss Zhou and dance,\n\na dance,\n\nwith no accompaniment.\n\n..............\n\n\"Driver, can you please hurry up?\" Bai Yingying urged from the back of the taxi.\n\n\"Young lady, I'm already going as fast as I can. Can't be helped, there are a lot of traffic lights here, and our luck is bad. Nothing I can do about hitting every red light.\"\n\n\"Alright.\"\n\nBai Yingying was a little worried the Boss would get impatient waiting for her.\n\nEven after seeing the address,\n\nBai Yingying still hadn't realized it was the villa she had just bought a short while ago, nor did she know that it was actually her property.\n\nShe was just worried about what would happen if she couldn't deliver what the Boss wanted in time. What if he got angry?\n\nShe sighed,\n\nand looked at the books in her hand.\n\nThat author, Zhang Tianquan, didn't just have one book.\n\nBesides the horror version of *I Love My Family*,\n\nshe actually had several other books, and the stories in all of them were set in a villa. She seemed to have a special fondness for that particular setting.\n\nThe taxi screeched to a halt.\n\nThe books resting on Yingying's lap fell to the floor.\n\n\"Damn it, that son of a bitch⁴ in front suddenly slowed down. What's his problem!\" the driver cursed.\n\nYingying bent down to pick up the books. The last one she picked up was titled *Dance of the Corpse*.\n\nThe theme was bizarre.\n\nThe synopsis actually said that the White Bone Demon from *Journey to the West* wasn't killed by Sun Wukong, but was instead beaten into amnesia, and had dazedly survived into the modern era, becoming a hipster female author.\n\nEvery so often, she would go out and seduce a man to dance with her.\n\nAfter the dance was over, she would eat her partner, and then change back into an ordinary author, resuming a normal life.\n\nAfter some time passed,\n\nshe would come out to hunt again...\n\nNot quite romance, not quite supernatural, just absurd and nonsensical. It was completely illogical if you thought about it too hard, but this was precisely the characteristic style of the female author's stories, and also her selling point.\n\nBai Yingying looked at the book cover,\n\nwhich depicted a man and a woman dancing in a villa's living room,\n\nand subconsciously smacked her lips.\n\n*I think I remember... I just bought a villa too, huh?*\n\n*Does that mean I can also dance with the Boss in a villa?*\n\n*Just thinking about it is so exciting!*\n\n*Yinyin-yin...*\n\n--------\n\n**(Author's Note)**\n\nBefore asking for monthly tickets⁵ this afternoon, we were ranked 26th overall.\n\nNow we're 15th.\n\nThe Dragon's goal,\n\nis the top ten.\n\nSo, dears who have monthly tickets, please vote for the Dragon!\n\n---\n**Footnotes:**\n\n¹ **穩坐釣魚台 (wěn zuò diào yú tái):** Lit. \"sitting steadily on the fishing platform.\" An idiom meaning to remain calm and composed, watching things unfold without getting involved.\n\n² **葛優躺 (Gě Yōu tǎng):** The \"Ge You slouch,\" a popular Chinese internet meme from a 90s sitcom, referring to a specific, lazy way of slumping onto a sofa.\n\n³ **中二 (zhōng'èr):** From the Japanese \"chūnibyō,\" it describes teens (or adults) who have grandiose delusions, pretend to have special powers, or are overly dramatic.\n\n⁴ **崽子 (zǎizi):** The original text used asterisks to censor a curse word, likely **崽子 (wángbā zǎizi), meaning \"son of a bitch\" or \"bastard.\"\n\n⁵ **月票 (yuèpiào):** \"Monthly tickets\" are a virtual item on Chinese web novel platforms that readers can use to vote for their favorite novels, boosting their rankings.",

    "content": "Boss Zhou now felt as if he were living in a chapter of *Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio*.¹\n\nBecause in the stories of *Liaozhai*, there were always various female ghosts, fox spirits, or even female corpses that would appear out of nowhere, inexplicably fall in love with a scholar, and then produce all sorts of inexplicable results.\n\nBoss Zhou was no scholar from a story, but he was still utterly baffled.\n\nWhat in the world was going on?\n\nHe had clearly just sent off the old Daoist and Zhang Yanfeng.\n\nHe had been sitting properly on the sofa, waiting for Bai Yingying to bring over all of that woman's published works.\n\nAs for whether he'd find any important clues tonight or uncover the truth of the female writer's death, Zhou Ze didn't know. He'd just let things take their course.\n\nHe had, however, been thinking about having Yingying buy some red wine and food later.\n\nHe would leisurely sit on the second-floor balcony of the villa, sipping wine and enjoying the breeze.\n\nYingying would be beside him, massaging his shoulders.\n\nEnjoying the corrupt life of a pre-liberation² landlord.\n\nAlthough this was a haunted house, one could even call it a ghost house, Boss Zhou himself was an underworld officer, and Yingying was a jiangshi.³\n\nEntering a ghost house…\n\n…was really as comforting as coming home.\n\nJust like one of those street thugs going into a detention center.\n\nOnly…\n\nThe way things were developing had veered off on a bizarre arc.\n\nOh, no.\n\nIt was a parabola!\n\nFirst of all…\n\nWho was this woman?\n\nAt first, Zhou Ze thought it was a coincidence, but now he could be certain this was definitely not some damn coincidence.\n\nInitially, her behavior had been quite normal. But now, he had practically peeled the skin off her back, yet she was still forcefully holding him and continuing to dance?\n\nCoincidence?\n\nTo hell with coincidence!\n\n\"My back is so cold.\"\n\nThe female writer brought her lips to Zhou Ze's ear, her soft, delicate voice like a girlfriend murmuring sweet nothings to you.\n\nZhou Ze just felt that the world had lost all logic at that moment.\n\nAt this point…\n\nHe'd had enough.\n\nHe'd really had enough.\n\nHe didn't care if you were human or ghost, didn't care what the hell you were.\n\n*I'm going to snap your damn neck!*\n\nHis fingernails lengthened again, taking on a scythe-like form. Zhou Ze stabbed mercilessly at the woman's neck!\n\n\"Pffft…\"\n\nAt first, it was the sound of metal piercing flesh.\n\nBut then it became a long, drawn-out sawing sound, like an erhu.\n\nZhou Ze felt like he was holding a saw, cutting through steel rebar. He didn't know if he had a grudge against the saw or if he was just fighting with himself.\n\nHis nails pierced the woman's neck, and Zhou Ze thrust them back and forth relentlessly.\n\nBut the woman was still dancing with Zhou Ze, lost in the moment, unable to pull herself away, as if it were a sacred and indispensable ritual before a grand feast.\n\nHeaven itself would have taken pity. Boss Zhou swore that even in his most miserable moments in the past, he had never been this embarrassed.\n\nThis woman was an absolute freak, impervious to everything. Even his own nails meant nothing special to her.\n\nThe dance steps began to quicken, the rhythm picking up, as if entering its final movement.\n\nThe claws on Zhou Ze's other hand also sank into the woman's neck. The two sets of nails on his two hands, like two saws, embedded themselves deep within the woman's body.\n\nBoss Zhou wasn't a butcher by trade, but with this back-and-forth crisscrossing, there was truly little flesh left on the woman's upper body. In most places, the white bone was directly exposed.\n\nThe bones were pristine and smooth. Even nails as sharp as Zhou Ze's couldn't leave much of a mark on them.\n\n\"Haaaah…\"\n\nThe woman's hands tightened their grip on Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Darling, let's eat.\"\n\nThe dance ended.\n\nTime to eat!\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nZhou Ze was carried into the kitchen, and then his entire body was pushed down onto the sink. Normally, this position was common in certain *little movies*,⁴ but the roles of the male and female leads were now somewhat reversed.\n\nThe woman picked up a nearby kitchen knife.\n\nZhou Ze's pupils contracted.\n\nHe knew…\n\n…that once the woman truly sent that knife into his body, it would really be too late for anything.\n\n\"ROAR!\"\n\nA low growl emanated from deep within Zhou Ze's throat.\n\nAnother consciousness was slowly awakening.\n\nImmediately after,\n\nZhou Ze's skin began to shrivel, his eye sockets started to sink, and two fangs grew at a speed visible to the naked eye.\n\nIn that instant,\n\nHis strength surging, Zhou Ze violently pulled his nails out and managed to break free from the woman's grasp. The kitchen knife in the woman's hand swung, hitting nothing but air.\n\nZhou Ze got down from the sink and looked at this woman, who was half human skin and half white bone.\n\n\"Time to eat.\"\n\nThe woman murmured, seemingly not noticing what had changed about the man in front of her.\n\nZhou Ze took a step forward,\n\nThen a thoughtful expression appeared on his face.\n\n*Something's wrong.*\n\n*Something's very wrong.*\n\nZhou Ze looked at his hands.\n\nThis time, upon awakening…\n\n…why was *he* the one in control?\n\nIt was impossible that the other consciousness had given up its control and lent its power to him.\n\nImpossible.\n\nThat was impossible!\n\nPreviously, when that consciousness awakened, Zhou Ze could only recede into the background, watching as that great one rampaged, dealt with the danger at hand, ate its fill, and left. Only then would Zhou Ze re-emerge.\n\nBut this time,\n\nZhou Ze found that he had clearly let that consciousness awaken, but why the hell was he still the \"driver\"?\n\n\"Come, time to eat!\"\n\nThe woman lunged at him again.\n\nZhou Ze had no time to think about anything else. He charged forward proactively. Every time he let that consciousness awaken and turned himself into a jiangshi, any problem before him seemed to cease being a problem.\n\nBecause of this, Zhou Ze had extreme confidence in this state.\n\nHowever,\n\nWhen the two of them collided,\n\nZhou Ze was sent flying backward, slamming heavily onto the kitchen tiles. Several bloody gashes appeared across his chest.\n\n*How is this possible?*\n\n*What is going on?*\n\nThe woman only staggered back a few steps before charging forward again with renewed excitement.\n\nZhou Ze got to his feet. This time, he didn't dare to face her head-on, choosing instead to retreat. But the woman's speed was simply too fast. Even though Zhou Ze had clearly dodged, the kitchen knife held in her skeletal hands still grazed his arm.\n\n\"Hiss…\"\n\nZhou Ze sucked in a sharp breath.\n\nA gash had actually been cut open on his arm, and fresh blood was gushing out.\n\nAt the same time,\n\nThe fangs in his mouth were slowly retracting, and his skin, which had just shriveled moments ago, was beginning to relax again.\n\n\"What are you doing?\"\n\nZhou Ze couldn't help but mutter to himself.\n\nAnd it was, indeed, talking to himself.\n\nBut no one answered him.\n\nThat other consciousness seemed to have left his body.\n\n*Did it go on a business trip?*\n\n*On vacation?*\n\n\"Time to eat!\"\n\nThe woman, brandishing the kitchen knife, pressed forward again. Zhou Ze violently flipped the table in front of him, temporarily slowing her advance. He then dashed out of the kitchen, turned into the bathroom, and immediately locked the door.\n\nA foul stench still lingered in the bathroom, but Zhou Ze couldn't be bothered. When one's life was in danger, even fastidiousness could be tolerated!\n\nYou could even shout, \"Smells great!\"\n\n\"Crack!\"\n\nA skeletal hand punched straight through the bathroom door. Zhou Ze looked back and saw that the old Daoist's paper talisman was still on the toilet lid. Without hesitation, he grabbed the talisman,\n\nAnd slapped it onto the door.\n\nThe talisman began to burn.\n\nThe skeletal hand instantly turned red,\n\nand even emitted a fragrance similar to \"sweet and sour pork ribs,\"\n\nbefore being yanked back abruptly.\n\nThe woman didn't dare try to break the door anymore, at least not for the time being. She just lowered her head, pressing her eye socket against the crack she had just made, and stared intently at Zhou Ze inside:\n\n\"Heh heh, just you wait… time to eat.\"\n\nZhou Ze glanced at the talisman,\n\nand saw that a third of it had already burned away.\n\n*Dammit…*\n\n*What in the world is going on!*\n\nZhou Ze turned his face to look at the bathroom mirror.\n\nAt that moment,\n\nHe was stunned to see his reflection in the mirror roaring and struggling ceaselessly.\n\n\"You're…\" Zhou Ze realized at once. \"How did you get in there!\"\n\nThe Zhou Ze in the mirror was roaring desperately.\n\nZhou Ze couldn't hear the sound,\n\nbut roughly,\n\nperhaps,\n\nmaybe,\n\nmore or less,\n\nhe could guess,\n\n…that he was being cursed out?\n\nZhou Ze's temper flared up as well.\n\n*Damn it,*\n\n*You took off without a word, leaving me unable to even use my ultimate move,*\n\n*And you have the nerve to curse me out?*\n\nAs if sensing what Zhou Ze was thinking,\n\nthe one in the mirror struggled and roared even more violently.\n\nIt was estimated that if he could get out right now,\n\nhe probably would have been willing to rip himself to shreds just for mutual destruction.\n\n………………\n\n\"We're here, this is it.\" The driver stopped the car. \"Young lady, my car can't enter this residential complex. You'll have to walk in from over there.\"\n\n\"Okay, Shifu. You can settle the fare.\"\n\nBai Yingying got out of the car. She hadn't taken more than a few steps when the driver called out from behind her:\n\n\"Hey, little miss, you forgot a book here.\"\n\nBai Yingying immediately ran back. The driver reached down and struggled to pull a book out from under the seat.\n\nIt must have slid off when the car braked suddenly earlier. Bai Yingying hadn't noticed and had left it behind.\n\n\"Heh, *The Two-Faced Man*. A ghost story, right? Aren't you afraid of having nightmares, young lady?\"\n\nThe driver teased her good-naturedly.\n\nIf this driver knew he was advising a jiangshi to watch out for nightmares from reading ghost stories, one wonders what he would think.\n\n\"I'm bringing it to someone. Thank you, Shifu.\"\n\n\"I actually quite like reading ghost stories myself, but I don't dare to when I'm driving at night. Let's see this synopsis here;\n\nTwo consciousnesses exist within one body.\n\nThey originally lived together in one body, with conflicts, arguments, distrust, and unease.\n\nBut one day, after one consciousness is trapped in a mirror,\n\nthe other one,\n\nunexpectedly finds himself unaccustomed to the independent life he once craved.\n\nHe even begins to actively search for the one imprisoned in the mirror,\n\nhis other self…\"\n\nThe driver smacked his lips.\n\n\"Heh, isn't this just schizophrenia?\n\nMaking it sound so mysterious. These novels nowadays, the gimmicks are getting flashier and flashier. They just don't have the same flavor as the wuxia books by Jin Yong and Gu Long we read when we were young.\"\n\nWith that, the master driver handed the book to Bai Yingying.\n\n\"Off I go!\"\n\n\"Goodbye, Shifu.\"\n\n---\n**Footnotes:**\n1.  *Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio* (*Liaozhai Zhiyi*): A famous collection of classical Chinese supernatural tales from the Qing Dynasty.\n2.

    "content": "\"Scrape… Scrape… Scrape…\"\n\nThe woman's face was rubbing ceaselessly against the door, even drooling, with an undisguised eagerness.\n\nShe was truly hungry.\n\nLike a big pet dog at home getting ready for dinner, so eager it wants to pounce right on you, pawing at the ground, forcibly restraining itself.\n\nZhou Ze turned on the tap and splashed cold water on his face. He needed to calm down. Especially at a time like this, calmness was exceptionally important.\n\nFirst of all, this shouldn't be an illusion anymore.\n\nBut it was precisely because it wasn't an illusion that it felt all the more terrifying, all the more incomprehensible.\n\nAlthough Zhou Ze was a ghost emissary, he still found it somewhat hard to accept this kind of situation occurring in the real world.\n\nEspecially since his greatest asset was now trapped inside the mirror. What he was shouting, what he was cursing—he couldn't hear any of it.\n\nIf Zhou Ze could post on his social media feed right now,\n\nit would definitely be:\n\nI'm Zhou Ze.\n\nAnd right now, I'm scared as fuck.¹\n\nThe old Daoist's paper talisman had almost finished burning; only a tiny bit was left.\n\nClosing the toilet lid, Zhou Ze sat down on it and slowly closed his eyes. He needed quiet, he needed calm.\n\nIf he couldn't survive without the help of that other consciousness, then what was the point of all this struggle? He might as well just obediently wait for the other guy to awaken and complete the handover.\n\nA person's most reliable asset is, in the end, themself.\n\n\"Hooo… Hooo…\"\n\nHe took a deep breath, calming the emotions in his heart.\n\nBecause his eyes were closed, Zhou Ze didn't see that the man in the mirror, upon seeing him sit down calmly, also gradually stopped struggling, roaring, and cursing. Instead, he began to stand there calmly as well.\n\nOutside, a woman was waiting for her meal. Boss Zhou didn't know that the woman outside was a White Bone Spirit, a paradoxical existence that was neither ghost nor demon.\n\nShe was something born from absurdity itself.\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nThe last bit of the paper talisman burned away, turning to ash.\n\nAt the same time,\n\nthe door was smashed open.\n\nThe woman charged in, wielding a cleaver in each hand.\n\nZhou Ze's eyes snapped open.\n\nSamurai armor appeared on his body.\n\nThe reason he hadn't summoned the armor before was because he was confident in his own strength when he awakened that other consciousness and entered the jiangshi state. He could instantly kill anything.\n\nNow,\n\nhe needed to utilize his power as completely as he possibly could.\n\n\"Clang! Clang!\"\n\nThe cleavers slammed crazily against the armor. The terrifying force of the impacts nearly knocked Zhou Ze to the ground. Frightening dents actually appeared on the armor; heaven knows how strong this woman was!\n\nEven with ordinary cleavers, when she swung them, she could probably kill a bull in one strike.\n\n\"Smack!\"\n\nZhou Ze's fingernails dug into her wrist. He then quickly sidestepped and shoved forward, pushing the woman to the other side.\n\nThe woman's face and chest were pressed against the bathroom's tiled wall. She writhed ceaselessly. Her clothes had already torn open earlier, but right now, no normal man could possibly appreciate this kind of \"beauty.\"\n\nMany people say that to appreciate a person, you must look at their inner self, not at their surface or skin.\n\nBut when the bloody skin is truly torn away for you to take a deep, thorough look at the inside,\n\nyou'd feel that,\n\nit's better to just look at the skin.\n\nIt's better to just look at the outside!\n\n\"Dinner time!\"\n\nThe woman braced her arms hard against the wall and pushed back. The wall tiles began to crack, spreading out like a spiderweb.\n\nThe nails on Zhou Ze's left hand transformed into sickles and stabbed directly into the small of the woman's back.\n\nThe woman felt no pain, let alone screamed. She even turned her head back to look at Zhou Ze, still drooling.\n\nAs if to say,\n\n*Aren't you a feisty one!*\n\n\"Get down!\"\n\nZhou Ze pressed down with the full force of his body, even throwing his own body weight into it. The woman's upper body was forced down, and Zhou Ze shoved her face, which had little flesh left on it, into the toilet bowl.\n\nThe woman began to struggle frantically.\n\nShe wanted to get up.\n\nShe wanted to grab Zhou Ze.\n\nShe wanted to enjoy her grand feast for the day!\n\nBut Zhou Ze's two hands, with their long nails, were like steel bars pinning her body in place. Like a stapler, they clamped her down right there.\n\nThe bathroom was only so big, and the presence of the toilet allowed Zhou Ze to use the space to restrain the woman.\n\nThe woman's struggles continued.\n\nThe sound of fingernails grating against bone was piercingly harsh.\n\nAs she continued to struggle, Zhou Ze could see fresh blood slowly seeping out from under his own fingernails. Clearly, his nails were also starting to give out.\n\nIn *Journey to the West*, if Tang Sanzang hadn't kept holding him back, the Great Sage Sun could have smashed the White Bone Spirit to death with a single swing of his staff. That's why most people think the White Bone Spirit is just good at shapeshifting and tricking people, nothing special.\n\nBut Boss Zhou was no Great Sage Sun. The woman before him truly felt \"impervious to weapons.\" Her bones were like a high-strength alloy.\n\nYou have to remember, Boss Zhou's nails used to be sharp enough to \"cut through iron as if it were mud.\" But with each scrape, they could only leave a faint white mark on her bones, not even a groove!\n\n\"What do I do!\" Zhou Ze shouted.\n\nIn the bathroom, there were only him and this woman.\n\nHowever,\n\nZhou Ze knew,\n\nthere was another one in the mirror.\n\nIf Boss Zhou didn't make it through tonight, if he really became this woman's dinner, it wouldn't just be Zhou Ze who died.\n\nWhy had the other one repeatedly forced himself awake to help when Zhou Ze was in danger?\n\nIt was for this very reason.\n\nHe and Zhou Ze were, in fact, one person. If Zhou Ze was done for, he was done for too.\n\nSo even though he had to pay a great price in energy and cost every time he woke up,\n\nhe still had to wake up time and time again to clean up Zhou Ze's messes.\n\nThe Zhou Ze in the mirror raised his hand.\n\nLike peeling a banana,\n\nhe slowly peeled the flesh from his fingers, revealing the scalp-numbing white bone beneath.\n\nEverything,\n\nseemed so fluid,\n\nso serene.\n\nThis serenity wasn't just reflected in the detail of the silence,\n\nbut in that,\n\nindifference to the body,\n\nto flesh and blood,\n\nto pain!\n\nAnd then,\n\nhe brought his bony fingers to his mouth and began to suck on them slowly,\n\nas if he were at a barbecue joint, eating a skewer of cartilage and meat, sprinkled with chili powder.\n\n\"Crunch… crunch…\"\n\nSo crisp,\n\nso savory.\n\nThe one in the mirror,\n\nwas actually starting to perform a rendition of stewing himself in an iron pot…\n\nOh, wait,\n\nhe was performing eating himself!\n\nHe ate with great absorption,\n\nwith great focus.\n\nThen,\n\nhe waved at Zhou Ze.\n\nAmong his five fingers,\n\none was already gone.\n\nAnd that one was still being chewed and savored in his mouth.\n\n*Eat myself?*\n\nZhou Ze thought.\n\n*Eat myself to increase my power?*\n\n*Is this a secret jiangshi technique?*\n\nThe expression on the Zhou Ze in the mirror suddenly changed.\n\nHe must have heard Zhou Ze's inner thoughts.\n\nAlthough he was in the mirror now, he and Zhou Ze were still connected.\n\nHe began to roar and curse madly again,\n\nas if he wanted nothing more than to tear this idiot to shreds!\n\nIt was just a pity he couldn't leave the mirror, couldn't come back.\n\nOtherwise, he might really have dragged Zhou Ze down to die with him!\n\n*Not eat myself?*\n\n*Then eat…?*\n\nZhou Ze lowered his head,\n\nand looked at the woman who was pinned to the toilet, temporarily unable to escape his two \"sickles.\"\n\n*That's a bit too much…*\n\nBoss Zhou wasn't someone who insisted on fine food and meticulously prepared meals.² In his past life, he came from an orphanage and wasn't picky about food.\n\nIn this life, \"eating\" had been a huge problem for a very long time. He was thankful just to be able to eat; as for eating and drinking well, he would never demand it.\n\nBut when all was said and done,\n\nto eat *this* directly,\n\nwas just too hard to accept.\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nA heart-piercing pain shot through him.\n\n\"Hiss…\"\n\nThe pain almost made Zhou Ze jump.\n\nThe nail on his left pinky finger had snapped right off. The nail bed was torn open, a bloody mess.\n\nThe ten fingers are connected to the heart.³\n\nEspecially since Boss Zhou's nails were different from ordinary ones, the pain they brought was even more intense.\n\nTen fingernails had only been barely enough to hold the woman in check.\n\nNow that one had broken,\n\nit was even harder to completely suppress her.\n\nAnd she seemed to be encouraged by this,\n\nstruggling with even more vigor.\n\nIn the bathroom,\n\nthe White Bone Spirit's rapid breathing could be heard,\n\ncarrying a powerful rhythm.\n\nShe kept trying to stand up, to turn around,\n\nbut each time she pushed herself up, she was forced back down by Zhou Ze.\n\nTheir struggle had been going on for a while now.\n\nThere was no time to hesitate,\n\nand no room for hesitation.\n\nZhou Ze opened his mouth,\n\nand bit down directly on the woman's back!\n\nHis fangs had long since retracted.\n\nAfter all, he couldn't enter the jiangshi state at all right now.\n\nBesides,\n\nthese bones were so hard that even his fingernails couldn't leave much of a mark. Could he rely on his teeth? Was that even possible?\n\nLess than a third of the woman's back still had skin and flesh clinging to it; the rest was already just white bone. But the bone was covered in a disgusting white mucus, like a specimen soaked in formalin.\n\nZhou Ze bit down on one of her bones.\n\nThis time, he didn't hold back at all. He didn't dare to.\n\n\"Screeeech…\"\n\nHis teeth grated against her bone.\n\nA sour pang shot through Zhou Ze's nose, and tears fell from his eyes.\n\n*I can't bite through!*\n\n*Fuck!*\n\n*What kind of stupid method is this!*\n\n*Don't tell me I have to throw the woman into an iron pot and boil her,*\n\n*or stir-fry her in red sauce?*\n\n*But is that even possible?*\n\nHe was already about to lose control of this woman.\n\nIf she broke free,\n\nhe would be the one getting steamed or stir-fried, just as the woman had been carrying him towards the kitchen after her dance.\n\nShe must have been a person of refined taste in her life.\n\nShe didn't like simply eating raw flesh and drinking blood.\n\nShe liked her food exquisitely prepared.\n\nBut in the next moment,\n\nwhen the saliva in Zhou Ze's mouth was secreted and touched the woman's bone,\n\nin a daze,\n\nZhou Ze felt that the bone he was biting,\n\nseemed to have softened a little.\n\nHis teeth seemed to have sunk in a tiny bit.\n\n*Is this an illusion?*\n\n---\n**Footnotes:**\n\n1.

After I deliver the books to the Boss, I'll call that manager and have him buy one for me here too.\"\n\n  Yingying muttered to herself as she admired the surrounding scenery.\n\n  She herself didn't even know,\n\n  that she had, in fact, already bought a house here.\n\n  And her boss,\n\n  had long since brazenly moved in.\n\n  Of course,\n\n  for people with a lot of property,\n\n  forgetting where all their houses are,\n\n  was a fairly normal thing, I suppose.\n\n  \"Oh, here it is. This one.\"\n\n  Bai Yingying stood outside the gate and peered in. She noticed the yard was very dilapidated and overgrown with weeds. The owner must be very lazy, or maybe no one even lived here.\n\n  \"It's you people who buy houses and leave them empty that drive up the property prices, making it so expensive for me to buy a house now!\"\n\n  Bai Yingying complained indignantly.\n\n  She had her own funerary goods,\n\n  and the antiques and paintings that Madam Bai had liked to collect were also with her.\n\n  But no matter how wealthy you were, when facing the real estate market, you'd still get the feeling of being quickly emptied out.\n\n  Of course,\n\n  Bai Yingying, who was only ever thinking about surpassing Xu Qinglang in the number of houses owned, didn't realize,\n\n  that her own house-buying behavior was, in fact, a form of property speculation itself.\n\n  Pushing open the yard gate, she walked to the entryway and rang the doorbell.\n\n  *Why would the Boss be in a place like this, and have me deliver books?*\n\n  \"Click...\"\n\n  The door opened.\n\n  A woman was standing inside.\n\n  She had a somewhat plump figure, wasn't very tall, and wore a pair of glasses.\n\n  \"Please, come in.\"\n\n  Without even asking who she was,\n\n  she let Bai Yingying straight in.\n\n  \"Er...\"\n\n  After stepping inside, Bai Yingying looked all around,\n\n  even starting to wonder if she'd come to the wrong place.\n\n  \"You're here for your man, aren't you?\" the woman asked as she poured tea.\n\n  \"Mhm, mhm!\"\n\n  Bai Yingying nodded like a chick pecking at rice.\n\n  *My man.*\n\n  *She really liked that title!*\n\n  \"He's over there. He said he was tired and wanted to lie down for a bit.\"\n\n  Bai Yingying followed the woman's finger,\n\n  and saw Zhou Ze lying on the sofa.\n\n  Her familiar boss,\n\n  in his familiar 'Ge You slouch'.¹\n\n  Bai Yingying immediately went over, holding the books.\n\n  Zhou Ze sat up and gestured for Bai Yingying to massage his shoulders.\n\n  Putting the books down,\n\n  Bai Yingying moved behind the sofa and began to massage Zhou Ze's shoulders.\n\n  \"Mama, I'm hungry.\"\n\n  A little girl who looked just like a porcelain doll came running over.\n\n  The woman knelt down,\n\n  stroked the girl's hair, and said,\n\n  \"Be good. Go upstairs and find your big brother. He's got a lot of snacks hidden in his room.\"\n\n  \"Okay, Mama!\"\n\n  The little girl skipped and bounced her way up the stairs.\n\n  In the living room,\n\n  only the woman, Bai Yingying, and Zhou Ze remained.\n\n  \"Boss, I brought the books,\"\n\n  Bai Yingying said softly to Zhou Ze as she massaged him.\n\n  \"Mm.\"\n\n  Zhou Ze nodded,\n\n  as if too tired to speak, closing his eyes to enjoy the massage.\n\n  The woman walked over, flipped through the stack of books, and picked one out.\n\n  \"I've read this one. *The Taotie's Banquet*.\"\n\n  \"Mhm,\" Bai Yingying said noncommittally.\n\n  \"It's about a man, a serial killer, and he has a particular fetish: after killing someone, he has to eat them.\n\n  He liked to kill women, and he was very particular about his cannibalism. He liked to strip the bones from his victims to make soup, then slowly gnaw on their bones.\"\n\n  The woman narrated with a placid expression.\n\n  \"Interesting, that a book like this could even get published.\"\n\n  The woman looked at Bai Yingying, smiled, and continued, \"Miss, I have some other books here. Would you like to read them?\"\n\n  Bai Yingying shook her head. Her entire focus seemed to be on her boss, with no attention to spare for anything else.\n\n  The woman looked a little disappointed.\n\n  She glanced at the sky outside,\n\n  and said,\n\n  \"Looks like it's going to rain.\"\n\n  Outside, it had actually already gotten dark.\n\n  \"Have you read this book, Miss?\"\n\n  The woman took out another book.\n\n  *You're so annoying.*\n\n  *Are you showing off how many books you've read?*\n\n  *I was lying in a coffin for two hundred years,*\n\n  *and there was no Wi-Fi!*\n\n  *Where would I find the time to read books?*\n\n  *Want me to recite the* Biographies of Exemplary Women *for you?*\n\n  Bai Yingying was very annoyed with this woman and her pretentious tone. Perhaps it was an instinctive wariness and defensiveness at finding Zhou Ze in the home of a woman with children.\n\n  *So now, besides the loli, the original partner, and the men,*\n\n  *the Boss is expanding his tastes,*\n\n  *and developing a thing for the married-woman type?*\n\n  Yingying suddenly felt a tightness in her chest.\n\n  *This is so tiring!*\n\n  But the woman seemed completely oblivious to Bai Yingying's reaction,\n\n  and continued:\n\n  \"The title of this book is *Qian-Nü Youhun*,² riding the coattails of *A Chinese Ghost Story*.\n\n  It's about a young lady from a wealthy family during the Qing dynasty who falls in love with a scholar.\n\n  It's a cliché that not only modern people, but probably even the ancients, would be tired of.\n\n  So the author designed a new direction for the story.\n\n  For example,\n\n  the poor scholar is actually a practiced womanizer who loves to move among the young ladies of various families, specializing in seducing these little girls...\"\n\n  Hearing this,\n\n  Bai Yingying's expression suddenly froze.\n\n  \"Also, the affair was later exposed. The reason it came out was simple: the scholar wanted to steal a taste of the forbidden fruit, but the young lady was unwilling. She only wanted to give her body on their wedding night. In modern terms, she wouldn't agree to 'getting on the bus before buying the ticket'.\n\n  She foolishly encouraged the scholar to study hard and earn an official title.\n\n  But the scholar got angry and spread rumors about their affair, even using the personal jade pendant the young lady had given him as proof.\n\n  Hah.\n\n  Men.\n\n  They like to treat women as trophies to show off,\n\n  to boast about at the drinking table.\n\n  Actually, many women are foolish too, not realizing that for a man,\n\n  sharing one quilt for a night is easy, but sharing one life for a lifetime is very hard.³\n\n  After this was spread around, it brought a great disaster upon the young lady, because she was already betrothed, and to the son of a provincial governor at that. Furthermore, her family was extremely strict and valued propriety; her ancestors and father were all learned men of the Dao, and they couldn't tolerate such a stain on their honor.\n\n  The young lady was drowned in a pig cage. Publicly, her death was reported as an illness.\"\n\n  Yingying's massaging fingers stopped. She lifted her head, her face dark, and stared at the woman who was still narrating calmly.\n\n  \"The story up to this point isn't that unusual, just a tragedy. But there are far too many tragedies like this; it's not enough to attract attention.\"\n\n  The woman took a sip of tea and continued:\n\n  \"The young lady died, and became a ghost after death. But due to a stroke of fate, she managed to evade capture by the netherworld bailiffs and linger in the mortal realm.\n\n  Her reason for staying was simple: she wanted revenge.\n\n  She had been a temple deity. She truly could have remained a temple deity, enjoying incense offerings and perhaps even attaining a stable official post in the afterlife.\n\n  But she was always watching, always waiting, and always taking revenge. She caused the scholar's descendants, one by one, to have their families torn apart and to live lives of frustrated ambition, ultimately meeting bad ends. But she always protected their family line from dying out, so that she could continue her revenge generation after generation.\n\n  So,\n\n  never anger a woman.\n\n  Doing ten thousand good deeds can be undone by one deliberate bad deed. Her position as a deity was always precarious, and later, it was gone completely.\n\n  Even after she eventually let it go and her revenge was over, when she descended to Hell, her heart was filled with great unease.\n\n  She knew she had accumulated a lot of merit,\n\n  but she didn't know if her merit could offset the evil she had done.\n\n  But she didn't regret it. Not one bit.\n\n  She loved brazenly in life, and took her revenge cathartically in death.\n\n  People often say not to feel it's unfair for the rich second generation; that's because their parents worked hard for it.\n\n  So, don't blame your own bad luck; it's the sins of your ancestors.\"\n\n  At this, the woman stretched, her full chest nearly bursting from her clothes, and sighed with feeling:\n\n  \"This book's story also tells us not to always believe in that kind of naive love. Overly naive love doesn't exist.\n\n  Of course, these ancient stories of talented scholars and beautiful ladies rarely happen in real life.\n\n  Eileen Chang or maybe Lu Xun seems to have said:\n\n  If the man isn't poor and the woman isn't ugly, all that's between them is a round of drinks.\n\n  If the man is poor and the woman is ugly, they're friends the world over.\"\n\n  \"Mama, Big Brother won't give me any snacks,\"\n\n  the little girl called from upstairs.\n\n  \"Coming, coming, Mama's coming.\"\n\n  The woman stood up and walked up the stairs, her long monologue finally over.\n\n  In the living room,\n\n  _** **_only Zhou Ze and Bai Yingying remained.\n\n  \"Keep kneading. Don't stop.\"\n\n  Zhou Ze pointed to his shoulder.\n\n  Bai Yingying nodded.\n\n  She reached down.\n\n  One hand gripped Zhou Ze's neck,\n\n  the other grabbed his shoulder,\n\n  and then with a surge of strength,\n\n  she twisted,\n\n  then wrenched,\n\n  and finally, pulled!\n\n  \"CRACK...\"\n\n  A perfectly fine head was detached by Bai Yingying.\n\n  Grabbing it by the hair,\n\n  she held it up in her hand.\n\n  Like a piece of seaweed,\n\n  swaying in the wind.\n\n  The head was still opening its mouth, looking somewhat baffled. The shift in treatment, from one moment to the next, was simply earth-shattering.\n\n  Bai Yingying glanced at it sideways,\n\n  and said:\n\n  \"I knew you were a fake the moment I walked in.\n\n  On you,\n\n  there's none of the Boss's scent.\"\n\n  \"His scent, what is it?\" the head in Bai Yingying's hand suddenly asked.\n\n  However,\n\n  the voice that came from the head this time wasn't a man's.\n\n  It was the voice of the woman who had been telling the story,\n\n  filled with deep confusion, and also an extremely strong thirst for knowledge.\n\n  As a writer,\n\n  she hoped the characters she wrote could be as realistic as possible, as \"vivid and lifelike\" as possible. Only that kind of work could give readers a sense of immersion.\n\n  Bai Yingying threw the man's head against the wall.\n\n  \"SPLAT!\"\n\n  Like a watermelon hitting the ground,\n\n  it burst open.\n\n  Eyeballs, ears, and other things rolled all over the floor.\n\n  Yingying clasped her hands into fists in front of her and swayed her body:\n\n  \"Hmph,\n\n  it's a man's scent, of course!\n\n  Why'd you ask me such an embarrassing wittle question?\n\n  Ying-ying-ying...\"\n\n***\n\n¹ A reference to a famous pose by Chinese actor Ge You from the 1993 sitcom *I Love My Family*, where he is slouched lifelessly on a sofa.

    "content": "Zhou Ze rarely ate barbecue.\n\n  As a child in the orphanage, he never had the chance;\n\n  after he grew up and became a doctor,\n\n  he considered it unsanitary and avoided it.\n\n  But at this moment,\n\n  Zhou Ze found himself dearly missing the smoky, fiery smell of a barbecue stand, and the heavy seasonings that could completely mask the taste of spoiled food.\n\n  These bones...\n\n  were just too disgusting to eat.\n\n  He had seen big dogs gnawing on bones before. There was clearly no meat left, and they were hard as rock, but the dogs just loved to work on them, gnawing and gnawing away.\n\n  Now,\n\n  Zhou Ze felt like he was a dog,\n\n  doing battle with the bones in front of him.\n\n  The posture was a bit indecent,\n\n  the scene a bit frightening.\n\n  One person lying on top of another,\n\n  gnawing on their body.\n\n  The woman beneath him was no longer able to support herself to stand up; she could only lie draped over the toilet. Every exertion resulted in her bracing herself for a moment before collapsing again.\n\n  Zhou Ze was a doctor, so he was very familiar with the structure of the human skeleton.\n\n  Therefore, although he had been gnawing for so long and had only eaten through and broken a few bones, Zhou Ze had his own selection process. He knew which bones were most critical for human movement, so his target was clear.\n\n  The effect was also outstanding.\n\n  With a *crack*,\n\n  as this bone was also bitten through,\n\n  Boss Zhou had no choice but to climb off the woman.\n\n  He vigorously rubbed his jaw.\n\n  Damn it,\n\n  it was so sore, so painful.\n\n  His mouth was full of leftover bone fragments. He wanted to spit them out, but then he thought of all his hard work and simply swallowed them all.\n\n  This feeling,\n\n  was like his old neighbors, Grandma Wang and Uncle Li, superstitiously believing that some medicinal wine could make them immune to all illnesses.\n\n  However, the strange thing was,\n\n  when he swallowed the bones, there wasn't the usual feeling of disgust. He swallowed them, and that was that.\n\n  Zhou Ze shook his head with a sense of helplessness.\n\n  An image surfaced in his mind:\n\n  The old Daoist, Old Xu, and the little loli eating a meal, while he sat to the side, holding a human bone and gnawing on it for dear life.\n\n  What a beautiful picture. It burned the eyes.\n\n  The woman lay on the floor, still convulsing, her hands still gripping the cleaver tightly. But she couldn't get up, and without being able to stand, she lost most of her threat. Furthermore, to prevent her from crawling on the floor or walls like a spider, Zhou Ze had shifted her position, wedging her on her side between the toilet and the wall.\n\n  The woman was still drooling; she had never once concealed her craving for Zhou Ze.\n\n  Zhou Ze gave her a salute, loosened the buttons of his shirt, and walked over to the sink to meticulously wash his hands.\n\n  As if he had just finished a major surgery.\n\n  It was a pity the villa had long been abandoned; otherwise, if there had been a toothbrush, Zhou Ze wouldn't have minded brushing his teeth. He might even have taken a shower.\n\n  The man in the mirror was still standing there.\n\n  He just watched Zhou Ze calmly,\n\n  with no encouragement for a promising pupil,\n\n  only the disdain of a \"you're-only-alive-by-pure-fucking-luck\" glare.\n\n  \"Hey,\" Zhou Ze called out. \"What do I do now?\"\n\n  What the hell was this place?\n\n  And what was the deal with this villa?\n\n  Zhou Ze was still completely clueless.\n\n  There was no logic,\n\n  no cause and effect.\n\n  Everything,\n\n  seemed so utterly baffling, so impossible to figure out.\n\n  The Zhou Ze in the mirror raised his hand and began to swipe across the mirror's surface, as if to write something.\n\n  However,\n\n  just as he began to write,\n\n  the glass began to vibrate violently.\n\n  The image within it was also distorting.\n\n  The Zhou Ze in the mirror frowned,\n\n  seemingly unwilling to give up.\n\n   _The words couldn't be written._\n\n  Any explicit hint would be blocked, be erased.\n\n  For readers,\n\n  when reading a book they're interested in, the most annoying thing is a spoiler.\n\n  Because it greatly diminishes the anticipation for the book, the story, and the plot,\n\n  robbing them of their reading momentum.\n\n  \"Stop writing. If you keep going, I'm afraid you'll break.\"\n\n  Zhou Ze held up his hands, signaling the other to stop.\n\n  Although Boss Zhou had always harbored a little scheme—that it would be pure bliss if the consciousness inside him ever got tired of living and killed itself—and it would be even more wonderful if it had a crisis of conscience and left all its abilities to him before committing suicide.\n\n  But at this moment,\n\n  in this environment,\n\n  even though the other party was trapped in the mirror,\n\n  Zhou Ze still didn't want anything to happen to him right now.\n\n  After all, they were both locusts on the same rope.¹\n\n  The Zhou Ze in the mirror stopped moving,\n\n  as if thinking.\n\n  Then,\n\n  he extended a single finger,\n\n  and pointed at Zhou Ze.\n\n  Zhou Ze pointed at himself.\n\n  *Pointing at me?*\n\n  The Zhou Ze in the mirror shook his head.\n\n  Zhou Ze stepped back, clearing the way. He saw that the finger of the man in the mirror was still pointing.\n\n  He was pointing in a direction.\n\n  And that direction was the hint.\n\n  He couldn't say it directly,\n\n  but he could give a subtle reminder.\n\n  This was foreshadowing.\n\n  Zhou Ze followed the direction of the finger and saw that the other was pointing at the Skeletal Demon² he had with great difficulty wedged between the toilet and the wall.\n\n  \"Her?\"\n\n  The Zhou Ze in the mirror nodded, then shook his head.\n\n  \"On her?\"\n\n  Zhou Ze walked over to the woman.\n\n  Seeing Zhou Ze return, the woman\n\n  grinned happily,\n\n  and the drool flowed even more fiercely.\n\n  \"Dinner time... Dinner time... Dinner time...\"\n\n  Zhou Ze swallowed hard.\n\n  He looked back at the mirror,\n\n  then back at the woman.\n\n  Finally,\n\n  he pointed to the woman's head.\n\n  The man in the mirror shook his head.\n\n  He pointed to the woman's left arm.\n\n  The man in the mirror continued to shake his head.\n\n  He pointed to the woman's neck.\n\n  The man in the mirror still shook his head...\n\n  ...\n\n  Not until Zhou Ze pointed to *that* spot,\n\n  did the man in the mirror hesitate for a moment,\n\n _and finally nod._\n\n  Zhou Ze let out a stunned laugh and pointed at the man in the mirror:\n\n  \"Are you sick in the head?\"\n\n  The man in the mirror immediately flew into a rage out of shame and anger.\n\n  He began to freak out,\n\n  to struggle,\n\n  to roar,\n\n  to curse!\n\n  He was like a grumpy old dog that would go crazy at the slightest provocation.\n\n  Fortunately, he couldn't get out right now, and Zhou Ze couldn't hear what he was yelling.\n\n  Zhou Ze just treated it as if he were performing a one-man Charlie Chaplin silent comedy.\n\n  He turned,\n\n  and looked back at the woman,\n\n  back at *that* spot.\n\n  What,\n\n  exactly, was it pointing to?\n\n  There was a film series that was very popular in niche circles called *Cube*.³\n\n  Zhou Ze felt like he was in that movie right now.\n\n  No beginning,\n\n  no end.\n\n  You're just meant to enjoy the thrilling and stimulating process.\n\n  Actually,\n\n  the cause of this incident,\n\n  was still because an old man came here to use the toilet.\n\n  No,\n\n  using the toilet wasn't the cause.\n\n  It was that the old man was nuts.\n\n  While using the toilet, he had stuck a paper talisman from his crotch onto the toilet lid.\n\n  The talisman,\n\n  had stimulated something dormant to awaken.\n\n  Or rather,\n\n  the talisman had triggered a mechanism.\n\n  ...\n\n  \"Boss? Boss?\"\n\n  Bai Yingying was searching all over the villa.\n\n  She searched from the first floor to the second,\n\n _and from the second floor back down to the first._\n\n  The boss was gone.\n\n  Not only was the boss gone, but the woman and the two children had also disappeared.\n\n  The entire villa,\n\n  was empty except for her.\n\n  The headless corpse was still sprawled on the sofa in a Ge You slouch,⁴ motionless.\n\n  \"Boss, where did you go? Don't scare Yingying.\"\n\n  Yingying pouted.\n\n  She surveyed the villa:\n\n  \"Damn you, villa. Don't let me find out who your owner is, or this young lady will skin you alive and eat you raw!\"\n\n  \"...\" said the villa.\n\n  Unwilling to give up, Bai Yingying searched again.\n\n  This time, she was more thorough.\n\n  Under the bed,\n\n  in the closets,\n\n  she even lifted the toilet lid.\n\n  She didn't find the boss in any of those places.\n\n  But Bai Yingying knew that the address the boss gave her was here, and that such bizarre things had just happened here.\n\n  Bai Yingying walked back to the sofa and sat down.\n\n  On the coffee table in front of her was a stack of novels.\n\n  On the very top,\n\n  was that book, *A Ghost's Guide to Riches*.⁵\n\n  She picked up the book, set it down. The second one was *The Resentful Ghost of the Secluded Boudoir*. The background on the cover was, shockingly, the villa's living room. A girl in a dress sat desolately on the sofa, and next to her lay a headless corpse.\n\n  The summary read: A lonely, resentful ghost, so bored that she constantly finds different corpses to accompany her and pass the dull, lonely time.\n\n  Bai Yingying tilted her head back slightly,\n\n  a look of disgust on her face.\n\n  Then she gave the second floor the middle finger!\n\n  *You think this young lady is stupid?*\n\n  *Mocking me like that!*\n\n  *Smack!*\n\n  Bai Yingying tossed the book aside.\n\n  The next book was *The Two-Faced Man*.\n\n  It was the book she had almost left in the taxi earlier.\n\n  In the dark,\n\n  Bai Yingying hadn't gotten a good look at the cover before.\n\n  As for the summary and story synopsis, the taxi driver had read it out to her.\n\n  Looking at the cover now,\n\n  it showed a large mirror.\n\n  A person stood inside the mirror,\n\n  and a person stood outside the mirror.\n\n  Oh, no.\n\n  There was also a dismembered woman, her legs splayed, lying in a messy heap in the corner.\n\n  \"Huh...\"\n\n  Bai Yingying let out a gasp of surprise.\n\n  The person in the cover illustration,\n\n  looked a bit like the boss.\n\n  It seemed the boss had been wearing clothes just like that when he went out today.\n\n  Looking closer,\n\n  Bai Yingying saw that the person inside the mirror was pointing outwards,\n\n  pointing in a direction.\n\n  He looked like he was trying to give the person outside the mirror a clue.\n\n  The main plot of *The Two-Faced Man* was actually about two souls who originally existed in one body with mutual suspicion, but after they were separated, they suddenly remembered the good things about each other. In the end, after countless hardships, they were finally reunited in a story of suspense and romance.\n\n  It was a rather BL-leaning, slash-esque novel that the author, whose real name was Zhang Tianquan but wrote under the pen name \"Second Sister-in-Law of the Secluded Boudoir,\" had written to cater to market trends.\n\n  Bai Yingying placed her fingernail on the arm of the person in the mirror.\n\n  She followed his arm,\n\n  then his finger,\n\n  tracing it all the way down.\n\n  Her nail crossed the mirror,\n\n  traversed most of the cover,\n\n  and finally moved towards the woman.\n\n  Then,\n\n  it continued further.\n\n  Bai Yingying's mouth fell open.\n\n  She was shocked,\n\n  astonished.\n\n  Oh my,\n\n  it seemed she had discovered a secret clue.\n\n  It was a pen!\n\n  The pen.\n\n  Find the pen,\n\n  and she could find the boss!\n\n***\n\n**Footnotes:**\n\n1.  **Locusts on the same rope (一條繩子上的螞蚱):** A Chinese idiom meaning to be tied to the same fate; in the same boat.\n2.  **Skeletal Demon (白骨精):** Literally \"White Bone Spirit.\" A famous demon from the classic novel *Journey to the West*, who was a shapeshifting skeleton.

    "content": "Over there,\n\nBoss Zhou was still locked in a death grip with the man in the mirror;\n\nOver here,\n\nthe clever, cute, smart, and witty Yingying, loved by all people and admired by all flowers, had already discovered the clue within!\n\nShe immediately got up, went upstairs, pushed open the study door directly, and began searching on the desk.\n\nIn a typical home, the most likely place to find a pen is in the study. Of course, one could also check the children's bedroom, but since they live in a villa, wouldn't the children have their own small study?\n\nBai Yingying pondered this as she searched.\n\nHowever,\n\nThe desk was very clean.\n\nThere were no pens even in the drawers.\n\nA suicide had occurred here, and the police had come and swept through the place back and forth. Anything of value or suspicion had been taken away and sealed as material evidence.\n\nMoreover,\n\nthe family living in this villa probably had a study just for show. People don't use pens much these days; most communication is done by typing on a keyboard. So, even after Yingying had turned the entire study upside down and searched every corner, she had only found two gel pens.\n\nOne of them had a broken tip and couldn't write.\n\nPlacing the two gel pens in front of her,\n\nYingying tilted her head.\n\nShe thought it over and over, but she just couldn't believe that a pen capable of being a secretly hidden ultimate boss and the source of all the behind-the-scenes machinations,\n\nwould be reduced to such a classless state.\n\n*Crack!*\n\nYingying gave them a little tug,\n\nand both pens snapped in two.\n\nAlas,\n\nit's not you.\n\nRest in peace.\n\nLeaving the study, Yingying searched several other rooms and found that things like clothes, toys, and stationery from the children's room were all gone.\n\nYingying fell into deep thought.\n\nActually, this wasn't hard to understand. The mother had committed suicide by poison with her two children. The relatives from both sides must have taken the children's clothes and other memorable items. With no one living in the villa anymore, it would naturally appear very \"empty and clean.\"\n\nAfter searching for a long time,\n\nfrom the second floor down to the first,\n\nthis time she was even more meticulous than when she had been looking for the boss. After all, there weren't many places that could hide a person as big as the boss,\n\nbut there were many places that could hide a pen.\n\nSearching high and low,\n\naside from the two dismembered gel pens from the study,\n\nBai Yingying couldn't find a third pen.\n\nSitting back down on the sofa,\n\nBai Yingying stared at the many books on the coffee table,\n\nin a daze.\n\nThe books are here.\n\nBooks are definitely written with pens.\n\nAuthors and those people in government agencies who specialize in writing reports are both called \"wielders of the pen.\"¹\n\nBut why couldn't she find one?\n\nShe picked up a book,\n\nflipped through it,\n\nand looked at the printed text.\n\nBai Yingying wondered if this \"pen\" didn't refer to a pen in the traditional sense, but to a more modern substitute?\n\nFor example…\n\nA keyboard?\n\nFor example,\n\nA laptop?\n\nBut she had just looked and hadn't found any computer or keyboard-like things.\n\n…………\n\n\"Hey, at a time like this, could you not be so lewd?\"\n\nZhou Ze said to the man in the mirror who looked exactly like him.\n\nThat man was still roaring,\n\nstill raging,\n\nstill struggling relentlessly.\n\nYou could tell,\n\nhe had gone mad!\n\nPerhaps,\n\none day,\n\nthe way Boss Zhou would truly solve the problem of this second consciousness in his body would be to use his own intelligence to drive the other party to a point of unbearable frustration, forcing him to commit suicide.\n\n\"Fine, fine, fine…\"\n\nZhou Ze spread his hands.\n\n\"I misunderstood?\"\n\nThe man in the mirror finally stopped going crazy.\n\n\"You weren't thinking of that kind of joke.\n\nYou meant,\n\nhair?\"\n\nZhou Ze fell into contemplation.\n\n\"Something with hair?\n\nWhat left the hair?\n\nIs there a demon here?\n\nBut I don't sense any demonic aura.\"\n\nThe Zhou Ze in the mirror stared blankly,\n\nmotionless,\n\nlooking out.\n\nThen,\n\nhe simply sat down.\n\nNo sorrow is greater than a dead heart.\n\nActually, you couldn't blame Boss Zhou for this.\n\nWhat normal person would see *that* place and instantly think of a \"pen\"?\n\nHoly crap,\n\nyou see that place and you can still think of something as refined as composing poetry?\n\nAre you even a man?\n\nThe reason the neighboring Yingying could think of it so quickly was because she'd had the subconscious groundwork laid by so many books beforehand.\n\nBut Boss Zhou hadn't.\n\nHe had just dazedly fought with that crazy woman,\n\nand then gnawed on unseasoned pork ribs for a long time in the bathroom, a place not suitable for eating.\n\n\"How should I get you out now?\"\n\nZhou Ze started to change his line of thinking.\n\nIf he could let this guy out,\n\nlet him return to his body,\n\nthen he could go god mode.\n\nThen all the problems would be solved,\n\nand he could go back to the bookstore and continue living his happy and blissful life.\n\nHow wonderful!\n\nBut the man in the mirror remained motionless, looking completely uninterested in dealing with Zhou Ze anymore.\n\nIt was hard to tell if it was because there was no way,\n\nor if he just didn't want to get out at all.\n\n\"Can't you be less pessimistic?\" Zhou Ze patted the already cracked mirror surface. \"We can't give up hope.\"\n\nThe man in the mirror remained motionless.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head.\n\nForget it.\n\nHe simply pushed open the bathroom door,\n\nand walked out.\n\nOutside,\n\nit was pitch black!\n\nZhou Ze remembered turning on the lights earlier, but when he came out again, the lights were all out.\n\nAnd this blackness was thick, deep, as if a truckload of ink had been poured in.\n\nInstinctively,\n\nZhou Ze felt that something must have happened here.\n\n*Crackle…*\n\nA faint scraping sound,\n\nlike a problem with a wiring connection.\n\nIn this kind of environment, for such a sound to suddenly appear… never mind a normal person, even a Netherworld Emissary like Zhou Ze felt a little numb all over.\n\nIn the face of terror,\n\nall are equal.\n\nA Netherworld Emissary isn't afraid of ghosts,\n\nbut the most terrifying things in this world,\n\nare not actually ghosts.\n\n*Click!*\n\nIt lit up.\n\nThe TV in the living room had turned on.\n\nBlack and white static flickered continuously. Although it brought light to the dark living room, this kind of light was truly worse than none at all.\n\n………………\n\n\"Pen, where are you, where are you…\"\n\nBai Yingying cupped her fragrant cheeks with both hands, looking very distressed.\n\nActually,\n\nBai Yingying was still very smart.\n\nIn the entire bookstore,\n\nbesides her, could you find a second person who could read Japanese?\n\nEven though she was reading *The Maid's Self-Cultivation*, it was still a Japanese work, mind you.\n\nReaching out, she began flipping through the books in front of her again. That author called Ersao² had written quite a few books, but Yingying wasn't very familiar with her; she would just smile when cleaning the bookshelf every day.\n\nYingying had once heard the old Daoist priest talk about a certain Ersao from the Northeast,\n\nand also people like Mr. Qin, Mr. Zhou, and Mr. Hang.³ The old Daoist said they were all artists, currently experiencing life in prison, waiting to be released so they could create more down-to-earth works.\n\nShe remembered asking the old Daoist back then why all artists had to go to prison.\n\nThe old Daoist said it was to get closer to life. He also said that when Lu Xun was in prison, he met his cellmate Zhou Shuren, and the two later became close friends.⁴\n\nAs she flipped,\n\na book cover caught Yingying's eye.\n\nThe cover was a pen,\n\na… fountain pen!\n\nIt was very abrupt,\n\nand very plain.\n\nIt was just a single pen as the cover, with nothing else.\n\nThe book's title was *Pen Tip Nightmare*. One look and you could tell it was a ghost story.\n\nShe glanced at the summary.\n\nIt was about a person who, by accident, comes into possession of a magical pen. If he uses this pen to write stories, the events in the stories will naturally happen in reality.\n\nThe first time, he used this pen to write a horror story.\n\nThe story took place in a villa.\n\nAt night,\n\nthe power suddenly went out.\n\nHe walked to the living room in the dark, wanting to check the electricity meter.\n\nBut just then,\n\nthe television in the living room,\n\nin a state of power outage,\n\nsuddenly turned on by itself.\n\nAt first, there was only black and white static flickering on the TV,\n\nbut next,\n\nsomething very terrifying happened…………\n\n\"This summary is written pretty well.\"\n\nBai Yingying subconsciously opened the first page and started reading.\n\nThen she thought, *this isn't right*, and immediately closed the book.\n\n*Ying-ying-ying*,\n\nI'm here to find the boss,\n\nwhy am I sitting here reading a book!\n\nBut it seemed like she had to read this book to find clues about the pen. She had already searched everywhere, high and low, but couldn't find it.\n\nWith this thought,\n\nBai Yingying could only open the book again and continue reading.\n\nIn a villa late at night,\n\na high school girl,\n\nsitting in a desolate, dusty living room,\n\nreading a,\n\nghost story.\n\nThis itself was already very scary!\n\nBut Yingying felt nothing at all.\n\nThat was a given, of course.\n\nShe was a two-hundred-year-old vintage Jiangshi!⁵\n\n\"The static on the TV began to slowly disappear. I slowly backed away, because I instinctively felt that something might crawl out of the television.\n\nI wasn't paying attention,\n\nand kept backing up until I tripped myself,\n\nand fell right onto the sofa.\n\nBut my eyes were still fixed on the television.\n\nHowever,\n\nwhat I didn't expect was,\n\nthe real terror,\n\ncame from behind me…………\"\n\nYingying read aloud in a low voice as she went.\n\n……………\n\nStatic continuously flickered from the TV.\n\nZhou Ze stared intently at the television,\n\nand began to slowly back away.\n\nZhou Ze had never seen *The Ring*. In his past life, Zhou Ze was single-mindedly focused on his studies and work; he wasn't interested in this type of movie. Besides, he was a doctor. He had seen plenty of dead people, and all sorts of tragic ways to die. He had even less interest in horror movies.\n\nThis life…\n\nIn this life, he had become a ghost himself. What was the point of watching ghost movies?\n\nZhou Ze had once watched the entire Lam Ching-ying series with Yingying to save Xu Qinglang, who had been poisoned by a Jiangshi.\n\nThe result was that his sense of immersion was so strong it was like watching *The Meddlesome Ma Dajie*.⁶\n\nBut even if he hadn't seen *The Ring*, Zhou Ze knew that the lovely and sweet girl named Sadako liked to crawl out of television sets.\n\nBack away,\n\nand be on guard.\n\nMaintaining a safe distance couldn't be wrong.\n\n*Thump!*\n\nZhou Ze's knee hit the coffee table,\n\nand he instantly lost his balance and fell onto the sofa.\n\nBut Zhou Ze's gaze remained fixed on the television.\n\nHe had a feeling,\n\nit was about to come out.\n\nThe thing in the television,\n\nwas about to come out!\n\nWhat Zhou Ze didn't notice,\n\nwas that in the darkness behind him,\n\na figure,\n\nwas imperceptibly drawing near…\n\n***\n\n**Footnotes:**\n\n1.  **\"Wielders of the pen\" (笔杆子):** A common Chinese term for people skilled at writing, especially for official reports, propaganda, or other formal documents.\n2.  **Ersao (二嫂):** Literally \"Second Sister-in-law.\" This, along with the following names, are the nicknames of several infamous amateur pornographers who were arrested in China. The old Daoist's story is a dark joke.\n3.  **Mr. Qin, Mr. Zhou, Mr. Hang:** More nicknames of the individuals mentioned in the previous footnote.\n4.  **Lu Xun and Zhou Shuren:** This is a joke based on Chinese literary history. Lu Xun was the pen name of Zhou Shuren, one of modern China's most famous writers. They are the same person. The old Daoist is humorously misleading the naive Yingying.\n5.  **Jiangshi (殭屍):** A type of reanimated corpse in Chinese folklore, often translated as \"hopping vampire\" or \"zombie.\"\n6.  ***The Meddlesome Ma Dajie* (闲人马大姐):** A popular and long-running Chinese sitcom, known for its lighthearted, everyday humor.

    "content": "\"Hey, make a meal\"\n\n\n\nIn the bookstore, Xiao Luoli sat in the window where Boss Zhou liked to sit the most, holding an economic magazine in her hand and flipping through it casually.\n\n\n\nFlip through,\n\n\n\nShe's tired,\n\n\n\nSince I'm tired,\n\n\n\nYou have to eat\n\n\n\nHowever, Zhou Ze is not here in the bookstore, and the silly and cute baby girl is not here.\n\n\n\nThe chef is still in a coma.\n\n\n\nDeadpool is still in the grass.\n\n\n\nOnly the living person, the old Taoist, is left\n\n\n\nThe old Taoist curled his lips and ignored her. He was holding a bathtub to take a bath for his monkey. He ate the evening meal on the way when he came back, and it was still the guest asked by Officer Zhang.\n\n\n\nXiao Luli wanted to be angry habitually.\n\n\n\nShe felt that her life was getting back and forth.\n\n\n\nWhen Zhou Ze was in front of her, he could only be a slut, and his life and death were in his palms.\n\n\n\nAnd now,\n\n\n\nZhou Ze dared not even beat himself up\n\n\n\nReluctantly took out the phone, ordered the out-of-sale software, and prepared to order a meal\n\n\n\n\"Squeak squeak...\"\n\n\n\nThe monkey in the bathtub suddenly danced and sang\n\n\n\n\"Pan\"\n\n\n\nThe old Taoist slapped the monkey's brain, \"Take a bath, don't tamper. Do you think you will have lice on your body in the future? What a precious time. As a result, you have let the mother monkey take you to catch lice for more than half, and you don't feel panic.\"\n\n\n\nThe monkey covered his brain, feeling very aggrieved\n\n\n\nXiao Luoli put down her cell phone. She saw that outside the glass door of the bookstore, there was a white cat crawling there.\n\n\n\nThe white cat should be a wild cat, it is dirty and has several injuries\n\n\n\nAt first, Xiao Luoli didn't care, but the monkey's cry reminded her, which made her look at the white cat a few more times.\n\n\n\nLater,\n\n\n\nShe found that it was wrong\n\n\n\nGet up, walk to the door, and open the glass door\n\n\n\nBaicat raised his head, looked at Xiao Luoli, with a look of fear on his face, and subconsciously began to drag his tired body backwards\n\n\n\n\"Demon\"\n\n\n\nXiao Luli immediately lowered her waist, hugged the white cat in her arms, and then walked to the side of the bar and placed it there\n\n\n\nThe two hands grabbed the white cat's front paws, lifted it over and over, and checked it back several times. The cat's face was red, looking very shy.\n\n\n\n\"It's mother\"\n\n\n\nXiao Luli has a slight eyebrow\n\n\n\n\"What kind of monster is this? She is obviously a fox.\"\n\n\n\nThe old Taoist wiped the monkey and walked over. He glanced at the white cat on the bar and said directly.\n\n\n\n  \"fox\"\n\n\n\n\"Yes, fox, but the tail was cut off. It's so strange. Do you have to participate in the selection like Corgi this year? \"\n\n\n\nThe white fox looked over the head, looked at the old man, grinned, revealing his teeth, making a \"hiss\" sound, with a threatening intention\n\n\n\n\"Squeak squeak\"\n\n\n\nThe monkey that was washed clean and fragrant spray jumped onto the corner immediately and glared at the fox.\n\n\n\nThe old Taoist catalog was thinking, as if he had thought of something, and immediately squatted down, looked at the fox on the cage, and said in confusion:\n\n\n\n\"House\"\n\n\n\nThe fox clicked the head\n\n\n\n\"Mom\"\n\n\n\nThe old Taoist was so surprised that he took a few steps back, and he fell to the ground.\n\n\n\n\"I've been hurt, I've been wiped out, my tail is gone. What are you afraid of? \"Little Rose looked at the old saying disdainfully, pointed to the white fox in front of me and said, \"You want to simmer or steam or even more decisive. If you come directly, she can only let you do it.\"\n\n\n\nThe white fox looked at Xiao Luoli with a look of praying\n\n\n\nFoxes are the best at being human.\n\n\n\nPeople often call those old people who have lived long and rich life philosophy... the old fox is the same.\n\n\n\nThe fox knew that in this bookstore, whom he needed to check out now\n\n\n\nIn fact,\n\n\n\nShe actually had no place to go, and after a long time of wandering away, she had to lower her head and found this bookstore, hoping to join Zhou Ze.\n\n\n\nBut who knows,\n\n\n\nShe came by unfortunately.\n\n\n\nBoss Zhou is not in the store at this time.\n\n\n\nThere is a little girl in the store.\n\n\n\nBut this little girl won't have two eyes for something cute.\n\n\n\n\"I gave her a bath and her body was so smelly. She was coming to find Zhou Cheng, so let her wait.\"\n\n\n\nXiao Luoli finally decided not to interfere in the matter. Anyway, Zhou Ze's fish had this kind of collection habit, and liked to collect all kinds of things from where she lives.\n\n\n\n  \"bath\"\n\n\n\nThe old Taoist was stunned for a moment, then left\n\n\n\nThe fox was scared and retreated constantly.\n\n\n\nAlthough this fox is not wearing clothes or anything else, it is almost naked, but then letting the old Taoist take a bath after seeing and letting the old Taoist help him take a bath are two completely different concepts\n\n\n\n A fox demon who has been practicing for more than a hundred years has to be called his ancestor by small characters in the clan. She could even have sex with Yuan Shikai overnight. How could the old Taoist have been able to bury his body like this\n\n \n\nThe thought of his body turning into a wool chicken after entering the water will be witnessed by this old man.\n\n\n\nThe foxes are only one thousand and ten thousand unwilling\n\n\n\nThe old man actually dared not.\n\n\n\nMom,\n\n\n\nThis is a fox demon\n\n\n\nShe had repaired herself at the beginning. Even if the phoenix with hair plucked is not as good as a chicken, who can confirm that this goods can no longer be restored in the future\n\n\n\nUnless you give her a meal now and let her GG in a final way, the old Taoist will never dare to replenish her.\n\n\n\n\"Absolutely, you go, how about I'll buy you a meal?\" The old Taoist said to Xiao Luli\n\n\n\nXiao Luoli's unwillingness to face\n\n\n\n\"The boss is very interested in her. He was in the club, hehe\"\n\n\n\nThe old Taoist said and shook his eyes at the fox.\n\n\n\nThanksgiving was also revealed in the fox's eyes\n\n\n\nShe knew that this old man was adding a play to himself and pulling tiger skin to make a coat\n\n\n\n\"Zhou Ze\"\n\n\n\nXiao Luoli looked at the old Taoist suspiciously,\n\n\n\nIt's clearly asking,\n\n\n\nZhou Ze has the ability to \"interest\"\n\n\n\n\"Thousands of truths and thousands of correct\"\n\n\n\nThe old Taoist patted his chest.\n\n\n\n\"So, you're a little tired, please help her take care of it.\"\n\n\n\n\"How do I feel like you are fooling me?\"\n\n\n\nIf Zhou Ze really likes this fox demon, then as a subordinate, he should show her goodwill for the local government and take a bath, it is nothing\n\n\n\n\"How dare I cheat you? You think,\n\n\n\nThe boss is not interested in the corpse.\n\n\n\nNot interested in men.\n\n\n\nNot interested in the daughters.\n\n\n\nHe must be interested in something.\"\n\n\n\n\"So, he is interested in demons.\"\n\n\n\n\"That's right? Look at that eighth aunt. When the boss and her had no grudges, why did they take her away? I understand why they wanted to take her away?\"\n\n\n\nXiao Luli's eyes were filled with shock\n\n\n\nThis truth,\n\n\n\nVery scary\n\n\n\nAfter the old Taoist said that, he was also shocked.\n\n\n\nLook back subconsciously,\n\n\n\nHuh,\n\n\n\n  It's not bad,\n\n\n\nThis time the boss did not suddenly appear behind him like a ghost\n\n\n\nHey,\n\n\n\nNo,\n\n\n\nThe boss was originally a ghost\n\n\n\nXiao Luli shook her head,\n\n\n\nCarrying the fox into the sanitation room\n\n\n\nThe old Taoist slapped the monkey and sat behind the bar. After helping Xiao Luoli order a seller, he put peanuts and white wine on his own, and drank one by one with the monkey and I drank one by one.\n\n\n\nAs for the old man, working in a bookstore is quite old.\n\n\n\nIn the first place, he chose to follow a boss in Rongcheng, so that he could experience the excitement of ghosts every few days.\n\n\n\nThis time, he stayed in the bookstore with Zhou Ze, but did not follow Tang Feng and others to Shanghai. In fact, he knew that he was old and tired. He was jogging and walked to the south and north.\n\n\n\nSeen by the big wind and waves,\n\n\n\nPeople's hearts have been seen,\n\n\n\nGhosts have seen it,\n\n\n\nJust thinking about being at ease\n\n\n\nIn this \"Fishing House\",\n\n\n\n  oh,\n\n\n\nNo,\n\n\n\nIn this \"Late Night Book House\",\n\n\n\nHe can get the greatest peace, not boring, but not tired. He can read the sunset of his life happily, and he will have to\n\n\n\n\"Squeak squeak\"\n\n\n\nThe monkey suddenly started to scream\n\n\n\nThe old Taoist narrowed his eyes because of drinking, took out the cow's eyes, wiped it, and saw an old man standing at the door, a man and a woman\n\n\n\nMen and women helped each other and walked inThe old Taoist stood up and signaled them to come in. Then he went to the back and prepared a few cold plates and placed them on the small wooden table wrapped in it, and poured three glasses of rice wine.\n\n\n\nThe old couple sat down at the small table.\n\n\n\nOld Taoist,\n\n\n\nDrink slowly with them\n\n\n\nEveryone is chatting about homework.\n\n\n\nSpeaking of some of the words that this age of talent association said\n\n\n\nThe times are changing,\n\n\n\nPeople are also changing.\n\n\n\n As you get old, you get old\n\n\n\nThe old Taoist talked to them for a long time.\n\n\n\nI only realized that the old man died eight days ago, and the old lady died one day after the old man died.\n\n\n\nThe old man is waiting for the old lady,\n\n\n\nThe old lady is chasing the old man,\n\n\n\nAfter the old lady passed the seventh year of her head,\n\n\n\nThe two elders work together,\n\n\n\nWalk forward together,\n\n\n\nWalking,\n\n\n\nThen I walked to the door of the bookstore\n\n\n\nThe old Taoist talked to them about the past.\n\n\n\nListen to them talking about children,\n\n\n\nListen to them talking about Xuezi,\n\n\n\nListen to the house they lived in before and the house they are now living in\n\n\n\nThe old Taoist has no children, but he also listens with relish. He keeps pouring dried tea or peanuts into his mouth and chews it slowly\n\n\n\nI continued to drink twice,\n\n\n\nPeanuts are also seen.\n\n\n\nAt this time,\n\n\n\nThe door of the sanitation room was pushed open,\n\n\n\nXiao Luli walked out with the white fox that had washed and dried her hair.\n\n\n\nXiao Luoli really disliked the environment of this bookstore.\n\n\n\nIt's a monkey and a fox,\n\n\n\nIt's just like an animal garden.\n\n\n\nAnd one person cherishes protection animals, and the person who is cheap and not illegal is not very good at taking over.\n\n\n\nMaybe things like the Big Bear, Cat, Siberian Tiger will appear in the book house in the future.\n\n\n\nPut down the fox,\n\n\n\nXiao Luoli walked to the bag and reached out to knock on the door.\n\n\n\n\"You've eaten and drank well, you're on the way.\"\n\n\n\nThe old lady got up together and said goodbye to the old Taoist\n\n\n\n\"Brother, sister-in-law, go away\"\n\n\n\nThe old man also stole the enemy from them\n\n\n\nXiao Luli opened her mouth,\n\n\n\nSpit out the tongue,\n\n\n\nThe carpet that looked like a meaty red color went away,\n\n\n\n\"The sect is orderly, and the yellow spring can be crossed...\"\n\n\n\nThe old man and the old lady were holding hands,\n\n\n\nThey supported and walked past most of the bushes.\n\n\n\nNow we have to continue to support and continue to move forward.\n\n\n\nThe road is still long,\n\n\n\nCan you still walk for a long time\n\n\n\nAfter I sent the two of them down,\n\n\n\nXiao Luoli withdrew her tongue.\n\n\n\nA little happy,\n\n\n\nA little excited,\n\n\n\nWhile Boss Zhou is away,\n\n\n\nSecretly done a business,\n\n\n\nThe score is still yours.\n\n\n\nHappyWhen I knead the fox's fur with my back, it became much gentler than before when I was taking a shower.\n\n\n\nThe old Taoist sighed and sat back behind the corner.\n\n\n\nStart drinking continuously\n\n\n\nThe monkey jumped onto the old Taoist's shoulder.\n\n\n\n  Hit him to his shoulder\n\n\n\n\"The surname Zhou won't come back tonight,\" Xiao Luli asked\n\n\n\n\"Oh, I guess it's right, I went to the two-person world with Bao Bao.\"\n\n\n\n\"Fishing fish is fish.

    "content": "PS: (A solemn announcement: Everyone, please feel free to post chapter bullet comments and roast the hell out of it! There are too few comments right now, and Long is getting frustrated because there's nothing for me to copy!)\n\n***\n\nThe static on the TV screen continued to flicker, as if foreshadowing something.\n\nAll around was absolute darkness and a scalp-numbing, dead silence.\n\nZhou Ze sat on the sofa,\nstaring intently at the TV screen.\n\nThis was probably how any normal person would react in this situation, and Boss Zhou was no exception.\n\nAnd just then,\n\na hand\n\nreached out from behind\n\nand rested on Zhou Ze's shoulder.\n\nIt was utterly abrupt,\nwithout the slightest bit of buildup.\n\nThe person on the sofa had their attention fixed on the television, completely unprepared for anything to happen behind them.\n\nZhou Ze's body tensed instantly. He whipped around, grabbed it, and threw it forward!\n\nIt was instinct, I suppose, the stress reaction of a person in a sudden situation. Besides, Boss Zhou was a man who had seen a thing or two, and he had just eaten so many pork ribs. Naturally, he wouldn't be so scared as to run away screaming with his hands over his head.\n\nHowever, after exerting his strength, Zhou Ze's body tilted, and he almost threw himself to the ground.\n\nBecause what Zhou Ze held was just a hand. It had no arm, torso, or any other parts attached. It was just a hand. It was as if all the force Zhou Ze had just exerted had been thrown at a ball of cotton.\n\nThis was a woman's hand, with fine lines and visible capillaries. It even had a ring on one finger.\n\nBoss Zhou wasn't frightened by this scene at all.\n\nInstead, he brought the hand in front of him and began to examine it closely.\n\nHe even took the initiative to hook his finger around its ring finger, then traced a line across its palm,\nas if he were flirting,\nor perhaps trying to communicate.\n\nIn the silent, dark night,\na young man sat on the sofa in a villa's living room,\nscrutinizing a disembodied hand.\nThe scene\nwas enough to make one's heart palpitate.\n\nThankfully, Boss Zhou wasn't a purely ordinary person. Especially when it came to \"fear,\" as someone who had once walked the Road to the Underworld, his resistance was very, very high.\n\nThe problem now wasn't whether he would be scared to death or killed,\nbut how he was supposed to get out of here.\n\nA White Bone Spirit had already come to pick a fight with him. He'd rather not have some other random monstrosity pop up later.\n\nPlacing the hand's fingers on his own palm, Zhou Ze hoped it would move, maybe write something, and leave him some kind of message.\n\nWhat are your demands? What injustice have you suffered?\n\nOut with it, quickly.\n\nThis official...\n\nEr,\n\nthis bailiff will see that justice is done for you!\n\nWith his extensive experience greeting all sorts of visitors at the bookstore, this was the natural direction for Zhou Ze's thoughts to take.\n\nGenerally speaking, when the dead linger in the world of the living, it's because of some obsession. Those delusional types who don't want to die, screaming \"I'll become the Ghost King and cultivate immortality!\" usually can't even become ghosts. After they die, they don't even need a psychopomp to escort them; they obediently head to Hell for rebirth on their own.\n\nZhou Ze's bookstore had plenty of books like that, but in his own experience, Zhou Ze had never met a ghost who wanted to \"unify Hell\" and become the Ghost King.\n\nHowever,\nthe hand still didn't react.\n\nZhou Ze patted the hand, then set it on the coffee table and gave it a shake. This hand was like a dead pig that doesn't fear boiling water; it completely ignored him.\n\nIf you're so goddamn \"placid as still water,\"\nthen what the hell did you come out for?\n\n...\n\n\"So much buildup, so much filler, it's so padded... so boring, *sob sob sob*...\"\n\nOver here,\nBai Yingying was flipping through the book *Pen-tip Nightmare*.\n\nIn *A Chinese Odyssey*, even the wick of the lamp at Buddha's side could become a sentient spirit.\nSo, as a zombie working in a bookstore,\nshe might not be a great scholar,\nbut she was at least well-read.\n\nAs for this kind of novel, Yingying had really read quite a few. Back in her lifetime during the Qing Dynasty, Madam Bai had enjoyed secretly reading novels, but they were considered licentious books back then, a low-class form of literature.\n\nTwo hundred years had passed. Although such literature was still considered low-class in the eyes of some who thought themselves high-brow, at least it could now be openly displayed and sold on bookstore shelves.\n\nThis book,\nhow should she put it...\nThe initial buildup was good.\nThe synopsis was well-written.\nBut after that,\nit was just so padded!\n\nSo padded that Bai Yingying felt like throwing up.\n\nSeriously,\nwhy so much description of appearances?\nWhy so much internal monologue?\nWhy so much environmental setup?\nWhy don't you just f*cking tell me what's going to appear!\n\nBesides, they were supposed to be looking for a pen. Who had time to read your made-up ghost stories? If I wanted to see a ghost story, I might as well just watch myself or the boss!\n\nAt this thought,\nViolent Ying directly reached out and ripped out several pages in a row.\n\nTake that for being padded!\nTake that for dragging it out!\nTake that for word-stuffing!\n\n\"*Riiip.*\"\n\nHear that sound?\nI'm ripping it!\n\nThe part Bai Yingying tore out happened to be where the dark figure appeared and a hand landed on the protagonist's shoulder.\nConsequently, the contents of the next few pages were torn away.\n\nYingying's strength was terrifying. She crushed the torn pages in her hand, and they turned to dust.\n\nThis led to a very awkward problem.\nThe plot in the place where Boss Zhou was,\nafter being violently torn by Yingying,\nwas now fragmented!\n\nBecause after Yingying tore out the pages, right after the story described the hand landing on the protagonist's shoulder,\nthat very hand was now cursing its fate!\n\nThe hand: \"Who am I? What am I doing? Where am I going?\"\n\nSomeone please tell me,\nwhat am I supposed to do now?\nHow am I supposed to continue this act?\n\nSo it wasn't the hand's fault that Boss Zhou looked like a moron, fiddling with it for ages while it remained unresponsive.\nThe truth was, the hand was just as confused.\n\nIt was only supposed to be the first one to appear.\nAfter it came the arm,\nthen the shoulder,\nthen the body,\nthen the terrifying silhouette.\nNow, it was all alone.\n\n...\n\n\"Where's the pen, where's the pen, where's my pen?\"\nYingying muttered as she flipped through the book, violently tearing as she went.\n\nShe needed to find clues about the pen.\nSo she had no time to read slowly. She just skimmed, and whenever she hit a useless plot point, she'd immediately rip out two pages.\n\nFortunately, in this day and age, a physical novel was considered a short one. The book looked thick, but it was only two or three hundred thousand words.\n\nIf it were one of today's monumental epics of ten or twenty million words,\nYingying probably wouldn't be tearing it. She'd never finish. She'd have to burn it!\n\n...\n\nBoss Zhou put the hand down,\nfumbled in his pocket,\nand lit a cigarette.\n\nHe took a deep drag,\nand exhaled a smoke ring.\n\nDamn it,\nwhat the hell kind of place was this?\n\n\"Meow!\"\n\nA cat's cry came from above.\n\nZhou Ze shot to his feet and looked up, his fingernails instantly growing long again. Although his pinky nail was already broken, this was still Zhou Ze's best method of defense.\n\nAt the same time, the armor he had just retracted back into his body reappeared. The armor couldn't be kept out all the time, or it would be like constantly draining \"mana,\" and his body would quickly be depleted.\nHe could only summon it for emergencies.\n\nBut the next scene\nleft Boss Zhou completely dumbfounded.\n\nA dead cat,\nwith a rope dangling from its neck,\nswung down,\ndangling back and forth in front of Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze remained on high alert,\nfacing off against the dead cat for a good twenty minutes.\nBy the end, Zhou Ze's eyes were sore, and his feet were even getting numb.\n\nHe finally confirmed one thing:\nThis dead cat\nwas really just a dead cat.\n\nA cat that, for some reason—maybe its cat-wife had run off with another stray—couldn't take it anymore and hanged itself.\nBefore it died,\nit had let out one last, unwilling cry,\nas if screaming, \"I can't go on!\"\nThen it died.\n\nThe corner of Zhou Ze's mouth began to twitch.\n\nWhat the hell...\nWhat in the world was this!\nFor f*ck's sake!\n\nEven if you're trying to be mysterious,\neven if you're trying to build suspense,\ncan't you be a little more f*cking professional about it?!\n\nYou throw out a hand,\nyou bring out a dead cat,\nwhat are you trying to do?!\nAnd then?\nThen nothing!\n\nAre you trying to make me scare myself to death with my own imagination?\n\nRespect\nis a two-way street!\n\n\"*Click... clack... click... clack...*\"\n\nAs if hearing Zhou Ze's complaints,\nand as if in response to his dissatisfaction,\nthe staticky television, which had played such a major role earlier, began to change.\n\nThe black and white static on the screen turned blood-red.\nThen,\nit was as if red blood began to drip from the television,\nstaining the carpet,\nand slowly starting to spread.\n\nThe living room filled with the thick, nauseating stench of blood.\n\nNext,\na man, his skin flayed and his body bound in chains, slowly grew larger inside the TV. Then, he reached out his hand, grabbing the edge of the television's frame, and began to pull his body out.\n\nHe had horns on his head,\nhis skin was blood-red,\nwith patches of bruised purple.\nHe looked like a demon crawling out of Hell.\nExcept, where Doraemon might pop out of a drawer, this one was climbing out of a television set.\n\nZhou Ze's breathing slowly grew ragged. Although this was a model of demon he, a genuine psychopomp from Hell, had never seen before, the aura it radiated was on a whole other level compared to the White Bone Spirit from earlier.\n\nTo be honest,\nwithout that consciousness in his body to help him cheat,\nBoss Zhou couldn't help but feel a little unnerved and intimidated when facing this kind of opponent.\n\nLife with cheats was pretty great, after all. At least you had some confidence.\n\nOn high alert,\npoised to strike,\nhe watched his opponent patiently.\n\nThe demon leered at Zhou Ze as it\nslowly began to emerge from the TV.\nFirst the head,\nthen the neck,\nthen the shoulders...\n\n...\n\n\"How long are you gonna f*cking pad out a ghost climbing out of a TV...\nI need to see the pen!\nI need the pen!\"\n\n\"*Riiip! Riiip!*\"\n\nViolent Ying decisively tore out more pages.\n\n...\n\n\"Come on, I'm waiting for you,\" Zhou Ze thought to himself, his eyes glued to the figure that was already halfway out of the TV.\n\nDeep breath.\nCalm his emotions.\nAdjust his state.\nCome on.\nCome on...\n\nHowever,\nsuddenly, it was like watching an old, scratched VCD.\nThe demon climbing out of the TV suddenly slowed down, and it started spasming rapidly, like a glitchy, repeating video.\n\n\"Beep-beep-beep-beep... boop-boop-boop... Beep-beep-beep-beep... boop-boop-boop-boop...\"\n\nIt would crawl out a little, then retract a little,\nback and forth,\nstuttering like it was having a seizure.\n\nFinally,\nwith a loud \"CLUNK!\"\nthe demon, half in and half out of the TV, went completely still.\nIts head lolled to one side.\nIts mouth hung open.\nIts tongue rolled out.\n\nHe had...\ngotten stuck and died!\n\n\"...\" Boss Zhou.",

    "content": "Boss Zhou felt like he was going crazy.\n\nFirst, there was the White Bone Spirit.\n\nShe was originally a very normal female author, but then she suddenly turned into a lunatic.\n\nBut at least her lunacy had an explanation; it wasn't completely incomprehensible.\n\nAnd she did carry her mission through to completion.\n\nShe appeared.\n\nShe hacked at herself with a knife.\n\nAnd her bones were really damn hard!\n\nBut she saw it through from beginning to end.\n\nShe was worth the price of her walk-on role.\n\nShe was diligent and conscientious.\n\nShe was still twitching in a cramped corner of the bathroom right now!\n\nEven if the camera wasn't on her, she continued to twitch away, displaying the highest degree of professionalism.\n\nBut what the fuck was up with this hand?\n\nWhat the fuck was up with that hanged cat?\n\nAnd this was even more ridiculous.\n\nThe build-up was so incredible.\n\nIt had all the makings of a final boss entrance.\n\nThe lighting,\n\nthe special effects,\n\nthe fake blood,\n\nthe cost,\n\nthe spectacle,\n\nso much had been spent on it,\n\nonly for it to freeze inside the TV like there was a power outage.\n\nAre you here for comedic relief?!\n\nEven the haunted house at an amusement park is more professional than you!\n\nBut Boss Zhou had clearly misjudged the situation.\n\nNext,\n\nan ironclad fact began to prove to him that,\n\nwhen it comes to comedy,\n\nthere is no lower limit!\n\nBeyond the absurd,\n\nthere is only the more absurd!\n\nA whole bunch of snakes suddenly rushed out from inside the sofa.\n\nBoss Zhou hadn't noticed them at all before.\n\nBut as soon as these snakes came out, they started to explode.\n\nOne after another, they self-detonated.\n\nIt was as if they’d had enough of life and had come out for a group suicide.\n\nThe scene was truly bloody and tragic!\n\nBoss Zhou was splattered with snake blood again and again,\n\nstanding there, dumbfounded.\n\nAfter that,\n\na giant centipede crawled out from under the carpet. The centipede reared up, but then, as if it had a spinal problem, its body tilted sideways,\n\nand it just died!\n\nAfter that,\n\nghostly figures began to appear on the walls,\n\ncreating a terrifying atmosphere.\n\nBut then, for some reason,\n\nthe lights suddenly turned on by themselves.\n\nAfter letting out blood-curdling screams,\n\nthe ghostly figures collectively vanished into thin air!\n\nAnd then there was... and... and...\n\nBoss Zhou was like a spectator,\n\nstanding in the middle of the living room,\n\nwatching this troupe of ghosts.\n\nOne would finish its act, and the next would take the stage.\n\nThere was no need for Boss Zhou to lift a finger.\n\nThey played themselves to death all on their own.\n\nBy the end,\n\nwhen a new ghost appeared,\n\nBoss Zhou wasn't the least bit nervous.\n\nHe even started to guess how this ghost would manage to kill itself.\n\nScore ten points for myself if I guess right!\n\nBoss Zhou swore,\n\neven since becoming an Emissary of Hell,\n\nhe had never seen so many bizarre ghosts and ghouls all in one day.\n\nEach was unique,\n\neach was different,\n\nand even their methods of self-mutilation and suicide,\n\nwere all creative and new!\n\n...\n\n\"Damn it, have you no shame!\n\nDon't you have any basic scientific knowledge!\n\nYou're a villa,\n\nwhere did you get so many ghosts!\n\nAnd one after another,\n\ndo you think you're *Journey to the West* or something?!\"\n\nBai Yingying grumbled as she ripped.\n\nA ghost appeared, she ripped. The next ghost appeared, she kept ripping!\n\nIn any case, she was manually speeding things up,\n\nmaking all the useless plot points just *snip*!\n\nAs she ripped and ripped,\n\nBai Yingying stopped.\n\nHuh,\n\nthis one seemed a little different:\n\n\"I don't know why I'm seeing so many ghosts in this villa, so many unbelievable things, as if my home has turned into *Night at the Museum*.\n\nJust as I was running and hiding with my head in my hands time after time, as I screamed in terror time after time with no one to hear me, as I was on the verge of a mental breakdown,\n\nthe shadow behind me,\n\nslowly began to stand up.\n\nIn its hand,\n\nit was holding a pen,\n\na fountain pen.\n\nIt seemed to be writing something, and it also seemed to be smiling at me...\"\n\n\"Emmm... the pen is finally here.\"\n\nBai Yingying finally stopped her book-tearing operation and began to read seriously.\n\nUnfortunately, this was a physical book.\n\nIf it were an electronic version,\n\nYingying could have just done a Ctrl+F,¹\n\nand a quick search for \"pen\" would have made everything clear.\n\nAs it was, her hands were sore from all the ripping!\n\n...\n\nBoss Zhou smoked his cigarette,\n\nsmiling as he watched the clouds roll by,\n\nthe very picture of transcendent detachment.\n\nIt was just as the Richie Jen song goes, \"One wave has yet to subside, another comes crashing in...\"\n\nWave after wave after wave, Boss Zhou had grown numb.\n\nAfter the previous ghost brother had offed himself in yet another inexplicable way,\n\nZhou Ze flicked the ash from his cigarette.\n\nHe watched as his own shadow, which had appeared on the floor when the lights came on, slowly began to rise up, turning from a 2D shape into a 3D figure.\n\nBro!\n\nHow are you going to play yourself to death?\n\nZhou Ze wondered to himself.\n\nThen,\n\nZhou Ze saw,\n\nthe thing the shadow was holding in its hand,\n\na... fountain pen!\n\nPen?\n\nA pen?\n\nThe Pen?\n\nIn an instant,\n\nit was as if Zhou Ze had figured something out!\n\nHoly shit,\n\nthis is the key to breaking out!\n\nZhou Ze immediately reached out to grab the pen.\n\nHe had the Book of Yin and Yang,\n\nand the corresponding item to the Book of Yin and Yang,\n\nwas the Judge's Brush!\n\nCould it be,\n\nthat this was the Judge's Brush, lost in the mortal world?\n\nThat's right.\n\nZhou Ze recalled his first encounter with the Book of Yin and Yang.\n\nOnly the Judge's Brush could possess a similar ability, and in terms of its power to affect reality, it was a cut above!\n\nHowever,\n\nthis shadow didn't obediently commit suicide.\n\nWhen Zhou Ze pounced,\n\nit started to actively run away.\n\nAs it ran, it let out a high-pitched, squeaky voice, like a man pinching his throat:\n\n\"Hehehe, come and get me, hehehe, come and get me, get me, get me...\"\n\nThe voice was disgusting,\n\ncarrying a hint of flirtation.\n\nWhat made it even more unbearable for Zhou Ze was that,\n\nthe shadow's original voice,\n\nwas his own!\n\nDamn it,\n\nthis is so,\n\nso mortifying!\n\nThe shadow ran to the second floor, and Zhou Ze chased it to the second floor.\n\nThe shadow ran to the first floor, and Zhou Ze chased it to the first floor.\n\nThe villa wasn't massive,\n\nbut it certainly wasn't small either.\n\nBoss Zhou and this shadow began a game of cat and mouse inside the villa.\n\nIn the end,\n\nthe shadow turned directly into the bedroom.\n\nBoss Zhou kicked open the bedroom door,\n\nand found his own shadow lying on the bed, beckoning to him.\n\n\"Come on, handsome, come and play, handsome...\"\n\nIt was still his own voice.\n\nThat sound made the veins in the corners of Zhou Ze's eyes pop.\n\nHowever,\n\njust as Zhou Ze couldn't stop himself from pouncing,\n\nthe world suddenly spun around him. Zhou Ze felt his entire body being flipped back and forth, like an ant trapped in a glass bottle that was being shaken relentlessly.\n\nThe shadow was the same, tumbling up and down, left and right.\n\nIt was as if the two of them were on a bus, and the bus had just driven off a cliff.\n\n...\n\n\"Where's the pen? Are you kidding me! Taking this long to catch a shadow, are you sick in the head?!\"\n\nYingying was furious.\n\nMy god,\n\nhow does a book like this even get published?\n\nAny book touching on the supernatural is very difficult to publish, as it can easily stray into the forbidden zone of \"promoting feudal superstition,\" or someone who's jealous of you might deliberately use that topic to cause trouble.\n\nTherefore, even in the bookstore, published horror novels on the shelves were a rarity among rarities.\n\nBut this *Nightmare at the Nib's Tip*,\n\nsince you got published, you lucky bastard,\n\nyou should be counting your blessings.\n\nHow dare you pad it out with so much filler!\n\n\"Rip! Rip! Rip!!!!!!!!!!\"\n\nYingying began tearing furiously.\n\nThis time she was ruthless.\n\nShe ripped straight to the very last page.\n\nBecause Yingying had figured out the author's formula: the beginning was all setup, all nonsense. All she needed to do was read the end, to see where the pen ended up or where it was placed!\n\nAnd just like that,\n\nYingying had an epiphany.\n\nSo that's how you read such a thick book.\n\nYou just need to read the first page and the last page,\n\nand you're done.\n\n...\n\nThe plot accelerated.\n\nIt accelerated to an insane degree.\n\nZhou Ze found himself in the living room one moment, the bedroom the next, and then the bathroom. In short, he was being rotated through various locations, without a moment's rest.\n\nFinally,\n\nas if a director had yelled \"Cut!\",\n\nZhou Ze stopped.\n\nThe shadow stopped too.\n\nHe and it were standing together on the balcony. The shadow had been relentlessly cornered and crushed by him, finally reaching a dead end. Here, a \"hundred thousand words\" of summary were omitted.\n\nBecause not even Zhou Ze had time to see clearly what exactly had happened during this fast-forwarded sequence, but in any case, a lot had definitely happened.\n\nAfter stopping,\n\nZhou Ze didn't rush to grab the pen.\n\nThe shadow didn't rush to dodge either.\n\nZhou Ze squatted down and began to dry-heave. Damn, he was dizzy from all the spinning.\n\nThe shadow was also swaying, clearly not feeling too great either.\n\nAfter resting for a moment,\n\nZhou Ze reached for the pen.\n\nThe shadow released its hand, and the pen fell into Zhou Ze's grasp.\n\n\"Got it!\"\n\nJoy welled up in Zhou Ze's heart.\n\nBut the shadow laughed.\n\nIt laughed very happily.\n\nLike a girl whose little scheme has succeeded, playfully tapping you on the chest,\n\ncomplaining about how you ignore her, how you won't play with her,\n\nabout how you used to call her Little Sweetie and now you call her Mrs. Niu...²\n\n\"Okay, I've got the pen.\"\n\nZhou Ze muttered to himself.\n\nThis way,\n\nI should be able to get out.\n\nLooking at the shadow, which was squatting there, laughing so hard it was out of breath,\n\nZhou Ze frowned slightly and said:\n\n\"How do I get out?\"\n\nYes,\n\nhow on earth do I leave this place?\n\n\"I already gave you the pen. You call the shots now.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n...\n\nBai Yingying finished reading the last page.\n\n\"I asked the shadow, now that I have the pen, how do I leave this place? I have my beloved waiting for me outside, I can't be trapped here forever.\n\nI want to get out.\n\nI need to get out.\n\nI must get out!\n\nBut the shadow just smiled at me, saying it had already given me the pen.\n\nAnd then...\"\n\nThis ellipsis was not really an ellipsis.\n\nIt was that the last sentence, of the last paragraph, of the last page, of the last chapter of the book,\n\nwas literally \"And then...\"\n\nBai Yingying's eyes widened.\n\nShe stared at the last sentence,\n\nthe hand holding the book trembling slightly.\n\nThen,\n\nshe flipped the book over to the back cover.\n\nAfter a careful search,\n\nshe finally discovered a detail she hadn't noticed before:\n\n\"*Nightmare at the Nib's Tip*... Part 1.\"\n\nThe character for \"Part 1\" was incredibly small, almost unnoticeable, unless you were specifically looking for it.\n\n\"Ying ying ying...\n\nWhat do I do?\n\nThis book,\n\nonly has a Part 1,\n\nthere's no Part 2...\"\n\n...\n\nThe shadow looked at Zhou Ze, still smiling, and pointed a finger at him.\n\n\"Come on, come on.\n\nThe pen is yours.\n\nYou write it...\"\n\n---\n¹ **Footnote:** In the original Chinese, this is a phonetic pun. The characters used for \"Ctrl+F\" sound like *kāng qiū jiā ài fǔ*, which literally translates to \"Control plus caress.\"\n\n² **Footnote:** \"You used to call her Little Sweetie and now you call her Mrs. Niu\" is a famous line from the Stephen Chow film *A Chinese Odyssey*, used to describe someone who has become fickle after finding a new favorite.",

    "content": "This pen, held in the hand, was very light. Even an exaggerated metaphor like \"light as a feather\" wasn't quite accurate at this moment. If he couldn't actually feel its touch, Zhou Ze might have mistaken what he was holding for a puff of air.\n\nThe shadow seemed to start getting cocky, endlessly circling and leaping around Zhou Ze…\n\n\"Stop spinning, I'm getting dizzy.\"\n\nBut the shadow ignored Zhou Ze's warning.\n\nIt even doubled down.\n\nJumping over here one moment,\n\nJumping over there the next.\n\n\"I jumped out,\n\nAnd I jumped back in,\n\nCome and get me,\n\nYou idiot!\"\n\nBoss Zhou rubbed his forehead.\n\nThis character before him was definitely being a smartass.\n\nBut its tone and voice were identical to his own.\n\nThis feeling made Boss Zhou feel as if he were being a smartass to himself in a mirror.\n\n\"So, this place… is a story? The world inside a book?\"\n\nZhou Ze asked.\n\n\"So, in your view, this world is just a big flatbread?\n\nThe front of the flatbread is the world of the living,\n\nAnd the back of the flatbread with the sesame seeds is the underworld?\" the shadow retorted.\n\nZhou Ze didn't answer.\n\n\"The ancients believed that 'the heavens are round and the earth is square' was absolute truth. That's why during the late Qing Dynasty, many wealthy officials and rich old men brought about their own doom by buying telescopes from foreigners. When they saw the vastness of the universe, their worldviews collapsed, and they chose to commit suicide.\n\n\"Giordano Bruno proposed the heliocentric model and was burned at the stake as a heretic.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"I mean this world isn't as simple as you imagine. The paths of Yin and Yang are two distinct roads, but alongside these two roads are countless side roads. Because they are rarely trodden, not many know of them, and even fewer dare to walk them.\n\n\"This world isn't a flatbread.\n\n\"It's not to say that everything detached from reality is an illusion.\n\n\"Not everything that isn't real is therefore fake.\n\n\"It's like watching old TV shows, where the only labels for characters are 'good guy' or 'bad guy.'\n\n\"No matter where you are, no matter on what level, black and white are often just a small part. The gray is what makes up the majority.\"\n\n\"Oh.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\nThen,\n\nHe continued to look at the pen in his hand.\n\n\"Is this the pen for writing the story?\"\n\n\"The so-called story in the book is nothing more than a side road off the paths of Yin and Yang. And this pen is the signpost to find that side road.\n\n\"The pen is in your hand, so you can naturally look at the signpost to find your way. Of course, with this pen, you can only find the way once. Next time you want to come in, it'll be impossible.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because this pen is a pen from within the book. It's a pen left behind because this story, this book, was eunuch-ed¹, but it's not the real pen. Do you get what I mean?\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head.\n\n\"It means the real pen isn't here, but you can use this fake pen to find the way out for now.\"\n\nThe shadow let out a sigh.\n\n\"Don't mind my chattering. I've been so incredibly bored all these years.\n\n\"A few years ago, a woman with two kids came to play with me for a while.\n\n\"But later, they couldn't stand the torment of not knowing what was real and what was false.\n\n\"They couldn't see a way out.\n\n\"The mother took her two kids and committed suicide with them.\"\n\nWhen the shadow said this, it even seemed a little sad and regretful, as if it weren't the murderer.\n\nOf course,\n\nZhang Tianquan and her two children were not, in fact, murdered by it. They died by poison. And in the eyes of the public, it was one thing for Zhang Tianquan to die herself, but taking her two children with her was a great sin. As a parent, you have no right to arbitrarily decide to take your own children's lives.\n\nBut trying to put himself in her shoes,\n\nEven Boss Zhou was getting completely disoriented by the story in this villa.\n\nHow could an ordinary person possibly bear it?\n\nThe mother had a mental breakdown.\n\nThe two children would only suffer more.\n\nSo Zhang Tianquan simply took poison with her two children. Legally and rationally, it was definitely wrong, but emotionally, it was somewhat understandable.\n\nShe had found her own release. As a mother, she couldn't possibly leave her two children behind to continue suffering in this limbo of reality and illusion.\n\nIn the end, it was her husband who got screwed over; he was still locked up in prison.\n\n\"How should I write?\"\n\nBoss Zhou hesitated, then asked again.\n\nThe black shadow smiled. \"You know how to write an essay, right?\"\n\n\"I do.\"\n\n\"Then just write it like that. It's not like I'm asking you to publish a book or write a biography. Besides, apart from you and me, there are no third eyes to see it.\"\n\n\"Third eyes?\"\n\nDid it miscount?\n\n\"Nonsense! How do you think we were fast-forwarding so fast it made our heads spin?\n\n\"There's a certain zombie out there foolishly reading the book while tearing it up, and tearing it so fast and fiercely at that!\"\n\nOh,\n\nSo Yingying was here too.\n\n\"Is she outside?\"\n\n\"She's in the story too.\"\n\nZhou Ze understood. He first went to the coffee table, found a magazine, and spread it open, preparing to write.\n\nHe had originally wanted to find a blank notebook, but there were none to be found in this villa.\n\nHe put pen to paper,\n\nBut no writing appeared.\n\n\"Is it out of ink?\"\n\nZhou Ze said.\n\nThe shadow didn't speak, just kept swaying nearby, as if awkwardly dancing to some specific rhythm.\n\n\"Hey, it's out of ink,\" Zhou Ze called out.\n\nBut the shadow continued its dance.\n\nZhou Ze put down the pen and watched it.\n\nAfter dancing for a very long time,\n\nThe shadow finally stopped.\n\n\"Look at me. Am I beautiful?\"\n\n\"...\" said Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze had a rough idea of what the shadow was. It was probably something like the black cat in the *Book of Yin and Yang*, a type of artifact spirit.\n\nBut clearly, this black shadow's intelligence was much higher than the black cat's. It was because its intelligence was high that it knew how to be a smartass, that it could provoke the urge in people to want to smack it.\n\n\"Write! Go on, write,\" the black shadow urged.\n\nIt had been frank before, telling him everything and putting on a completely open and honest act, but in reality, it was deliberately laying the groundwork for its current smartass behavior.\n\nZhou Ze thought for a moment, then picked up the pen and began to write on his own palm.\n\nA sharp, stabbing pain came from his palm, like being pricked by needles, but the skin didn't break, and no blood flowed. Even when Zhou Ze deliberately tried to pierce his skin to write in blood, it still had no effect.\n\nThe words,\n\nStill wouldn't appear.\n\nThere was a problem with this pen. Or rather, there was a problem with the writing medium.\n\nThe black shadow drifted restlessly around him, saying, \"Actually, there's another way. That is to wait slowly. Wait for time to pass, wait for the effect to wear off, and then you'll be able to get out.\"\n\n\"How long will that take?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Very soon. Maybe a sixty-year cycle, maybe two.\"\n\n\"If that's the case, how was that mother able to return to reality to commit suicide with her children?\"\n\n\"You should take a look at who wrote the story in the first place.\"\n\n\"Oh.\"\n\nZhou Ze stood up, walked over to the wall, and tried to write with the pen. It still wouldn't write.\n\nAnd because it was light, appallingly so, it was impossible to use hard pressure to scrape out marks and forcibly \"write\" words.\n\nZhou Ze had already experimented on his own palm; it was no use.\n\nThe pen was fake,\n\nBut it should be able to write.\n\nThe shadow probably wasn't lying to him about that.\n\nSince the pen could write but wasn't writing now, by process of elimination, the problem had to be the medium.\n\nIt could only write on a specific surface.\n\nFor example,\n\nThe *Book of Yin and Yang*?\n\nZhou Ze thought of the black-covered notebook back in the bookstore that he had entrusted to Monkey for safekeeping.\n\nBut that raised another problem.\n\nHe could most likely write in the *Book of Yin and Yang*.\n\nBut he couldn't open the *Book of Yin and Yang*.\n\nOpening it meant entering it.\n\nWhat the hell was he supposed to write then?\n\nSo, bringing the *Book of Yin and Yang* or not made no difference. Opening it in this environment would likely trap him in the most awkward situation of a \"dream within a dream\" or a \"trap within a trap.\" Heaven knew what consequences that would cause.\n\nZhou Ze tried writing on many other surfaces, but none of them worked.\n\nIn the end,\n\nZhou Ze sat back down on the sofa.\n\nThe shadow continued to drift around, comforting Zhou Ze at the same time, \"What's so bad about staying here to keep me company?\"\n\n\"You're really narcissistic.\"\n\n\"If that foolish zombie hadn't torn through the several hundred thousand words of our love-hate entanglement and sweet nothings, fast-forwarding everything, I believe the relationship between us wouldn't be so dull.\n\n\"It should be a relationship of loving and killing each other, of mutual respect between rivals, of mutual admiration, and so on.\n\n\"Some things, you can look at the beginning, then flip straight to the end to see the result.\n\n\"But other things, the most important part is actually the process. If the process is gone, then there's no point.\"\n\n\"In that case, can you change your voice and your appearance?\" Zhou Ze suggested.\n\nLooking at his own shadow, hearing his own voice,\n\nZhou Ze really couldn't appreciate it.\n\n\"What kind do you like?\" the shadow asked.\n\n\"How about you change into Joey Wong?\"\n\n\"A pity, but in this book, I am your shadow.\" The shadow shrugged. \"I can't turn into the Joey Wong you like.\"\n\nZhou Ze reached into his pocket and then pulled out a small booklet.\n\n\"Not many people carry notebooks around with them these days.\" The shadow leaned in for a look and realized it wasn't a small notebook. \"Is this a driver's license? Oh, no, wait, it's... a Ghost Emissary ID?\"\n\nZhou Ze opened his ID.\n\nThe merit points displayed showed three hundred out of a thousand.\n\n\"A Ghost Emissary ID is useless too,\" the shadow laughed.\n\nZhou Ze put the pen to the page.\n\nWords appeared.\n\nThey were black characters, clearly materializing on the blank page of the Ghost Emissary ID.\n\n\"...\" said the shadow.\n\nA faint smile appeared on the corner of Zhou Ze's mouth.\n\nHe wrote:\n\n\"A door appeared in front of me. After the door opened, Bai Yingying walked out.\"\n\nAnd then,\n\nA door appeared in front of Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nThe door was kicked down.\n\n\"Scared the hell out of me!\n\n\"A door suddenly appearing in front of me!\n\n\"Which son of a bitch is playing a prank on me!\"\n\nBai Yingying made her domineering entrance,\n\nStill holding the book she had torn until it was very, very thin.\n\nThen she saw Zhou Ze.\n\nAnd saw the pen in Zhou Ze's hand.\n\nShe immediately seemed to understand something.\n\nShe instantly wiped the corners of her eyes and stomped her foot.\n\nCrying pitifully, she said:\n\n\"Sob, sob, sob...\n\n\"Boss,\n\n\"This place really scared Yingying to death.\n\n\"Thank goodness you were here to save me, Boss, to rescue me from this desperate plight.\n\n\"Otherwise, Yingying really wouldn't have been able to go on living.\n\n\"After all, Yingying is just a weak little woman...\"\n\n***\n**Footnotes:**\n¹ *Eunuch-ed* (太監了, tàijiàn le): Internet slang for a serialized novel or story that the author has abandoned without finishing.

    "content": "Pushing open the door,\n\n  Zhou Ze and Bai Yingying walked out together.\n\n  Outside,\n\n  the sky had already brightened. It must have been the morning of the next day.\n\n  The tears in his clothes were still there, and even the nail on his little finger was still bleeding.\n\n  The shadow in the book had said that in this world, not everything that isn't real is fake.\n\n  Now, Zhou Ze understood that feeling. After all, if it were fake, if it were exactly like the illusions he had experienced before, then there would be no injuries on his body when he came out, not even the slightest trace of its existence.\n\n  Bai Yingying took her boss's hand and, blowing gently on the wound on his fingernail, comforted him,\n\n  \"Boss, it doesn't hurt, it doesn't hurt. *Hooo, hooo*, it doesn't hurt, it doesn't hurt.\"\n\n  \"It's fine. It'll grow back.\"\n\n  Zhou Ze looked at his other hand, the one that had been holding the pen. But when he walked out, the pen was gone.\n\n  The shadow said it was a fake because the work was never finished; the author had dropped it.\n\n  So a fake pen was left here, while the real pen was not.\n\n  Then,\n\n  where was the real pen?\n\n  Was it the Judge's Brush?\n\n  Zhou Ze thought of the female author who had committed suicide by poison with her children. She had written the story, and in the end, she was the one who couldn't bear it. She was already dead. Could the pen have been disposed of as part of her belongings? Or was it collected by someone?\n\n  After he got back and took a shower, he'd have to get Lao Dao and the little loli to investigate this matter. That pen was truly terrifying, but if it remained lost out in the world, it would be even more terrifying.\n\n  It might brew a second, similar tragedy.\n\n  Pushing open the front door,\n\n  Zhou Ze saw Zhang Yanfeng's car parked outside. Officer Zhang was leaning against the car door, smoking. When he saw the door open, Officer Zhang immediately walked over. He looked at Zhou Ze's rather miserable state and said,\n\n  \"I couldn't reach you on your phone. I was thinking of going in, but then I figured I'd better wait for you to come out.\"\n\n  \"It's a good thing you didn't come in.\"\n\n  Zhou Ze was somewhat relieved. If Officer Zhang had gone in earlier, he probably would have ended up in the book too. At that point, Zhou Ze and Bai Yingying, who were already out, had no desire to re-enter that story.\n\n  Getting into the car, they found that Zhang Yanfeng had even thoughtfully prepared breakfast.\n\n  \"Is the matter... resolved?\"\n\n  \"What aspect are you asking about?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n  \"I just want to know if it was man-made or due to other reasons. My sister, did she really commit suicide?\"\n\n  \"It wasn't man-made. And your sister really did commit suicide,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\n  \"That... thing. Is it dealt with?\"\n\n  \"I'm going to deal with it. By the way, how were your sister's belongings handled at the time?\"\n\n  \"My family took some of them, and my brother-in-law's family also took some.\"\n\n  \"Give me your brother-in-law's family's contact address. I'll have someone go take a look.\"\n\n  \"Alright.\"\n\n  \"Okay, that's all for now. Yingying and I will take a taxi back so we don't keep you from work. As for this villa, you'd best not go inside on your own. Got it?\"\n\n  Although the story of this incident was over,\n\n  if Lao Dao hadn't idly stuck that talisman paper to the wall while on the toilet,\n\n  none of the subsequent events would have happened.\n\n  But to be safe, it was best to stay away from this villa for the time being. Even Zhou Ze decided not to move back in until he found that pen. What if he ran into something else that triggered something? He really couldn't take another round of that.\n\n  He got out of the car, waved at Officer Zhang's vehicle, and watched it disappear from sight. Suddenly, a question occurred to Zhou Ze, and he fell into deep thought.\n\n  \"Boss, what's wrong?\"\n\n  \"I'm wondering if... *that person*... is still inside my body.\"\n\n  Zhou Ze thought of that mirror,\n\n  and the one in the mirror.\n\n  In the story, he and the other him had been separated.\n\n  Now that he was out,\n\n  then,\n\n  what about him?\n\n  If he were gone, Zhou Ze would feel relieved, body and soul, no longer having to worry about being overthrown one day.\n\n  But why did he feel a little hollow inside?\n\n  Especially since he couldn't unleash his invincible mode in the story this time, which felt very strange.\n\n  At this moment,\n\n  Boss Zhou felt he was being a bit of a deadbeat,\n\n  like one of those girls who wants to land a sugar daddy but acts all coy, claiming it’s her first time and it hurts.\n\n  But, if he could find that pen, would that also mean he'd have a way to suppress him?\n\n  The days of using his cheat-mode without any worries...\n\n  Just thinking about it felt wonderful.\n\n  Yingying walked up to Zhou Ze.\n\n  She reached out and gently tapped his chest.\n\n  Zhou Ze was a bit confused.\n\n  \"Hey, are you still in there?\"\n\n  Yingying called out to Zhou Ze's chest.\n\n  \"...\" Zhou Ze.\n\n  As if she couldn't get a response,\n\n  Yingying then pressed her ear against Zhou Ze's chest.\n\n  The gesture,\n\n  looked as if a girl was throwing herself into your arms.\n\n  She reached out again and gently tapped on Zhou Ze's chest.\n\n  \"If you can hear me, please respond.\"\n\n  Zhou Ze smiled,\n\n  and one hand naturally wrapped around the girl in front of him.\n\n  Yingying froze for a moment,\n\n  then stuck out her tongue,\n\n  pretending she knew nothing at all.\n\n  ...\n\n  Zhang Yanfeng didn't go back to the station. Instead, he drove directly to the Tongcheng prison on Guanyin Mountain. He had scheduled a visit the day before.\n\n  Originally, he had intended to question his brother-in-law again based on Zhou Ze's needs. Since Zhou Ze said his sister had indeed committed suicide and the incident wasn't man-made, the original investigative visit had turned into one of consolation.\n\n  Zhang Yanfeng's heart was a tangle of emotions.\n\n  He had always felt his brother-in-law was wrongly accused,\n\n  and now Zhou Ze had confirmed it.\n\n  His brother-in-law was truly pitiful. His wife and children were dead, and he himself was mistaken for the abuser and thrown in prison.\n\n  As for how to clear his brother-in-law's name and give him his freedom, it was difficult, truly difficult. Was Zhang Yanfeng supposed to tell the judge that it wasn't his brother-in-law who was the abuser, but a ghost?\n\n  Sitting outside the glass partition,\n\n  his brother-in-law, dressed in a prison uniform, walked in accompanied by a guard.\n\n  His brother-in-law was tall and thin. A few years in prison had made him even more gaunt, but his overall mental state seemed fine; there was no sense of him having given up on himself.\n\n  \"Brother.\"\n\n  He picked up the phone, and they began to talk.\n\n  \"Have you been... doing alright lately?\"\n\n  \"I'm doing well.\"\n\n  Zhang Yanfeng nodded and offered some comfort, \"Don't give up hope on life. Never give up.\"\n\n  Officer Zhang's way of comforting people was always that stiff. It had been the same when he \"comforted\" Zhou Ze in the detention center, but it was precisely this stiffness that made the sincerity within so easy to feel.\n\n  His brother-in-law nodded and even managed a smile for Zhang Yanfeng.\n\n  \"Brother, I know.\n\n  Quanquan is gone,\n\n  my two children are gone too,\n\n  but I always feel like they're still by my side, accompanying me and watching over me.\n\n  I'm planning to travel after I get out of prison. I'll take their photos with me, walk around and see the world. I used to be so busy with the factory, I rarely had time to spend with them.\n\n  When I get out, I'll take them on a family trip.\"\n\n  Zhang Yanfeng let out a long sigh. \"The day you're released, I'll come pick you up.\"\n\n  \"Okay, Brother.\"\n\n  The two men fell silent for a long time.\n\n  Visiting hours were short to begin with, and Zhang Yanfeng wasn't interrogating a criminal.\n\n  Finally, as the time was almost up,\n\n  his brother-in-law said with a hint of melancholy, \"Brother, thank you for still believing in me.\"\n\n  Zhang Yanfeng was at a loss for words.\n\n  When it came down to it,\n\n  he was the one who had wronged him.\n\n  As a police officer, he was unable to clear an innocent man's name.\n\n  \"Time's up, Officer Zhang,\" a prison warden accompanying him reminded.\n\n  \"Alright, thank you.\"\n\n  Zhang Yanfeng nodded and watched his brother-in-law being led away from the visitation room.\n\n  An ordinary person visiting a prisoner would certainly not be accompanied by a warden, but this warden and Zhang Yanfeng were old friends. They had met through work long ago, and later, finding they had compatible personalities, they would occasionally get together for drinks.\n\n  The two walked out side by side, chatting casually.\n\n  \"Old Zhang, do you really believe he was framed?\"\n\n  Zhang Yanfeng nodded.\n\n  \"Well, it's your family's business, so I won't say more. Actually, I also think he might have been wrongly accused. His attitude and performance during rehabilitation in prison have been excellent. He's really set a good example. He's had his sentence reduced several times successfully. I reckon he'll be out in about another year.\"\n\n  Beside the corridor was a Wall of Honor.\n\n  First was a commendation board for outstanding Party members and workers in the prison.\n\n  Further down was the board for rehabilitation role models.\n\n  His brother-in-law's photo was at the very top of the list.\n\n  \"In prison, he often counsels and encourages other inmates to actively participate in rehabilitation. He's been a great help to us.\n\n  Also, he wrote a book, and it got published. It's had a huge impact.\"\n\n  \"Oh, wrote a book?\" Zhang Yanfeng asked, a little curious.\n\n  \"Yeah, he wrote a book called *The Road to Redemption*. The protagonist is an inmate, and the setting is our Tongcheng Prison. It's about a prisoner's psychological journey from committing a crime to accepting legal punishment.\n\n  It's about how one goes from initial confusion and resistance to later actively accepting and correcting one's mistakes,\n\n  actively accepting rehabilitation, striving to get a reduced sentence,\n\n  and trying to return to society as soon as possible to become a useful person, facing prison life and the road ahead with a positive attitude.\n\n  I've read the book too. It's really well-written.\"\n\n  \"That's really great.\"\n\n  Zhang Yanfeng nodded, very pleased.\n\n  \"I have a few copies in my office. Want to take one back to read?\"\n\n  \"I say, Old Chen, are you just handing these out to everyone who comes, using this book as promotional material for your prison?\"\n\n  \"Hey, I offer you a gift and you're ungrateful, are you? Forget it, go buy it from a bookstore yourself.\"\n\n  The two continued walking, bantering back and forth.\n\n  \"Does he write every day?\"\n\n  Zhang Yanfeng remembered his sister seemed to have told him once that she and her husband had met online because they both wrote fiction. That's how they fell in love.\n\n  But back then, both their incomes were relatively low, and his brother-in-law's family wasn't well-off, which was why he became a live-in son-in-law to take over the Zhang family's small mooncake workshop. After having children, his sister focused on writing at home and later published many books in a row.\n\n  So,\n\n  his brother-in-law had, in a sense, given up his own dream for love.\n\n  Thinking about it,\n\n  it really hadn't been easy for him.\n\n  Now,\n\n  he could only display his talent from within the prison walls.\n\n  \"Let me tell you, our prison has its own computer room. I originally approved for him to use the computer room for writing after his daily rehabilitation activities.\n\n  Aren't all authors these days using computers and keyboards to write stories?\n\n  But he refused.\n\n  He said he just likes to use his fountain pen to write stories on paper.\n\n  He said stories written that way are more grounded,\n\n  more real.\"",

    "content": "For Zhou Ze, there was nothing more pleasant than getting up in the early morning from beside Yingying and the Little Loli, taking a shower, and then settling into his favorite window seat to soak up the sun.\n\nKopi luwak coffee,\n\nan ironed newspaper,\n\naccompanied by the morning crowd beginning to stir on South Avenue outside.\n\nWatching the people come and go, toiling for their livelihoods,\n\nwhile he, separated by a single window, stole for himself a half-day of idle leisure.\n\nThis,\n\nperhaps, was the true taste of life.\n\nThe Old Daoist was sweeping the bookstore. Even with the air conditioning on in the sweltering heat, he was still sweating.\n\nThe little monkey, wearing a flat cap¹ and holding a rag, was also helping the Old Daoist wipe the tables and chairs with surprising efficiency.\n\nYingying was taking the dirty clothes out of the washing machine and heading up the stairs to hang them on the second-floor balcony.\n\nThe vitality of the bookstore, paired with the aroma of coffee,\n\nBoss Zhou sank into the sofa,\n\nfeeling his entire body grow soft and pliant under the sun's gentle touch.\n\nThe Old Daoist had once asked Xu Qinglang why the boss loved sunbathing so much.\n\nIt was because the Old Daoist's previous boss, who owned a funerary goods shop, also loved to pull up a stool and sit at the entrance, basking in the sun like a leisurely old grandfather.\n\nXu Qinglang had replied,\n\njust as cold-blooded animals like crocodiles need to sunbathe,\n\nghosts, well,\n\nthey're heavy with *yin* energy,\n\nso when they have nothing to do, they should soak up more sun,\n\nto absorb a little more *yang* energy.\n\nOf course, Old Xu, the one who'd said this, was still upstairs playing Sleeping Beauty. After the last hospital check-up revealed nothing, Zhou Ze had originally planned to use his fingernail to stimulate him awake.\n\nHowever, the matter with the villa had caused a delay, and the injury to his fingernail had yet to heal. This made Zhou Ze temporarily hesitant to act rashly. An injured fingernail could reduce the fine control he had over it.\n\nIf, while stimulating Xu Qinglang, he accidentally inserted it too deeply,\n\nand turned Old Xu from a Sleeping Beauty into an ancient Loulan corpse, that would be a real shame.\n\nThe Little Loli was also up.\n\nSummer vacation had arrived, so she didn't have to go to school. That guy, Wang Ke, was quite at ease leaving his daughter here with Zhou Ze, basically washing his hands of her.\n\nPerhaps,\n\nfor Wang Ke, the priority right now was resolving the issue with his wife; he really didn't have the energy for anything else.\n\nLooking at his childhood friend's current life,\n\nZhou Ze felt all the more emotional.\n\nWhat's the point of a wife?\n\nWhat's the point of kids?\n\nBeing alone,\n\nit’s so much better.\n\nFour or five middle school students, all boys, walked into the bookstore. This was already their third day here. With summer vacation on, they had simply decided to use the bookstore as their place to study and relax.\n\nAnyway, one hundred yuan for a day—back when Zhou Ze was in middle school, a hundred yuan was a fortune, but for today's kids, a hundred yuan for a place to hang out all day was well worth it.\n\nEven their parents thought it was worth it. After all, their kids were going to a bookstore, not an internet cafe.\n\nZhou Ze watched as the kids found a sofa, sat down, and started on their homework. One was in charge of English, one of math, one of physics and chemistry, and so on. Whoever finished their part would pass it around for the others to copy. As a result, they could finish a whole day's worth of summer vacation homework in just half a morning.\n\nThe rest of the day would be spent grabbing a book from the shelves to kill time until they could go home and report their duties done.\n\nThe Little Loli also came out after a shower. Today, she wore a little princess dress, her hair draped down, exuding a subtle charm. Paired with her petite frame, she was as exquisite as a porcelain doll placed in the most prominent spot in a toy store.\n\nWhen he saw her come down, Zhou Ze gave her the middle finger.\n\nHer actual age was that of a grown lady,\n\nyet she still loved to act so cutesy!\n\nContemptible!\n\nPerhaps this was a strange cycle: many girls like to dress maturely when they're young, but as they get a little older, they start thinking of ways to make themselves look younger.\n\nThe morning at the bookstore passed by in this placid manner.\n\nHowever, just before noon, a blond, blue-eyed man walked in. A *yanggui*² had arrived. Everyone in the bookstore, including the students, glanced up for a moment before dismissing it. In recent years, everyone had grown tired of seeing foreigners.\n\nAside from the relevant government departments who still made a fuss, ordinary people could maintain a very nonchalant attitude about it.\n\n\"Excuse me, do you serve food here?\"\n\nThe foreigner's Mandarin pronunciation was very accurate and natural.\n\n\"Food?\"\n\nThe Old Daoist, sitting behind the counter, was taken aback for a second.\n\n*Damn it,*\n\n*Do they really think this is a cafeteria?*\n\nBut adhering to the principle that the customer is always right, the Old Daoist still nodded and said:\n\n\"Yes, yes, we only offer a folk custom set menu.\"\n\n\"OK, what is national is what is global. I like it.\"\n\nThe foreigner found a window seat similar to Zhou Ze's, sitting down right behind him and very close to the five middle school students.\n\nA short while later,\n\nthe Old Daoist brought over a small tray holding a plate of peanuts, a dish of spiced fava beans, a few slices of cloud-flake cake, accompanied by some dried tofu and yellow wine. At the same time, he reminded him:\n\n\"The set menu price is 888.\"\n\nThe foreigner nodded, indicating he understood.\n\nThe Old Daoist helped him arrange the small dishes, then stepped back.\n\nThese were the meal offerings the shop used to entertain visiting ghosts. Items like dried tofu, peanuts, and cloud-flake cakes were easy to store, chosen purely for convenience. It was all the shop had. After all, with the chef gone, the staff and the boss all relied on takeout for their meals. Who had the spare time to cook for customers?\n\nThe foreigner ate while nodding, saying it was delicious, and even took out his phone to take pictures.\n\nAfter eating about half, the foreigner proactively started chatting with the middle school students.\n\nBut while he had used Mandarin before, this time he used English.\n\n\"How are you?\"\n\n\"I'm fine, thank you, and you?\"\n\n\"I'm fine too.\"\n\n\"..................\"\n\nAs the foreigner spoke with the students, Zhou Ze overheard him introduce himself as Otteson, from Iceland.\n\n\"Boss, this humble Daoist³ is stepping out to buy some daily necessities.\"\n\nThe Old Daoist informed Zhou Ze, and after seeing him nod in agreement, he went out. His earlier reminder about the price was simply to make the boss aware that the foreigner hadn't paid his bill yet.\n\nOver here, the foreigner and the students were chatting enthusiastically.\n\nYou could tell,\n\nhe was very happy,\n\nthinking that young Chinese people were truly hospitable.\n\nIn reality, as Zhou Ze saw it, the only reason these middle schoolers were so enthusiastic was that they wanted to practice their spoken English.\n\nThe Little Loli sat down next to Zhou Ze. \"Can you tell me about the Judge's Brush again?\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head lazily. He had already gone over it once and was too lazy to repeat himself.\n\n\"I just feel that things aren't that simple. The Judge's Brush couldn't have just disappeared for no reason. I also went to both families' homes and secretly searched through their belongings but found nothing special.\"\n\nThe investigation into the Judge's Brush had begun as soon as Zhou Ze returned. The Old Daoist was responsible for networking and running errands, but the information he brought back was useless.\n\nZhou Ze hadn't asked the Little Loli to investigate, only sending the Old Daoist, but she had still gone and secretly investigated on her own after finding out.\n\n\"So? Do you have a suspect?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"I want to go to the prison to see the husband who was sentenced.\"\n\nThe Little Loli had placed her suspicion on him.\n\n\"Don't overthink it,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Don't you think he's suspicious?\" The Little Loli frowned. \"Out of a family of four, the other three all had something happen to them, but he's perfectly fine?\"\n\n\"He's in prison. How is that 'perfectly fine'?\"\n\n\"Compared to dying, what's going to prison?\"\n\n\"If the Judge's Brush was in his hands, and he wanted to kill his wife and child, would he be stupid enough to let himself become a suspect and go to prison?\"\n\nThe Little Loli froze,\n\nlost in thought.\n\n\"Putting it that way, you seem to have a point.\"\n\nWith that,\n\nthe Little Loli hopped off the sofa and waved her hand.\n\n\"Forget it, I'm done. I'm not getting involved.\"\n\nThe Little Loli went upstairs.\n\n\"What's wrong, Boss?\"\n\nYingying came over at that moment to refill the boss's coffee.\n\n\"Nothing. I'm not going to stoop to a child's level.\"\n\nJust then, Zhou Ze received a WeChat message. It was a reply from Zhang Yanfeng:\n\n\"If you want to see him, I can arrange it. I just went to see him a couple of days ago.\"\n\nGlancing at the message, Zhou Ze silently dimmed his screen.\n\nBai Yingying also saw the content of the WeChat message,\n\nand felt a secret delight,\n\nthinking that her boss treated the Little Loli as an outsider but not her.\n\nIn reality, Zhou Ze had been very curious about the imprisoned husband all along, especially after the Old Daoist's search of the belongings yielded no valuable information. The husband's suspiciousness had instantly skyrocketed.\n\nEven if he was in prison.\n\nThe most crucial factor was the Judge's Brush; it couldn't have disappeared for no reason.\n\nOf course, deliberately hiding his investigation from the Little Loli was also a sign of progress for Boss Zhou, a moment when he set aside a little of his lazy-fish mentality.\n\nThe Judge's Brush had been able to sever the connection between him and the being inside him. If the Little Loli got her hands on it first, she would probably find a way to block the hold he had on her through her soul-blood.\n\nThis kind of artifact was better kept in his own hands. After all, it wasn't like the Book of Life and Death, which neither he nor the Little Loli could use at the moment—whoever used it would get sucked in. That was why he could generously toss it to the monkey for safekeeping.\n\nBut the Judge's Brush could be used effectively even by ordinary people.\n\nHe continued sipping his coffee and reading the paper.\n\nBehind him, the middle school students were still chatting with the foreigner.\n\nAbout an hour later,\n\nthe Old Daoist returned, panting, holding a plastic bag with some daily necessities inside.\n\n\"What's wrong?\"\n\nZhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Boss, I think this humble Daoist's phone was stolen at the supermarket.\"\n\nThe Old Daoist looked utterly humiliated.\n\nHe considered himself a seasoned man of the world,\n\nyet he still fell victim to a pickpocket,\n\nand a successful one at that.\n\nWhat a complete loss of face.\n\n\"Go report it to the police,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Sigh.\"\n\nThe Old Daoist nodded helplessly, setting his things down to go report it.\n\n\"I'll call the police.\"\n\nAt that moment,\n\nthe foreigner, Otteson, who had been enthusiastically chatting with the students, stood up and said.\n\n\"It was my phone that was stolen, why are you calling the police?\" the Old Daoist asked, confused.\n\nOtteson thought for a moment, then replied:\n\n\"If I call the police, it can be found faster.\"\n\n***\n\n**Footnotes:**\n\n¹ `鴨舌帽 (yā shé mào)`: Literally \"duck-tongued cap,\" a common term for a flat cap or newsboy cap.\n\n² `洋鬼子 (yáng guǐzi)`: A colloquial, sometimes derogatory, term for a foreigner, literally \"foreign devil.\" In modern usage, its offensiveness depends heavily on context and tone.\n\n³ `貧道 (pín dào)`: \"This poor/humble Daoist,\" a traditional and humble first-person pronoun used by Daoist priests.",

A Chinese person had lost something on Chinese territory; how could their own police not put their hearts into finding it?\n\nDid they really need a foreigner like you meddling in their business?\n\nSo, you think just because you’re a foreigner the police will take it more seriously, but they won’t care if it's one of their own people?\n\nWhat kind of logic was that!\n\n*The foreigners’ ambition to see us fall will never die.* This old Taoist would not be fooled!\n\nThe old Taoist shot Ottesen a contemptuous look, as if the man were speaking nonsense, and ran off to the police station to file a report himself.\n\nOttesen shrugged a little awkwardly. Seeing Zhou Ze looking at him, he said with a hint of resignation:\n\n\"I was just trying to help.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" Zhou Ze responded.\n\n\"You're the owner of this shop, aren't you?\"\n\nOttesen sat down next to Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"I've also always dreamed of opening my own bookstore. And it would have to be just like yours, in a bustling city center. This kind of life is just so wonderful.\"\n\n\"You could give it a try.\"\n\n*If you're not afraid of losing money,* Zhou Ze thought.\n\nNoticing Zhou Ze’s rather cold attitude, Ottesen quickly said:\n\n\"I really like your Chinese culture.\"\n\n\"Saying that is like British people making small talk about the weather.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"It's nonsense.\"\n\n\"I truly do love Chinese culture. I'm different from the others,\" Ottesen emphasized. At the same time, he stood up, grabbed a Chinese language textbook from a nearby middle school student’s table, flipped through it, and read aloud to Zhou Ze:\n\n\"If a true knight is roused to fury, two corpses will lie on the ground, and blood will flow for five paces. The whole world will be clad in mourning. Today is that day.\"\n\nOttesen recited the passage with perfect pronunciation, adding for Zhou Ze’s benefit:\n\n\"I can also understand the meaning here. And I deeply admire the protagonist Tang Ju’s spirit of defying the powerful. It’s a lot like our ancestors who battled the wind and waves on the seas.\"\n\nIcelanders consider themselves descendants of the Vikings, the so-called Viking pirates.\n\nAnd what Ottesen had just recited was, in fact, an excerpt from *Tang Ju Does Not Disgrace His Mission*.\n\nThis text was selected for many textbooks, and many students were required by their teachers to memorize it.\n\nThe gist of it was that the King of Qin was trying to act all tough in front of Tang Ju.\n\nTang Ju pulled out a sword and told the King of Qin, \"If you keep running your mouth, I'll cut you down.\"\n\nThe King of Qin immediately backed down and cried out:\n\n\"Smells good to me.\"¹\n\nZhou Ze lit a cigarette.\n\nHe blew out a smoke ring.\n\nMmm.\n\nHe had no intention of engaging him.\n\n\"Sir, do you still think I don't understand traditional Chinese culture?\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head and said:\n\n\"If you truly understood it, you would know that this story is fake.\"\n\n\"Fake? But it comes from the book *Intrigues of the Warring States*.\"\n\n\"It's definitely fake. Use that clever little brain of yours and think about it.\n\nWhen the King of Qin summoned Tang Ju, how could Tang Ju possibly have walked into the main hall carrying a longsword?\n\nWhat's more, the king had already learned his lesson from Jing Ke's assassination attempt. Besides, Tang Ju was over ninety years old at the time.\"\n\n\"...\" Ottesen was speechless.\n\nZhou Ze flicked the ash from his cigarette.\n\nTo be honest,\n\nhe too had felt uncomfortable when he had to memorize this classical text in school. Because you knew it was fake, but you still had to memorize it, and you’d lose points on the exam if you got it wrong.\n\nOttesen returned the book.\n\nHe sat back down in his original spot.\n\nHe popped a piece of dried tea-tofu into his mouth and fell into deep thought.\n\nBy the afternoon, the middle school students had left. Under Zhou Ze's watchful gaze, Ottesen paid Yingying and left as well.\n\n\"Are all foreigners this rich? That 888-yuan set actually sold.\"\n\nBai Yingying found it a bit incredible.\n\nThings like dried tea-tofu, cloud-flake cakes, and yellow wine weren't anything special in her era, let alone now.\n\n\"Anything can become valuable once you add 'ethnic flavor' to it. It's called cultural added value.\"\n\nZhou Ze remembered a roommate from his past life in university who was from western Sichuan. The roommate had told them a funny story about how the local government had commissioned a batch of ethnic costumes that he himself had never seen before, all for the sake of developing the tourism industry. Whenever tourists showed up, his mother and aunts would all shout:\n\n\"The tourists are here! Let's put on the costumes and go trick 'em out of their money!\"\n\nThen they would all put on those custom-made clothes and run to the village gate to perform and attract tourists.\n\nHe stood up and stretched his back. It was almost dusk, and the summer heat outside had subsided a little. Boss Zhou decided to walk out of the shop and squat on the curb for a smoke.\n\nThe old Taoist came running back, elated, holding his mobile phone high in the air.\n\n\"You got it back?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Yep, got it back. The comrades at the police station reviewed the surveillance footage and helped this humble Taoist identify the suspect. Then, more than half the station went out to help me search. After a long afternoon of work, they finally caught the thief and got my phone back for this humble Taoist. The thief was arrested, too.\n\nThe police comrades truly have the people's interests at heart and serve them wholeheartedly!\"\n\n\"Mm,\" Zhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"This humble Taoist plans to send them a silk banner tomorrow,\" the old Taoist said with great enthusiasm.\n\n\"Go for it.\"\n\n\"Boss, do you want some ice jelly?\"\n\nThe old Taoist pointed to a small stall across the street.\n\nZhou Ze hadn't noticed it before. There was a stall across the street. Street vending wasn't supposed to be allowed in this area; he guessed the owner was one of those who fought a guerrilla war with the authorities.\n\nThe stall was selling ice jelly, a Sichuan delicacy, and a fine treat for relieving the summer heat.\n\n\"Get me one, please. No extra toppings.\"\n\nAs he spoke, Zhou Ze also took out his own bottle of Netherworld Flower Oral Solution and took a sip.\n\n\"You got it!\"\n\nThe old Taoist went and bought two bowls of ice jelly, and squatted down on the curb next to his boss to eat.\n\nZhou Ze's was a simple sour plum juice ice jelly, very refreshing. The old Taoist's, however, was loaded with brown sugar, peanuts, and all sorts of other toppings, looking particularly rich.\n\nAs they were eating,\n\na black minivan pulled up. The side facing Zhou Ze and the old Taoist had the words \"Law Enforcement\" written on it. The other side, presumably, said \"City Management.\"\n\nThe van stopped.\n\nFour or five City Management officers got out.\n\nTwo of them were familiar faces. They were the same two officers who had brought the old Taoist back after Zhou Ze had sent him to sweep the streets as a contribution to the city's sanitation campaign.\n\nThe two officers also spotted the pair squatting there, eating ice jelly together.\n\nOne of them raised a hand in greeting:\n\n\"Yo, father and son having a snack!\"\n\n\"Pfft!\"\n\nThe old Taoist was so startled he sprayed a mouthful of ice jelly right out.\n\nBecause he sprayed it out so violently,\n\nit shot out from his nostrils as well,\n\nwith quite a few peanut bits stuck to it.\n\nZhou Ze, however, said nothing and continued eating with his disposable spoon.\n\nSeveral City Management officers went over to speak with the vendor.\n\nThe vendor was an old grandma with a full head of white hair.\n\nAs they talked,\n\nthe grandma started making more ice jelly.\n\nThe officers, each holding several boxes, paid her. Once the grandma had sold out of ice jelly, she obediently pushed her cart away, repeatedly promising she wouldn't set up her stall here again tomorrow.\n\nThe other officers drove away with the ice jelly, probably to share it with their colleagues back at the office.\n\nThe young City Management officer who had greeted the old Taoist earlier walked over, holding a bowl of ice jelly. He squatted down on the curb with them and started to eat.\n\nAfter he squatted down,\n\nthe old Taoist was completely on edge, terrified that this straightforward young man would say something \"shocking\" again and get him killed.\n\n\"I really can't get used to this ice jelly,\"\n\nthe young officer said after a few bites, looking a bit frustrated.\n\nIf they hadn't wanted the old grandma to pack up and leave quickly, they wouldn't have bought out her remaining stock. It wasn't expensive, but they really weren't used to the taste.\n\nIce jelly was popular in Sichuan, but it didn't really suit the palate of Tongcheng's locals, especially since it was usually loaded with so many toppings and ingredients. In contrast, Zhou Ze's simple, clean version was more palatable.\n\n\"It’s not as good as our local liangfen,\"² the young officer said.\n\nZhou Ze nodded,\n\nin deep agreement.\n\nIn his past life, when he was working at the hospital, he had been assigned to a medical team and sent to support a hospital in Sichuan for a month. He couldn't get used to the food there, which made for a miserable time.\n\nZhou Ze still clearly remembered a young doctor from his department who had gone out of his way to buy a large block of liangfen from a small street stall and invited Zhou Ze to eat with him.\n\nAt first, Zhou Ze had refused, because he truly couldn't stand the local way of preparing it—cut into strips and mixed with chili, vinegar, oil, and minced garlic.\n\nBut that young doctor had simply asked the vendor for a few cloves of garlic and a little soy sauce.\n\nHe smashed the garlic, added a bit of soy sauce, and cut the liangfen into large, mahjong-tile-sized cubes. Zhou Ze and he spent most of the evening eating that one dish and drinking beverages.\n\nZhou Ze had never forgotten that taste.\n\nUnfortunately, that doctor who had eaten liangfen with him was later a victim of a medical exposure incident. While treating a patient, the patient concealed their illness, which led to him becoming infected as well.\n\nAt the time, he had already sent out his wedding invitations.\n\nHe didn't make it through. You could say he was weak, or you could say he wasn't strong enough. In the end, he chose to jump from a tall building, taking his own life.\n\n*Sigh.*\n\n\"Boss? Boss?\"\n\nJust as Zhou Ze was squatting there, lost in thought, the old Taoist reached out and gently \"poked\" his shoulder.\n\n\"What's wrong?\" Zhou Ze came back to his senses.\n\n\"Uh, Boss, you didn't hear him clearly just now. This young brother wants to hire me to perform a ceremony at his home.\"\n\nZhou Ze looked at the young City Management officer with some surprise.\n\n\"It was my mother's request, not mine. I don't believe in this stuff, but my mother is from the countryside, and she wants some peace of mind. My father's tenth death anniversary is in a few days.\"\n\n\"Oh.\"\n\nZhou Ze looked back at the old Taoist.\n\n\"If you want to go, then go.\"\n\n\"No, Boss, I was hoping you'd come with me.\"\n\n\"It's a job for a father-son team, after all,\"\n\nthe young officer chuckled.\n\n\"Can you shut your frickin' mouth!\"\n\nThe old Taoist shot to his feet and roared at the young officer.\n\n*Damn it,*\n\n*you may want to go see your father in the underworld, but I don't!*\n\nThe young City Management officer was baffled.\n\nJust then,\n\nthe old Taoist gestured behind his back for Zhou Ze to look at the young officer's back.\n\nZhou Ze tilted his head and looked over.\n\nHe saw that, at some point, the old Taoist had already stuck a talisman paper on the young officer's back.\n\nThis guy had really developed a good habit of sticking talismans everywhere he went, hadn't he?\n\nHe slapped his ancestral talismans around like they were cheap medicinal plasters on a telephone pole.\n\nLast time, it was on the toilet when he went to the bathroom.\n\nThis time, he was sticking them on random people on the street.\n\nHowever,\n\nZhou Ze still saw what the old Taoist wanted him to see.\n\nOn the spot where the talisman was stuck to the young man's back,\n\na black palm print had appeared...\n\n---\n**Footnotes:**\n\n1.  **\"Smells good to me\" (真香 - zhēn xiāng):** This is a modern Chinese internet slang. It's used ironically to describe someone who vehemently rejects something at first, only to embrace it enthusiastically later.

    "content": "After finishing his bingfen, he returned to the bookstore and, out of habit, took a shower. When he went upstairs and pushed open his bedroom door, he found Yingying changing the bedsheets.\n\nThe young woman was kneeling by the bed, carefully tucking the corners of the sheet in and then slowly smoothing it out. She did it with great care and thoughtfulness.\n\nZhou Ze didn't go in. After all, night had just fallen, and the bookstore’s normal business hours were in the evening. As the owner, he certainly couldn't be the first one to go to bed.\n\nIn an ordinary shop, if the boss went to sleep, the whole staff would have to drink the northwest wind.¹\n\nBut Zhou Ze’s situation was a bit special. His employees were, one after another, loaded with money.\n\nIf the business closed, they would continue to eat and drink well; he, the owner, would be the one left to drink the northwest wind.\n\nHe went to the room next door to check on Old Xu. Old Xu was still in a coma. After several days of recovery, he truly looked as if he were just asleep.\n\nIf it weren't for the lingering discomfort in his own fingernails and his fear of making a mistake, Zhou Ze would have been sorely tempted to prick him awake right then.\n\nSleep, sleep, sleep,\n\nAll you know is sleep.\n\nDon't you have to work?\n\nYou think you're so great with your twenty-something properties?\n\nYou think with twenty-something properties you're set for life and can sleep in forever?\n\nWhat if the housing market crashes?\n\nAs he thought about it,\n\nZhou Ze shook his head.\n\nHmm,\n\nThat \"what if\" didn't seem very likely.\n\nLeaving the room, he saw a large glass case in the hallway, containing a potted plant.\n\nThis plant was originally kept in the Old Daoist's room. Back then, the Old Daoist shared a room with Deadpool, but he later moved the plant out himself.\n\nThe reason was that when he slept at night,\n\nThe Old Daoist could always hear the sound of the flower blooming.\n\nIf it happened just once, the experience might be described as beautiful; poets and scholars could even compose verses about it.\n\nBut according to the Old Daoist, this thing bloomed all night long. It would bloom, then close; close, then bloom again; bloom, then close again. So, trying to sleep felt like someone was sitting in front of you, tearing up countless sheets of paper for fun.\n\nAny beautiful thing, once you've experienced it too much, ceases to be interesting.\n\nAt night, the plant was kept in the hallway. During the day, it was placed on the balcony of a second-floor room to get plenty of sun.\n\nAfter that night, Zhou Ze had initially looked at Deadpool’s state and thought his mangled body would slowly writhe and then gradually recover. Now, it seemed he had oversimplified things. The bottom of the large glass case was now almost a puddle of sticky sludge. Several large lotus leaves and a fist-sized flower bud had already grown past the top of the case.\n\nCould it be…\n\nThat he really won't grow back?\n\nZhou Ze felt a bit uncertain. Who was to blame but the little monkey for planting a seed in there?\n\nPicking up the glucose bottle nearby, Zhou Ze poured a little more into the glass case. The flower bud actually swayed toward him, as if thanking and trying to please him.\n\n\"Heh.\"\n\nA small smile touched Zhou Ze's lips.\n\nHe reached out to touch the flower bud.\n\nThe flower suddenly bloomed,\n\nRevealing petals lined with barbs.\n\nAs Zhou Ze’s hand approached, it first opened, then snapped shut, as if trying to bite his hand off.\n\nZhou Ze didn't pull back, allowing the flower to envelop his hand.\n\nImmediately after,\n\nThere was no sharp pain. Instead, his palm, especially his fingertips, felt as if it were wrapped in a warm current, a very comfortable sensation.\n\nAfter a few minutes, the petals opened again.\n\nZhou Ze withdrew his hand and found it covered in a viscous white liquid that gave off a strange fragrance. The pinky finger with the previously broken nail was now actually itching—a sign that new flesh was growing.\n\nHe reached out and patted a lotus leaf, a gesture of thanks.\n\nZhou Ze turned and walked downstairs, looking at his hand. Although Boss Zhou was a neat freak, he knew he couldn't wipe this liquid off.\n\nA mosquito flew past the hallway entrance.\n\nAs it neared the glass case,\n\nThe flower bud suddenly shot out two meters, lunged upward, opened its petals, and sucked the mosquito into its \"mouth\" before retracting.\n\n***\n\n\"Boss, it's all arranged. We'll go to his house in three days.\"\n\nThe Old Daoist came to report to Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze nodded. The Old Daoist had asked for his opinion, and Zhou Ze had previously agreed.\n\n\"Boss, that handprint on the guy's back, what's the deal with it?\"\n\n\"Probably ran into a ghost on the road. The ghost patted him on the shoulder and asked for directions.\"\n\n\"Is it serious?\"\n\n\"It's just a ghost print. He's not showing any signs of being haunted, and he seems perfectly normal otherwise. It's probably not a big deal. In this world, very few people are actually harmed by ghosts, but many have unintentionally bumped into them. Most of the latter group are fine. After all, ghosts that can actually harm people are a minority within a minority.\"\n\n\"I hope it's nothing. He's such a good young man.\"\n\nAlthough the young city management officer had scared the Old Daoist several times by shooting his mouth off, the man's intentions and heart were truly good.\n\n\"I've noticed you've become quite the philanthropist lately,\" Zhou Ze said with a smile.\n\nTo ask for a favor for a stranger, inviting him along to perform a ritual at the man’s house…\n\nAlthough you couldn't put a price tag on a favor, no one could deny its value.\n\n\"My mindset is different now. Help one person if I can. I'll just consider it accumulating good karma for myself.\"\n\n\"That's a very dangerous way of thinking. People usually only have that kind of change of heart right before they're about to die.\"\n\nZhou Ze reached out and patted the Old Daoist's shoulder.\n\nThe Old Daoist shuddered in fear.\n\n\"Boss, you can't scare me like that, can you?\"\n\n\"It's fine, don't be nervous. Anyway, when you die and go to Hell, it'll be like going back to your own home. I promise I'll give you a very comfortable send-off.\"\n\n\"Well…\"\n\nThe Old Daoist didn't know whether he should say thank you or not.\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nA loud, muffled crash came from outside the bookstore.\n\nZhou Ze turned to see a public bus had driven onto the sidewalk. A fire hydrant had been smashed open and was spraying water, and screams could be heard from across the street.\n\n\"A car accident?\" the Old Daoist said.\n\n\"Let's go see.\"\n\nStepping outside the bookstore, Zhou Ze immediately saw a girl lying by the roadside. She was on the ground, bleeding from several places. A few other injured people were sitting on the ground nearby.\n\nThe bus driver had gotten out of the vehicle and was frantically making a phone call.\n\nDriven by the instincts of his past life as a doctor, Zhou Ze walked over, first checking on the girl who was lying on the ground, nearly semi-conscious, as her injuries looked the most severe.\n\nShe had obvious trauma to her head, chest, and thigh. The gash on her head was quite large, and it looked like she might have broken bones.\n\n\"Boss, is she okay?\" the Old Daoist asked, having followed him.\n\n\"Get the car. We're taking her to the hospital,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Oh, okay.\"\n\nZhou Ze looked up. There were security cameras here; the whole incident should have been recorded.\n\nThe Old Daoist pulled up in the newly repaired Nissan. Zhou Ze placed the girl in the car, and the Old Daoist drove.\n\nPreviously, Zhou Ze had said he and the Old Daoist would get their driver's licenses together. The Old Daoist went and got his; Zhou Ze did not.\n\n\"Which hospital?\" the Old Daoist asked.\n\n\"The nearest one.\"\n\nThe Old Daoist drove to a private hospital.\n\nYes,\n\nThat's right,\n\nIt was the Lin family's hospital.\n\nZhou Ze didn't contact Director Lin. When the car pulled up to the hospital's emergency building, he just shouted inside a few times. Soon, nurses and doctors came out with a stretcher and wheeled the girl into the emergency room.\n\nAfter that was done, Zhou Ze and the Old Daoist squatted by the flowerbed at the entrance, smoking. About two hours later, the sound of high heels clicked on the pavement, followed by a very familiar perfume.\n\n\"You're the ones who brought her in?\" Dr. Lin asked.\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"Did you hit her?\"\n\n\"There was a car accident outside our shop. The bus was at fault. We were just playing the good samaritan,\" the Old Daoist quickly explained.\n\n\"Open rib fractures, hemopneumothorax, ruptured spleen. Several of our departments consulted jointly, and she was sent directly to the operating room after diagnosis. The surgery just finished. It was successful. The girl is no longer in critical condition.\"\n\n\"The medical bills… do we need to pay anything upfront?\" the Old Daoist asked.\n\nHe had always understood that you needed money to go to the hospital.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head.\n\nThe Old Daoist nodded, thinking to himself, *Our own hospital is really something else!*\n\nLin Wanqiu smiled. \"The party at fault is the bus company, so they will pay for all medical expenses. The victim won't have to spend a single cent on medical fees. Of course, in situations like this, we always provide zero-cost registration and emergency approval for all tests, lab work, and medication. We treat first and bill later to ensure the patient is saved as quickly as possible. After all, human life is at stake.\"\n\nJust then, a motorcycle drove up to the hospital, bypassing the guard booth and pulling right up to the emergency building. A middle-aged man in a sleeveless shirt jumped off.\n\n\"Is my sister in there?\" the man asked.\n\nZhou Ze recognized his voice. He was the one he had called from the girl's phone. Yes, the phone had a fingerprint lock, so he had just used her finger to open it.\n\n\"The surgery was successful. Your sister is out of danger,\" Zhou Ze explained.\n\nThe man glanced at Zhou Ze and then ran into the hospital.\n\n\"Tch, not even a word of thanks,\" the Old Daoist grumbled.\n\n\"Don't complain. Don't you get the same treatment from those poor students you sponsor?\"\n\n\"...\" said the Old Daoist.\n\n\"We're leaving. You get back to work.\"\n\nZhou Ze said goodbye to Dr. Lin, got back in the car, and the Old Daoist drove them back to the bookstore.\n\nThe bookstore stayed open until three in the morning. Business was slow tonight; no ghosts came to the door. Zhou Ze went upstairs, put his arms around Yingying, and went to sleep.\n\nThe next day, when Zhou Ze woke up at ten and was heading downstairs to the bathroom to wash up,\n\nthe Old Daoist, who had been up for a while and had already finished cleaning, was sitting at the bar drinking tea. He suddenly held up his phone and shouted to Zhou Ze:\n\n\"Boss, look at this social media post.\"\n\nWith that, the Old Daoist walked over and held the phone out in front of Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Love-Heart Crowdfunding: *Save My Sister*:\n\nA tragic accident involving Tongcheng's Route 11 bus has left a girl in the bloom of her youth severely injured. Her family is poor and desperately needs money to save her life!\"\n\n\"Huh?\" Zhou Ze froze for a moment, then asked, \"Yesterday's accident?\"\n\n\"Yes, it's the woman we took to the hospital. There's a picture of her, the hospital address, and even the room number. It's all the same. The person who posted it is the girl's brother. He says on there: a CT scan costs 30,000, and the family scraped together 20,000, but the hospital still refuses to do it; the hospital only cares about money, not people, and now his sister urgently needs life-saving surgery. He also says the medical fees will be a million yuan and hopes everyone can help his sister. Save his sister!\"\n\n---\n¹An idiom meaning to have nothing to eat.",

    "content": "Zhou Ze sent the crowdfunding message to Lin Wanqiu via WeChat.\n\nTen minutes later, Lin Wanqiu replied with a single message:\n\n\"Got it.\"\n\nAnd then,\n\n...that was it.\n\nThose two simple words made Boss Zhou feel as if this morning's Kopi Luwak didn't even have a hint of shit in it.\n\nEverything seemed utterly tasteless.\n\n\"What's wrong with the boss?\" Yingying, who had gotten up later, asked the Old Daoist.\n\n\"The loved one is fearless, the one you can't have is always in turmoil. Now the roles have flipped, and he's not used to it.\"¹\n\n\"Why are you talking so strangely?\" Yingying couldn't quite understand.\n\n\"You're still young. You'll get it when you're older,\" the Old Daoist said, stroking his goatee.\n\n\"Are you older than me?\"\n\n\"You're still cold. Once you warm up, you'll understand.\"\n\nStaring blankly at his phone, Zhou Ze noticed the coffee cup in front of him vibrating gently. He looked up to see Yingying chasing the Old Daoist, beating him furiously.\n\nThe little monkey was screeching \"Squeak squeak squeak!\" nearby, but having inherited the Old Daoist's cowardice, it only screeched and didn't dare to actually enter the fray to stop the zombie.\n\n\"So noisy first thing in the morning! What's all the racket about? It's so annoying!\"\n\nThe little loli came downstairs,\n\nhair uncombed,\n\nwearing her pajamas.\n\nFirst thing in the morning, the bookstore was already bustling with activity. Boss Zhou stretched, and out of the corner of his eye, he saw a police car parked outside the bookstore's entrance.\n\nHe got up and walked out.\n\nThe little loli noticed Zhou Ze going out and was about to follow him to see what was happening.\n\n\"Hey, you're going out without washing your face, brushing your teeth, or even changing your clothes?\" Bai Yingying came over and asked.\n\n\"None of your business.\" The little loli had been annoyed with this dumbly adorable zombie for a long time.\n\n\"This is the bookstore, the boss's domain. You're one of the boss's people, so when you go out, you represent his image. If you go out so casually and something gets exposed for someone to see, the boss will lose a lot of face!\"\n\n\"...\" The little loli was speechless.\n\n\"Did you take the wrong medicine today, you stinking zombie!\"\n\nThe little loli made a face and stuck her tongue out at Bai Yingying.\n\nWhen she turned back, she saw that Zhou Ze had already gotten into the police car and left.\n\n\"Where is he going so early in the morning?\"\n\n\"To investigate a case, probably,\" Bai Yingying said.\n\n\"So secretive.\"\n\nThe little loli pouted and shouted:\n\n\"The boss's image is hungry! I want to eat!\"\n\n\"Alright, just wait.\"\n\nSeeing that she had successfully made the little loli stay, Bai Yingying went along with her and started making her breakfast.\n\nThe little loli glanced outside again, then looked at Bai Yingying's back,\n\ncupped her hands over her chest,\n\nand muttered:\n\n\"Dumb zombie. Sooner or later, you'll be sold off and still be helping them count the money! If you don't want me to go, then I won't go.\"\n\nThe little loli sat down on the sofa in a huff, resting her chin on her hand, watching the little monkey play with the Book of Life and Death, tumbling over and over.\n\n\"Stupid Zhou Ze, is my status even lower than a monkey's?\"\n\n...\n\n\"Youtiao.\"²\n\nZhang Yanfeng handed a youtiao to Zhou Ze.\n\n\"I've eaten,\" Zhou Ze said, waving his hand.\n\nZhang Yanfeng nodded, eating while he drove.\n\n\"Is this a police car?\"\n\n\"What about it?\"\n\n\"You're using a public vehicle for private errands.\"\n\n\"I happen to be going to the prison to drop off some documents today. It's on the way.\" Zhang Yanfeng glanced at Zhou Ze. \"If you're not out by the time I'm done, I'm not waiting for you. You can take a taxi back yourself.\"\n\nIt was nine in the morning when the car arrived at the prison. Zhang Yanfeng arranged the visit, and the two went their separate ways after entering the prison.\n\nZhou Ze sat alone behind the glass panel, waiting. He was a bit bored, but smoking wasn't allowed here.\n\nAfter waiting for about a quarter of an hour,\n\na tall, thin-faced man walked in, accompanied by a guard. When he saw Zhou Ze sitting on the other side, he seemed a bit surprised. He turned back and asked the guard beside him something, and only after confirming there was no mistake did he sit down.\n\nHe picked up the phone and asked directly:\n\n\"Who are you?\"\n\n\"I'm a friend of Officer Zhang. I need to ask you about a few things.\"\n\n\"Are you a reporter?\"\n\n\"I'm not.\"\n\n\"What's in it for me if I talk to you?\"\n\n\"Perhaps we can find a way to help you clear your name.\"\n\n\"Heh.\"\n\nThe other man chuckled.\n\n\"I've already been in prison for five years. I only have one year left before I get out. Why would I bother with all that?\"\n\n\"If it's proven that you were wrongly accused, you can receive compensation.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry. First of all, I firmly believe I am innocent and my name is clear, but my wife and two children are dead. That's a fact.\n\nI have to thank these five years of prison life. If I had been on the outside, I probably would have committed suicide long ago from the mental pressure. Here, I've found peace again.\"\n\nFaced with this attitude, Zhou Ze was truly at a loss for words. He nodded, stood up, and signaled that the visit could end.\n\n\"It's over?\"\n\nThe man was a bit surprised, but he still put down the phone, stood up, and prepared to follow the guard back.\n\nZhou Ze watched his back disappear behind the door, his previously warm, smiling face slowly turning cold.\n\nHe had seen that kind of demeanor before in some ascetic monks. They treated all the hardships the world threw at them as trials from Buddha, and thus could endure them with pleasure.\n\nBut this was a prison,\n\nnot a church.\n\nA middle-aged man whose wife and children were dead,\n\nable to achieve such enlightenment and let go of everything in prison...\n\nNo matter if others believed it,\n\nZhou Ze certainly didn't.\n\nAfter leaving the visiting room, Zhou Ze called Zhang Yanfeng's phone.\n\n\"Finished already?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"I'll be a little while longer here. Go wait for me at the prison gate.\"\n\n\"Alright.\"\n\nOutside the prison, the area was somewhat desolate. Zhou Ze squatted by a rock on the roadside and silently lit a cigarette.\n\nIf he had only been suspicious before, now Zhou Ze had a premonition: that female author's husband definitely knew something.\n\nAs for anything deeper,\n\nZhou Ze didn't let himself think about it,\n\nbecause just the thought of it was terrifying.\n\nRegardless of whether the man had the pen or not, a direct verbal probe or questioning was pointless and would only alert the enemy.\n\nYou could say Boss Zhou was a bit of a coward,\n\nbut as a \"salted fish,\"³ you have to place yourself in the safest possible position to be able to bask leisurely in the sun all day.\n\nHe took a few steps back, looking at the iron gates of the prison, then at its towering structure.\n\nZhou Ze was mentally calculating whether he should find a chance to sneak in and take a look.\n\nIf the pen really was in the man's possession,\n\nthen he absolutely couldn't give him any chance to react or prepare.\n\nWhen a little girl says, \"I'm going to squat in the corner and draw circles to curse you,\" it's most likely her just being cute.\n\nBut if someone with the pen really tailored a story just for you and gave you a bit part, then you'd really be putting your life on the line.\n\nHis phone rang just then. Zhou Ze answered it. It was the Old Daoist.\n\n\"Hey, Boss, the shop next to our bookstore has been bought out. The renovation team is already inside. I asked; Director Lin sent them.\"\n\n\"Oh.\"\n\nZhou Ze remembered Lin Wanqiu saying she wanted to open a pharmacy next to his bookstore, because she felt that her mentor from her memories running off to sell books was not attending to his proper duties.\n\n\"The renovation team is asking you what kind of style you want,\"\n\nthe Old Daoist shouted over the phone.\n\n\"Match the bookstore's layout.\"\n\n\"Match the bookstore's layout?\" The Old Daoist was stunned. What kind of pharmacy looked like that?\n\n\"Just do that.\"\n\n\"Oh, okay.\"\n\nAfter hanging up, Zhou Ze thought he should probably call Lin Wanqiu to ask about things. After all, he was the one who had sent the injured person to her, and the patient's brother's behavior—defrauding people for donations in an attempt to make a fortune—had greatly tarnished the reputation of Lin Wanqiu's hospital.\n\n\"Hello, what is it?\"\n\nDirector Lin answered the phone.\n\n\"How do you plan to handle the crowdfunding issue?\"\n\n\"I've already had my lawyers sue that crowdfunding website. At the same time, the hospital's official Weibo account has released the video from yesterday, from receiving the patient to the end of the surgery.\"\n\n\"Can the damage be undone?\" Zhou Ze asked, feeling a little guilty.\n\nThey weren't divorced yet, were they? And even if they were, any man would feel a bit of guilt for screwing over his ex-wife like this, right?\n\n\"I knew about the crowdfunding post the patient's brother made last night,\" Director Lin said.\n\n\"Hmm?\"\n\n\"And I did him a favor. I helped him hire an online mob and paid influential accounts to share it, helping him get massive exposure. Of course, his crowdfunding total also reached half a million yuan. He was very happy.\"\n\n\"You did it on purpose?\" Zhou Ze realized.\n\n\"That's right. When the matter gained notoriety, and many people began to criticize my hospital for only caring about money and not human lives, I struck while the iron was hot and hired even more marketing accounts to help me share the truth, release the video, and issue condemnations.\n\nNow, public opinion online is praising my hospital. All in all, it didn't cost that much more money. I just treated it as a PR expense, and the effect has been surprisingly good. We've received praise from both the public and the higher-ups.\"\n\n\"Then I worried for nothing.\"\n\n\"Do you think I've changed?\"\n\n\"A little, I guess.\"\n\n\"I'm the Director now. The entire hospital depends on me to make a living. I'm no longer that little girl who used to run around following you during her internship.\"\n\n\"Mm.\"\n\nThe call ended.\n\nBoss Zhou looked at his phone, dropped the cigarette he was holding, and stamped it out with his shoe.\n\n\"Hey, get in the car. What are you spacing out for?\"\n\nZhang Yanfeng had already driven the car out and was honking at Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze got in the car.\n\n\"Did you find anything out?\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head.\n\nWhatever the truth of this matter was, it was no longer suitable for Zhang Yanfeng to be involved.\n\n\"Alright then. I'm heading back to the station. It's on the way, so I can drop you off at the bookstore.\"\n\n\"Thanks.\"\n\n\"It's on the way, on the way. I would never use a public vehicle for private errands.\"\n\nZhang Yanfeng patted the steering wheel, and a book that had been resting on it fell down.\n\nSince he was driving, Zhou Ze bent over to pick it up for him.\n\n\"The Road to Redemption?\" Zhou Ze glanced at the book's title. \"You read this?\"\n\n\"My brother-in-law wrote it. The one you just visited,\" Zhang Yanfeng said with a hint of shared pride.\n\n\"He wrote it?\"\n\n\"Yeah. He's been a model inmate in prison and even wrote a few books based on prison life. Some have been published, some haven't. Because of that, he even got his sentence reduced.\"\n\nZhou Ze held the book in his hands, his expression growing serious.\n\nThe cover\n\nwas a panoramic photo of Tongcheng Prison.\n\nLeaning his body out the car window, Zhou Ze looked back at Tongcheng Prison.\n\nFor some reason,\n\nhe suddenly felt\n\nthat this towering, majestic prison,\n\nand the haunted villa Bai Yingying had bought before,\n\nlooked a little bit...\n\nsimilar...\n\n***\n\n**Footnotes:**\n\n1.
