    "content": "The delivery man stood rooted to the spot, looking at Zhou Ze, who was seated behind the counter.\n\n“Don’t be afraid. There are no cameras in the store, and I don’t have a voice recorder here.” Zhou Ze stretched. “Of course, you definitely won’t believe me when I say that. Tsk, suit yourself.”\n\n“I don’t know what you mean by that.” The delivery man was very calm.\n\nSomeone capable of such a deed would certainly be calm.\n\nThe police haven’t specifically identified the arsonist yet; that’s his skill, of course, used here as a derogatory term.\n\n“I’m certain you set that fire.” Zhou Ze spread his hands. He was merely stating a fact, a fact that didn’t require any rebuttal.\n\n“You’re drunk,” the delivery man said.\n\n“No, I’m not.”\n\nZhou Ze smiled.\n\n“Based on *that*, you’re saying I set the fire? You’re better than the police?” The delivery man’s expression was starting to tense up, but he was still restraining himself.\n\n“Hiss… Of course, I’m not better than the police, but I’m not blind. As for me saying I believe you’re the arsonist based on that, I’m sorry, but that’s not it at all. I merely confirmed you were the arsonist first, then deduced that piece of evidence afterward, just to get a taste of being Conan.”\n\nZhou Ze pointed behind the delivery man.\n\nThe delivery man immediately turned his head. He thought the police were standing there, but there was no one, nor any siren sounds.\n\nIn this almost deserted mall, and late at night, there wasn’t even a passerby.\n\n“They all came in with you,” Zhou Ze said.\n\n“Who?” The delivery man frowned.\n\n“The six people who died in the cinema, they followed you in. Then I took one look and went, ‘Oh.’ You’re the killer; it’s obvious, isn’t it? Besides that brain-damaged idiot behind me who’s singularly devoted to hating me, you can’t possibly say the other six victims all mistook their killer, can you?”\n\nZhou Ze slowly stood up, looking at the delivery man in front of him.\n\n“Playing tricks!” The delivery man almost roared. For some reason, he felt the pressure on him growing, and cold sweat started to trickle down his face.\n\n“Don’t be nervous, they can’t harm you.”\n\nZhou Ze walked out from behind the counter, holding a plastic bag.\n\nThe plastic bag contained small boxes of rice and some pickled vegetables.\n\nIn Zhou Ze’s vision, six people, both men and women, were seated on plastic stools, two of them elders.\n\nThey were all sitting there obediently reading books, very quiet, not noisy at all.\n\nZhou Ze placed a bowl of rice in front of each person, with pickled vegetables on top, and disposable chopsticks stood upright, stuck directly into the rice.\n\nAfterward, Zhou Ze took out a bottle of baijiu costing less than 10 yuan, poured it into plastic cups from the water dispenser, and placed a cup in front of each person.\n\n“Brothers, I’m not having an easy time either. This bookstore is constantly losing money, so I can only treat you all with this. Don’t blame me for being stingy, alright? You’re dead, but I still have to live. Anyway, your families will also make offerings to you, so a little bit from me won’t hurt, right?”\n\nZhou Ze bent down, speaking as if he were normally greeting customers.\n\nHm, as for that brain-damaged idiot in the back, Zhou Ze wasn’t kind-hearted enough to save a portion for him.\n\n“You f*cking insane!” The delivery man couldn’t hold back. “Ha, I really should record this and upload it online, so my followers can all see what you’re like!”\n\n“Do you dare?” Zhou Ze turned sideways. “You talk as if you actually would. You’ve only been livestreaming for a few days, and Wu Wu’s already gone.”\n\nYes, there were many reasons the police hadn’t found the arsonist yet, but if they had a key suspect to investigate, it would be very difficult for the arsonist to stay hidden.\n\n“I’m leaving. You’re crazy.”\n\nThe delivery man’s previous pleasant demeanor changed. He had successfully leveraged his popularity into livestreaming, earning significant income, not just because he was a “hero,” but also due to his own marketing strategies.\n\nHe was very down-to-earth, and his original persona was well-established. On this foundation, livestreaming food delivery, which would normally be a very dull and boring activity, could also be watched with great relish.\n\nHe knew he was panicking, he was losing control. So, he wanted to leave, to escape this bookstore.\n\nHe regretted coming here today, deeply, deeply regretted it.\n\nZhou Ze didn’t stop him. However, just as the delivery man reached out to push open the bookstore door,\n\nZhou Ze took out his phone, checked the time, and said:\n\n“It’s midnight.”\n\n“Dong!”\n\nThere was no wall clock in the bookstore, but at that moment, the delivery man seemed to hear a bell chime.\n\nHe pushed the door forcefully, but it didn’t budge. He became enraged, checked the lock, the door wasn’t locked, and there was nothing obstructing it, yet it wouldn’t open.\n\nThe delivery man started kicking the door like a madman, but it still didn’t budge.\n\nWhat he couldn’t see was,\n\nThe six people who had been sitting there reading,\n\nAll slowly stood up.\n\nIt was the seventh-day return of the spirit night<sup>1</sup>.\n\nEvery wrong has its perpetrator, every debt its debtor<sup>2</sup>.\n\nThey had come here, following their enemy,\n\nAnd now,\n\nThey were all staring intently at their enemy,\n\nA man who had clearly set fire to and killed them, yet had become a hero.\n\n“I told you not to save me!”\n\nA low growl came from behind Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze coincidentally blew on his fingernails at that moment, then suddenly turned around. The fingernails on his right hand instantly lengthened, a translucent black emitting an unusual glow, and wisps of black aura swirled around his fingertips, bringing a terrifying presence.\n\nSimultaneously, black mist swirled in Zhou Ze’s eyes.\n\n“Hiss, hiss, hiss… Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah!!!!!”\n\nThe black-suited man, who had just painstakingly transformed into a vengeful spirit, was directly grabbed by the shoulder by Zhou Ze’s hand. He then began to tremble all over. The black aura from Zhou Ze’s fingertips was like sharp little knives constantly piercing his body, and wisps of green smoke rose upwards from the top of the black-suited man’s head.\n\n“I understand you, but you disgust me.”\n\nZhou Ze said in a deep voice,\n\n“So, you’d better say goodbye.”\n\nZhou Ze exerted more force with his fingers.\n\nThe black-suited man howled while showing a pleading expression. He hoped Zhou Ze would spare him. He had already become a vengeful spirit; if he “died” again, his soul would be scattered, without even a chance to enter hell.\n\nBut Zhou Ze didn’t let go,\n\nHis gaze remained icy.\n\nIt wasn’t until the black-suited man’s body had completely melted and vaporized,\n\nThat he withdrew his hand, seeing faint ashes in his palm.\n\n“Hoo…”\n\nZhou Ze blew on his palm, then clapped his hands.\n\nTurning around, Zhou Ze sighed.\n\nHe wasn’t sure if it was because of his presence that the bookstore’s layout had changed,\n\nOr perhaps,\n\nThis was just a coincidence.\n\nThe six customers who had previously entered and quietly read books were now all beginning to emit black mist from their bodies, showing a tendency to transform into vengeful spirits for revenge.\n\nMeanwhile, the delivery man was still relentlessly punching and kicking the wall.\n\nLooking up, “Heaven spares no one” might be referring to the scene before them.\n\nThese six victims had also been in a panic amid rolling thick smoke and fire, bewildered, ultimately failing to escape and dying tragically within.\n\n“Everyone, give me some face, please don’t rush to become vengeful spirits.”\n\nZhou Ze walked among the group, raising a hand to signal to the six people.\n\n“Come on, relax a bit. How about a smile for your brother?”\n\nZhou Ze wanted to ease the atmosphere. Once they transformed into vengeful spirits, they wouldn’t enter reincarnation. After taking revenge and completely losing their obsession, they could only dissipate into the wind.\n\nThis was the most tragic outcome.\n\nZhou Ze felt it wasn’t worth it, truly not worth it.\n\nThe arsonist had already caused your deaths, separating you from your loved ones by life and death. Your children lost their father or mother, your parents lost their child,\n\nThere’s no need to push yourselves into an even more terrifying abyss because of this killer.\n\nHowever, Zhou Ze’s words had no effect.\n\nThe six people’s faces remained icy, and the black mist on their bodies was growing thicker. Black lines were starting to appear at the corners of their eyes and lips.\n\nThey were about to turn into the same appearance as that brain-damaged man in black just before he rushed at him.\n\n“Since you won’t smile for your brother, how about your brother smiles for you?”\n\nZhou Ze forced an ugly smile.\n\nIt was over.\n\nWhat a disaster.\n\nIt couldn’t be salvaged.\n\nZhou Ze knew it was easy for him to scatter the souls of these vengeful spirits, just like that brain-damaged idiot who had been following him for a week, who had finally finished his cooldown and was about to unleash his ultimate move, only to be slapped to death by him.\n\nBut to transcend these ghosts? He really didn’t know how to do it. Moreover, Zhou Ze himself was a ghost, so it wasn’t convenient for him to do such a thing, like asking Zhang Fei to do embroidery.\n\n“The Underworld has a path, the Yellow Springs can be crossed!”\n\nA sharp shout came from outside. Immediately after, the bookstore door was pushed open, and Xu Qinglang entered, holding a small porcelain bowl. The bowl contained grains of rice, and three incense sticks were stuck upright in it.\n\n“Arise!”\n\nThe three incense sticks burned quickly.\n\nSimultaneously, the grains of rice in the bowl also changed from translucent white to black, and the black mist on the six people began to fade. Finally, their expressions transformed from their initial icy solemnity to peace and tranquility.\n\nThe six people slowly sat down, in front of their bowls and chopsticks.\n\n“Xu Qinglang!” Zhou Ze pointed at Xu Qinglang and exclaimed,\n\nVery excited,\n\nTruly excited,\n\nMore excited than seeing Dr. Lin step out of the bath,\n\nJust think about how difficult it had been for him to eat this past week.\n\nHow could he not be excited!\n\nAs for Xu Qinglang’s recent display, Zhou Ze wasn’t surprised. In truth, everyone had merely seen through it but chosen not to speak of it before.\n\nXu Qinglang gave Zhou Ze a sidelong glance. In that instant, a myriad of charms appeared, as if the azaleas on the mountains had all bloomed,\n\nBut at the same time, he said exasperatedly:\n\n“Are you having a Chinese New Year midnight party here?”\n\n“I didn’t want to,” Zhou Ze said, briefly explaining the situation to Xu Qinglang.\n\nXu Qinglang nodded, indicating he understood, then cupped his hands and bowed to the six people, saying:\n\n“Everyone, it’s the seventh-day return of the spirit night. You should go back and see your loved ones; they’re probably waiting for you at home. I will give you an explanation for what happened here.”\n\nHearing this, the six people silently passed through the glass and left.\n\nZhou Ze’s gaze then fell on the bowl containing the “black rice.”\n\n“How come this stuff has no effect on me?”\n\nXu Qinglang’s mouth twitched. He strongly suppressed the urge to flare up and fight Zhou Ze for three hundred rounds,\n\nAnd huffed:\n\n“You’re different.”\n\nHe was still angry, still had issues with Zhou Ze, and was still disgruntled, but due to his appearance, temperament, and voice, that phrase, “You’re different,” carried the rich, deep-seated resentment of a cloistered maiden.\n\nImmediately afterward,\n\nXu Qinglang looked at the delivery man, who was curled up in a corner, having fainted from fear. “How do we deal with him?”\n\nAs he spoke, Xu Qinglang made a gesture of cutting clean through.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head,\n\nAnd said:\n\n“Let’s still turn him over to the state.”\n\n---\n<sup>1</sup> **Seventh-day return of the spirit night (頭七回魂夜):** In some Chinese folk beliefs, the spirit of a deceased person returns to their home on the seventh day after death.\n<sup>2</sup> **Every wrong has its perpetrator, every debt its debtor (冤有頭債有主):** An idiom implying that justice will be served, and the person responsible for a wrong or debt will ultimately face consequences.",

    "content": "Zhou Ze finally called the police, and the police came soon. According to Zhou Ze, he said that this foreign seller suddenly had a crazy accident when he came to his store. He said that many souls of the dead came to him to revenge him, and then kept kicking and smashing the wall wildly and finally passed away.\n\n\n\nWhen the police station finished recording, it was already bright. The cinema fire case was full of twists and turns, but now at least the situation has been opened. The police may have not suspected the foreign seller whom Yi Yong was just because of the darkness under the light. Even if there is no accurate evidence, as long as you really look at the other party and search, the truth should be discovered soon.\n\n\n\nAs for the subsequent reversal, the reversal of the online melon-eating crowd, and the stunned people who once gave this foreign seller a gift, they are not the problems that Zhou Ze needs to worry about and think about. There is only so much he can do, and there is only so much he wants to do.\n\n\n\n  It is better to leave the ghost to solve the problem of the ghost, and it is better to leave the problem of the human being to the police to solve the problem of the problem of the human being.\n\n\n\nStanding at the door of the police station, breathing the fresh air in the morning, and feeling awake\n\n\n\nWhen he returned to the store by car, Zhou Ze saw that the store next door, Xu Qinglang had already opened its doors for business again. Xu Qinglang changed his usual clothes and sat at the door of the store, placing the dishes and sunny, and humming the \"Boy's Drama\" (local style) in his mouth, leisurely, and a stream of scented out of his own.\n\n\n\n  everything,\n\n\n\nAs if it's still\n\n\n\nZhou Ze walked to the store, Xu Qinglang clapped his hands and asked, \"What to eat?\"\n\n\n\n\"Just let me take a look, I want sour plum juice.\"\n\n\n\nXu Qinglang point\n\n\n\nZhou Ze sat down in the store, and his fingers gently tapped the tabletop\n\n\n\n  It’s not too long that Xu Qinglang brought a bowl of chicken noodles. The soup was clear and the noodles were chewy. Of course, these were not important. The most important thing was that the familiar sour plum sauce appeared in front of Zhou Ze again.\n\n\n\n\"Make me a bucket, how much does it cost?\" Zhou Ze pointed to the bucket of the drink machine in the store, \"Make one bucket first.\"\n\n\n\n\"Should you wait for a while.\" Xu Qinglang sat down in front of Zhou Ze, holding a smoke in his mouth. He seemed to want to act like a little gangster smoking and hanging posture, but he gave people a sense of discomfort that \"women can be so beautiful even if they smoke.\"\n\n\n\nHe is not a mother or gay, so he can only blame God for giving the wrong skin\n\n\n\nAfter eating the noodles with sour plum juice, it was the first time. After eating the bowl of noodles, Zhou Ze's disgust was no longer so strong, but he still drank a few more glasses of water and it was relieved.\n\n\n\n\"Remember what happened to Lin Daiyu when she first entered the Jah Mansion to eat,\" Xu Qinglang asked in a sip of smoke.\n\n\n\nZhou Ze thought about it and understood\n\n\n\nLin Daiyu first entered the Jah Mansion and was at the first house banquet. After the meal, the servants gave her tea soup. Lin Daiyu was taught by her father at home and was not suitable for drinking tea and it was easy to digest indigestion. However, when Jah's mother and sisters were both drunk, she could only drink it with her.\n\n\n\n\"I can eat it\"Zhou Ze was shaking his head. With his current situation, it is very likely that this person could not become a gourmet or a gourmet. As for digesting the problem, let's talk about it again\n\n\n\n\"I feel a little unbalanced.\" Xu Qinglang opened the door to see Shandi and said, \"My parents are gone.\"\n\n\n\nXu Qinglang's parents had already left, but Zhou Ze knew what Xu Qinglang meant when he said \"left\" this time, so he should go down.\n\n\n\n\"Why did you leave suddenly?\" Zhou Cheng asked. He wanted to respond to a \"morrow\". Thinking about it, it was not suitable\n\n\n\n\"I've been discovered\"\n\n\n\nZhou Ze's hand holding the smoke shook slightly,\n\n\n\nHave been discovered\n\n\n\nZhou Ze remembered that before the old man died, he also shouted, \"They found me.\"\n\n\n\nXu Qinglang looked at Zhou Ze, \"I am very unwilling and unbalanced. Why did she take my parents away and not take you away?\"\n\n\n\n\"He and She\" Zhou Ze's image appeared in his brain. Then, combining Xu Qinglang's state of that day and his departure at night, he guessed it.\n\n\n\n\"She, that's impossible.\"\n\n\n\n\"The order of the sect is orderly, the deceased is on the road.\" Xu Qinglang lowered his voice and stared at Zhou Ze's eyes, \"The long tongue turns into a road, and the deep throat is Xu Youming, familiar.\"\n\n\n\n\"Black and white are inconsistent\"\n\n\n\n\"That's just a singularity.\" Xu Qinglang sighed, \"But they are indeed law-enforcers, traveling to the sun and pursuing order, dividing people and ghosts, and people telling each other, and ghosts have their own way.\"\n\n\n\n  \"oh\"\n\n\n\nZhou Ze still didn't believe it. If Xiao Luoli was really a Bai Wuchang identity, then what would be the death of the car and the driver before she showed her true body and spit out her long tongue on the school car.\n\n\n\n\"She didn't take me away, but instead took your parents away, so you hate me.\" Zhou Ze pointed at himself\n\n\n\n\"Yes\" Xu Qinglang pointed at the head\n\n\n\n\"Then there is no poison here.\"\n\n\n\n\"…………” Xu Qinglang\n\n\n\n\"Don't poison it, right?\" Zhou Ze asked again\n\n\n\n\"No\" Xu Qinglang answered\n\n\n\n\"That's good.\" Zhou Ze didn't know that in the meaty food that day, the vegetables were poisoned. If Dr. Lin hadn't come earlier that day, he might have really eaten the food.\n\n\n\n\"Are you really stupid or fake?\" Xu Qinglang looked at Zhou Ze with some disgrace, \"Why didn't she catch you?\"\n\n\n\n\"Yes, why didn't she catch me?\" Zhou Ze also asked\n\n\n\n\"I'm asking you.\" Xu Qinglang raised his voice\n\n\n\n\"I don't know either.\" Zhou Ze put his hands on his back, \"Maybe, it's because I saved her once.\"\n\n\n\n\"…………” Xu Qinglang\n\n\n\nThe conversation between the two people was finally burned with the cigarette head as the ending sign\n\n\n\nThe two sides opened the mountain this time, breaking the original silent tacit understanding\n\n\n\nWhen Zhou Ze walked back to his shop and packed up the plastic benches on the floor, he found that there were six plastic benches with uneven thicknesses underneath them.\n\n\n\nThis is whether to read books or eatZhou Ze remembered that the old master who started the live broadcast in the past also gave him a stack of sluts, saying that they could replenish sluts, so his sluts were made in this way.\n\n\n\nHow did he get it\n\n\n\nZhou Ze collected all the slights, and they were all in a whole bunch, which felt good. It was not as rough as those slights you usually see. When you touch it in your hands, it felt like a silky touch.\n\n\n\nThis made Zhou Ze think of the underworld shop as the old Taoist said, and do business with ghosts. The best store is of course the underworld shop, because the things sold there are also for the dead.\n\n\n\nTherefore, if the slightest calves in your hand are the \"slightest tickets\" for the dead, then you will definitely be able to earn more than you can\n\n\n\nIn the brain, a man sitting behind the cabinet and drinking porridge appeared again in the video screen.\n\n\n\nZhou Ze suddenly felt that\n\n\n\nI seem to have discovered something that might be very interesting\n\n\n\nOf course, no matter how interesting things are, I don’t have the energy to take care of them now. I didn’t sleep all night last night. Now that I’m back, I have to make a good idea.\n\n\n\nZhou Ze pulled the bookstore down and put it on the lock. For some reason, his bookstore is opening more at night than during the day, or maybe he has the opportunity to order another brand in the future.\n\n\n\n  Call\n\n\n\n\"Late Night Book House\"\n\n\n\nAnyway, there is no business during the day, and the bookstore has been lying on it. You can play some gimmicks and do something casually. The worst result is not the current situation.\n\n\n\nThe foreign seller's business is a serious mistake, but it also gives Zhou Ze some trouble\n\n\n\nThe bathing equipment in the sanitation room has been installed. Zhou Ze bought a water heater and took off his clothes. Zhou Ze took a shower and changed into a set of dry clothes to the building.\n\n\n\nWhen Zhou Ze lowered his waist and prepared to adjust the temperature of the ice cabinet, the whole person was stunned.\n\n\n\nBecause in the ice cabinet in front of him,\n\n\n\nA person lying down\n\n\n\nThe other party closed his eyes, as if he was in a deep sleep, breathing smoothly, his hands crossed in front of his chest, and he felt as peaceful as a little adult.\n\n\n\nVery calm and lovely,\n\n\n\nPrerequisite is,\n\n\n\nHer tongue wouldn't have become that long\n\n\n\nXiao Luli,\n\n\n\nTake your nest for the turtle\n\n\n\nZhou Ze really wanted to shout, so that Xu Qinglang, who was next door, would get revenge\n\n\n\nBut after thinking about it, let’s forget it. It’s not that he thought that calling Xu Qinglang to revenge was a harm to him, but he thought that Xu Qinglang didn’t come to revenge, and maybe he would ask with a sincere voice when he came:\n\n\n\n\"You're awake\n\n\n\nWhat do you want to eat\n\n\n\nI'll give you a way to do it.\"\n\n\n\nXiao Luli opened her eyes quietly. Her eyes were very deep, no longer the clear and simple way she had seen before.\n\n\n\nThe other party stretched out his hand, and Zhou Ze helped him open the ice cabinet.Xiao Luoli sat up from inside, and Zhou Ze noticed that she actually did not set the temperature, but just chose a ventilation and air conditioning.\n\n\n\n\"You are lying here, not cold.\" Xiao Luoli, who was sitting in the ice cabinet, asked. Before Zhou Ze could answer, Xiao Luoli opened her mouth again, \"Oh, I forgot, you are different.\"\n\n\n\nAfter saying that, Xiao Luoli, who was sitting in the ice cabinet, reached out and patted the empty space beside her, and looked at Zhou Ze innocently:\n\n\n\n\"Can you sleep together\"\n\n\n\nZhou Ze reached out to rub the girl's head, but his hand was next to him and stopped.\n\n\n\nShe is an invariable existence in black and white, and is the wizard of the sage among people.\n\n\n\nXiao Luoli reached out, and her little hand grabbed Zhou Ze's big hand, pressed Zhou Ze's hand on her head, and then pressed Zhou Ze's hand to rub it back and rub it back on her head.\n\n\n\n\"…………” Zhou Cheng\n\n\n\n\"You, it's great.\" Little Roo Li finally stood up from the ice cabinet, but it seemed that it was a bit difficult to climb out because of her short legs.\n\n\n\nZhou Ze carried her out of the ice cabinet.\n\n\n\nI don't know how she lies in before\n\n\n\n\"You are very good.\" Xiao Luoli pointed at Zhou Ze, \"repeat\"\n\n\n\n\"Amount... Thank you\" Zhou Ze didn't know how to recover\n\n\n\n\"I'm leaving.\" Xiao Luoli turned around, facing Zhou Ze, and crossed her hands behind her back. Zhou Ze knew that she wanted to show a kind of attitude that she admired.\n\n\n\nBut her problem is the same as Xu Qinglang.\n\n\n\nGod gave the wrong skin bag\n\n\n\nShe feels so cute no matter how she looks\n\n\n\nHold on,\n\n\n\nDon't laugh\n\n\n\nZhou Ze kept reminding himself,\n\n\n\nThis is black and white, unpredictable old man,\n\n\n\nDon't laugh\n\n\n\nHahahahahaha\n\n\n\nBut I still can't help it\n\n\n\nHe was dying hahaha\n\n\n\nFinished hahaha\n\n\n\nThe more you laughed, the more you became, the more annoying it became, and even your eyes were dripping.\n\n\n\nXiao Luli ignored Zhou Ze's laughter and did not cure Zhou Ze's crime of great disrespect.\n\n\n\nJust asked:\n\n\n\n\"You want to take over me.\"",
