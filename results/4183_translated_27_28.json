    "content": "The food delivery guy stood there, across the counter, looking at Zhou Ze, who was sitting behind it.\n\n\"Don't be afraid. There are no cameras in the shop, and I don't have a voice recorder either.\" Zhou Ze stretched. \"Of course, you probably won't believe me when I say that. Tsk, suit yourself.\"\n\n\"I don't know what you mean.\" The food delivery guy was very calm.\n\nSomeone who could do something like that must be very calm.\n\nThe police haven't specifically identified the arsonist yet, and that's his ability—though, of course, here it's a derogatory term.\n\n\"I'm certain that fire was set by you.\" Zhou Ze spread his hands. He was merely stating a fact, a fact that didn't need to be debated at all.\n\n\"You're drunk,\" the food delivery guy said.\n\n\"Not drunk.\"\n\nZhou Ze smiled.\n\n\"Just based on this, you're saying I set the fire? Are you better than the police?\" The food delivery guy's expression was already starting to tense up, but he was still restraining himself.\n\n\"Hiss... Of course, I'm not as capable as the police, but I'm not blind. As for me saying that I determined you're the arsonist based on that, I'm sorry, but that's really not it. I just deduced a piece of evidence after first confirming you were the arsonist, just to experience what it's like to be Conan.\"\n\nZhou Ze pointed a finger behind the food delivery guy.\n\nThe food delivery guy immediately turned his head. He thought there were police standing there, but there was no one there, nor any siren sounds.\n\nIn this nearly abandoned mall, and it was late at night, there wasn't even a passerby.\n\n\"They all came in with you,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Who?\" The food delivery guy frowned.\n\n\"The six people who died in the movie theater! They came in with you, and when I saw them, it was like 'oh', you're the killer, it's obvious. Except for that idiot standing behind me who's solely focused on hating me, you can't possibly say the other six victims all got the wrong killer, right?\"\n\nZhou Ze slowly stood up, looking at the food delivery guy in front of him.\n\n\"Playing supernatural!\" the food delivery guy almost roared. For some reason, he felt his pressure increasing, and cold sweat started to stream down his face.\n\n\"Don't be nervous, they can't harm you.\"\n\nZhou Ze walked out from behind the counter, carrying a plastic bag in his hand.\n\nThe plastic bag contained small boxes of rice and some pickled vegetables.\n\nIn Zhou Ze's sight, six people were sitting on plastic stools, both men and women, two of whom were elderly.\n\nThey were all sitting there properly, reading books, very quietly, not noisy at all.\n\nZhou Ze placed a bowl of rice in front of each person, with pickled vegetables on top of the rice, and disposable chopsticks stuck upright in the rice¹.\n\nAfterwards, Zhou Ze then took out a bottle of baijiu that cost less than 10 yuan, and poured the liquor into plastic cups from the water dispenser, placing a cup in front of each person.\n\n\"Guys, it's not easy for me either. This bookstore has been losing money ever since it opened, so I can only treat you all with this. Don't blame me for being stingy, alright? You're dead, but I still have to keep living. Anyway, your families will also make offerings to you, so a little bit from me won't make much difference, right?\"\n\nZhou Ze bent down, speaking as if he were greeting customers normally.\n\nHmm, as for that idiot behind him with a screw loose, Zhou Ze wasn't kind enough to save a portion for him too.\n\n\"You're goddamn crazy!\" the food delivery guy couldn't hold back anymore. \"Heh, I really should record this and upload it online, so the netizens can all see your true colors!\"\n\n\"Do you dare?\" Zhou Ze turned sideways. \"You say that as if you really dare. You've only been live-streaming for a few days, and even Wu Wu went down.\"\n\nYes, there are many reasons why the police haven't found the arsonist yet, but if the police had a key suspect to investigate further, it would be very difficult for the arsonist to remain hidden.\n\n\"I'm leaving. You have problems.\"\n\nThe food delivery guy's previously amicable demeanor changed completely. He was able to successfully convert his popularity into live-streaming and also gain huge income, not just because he was a \"hero\", but also due to his own marketing strategies.\n\nHe was very down-to-earth, and his original persona was very well-designed. On this basis, live-streaming food delivery, which was originally a very dry and boring thing, could also be very engaging for viewers.\n\nHe knew he was panicking and flustered. Therefore, he wanted to leave, to escape this bookstore.\n\nHe regretted coming here today. He regretted it very, very much.\n\nZhou Ze didn't stop him. But, just as the food delivery guy reached out to push open the bookstore door,\n\nZhou Ze took out his phone and checked the time, saying:\n\n\"It's midnight.\"\n\n\"Dong!\"\n\nThere was no wall clock in the bookstore, but at this moment, the food delivery guy seemed to hear a bell tolling.\n\nHe pushed the door hard, but the door didn't budge. He got angry. He looked at the lock—the door wasn't locked, and there was nothing blocking it—but the door just wouldn't open.\n\nThe food delivery guy started kicking the door like a madman, but the door still didn't budge.\n\nWhat he couldn't see was,\n\nthe six people who had been sitting there reading,\n\nhad all slowly stood up.\n\nThe seventh night, the night of the soul's return².\n\nEvery wrong has its perpetrator, every debt its debtor.\n\nThey had come here, following their enemy,\n\nAnd now,\n\nthey were all staring intently at their enemy,\n\na guy who had clearly set fire and killed them, but had become a hero.\n\n\"You didn't save me!\"\n\nA low growl came from behind Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze happened to blow on his fingernails at this moment, then sharply turned around, the nails on his right hand instantly growing long, a translucent black emitting an unusual sheen, wisps of black mist circling his fingertips, bringing a terrifying aura.\n\nAt the same time, black mist also swirled in Zhou Ze's eyes.\n\n\"Hiss hiss hiss... Ahhhhhhh!!!!\"\n\nThe man in the black suit, who had just managed to transform into a vengeful spirit, had his shoulder directly grabbed by Zhou Ze's hand, and then his whole body began to tremble. The black mist from Zhou Ze's fingertips was like sharp little knives constantly piercing his body, and wisps of green smoke rose upwards from the top of the man in the black suit's head.\n\n\"I understand you, but you disgust me.\"\n\nZhou Ze said in a deep voice,\n\n\"So, say goodbye.\"\n\nZhou Ze exerted more force with his fingers.\n\nThe man in the black suit wailed while showing an expression of pleading. He hoped Zhou Ze would spare him. He had already transformed into a vengeful spirit, and once he \"died\" again, his soul would be scattered, and he wouldn't even have a chance to enter hell.\n\nBut Zhou Ze didn't let go.\n\nHis gaze remained cold.\n\nHe waited until the man in the black suit's body had completely melted and evaporated,\n\nbefore he withdrew his hand. In the palm of his hand, he vaguely saw some ashes.\n\n\"Phew...\"\n\nZhou Ze blew on his palm, then clapped his hands.\n\nWhen he turned around, Zhou Ze sighed.\n\nHe didn't know if it was because of his presence here that the dynamic of the bookstore had changed,\n\nor perhaps,\n\nthis was just a coincidence.\n\nThe six customers who had merely been quietly reading after coming in now began to emit black mist from their bodies. This was a sign that they were about to transform into vengeful spirits for revenge.\n\nAnd the food delivery guy was still relentlessly smashing the wall with his fists and kicking it with his feet.\n\nLooking up, Heaven spares no one—perhaps that's what the scene unfolding before him was saying.\n\nThese six victims had also panicked amidst the rolling thick smoke and raging fire back then, not knowing what to do, and ultimately failed to escape, dying tragically within.\n\n\"Everyone, give me some face³, please. Don't be in a hurry to become vengeful spirits.\"\n\nZhou Ze walked into the crowd and gestured to the six people with a raised hand, saying.\n\n\"Come on, relax. How about you all give big brother a smile?\"\n\nZhou Ze wanted to ease the atmosphere. Once they transformed into vengeful spirits, they wouldn't enter reincarnation. After revenge, and once their obsession was completely gone, they would only dissipate into the wind.\n\nThis was the most tragic outcome.\n\nZhou Ze felt it wasn't worth it. It really wasn't worth it.\n\nThe arsonist had already caused your deaths, separating you from your loved ones by life and death. Your children lost their father or mother, your parents lost their children,\n\nThere was no need to push yourselves into an even more terrifying abyss because of this killer.\n\nHowever, Zhou Ze's words had no effect whatsoever,\n\nThe six people's expressions remained icy cold, and the black mist on their bodies was growing thicker, with black lines beginning to appear at the corners of their eyes and mouths.\n\nThey were quickly starting to resemble the black-suited idiot from earlier, just as he charged towards him.\n\n\"Since you won't smile for big brother, then big brother will smile for you?\"\n\nZhou Ze forced an ugly smile.\n\nIt's over.\n\nThis is a mess.\n\nIt can't be salvaged.\n\nZhou Ze knew it would be easy for him to scatter the souls of these vengeful spirits, just like that idiot who had been following him for a week—he had just managed to come off cooldown and was about to unleash his ultimate move, only to be slapped to death by him.\n\nBut to help these ghosts achieve salvation, he really didn't know how to do it. Moreover, Zhou Ze himself was a ghost, so it wasn't convenient for him to do it—it was like asking Zhang Fei to do embroidery.\n\n\"There is a path in the Underworld, the Yellow Springs can be crossed!\"\n\nA sharp shout came from outside. Immediately after, the bookstore door was pushed open, and Xu Qinglang walked in, holding a small porcelain bowl with grains of rice in it, and three incense sticks inserted into it.\n\n\"Rise!\"\n\nThe three incense sticks rapidly burned down,\n\nAt the same time, the grains of rice in the bowl also turned from crystalline white to black, while the black mist on the six people's bodies began to fade. Finally, their expressions began to transform from their initial icy sternness to peaceful serenity.\n\nThe six people all slowly sat down, sitting in front of their bowls and chopsticks.\n\n\"Xu Qinglang!\" Zhou Ze pointed at Xu Qinglang and exclaimed,\n\nvery excited,\n\ntruly very excited,\n\nmore excited than seeing Dr. Lin stepping out of a bath,\n\nJust think about this past week, how difficult it had been for him to eat!\n\nHow could he not be excited!\n\nAs for Xu Qinglang's performance just now, Zhou Ze wasn't surprised. In fact, everyone had just chosen to pretend not to notice.\n\nXu Qinglang rolled his eyes at Zhou Ze. In that instant, he exuded charm in a myriad of ways, as if all the azaleas on the mountain had blossomed,\n\nbut at the same time, he said huffily:\n\n\"Are you holding a Chinese New Year midnight party here?\"\n\n\"I didn't want to either.\" Zhou Ze briefly explained the situation to Xu Qinglang.\n\nXu Qinglang nodded to show he understood, and bowed with cupped hands to the six people, saying:\n\n\"Everyone, it's the seventh night, the night of the soul's return. You should still go back and see your loved ones. They should also be waiting for you at home. As for what happened here, I will give you an account.\"\n\nHearing this, the six people all silently passed through the glass and left.\n\nZhou Ze's gaze, meanwhile, was on the bowl with the \"black rice,\"\n\n\"How come this stuff has no effect on me?\"\n\nXu Qinglang's mouth twitched, forcibly suppressing the urge to flare up and fight Zhou Ze for three hundred rounds,\n\nand snorted:\n\n\"You're different.\"\n\nHe was still angry, still had complaints about Zhou Ze, and was still resentful, but due to his appearance, temperament, and voice, this phrase \"You're different\" carried a strong sense of deep-seated feminine resentment⁴.\n\nImmediately after,\n\nXu Qinglang looked at the food delivery guy, who was curled up in the corner, having already fainted from fright. \"How should we deal with him?\"\n\nAs he spoke, Xu Qinglang made a cutting motion.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head,\n\nsaying:\n\n\"We should just hand him over to the state.\"\n***\n¹ In Chinese culture, this gesture is reminiscent of incense offered to the deceased.\n² In Chinese tradition, the seventh day after a person's death is believed to be when their soul returns home.\n³ An idiom meaning to show respect or preserve one's dignity.\n⁴ Literally \"deep boudoir resentment,\" a culturally specific phrase implying a delicate, suppressed, or romanticized complaint, typically associated with a secluded woman.",

    "content": "周澤最後報了警，警察很快來了，按照周澤的說法，是說這位外賣小哥來到自己店裡後忽然發了瘋，說有很多被他燒死的人亡魂來找他復仇，然後不停地對著牆壁狂踹狂砸最後暈厥了過去。\n\n\n\n  從警局做完筆錄出來時，天都已經亮了，影院縱火案，一波三折，但現在至少打開了局面，之前警方很可能只是因為燈下黑的緣故，沒有懷疑到見義勇為的外賣小哥身上，現在哪怕還沒有確切的證據，但只要真的將目光落在對方身上進行查找，應該很快就能發現真相。\n\n\n\n  至於之後輿論的轉向，網上吃瓜群眾的顛覆以及那些曾給這位外賣小哥刷禮物的目瞪口呆，就不是周澤需要擔心和思考的問題了，他能做的，也就只有這麼多，願意做的，也就只有這麼多。\n\n\n\n  鬼的事兒，還是交給鬼來解決，人的事兒，還是交給警察來解決為好。\n\n\n\n  站在警局門口，呼吸著清晨新鮮的空氣，頭腦頓覺清醒。\n\n\n\n  打車回到店裡時，周澤看見隔壁許清朗的店已經重新開門營業了，許清朗本人換了一身平常點的衣服坐在店鋪門口一邊擇菜一邊曬著太陽，嘴裡還哼著「童子戲」（地方曲種）小調，悠哉悠哉，自有一股子風流韻味流淌出來。\n\n\n\n  一切，\n\n\n\n  仿佛依舊。\n\n\n\n  周澤走到店裡，許清朗拍了拍手，問道：「吃啥？」 \n\n\n\n  「隨便吧，我要酸梅汁。」\n\n\n\n  許清朗點點頭。\n\n\n\n  周澤在店裡坐了下來，手指輕輕地敲擊著桌面。\n\n\n\n  不一會兒，許清朗端上來一碗雞蛋面，麵湯清澈，麵條筋道，當然，這些都不重要，最重要的是，熟悉的酸梅汁，又出現在了周澤面前。\n\n\n\n  「給我做一桶吧，多少錢？」周澤指了指店裡的飲水機水桶，「先做一桶。」\n\n\n\n  「等過陣子吧。」許清朗在周澤面前坐下來，嘴裡叼著一根煙，他似乎很想做出一副小痞子抽菸吊啊吊的姿態，但偏偏給人一種「女人抽菸也能這般美麗」的違和感。\n\n\n\n  他不娘，也不gay，只能怪老天給錯了皮囊。\n\n\n\n  就著酸梅汁吃完了面，破天荒地，這次吃碗麵後周澤的噁心感不再那麼強烈了，但依舊多喝了好幾杯水緩了緩。\n\n\n\n  「記得林黛玉初進賈府吃飯後遇到什麼事兒麼？」許清朗吐出一口煙圈問道。\n\n\n\n  周澤想了想，明白了過來。\n\n\n\n  林黛玉初入賈府，第一頓家宴，飯畢後，下人送上茶湯，林黛玉在家裡被父親教導過飯後不宜飲茶容易消化不良，但見賈母和諸多姐妹都喝了，她也只能跟著一起喝。\n\n\n\n  「我能吃飽了就行。」周澤搖搖頭，以他現在這個情況，很可能這輩子是做不成一個老饕或者美食家了，至於消化問題，再說吧。 \n\n\n\n  「我心裡有些不平衡。」許清朗開門見山地說道，「我父母，走了。」\n\n\n\n  許清朗父母早就走了，但周澤清楚許清朗這次說「走了」是什麼意思，應該是下去了。\n\n\n\n  「怎麼忽然就走了？」周澤問道，本想回應一個「節哀」，想想，不合適。\n\n\n\n  「被發現了。」\n\n\n\n  周澤拿煙的手微微一抖，\n\n\n\n  被發現了？\n\n\n\n  周澤記得那個老者在臨死前，也曾喊過「他們發現我了！」\n\n\n\n  許清朗看著周澤，「我很不甘心，也很不平衡，為什麼她帶走了我父母，卻不帶走你。」\n\n\n\n  「他？她？」周澤腦海中浮現出了那個小蘿莉的形象，再結合許清朗那日的狀態和晚上的離開，就猜出了七七八八。\n\n\n\n  「她，不可能吧。」\n\n\n\n  「陰司有序，亡者上路！」許清朗壓低了聲音，盯著周澤的眼睛，「長舌化路引，深喉許幽冥，熟悉麼？」\n\n\n\n  「黑白無常？」\n\n\n\n  「那只是一個統稱。」許清朗嘆了口氣，「但他們確實是執法者，遊歷陽間，肅清秩序，將人和鬼，區分開來。人有人間道，鬼有奈何橋。」\n\n\n\n  「哦。」\n\n\n\n  周澤還是有些不太相信，如果小蘿莉真的是白無常那種的身份，那她之前在校車上顯露出真身吐出長舌頭導致車禍和那位司機的死亡該怎麼算？ \n\n\n\n  「她沒帶走我，反而帶走你父母，所以，你恨我？」周澤伸手指了指自己。\n\n\n\n  「對。」許清朗點頭道。\n\n\n\n  「那這面里沒下毒吧？」\n\n\n\n  「…………」許清朗。\n\n\n\n  「沒下毒吧？」周澤又問道。\n\n\n\n  「沒。」許清朗回答。\n\n\n\n  「那就好。」周澤並不知道，在那天的回鍋肉蓋澆飯里，飯菜里是下了毒的，若不是那天林醫生來得早了一些，可能自己真得吃下那頓飯。\n\n\n\n  「你是真傻還是假傻？」許清朗有些沒好氣地看著周澤，「她為什麼不抓你？」\n\n\n\n  「對啊，她為什麼不抓我？」周澤也問道。\n\n\n\n  「我問你呢！」許清朗提高了聲音。\n\n\n\n  「我也不知道。」周澤攤攤手，「可能，是因為我救了她一次吧。」\n\n\n\n  「…………」許清朗。\n\n\n\n  兩個人的談話，最後以菸頭燒滅了作為終止符。\n\n\n\n  雙方這次算是開門見山了，打破了原本的那種默不作聲地默契。\n\n\n\n  周澤走回自己的店裡，收拾地上的塑料板凳時，卻發現有六張塑料板凳下面都貼著厚度不均的冥鈔。\n\n\n\n  這是看書錢還是吃飯錢？ \n\n\n\n  周澤記得前陣子那個開直播的老道也曾給自己一沓冥鈔，說是能積攢陰德，那麼，他的那些冥鈔就是以這種方式弄來的麼？\n\n\n\n  他是怎麼弄過來的？\n\n\n\n  周澤將冥鈔都收集起來，整整一沓，手感不錯，沒有平日裡見到的那些冥鈔的粗糙，摸在手裡，有絲綢的觸感。\n\n\n\n  這讓周澤想到了老道所說的冥店，和鬼做生意，最好的店鋪當然是冥店，因為那裡賣的東西，也都是給死人的。\n\n\n\n  也因此，如果自己手中現在拿的冥鈔是死人的「鈔票」，那麼開冥店，肯定能比自己賺得更多。\n\n\n\n  腦海中，再次浮現出視頻畫面里坐在櫃檯後面艱難喝粥的男子，\n\n\n\n  周澤忽然覺得，\n\n\n\n  自己好像發現了一件可能會很有趣的事情。\n\n\n\n  當然，再有趣的事兒，現在也沒精力去管了，昨晚一宿沒睡，現在既然回來了，就得好好地補一個覺。\n\n\n\n  周澤將書店捲簾門給拉了下來，上了鎖，不知道為什麼，他的書店正在變得晚上開門的時間比白天多，或許，自己以後有機會可以再訂做一個牌子，\n\n\n\n  叫\n\n\n\n  「深夜書屋。」\n\n\n\n  反正白天也沒什麼生意，書店也一直在虧損著，自己可以隨意地玩一些噱頭，搞一些事情，最爛最壞的結果也不就是現在這個樣子唄。 \n\n\n\n  外賣小哥的事兒是罪大惡極的錯誤，但也給周澤一些啟發。\n\n\n\n  衛生間的洗澡設備已經被裝了起來，周澤買的是電熱水器，脫去衣服，周澤洗了一個澡，換上了一套干整的衣服上了樓。\n\n\n\n  當周澤彎下腰準備調置冰櫃溫度時，整個人卻愣在了那裡，\n\n\n\n  因為在他面前的冰櫃裡，\n\n\n\n  躺著一個人。\n\n\n\n  對方閉著眼，像是陷入了沉睡，呼吸平穩，雙手交叉放在胸前，有著一種小大人似地安逸。\n\n\n\n  很平靜，也很可愛，\n\n\n\n  前提是，\n\n\n\n  她的舌頭如果不會變得那麼長的話。\n\n\n\n  小蘿莉，\n\n\n\n  把自己的巢穴給鵲巢鳩占了。\n\n\n\n  周澤很想大喊一聲，讓隔壁的許清朗同學過來復仇。\n\n\n\n  但想想還是算了，不是他覺得把許清朗喊來復仇是害了他，而是他認為許清朗也沒那個膽子過來復仇，說不定人家來了他還會親切地問候一聲：\n\n\n\n  「您醒了啊？\n\n\n\n  您想吃點什麼？\n\n\n\n  我給您去做。」\n\n\n\n  小蘿莉睜開了眼，她的眸子很深邃，不再是以往見面的清澈和單純。 \n\n\n\n  對方伸出手，周澤幫忙把冰櫃蓋子打開。\n\n\n\n  小蘿莉從裡面坐起來，周澤注意到了，她其實沒有設置溫度，只是選擇了一個通風換氣。\n\n\n\n  「你躺在這裡，不冷麼？」坐在冰櫃裡的小蘿莉開口問道，沒等周澤回答，小蘿莉又開口道：「哦，我忘了，你不一樣。」\n\n\n\n  說完，坐在冰櫃裡的小蘿莉伸手輕輕拍了拍自己身邊的空位置，一臉天真無邪地看向周澤：\n\n\n\n  「一起睡不？」\n\n\n\n  周澤伸手想要揉一揉這個女孩兒的頭，但手在旁邊，卻停了下來。\n\n\n\n  她是黑白無常一類的存在，是陰司在人間的執法者。\n\n\n\n  小蘿莉伸手，她的小手抓住了周澤的大手，把周澤的手按在她的頭上，然後按著周澤的手在自己頭上來回揉了揉。\n\n\n\n  「…………」周澤。\n\n\n\n  「你，很好。」小蘿莉終於從冰櫃裡站起來，但似乎因為腿短的原因，爬出來有些困難。\n\n\n\n  周澤將她從冰櫃裡抱出來，\n\n\n\n  也不知道她之前是怎麼躺進去的。\n\n\n\n  「你，很好。」小蘿莉伸手指著周澤，「重複道。」\n\n\n\n  「額……謝謝。」周澤不知道該如何回復了。 \n\n\n\n  「我要走了。」小蘿莉轉過身，背對著周澤，雙手交叉負於身後，周澤知道她是想表現出一種高山仰止的氣質。\n\n\n\n  但她的問題和許清朗一樣，\n\n\n\n  老天給錯了皮囊。\n\n\n\n  她這個樣子，怎麼都覺得好可愛。\n\n\n\n  憋住，\n\n\n\n  不准笑。\n\n\n\n  周澤在不停地提醒自己，\n\n\n\n  這是黑白無常老爺，\n\n\n\n  不准笑！\n\n\n\n  哈哈哈哈哈！\n\n\n\n  但還是忍不住啊！\n\n\n\n  作死了哈哈哈！\n\n\n\n  完蛋了哈哈哈！\n\n\n\n  憋得越狠笑起來就越誇張，連眼淚都滴出來了。\n\n\n\n  小蘿莉沒理會周澤的笑聲，也沒治周澤一個大不敬之罪，\n\n\n\n  只是問道：\n\n\n\n  「你想，接替我麼？」",
