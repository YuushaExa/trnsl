    "content": "Cupping a handful of water and splashing it on his face, Zhou Ze slowly raised his head, looking at himself in the mirror, slightly haggard. As an Emergency Department doctor, this haggardness seemed like a standard feature.\n\n\"Doctor Zhou, a new patient is arriving soon. Looks like they fell from upstairs, not sure if it was suicide!\" Nurse Wang Ya shouted from the entrance of the men's restroom.\n\n\"Got it, I'll be right there,\" Zhou Ze replied, then pulled out a tissue, wiped the water droplets clean, and started to walk out.\n\nThe ambulance quickly drove into the hospital. Lying on the stretcher was an old man wearing a gray Tang suit. The old man coughed incessantly, occasionally coughing up bloody froth and spleen organ fragments. His entire body was covered in bloodstains.\n\nZhou Ze immediately ran over, pushing the stretcher while observing the patient's condition, and at the same time shouted to the people ahead, \"Prepare surgical instruments, quickly!\"\n\nThe patient's condition was very bad.\n\n\"I... I... don't want to die.\"\n\nThe old man opened his eyes, looking at Zhou Ze, who was closest to him.\n\n\"Don't worry, you'll be fine. We'll help you, you won't die.\"\n\nMost critically ill patients say these kinds of words at this time. Those who can truly face death calmly are, after all, a minority. And as a doctor, this is certainly not the time to analyze the patient's condition and tell them their chances of survival. What the patient needs at this moment is psychological comfort.\n\n\"No... no... down there... down there... down there is really too terrifying...\"\n\nThe old man suddenly clutched Zhou Ze's wrist, looking at Zhou Ze with a serious expression.\n\n\"Calm down, relax, your life won't be in danger.\" Although his wrist was throbbing with pain, Zhou Ze still didn't try to break free.\n\n\"I don't want... don't want to go down again... They... they found me... I... they found me...\"\n\n\"Hiss...\" Zhou Ze suddenly felt a sharp pain in his wrist.\n\n\"Doctor Zhou, your hand!\" the young nurse beside him immediately cried out.\n\nThe old man's fingernails were very long, and for some unknown reason, they were black. They were a translucent black, like amber, not appearing to have dirt accumulated within.\n\nAnd at this moment, the old man's fingernails had already embedded themselves into the flesh of Zhou Ze's wrist.\n\n\"I'm not going down... not going down... not going down... Haha... cough cough cough...\"\n\nThe old man suddenly straightened up and coughed violently. Immediately after, his body trembled, the hand that had been gripping Zhou Ze's fell away, and the entire person became still.\n\n\"Prepare for resuscitation!\" Zhou Ze shouted.\n\nThe old man was pushed into the emergency room. Doctors and nurses began to perform resuscitation measures on him, and at the same time, the defibrillator was also ready.\n\n\"Doctor Zhou, let me treat your wound,\" Wang Ya walked over at this moment.\n\nAs doctors, they weren't actually worried about this minor flesh wound. Their biggest concern was if the old man had other diseases, which could put the doctors in a dangerous situation of occupational exposure. After all, there was a lot of blood on the old man's hand just now, and no one knew if he had any infectious diseases.\n\nSome diseases, if contracted, could ruin a lifetime.\n\nAfter the wound was bandaged, another doctor walked out of the emergency room and shook his head at Zhou Ze.\n\nThis meant the person couldn't be saved.\n\nEveryone's mood was a bit down, but for them, this kind of thing was already common, and they would quickly adjust.\n\n\"Doctor Zhou, you should get checked out,\" Wang Ya suggested.\n\n\"No, I have something to do tonight.\" Zhou Ze shook his head, walked directly to the changing room to change his clothes, then walked to the hospital parking lot and drove away.\n\nThe car had just driven under the Jianghai Avenue elevated road when Zhou Ze's phone rang.\n\n\"Hello, this is Zhou Ze.\"\n\n\"Doctor Zhou, the children are all waiting for you.\"\n\n\"Sorry, Principal Wu, a patient delayed me. I'm coming right over now, please ask the children to wait for me a little longer.\"\n\n\"Okay, okay.\" The other side quickly hung up the phone.\n\nZhou Ze glanced at the time again. It was already 8:30 PM, and the children at the orphanage usually went to bed very early.\n\nThe red light turned green, Zhou Ze pressed the accelerator and drove past.\n\n\"Honk!!!!!!!!!!\"\n\nAnd at this moment,\n\nA heavy truck ran a red light and drove over. Zhou Ze only had time to turn his head and look at the dazzling high beams outside the car window,\n\nImmediately after,\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nThe world spun,\n\nThe car, like a fragile piece of white paper before the heavy truck, was directly sent flying, and after tumbling several times in the air, it crashed onto the ground.\n\n............\n\n\"Ugh...\"\n\nZhou Ze woke up.\n\nHe found that his body was completely unable to move, as if it were stuck.\n\nAt the same time, his eyes couldn't open. He knew he had been in a car accident, a very serious one. Out of professional instinct, he really wanted to check his injuries right now, but he couldn't move.\n\nAll around, there were occasional sounds of other vehicles driving past, and various horn sounds. *\n\nAm I still at the accident scene?\n\nAm I still in the car?\n\nZhou Ze thought to himself.\n\nSoon,\n\nThe siren of a police car came, and the sound of a fire truck.\n\nFinally, the familiar siren of an ambulance reached Zhou Ze's ears.\n\nZhou Ze perceived that his body was being moved. The temperature nearby was slightly high; they must be cutting his car to rescue him.\n\nZhou Ze had participated in many such rescue operations and was still clear about some of the procedures.\n\nWhat a pity, the cake in his back trunk and the Children's Day party for the orphanage kids would just have to fall through.\n\n\"Doctor Zhou!\"\n\nA familiar voice.\n\nIt must be Doctor Chen from the hospital.\n\nZhou Ze let out a long sigh of relief in his heart. At least, he had saved his own life. This could tentatively be considered an unforeseen disaster.\n\nThere were also the voices of several nurses nearby, but because it was too noisy, Zhou Ze couldn't hear them very clearly.\n\nBut next, a sentence from Doctor Chen made Zhou Ze's heart plummet to rock bottom!\n\n\"Doctor Zhou has lost vital signs.\"\n\nNo,\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nI'm not dead yet!\n\nI'm not dead!!\n\nZhou Ze desperately screamed in his heart!\n\nHe wasn't dead, he was still conscious, he wasn't dead!\n\nNext, Zhou Ze perceived that someone was performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation on him. He felt those heavy compressions, one after another, but he couldn't open his eyes, nor could he speak.\n\nHe wasn't dead,\n\nHe hoped they would quickly realize he wasn't dead!\n\nBut after a flurry of activity,\n\nZhou Ze heard the crying of several nurses he knew.\n\nDoctor Chen punched the nearby car door, looking very grief-stricken.\n\nHey!\n\nDon't give up!\n\nPlease don't give up!\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nI must be in a state of suspended animation,\n\nExcessive blood loss?\n\nSevere injuries?\n\nBut I'm really not dead!\n\nI should still be breathing, I should still have a heartbeat!\n\nZhou Ze roared frantically in his heart.\n\nBut next, he perceived that he was lifted onto a stretcher; he must have been put into the ambulance.\n\nImmediately after, came the sound of the ambulance starting.\n\nThe nurses in the ambulance compartment were still crying.\n\nBut this crying was particularly grating in Zhou Ze's ears.\n\nHe wasn't dead,\n\nWhy are you crying!\n\nWhy cry!\n\nLook at me again,\n\nLook at me again,\n\nCheck again,\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nThe ambulance stopped.\n\nImmediately after, Zhou Ze heard the voices of the hospital leaders:\n\n\"Little Zhou is just gone like that?\"\n\n\"The car accident was very serious. Doctor Zhou was severely injured and lost too much blood. Death has been confirmed.\"\n\n\"Really? He's just gone like that?\" another vice president still couldn't believe it.\n\n\"Little Zhou is gone.\" This was the voice of a department head. \"I just checked again.\"\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nYou quacks!\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nYou bastards!\n\nBastards!\n\nZhou Ze cursed incessantly in his heart. At this very moment, the people around him were no longer his colleagues, nor his friends, nor his superiors and elders,\n\nThey actually concluded that he was already dead,\n\nBut can dead people still hear sounds and perceive things?\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nYou bastards,\n\nAnimals,\n\nSons of bitches!!!!!\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nSave me!\n\nSave me!\n\nThe stretcher began to move. It was quiet all around, and the temperature was gradually dropping.\n\n\"Xiao Ya, don't be too sad. The president said the hospital will hold a memorial service for Doctor Zhou tomorrow.\"\n\n\"Sister Suqin, I just can't believe it, a person, just gone like that. Doctor Zhou was such a good person, how could he just be gone?\"\n\n\"The heavens have unforeseen winds and clouds, and people have morning and evening misfortunes. Just try to see it through.\" **\n\nAfter the two nurses finished saying this, they left.\n\nAll around,\n\nIt was empty,\n\nThat chilling coldness,\n\nwas so clear.\n\nZhou Ze struggled incessantly, constantly wanting to resist. He wanted to wake up, he desperately longed to make his voice heard.\n\nBut his current feeling was like sleep paralysis. No matter how hard he tried, his body was simply beyond his control.\n\nFinally,\n\nHe gave up in a bit of despair.\n\nHe was tired,\n\nand exhausted.\n\nHe knew where he was now.\n\nIn the hospital's,\n\nMorgue.\n\n..............\n\nWhen Zhou Ze \"woke up\" again, he perceived a faint coolness on his face, and a stinging sensation was also very clear.\n\n\"Is the makeup done?\" someone asked nearby.\n\n\"Don't rush, wait a bit. He was completely smashed up like this, how could the makeup be so fast?\"\n\n\"The hospital is rushing us, they're about to send him to the memorial service.\"\n\n\"Why don't you do it then?\"\n\nThe mortician seemed a bit annoyed and applied makeup with more force. Of course, their clients were dead people, and dead people naturally wouldn't feel pain, nor did they need to worry about complaints. They just needed to show results to the living.\n\nZhou Ze no longer had the strength to struggle.\n\nHe just lay there quietly,\n\nenduring the stinging sensation of the makeup brush pressing down on his face incessantly.\n\nFinally,\n\nthe makeup was finished.\n\n\"Alright, tell them to come in. Our work is done.\"\n\nZhou Ze felt himself being changed into clothes. Immediately after, he was pushed out, and hospital orderlies carried him into a soft, cramped space.\n\nThis,\n\nmust be an ice coffin.\n\nThen, all the surrounding noise was instantly isolated.\n\nThe lid must have been closed.\n\nShaking,\n\nswaying,\n\nbumping...\n\nAfter an unknown amount of time, Zhou Ze finally heard sounds again. The ice coffin lid must have been opened.\n\nWhat entered his ears,\n\nwas funeral music.\n\nThe hospital president was speaking into a microphone. He was praising himself, lamenting himself,\n\nThen came the vice president, department heads, and others.\n\nAround him,\n\nthere were occasional sounds of footsteps passing by.\n\nSome just quietly walked past, taking a last look at him.\n\nSome even tried to call his name a few times, with a choked voice.\n\nThis was a viewing of the remains.\n\nViewing,\n\nMy remains!\n\nI'm not dead,\n\nI'm really not dead,\n\nI'm not dead yet!\n\nNot dead!\n\nZhou Ze wailed in his heart.\n\nHe started trying to struggle again.\n\nBut it was still no use.\n\nHe could only hear and feel,\n\nbut couldn't speak,\n\nnor could he open his eyes.\n\nEveryone believed he was dead.\n\nBut he himself knew clearly.\n\nHe wasn't dead yet!\n\nThe children from the orphanage also came, crying by his side.\n\nTheir crying was very sincere, because Zhou Ze himself was a child who grew up in an orphanage. And because of this, after he started working, most of his salary was donated to the orphanage. This car accident also happened because he was rushing back to the orphanage at night to celebrate Children's Day with the children.\n\n\"Xiao Zhou, rest in peace. This time, you died in the line of duty. You have no family, but your compensation will be given to the orphanage by the hospital, rest assured,\" the vice president said, standing beside Zhou Ze.\n\nSubsequently,\n\nZhou Ze perceived that he was isolated again; the ice coffin lid must have been closed again.\n\nThen there was another bout of bumping.\n\nFinally, it stopped.\n\nThe ice coffin lid was opened again.\n\nAll around, it was somewhat quiet. Occasionally, human voices could be heard, but they weren't noisy.\n\nTwo people, one holding his shoulders and one holding his legs, lifted him up, then placed him on another cold rack, which seemed to be a steel plate.\n\nThese two people were very skilled, extremely skilled.\n\nAround him, there was a faint, indistinct sound of crying.\n\nZhou Ze initially couldn't distinguish where he had arrived now.\n\nBut at this moment,\n\nhe suddenly understood.\n\nBastards!\n\nThey sent him to the crematorium!\n\nThey were going to burn him!\n\nI'm not dead, you bastards!\n\nFuck your ancestors!\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nNot dead yet!\n\nDon't cremate me,\n\nDon't cremate me!\n\nI'm really not dead yet!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nYou animals,\n\nMongrels!\n\nSons of bitches!!!!!\n\nThis time, it was Zhou Ze's most frantic moment, and his most insane.\n\nHe knew,\n\nOnce he was cremated,\n\nthere would be no room for anything else!\n\nHe would directly face death!\n\nA complete and utter end!\n\nHe was unwilling, he was truly unwilling. He was not yet thirty years old, he hadn't started a family yet, he didn't have children yet, he still had a life ahead, he still had a long way to go!\n\n\"Mommy, I just saw this uncle's hand move,\" a little girl's timid voice sounded nearby.\n\n\"Slap!\" A small slap landed.\n\n\"Don't talk nonsense. I'll deal with you when we get home,\" the girl's mother reprimanded.\n\nZhou Ze despaired.\n\nBecause no matter how he struggled,\n\nhow he roared in his heart,\n\nthe people outside couldn't perceive it.\n\nHe was placed on the conveyor belt.\n\nThe machine started.\n\nHe was being pushed forward.\n\nHe knew what he was about to face.\n\nAnd because of this, he was incomparably terrified!\n\nNo,\n\nNo,\n\nNo!\n\nI'm not dead, I'm really not dead!\n\nDon't burn me!\n\nDon't burn me!\n\nNo one could hear his cries.\n\nThey were only responsible for being sad,\n\nonly responsible for being upset,\n\nonly responsible for completing this procedure,\n\nthen going home for dinner, and continuing life tomorrow.\n\nFinally,\n\nZhou Ze perceived that he seemed to have been pushed into a narrow place filled with the smell of oil residue.\n\nImmediately after,\n\na sticky liquid was sprayed onto his body.\n\nHe knew what this was.\n\nIt was gasoline.\n\nImmediately after,\n\n\"Sizzle...\"\n\nHot!\n\nExtremely hot!\n\nPain,\n\nIntense burning pain!\n\nFire,\n\nFire,\n\nHuge fire,\n\nFire everywhere............\n\n---\n*   The original text uses 喇嘛 (lǎma), which typically refers to a Buddhist monk, but in this context, it is understood as a typo for 喇叭 (lǎba), meaning 'horn' or 'trumpet'.\n**  A Chinese idiom meaning life is unpredictable and full of uncertainties.",

    "content": "Cold, So cold... Zhou Ze didn't know why it was so cold here, He walked on a secluded path. On both sides of the path, flowers bloomed everywhere, yet there was not the slightest romantic or beautiful atmosphere. The flowers were vibrant, like a series of taunts, and also like onlookers. Flowers bloom on the other shore, people go to rebirth; Zhou Ze remembered that his last memory before was fire, a big fire, terrifying flames completely engulfed him, that heart-pounding scorching temperature baked him into ash. But in the blink of an eye, But he came here. On this road, actually there are still many people, There are elderly people, Have children, There are also young people and middle-aged people, There are men and women, Everyone's clothes are different. Some people dress very simply, while others wear clothes that are bright red and purple, and their faces are also painted with excessive blush. Everyone is walking on tiptoe. 沒人說話， No one else made a sound either, Only the occasional 'cā cā cā' sound of shoe soles rubbing remained. 這段文字描繪了周澤澤在一個陌生環境中的感受，充滿了懸念和探索的意味。我們可以從幾個角度來解讀：\n\n**1. 周澤澤的狀態：**\n\n*   **麻木地前行：** 這暗示著他可能身處一個極度壓抑、缺乏生機的環境，或者他自己已經感到疲憊、無奈，失去了主動性。這種「麻木」可能是一種被動的跟隨，也可能是一種心理上的防禦機制。\n*   **不時地在張望，也在不時地回首：** 這表明他並非完全失去意識，而是有著觀察和思考的意願。\n    *   **張望：** 他在試圖了解周圍的環境，尋找線索，了解自己身處何處。\n    *   **回首：** 他可能在回憶自己是如何來到這裡的，或者在尋找來時的路，希望能找到逃離或理解的途徑。這種回首也可能是一種對過去的留戀或對現狀的困惑。\n\n**2. 他意識到的地方：**\n\n*   **隱約間意識到自己來到了什麼地方：** 「隱約」這個詞非常關鍵，說明他還沒有完全清晰的認知，但已經有了一種模糊的、潛在的感覺。這種感覺可能來自於：\n    *   **環境的特徵：** 可能是某種熟悉的氣味、聲音、景象，或者是一種難以言喻的氛圍。\n    *   **內心的預感：** 可能是他內心深處的一種直覺，一種不祥的預感，或者是一種對某種特定情境的聯想。\n    *   **集體的情緒：** 他跟著「所有人」一起前行，說明他可能身處一個集體行動中，而這個集體的狀態（麻木）也可能影響了他的感知。\n\n**3. 可能的場景和情境：**\n\n根據這段文字，我們可以聯想到一些可能的場景：\n\n*   **災難或末日場景：** 人們麻木地逃離或遷徙，周澤澤在其中尋找方向。\n*   **監獄或集中營：** 人們被迫集體行動，周澤澤試圖理解自己的處境。\n*   **夢境或幻覺：** 一種超現實的、令人不安的體驗。\n*   **某種儀式或集體活動：** 人們被引導著進行某種活動，周澤澤對其目的感到困惑。\n*   **精神上的困境：** 周澤澤可能正經歷一種心理上的迷失，周圍的人也處於類似的狀態。\n\n**總結來說，這段文字成功地營造了一種懸疑和不安的氛圍。周澤澤的「麻木」與他「張望回首」的行為形成了對比，突顯了他內心的掙扎和對未知的探索。他對自己所處之地的「隱約」意識，更是激發了讀者的好奇心，讓人想知道他究竟來到了怎樣一個地方，以及接下來會發生什麼。** 這句話非常簡潔有力，充滿了戲劇性和情感。它能引發很多聯想和猜測。\n\n我們可以從幾個角度來理解這句話：\n\n**字面意思：**\n\n*   **死亡的宣告：** 最直接的理解就是某個人已經離世。\n\n**情感和意境：**\n\n*   **悲傷與失落：** 這句話通常伴隨著深深的悲傷、失落、懷念，甚至是絕望。\n*   **結束與終結：** 它標誌著一段關係、一個時代、一個故事的結束。\n*   **無可挽回：** 死亡是絕對的，這句話傳達了一種無可挽回的現實。\n*   **戲劇性與張力：** 在故事或對話中，這句話往往是關鍵的轉折點，能瞬間抓住聽眾或讀者的注意力。\n\n**可能的情境：**\n\n這句話可以出現在各種情境中：\n\n*   **悼詞或追思會：** 紀念逝者。\n*   **小說或劇本：** 揭示角色的命運，推動劇情發展。\n*   **個人獨白或回憶：** 表達對已故親友的思念。\n*   **歷史敘事：** 記錄某位歷史人物的離世。\n*   **比喻意義：** 有時也可能用來形容某種精神上的死亡，或者某種事物的徹底終結，儘管字面上是說“人”。\n\n**接下來會發生什麼？**\n\n這句話本身是一個開端，它會引發後續的思考和行動：\n\n*   **人們會如何反應？** 悲傷、憤怒、解脫？\n*   **這對其他人有什麼影響？**\n*   **他留下了什麼？** 遺產、回憶、未竟的事業？\n*   **故事將如何繼續？**\n\n總之，“他，已經死了；”這句話雖然簡短，卻蘊含著豐富的意義和情感，能夠引發聽者或讀者無限的聯想。\n\n您是在什麼情境下聽到或看到這句話的呢？ 了解更多背景信息，或許能更深入地理解它的含義。 「而這裡，」這是一個非常開放的開頭，可以引導出各種各樣的敘述。為了能更好地理解您想表達的意思，您能否提供更多上下文？\n\n例如，您想表達的是：\n\n*   **地點的描述？** (例如：「而這裡，陽光灑滿了整個庭院。」)\n*   **情況的對比？** (例如：「他們在遠方奮鬥，而這裡，一切都靜止不動。」)\n*   **一個轉折點？** (例如：「經過漫長的旅途，而這裡，我們終於找到了歸宿。」)\n*   **一個新的開始？** (例如：「過去的都已過去，而這裡，是全新的開始。」)\n*   **一個特定的情境？** (例如：「在會議室裡，大家都在討論方案，而這裡，我獨自一人思考著。」)\n\n請告訴我您想表達的具體內容，我才能給您更貼切的回應。 「是地獄。」\n\n這句話可以有很多種解讀，取決於說話者當時的情境、語氣和感受。\n\n以下是一些可能的解讀：\n\n**字面上的意思：**\n\n*   **真的地獄：** 如果是在宗教或神話的語境下，這句話可能是在描述一個真實存在的、充滿痛苦和折磨的地方。\n\n**比喻上的意思：**\n\n*   **極度的痛苦和折磨：** 這是最常見的用法。說話者可能正在經歷極度的身體或精神痛苦，感到無法忍受。\n    *   例如：在經歷一場非常痛苦的手術後，病人可能會說「是地獄。」\n    *   例如：在經歷一段極度壓抑和不快樂的關係後，可能會說「那段日子真是地獄。」\n*   **極度的困難和挑戰：** 這句話也可以用來形容一個情況非常艱難、充滿障礙，讓人感到絕望。\n    *   例如：在一個極度混亂和低效的工作環境中，員工可能會說「這裡簡直是地獄。」\n    *   例如：在一個充滿危險和敵意的環境中，可能會說「我們現在身處地獄。」\n*   **極度的無聊和枯燥：** 有時，這句話也可能用來形容一種極度無聊、缺乏刺激、讓人感到時間難熬的狀態。\n    *   例如：在一個非常冗長且無趣的會議中，有人可能會低聲說「這簡直是地獄。」\n*   **道德上的墮落或邪惡：** 在某些情況下，這句話也可能用來形容一個地方或一群人充滿了邪惡、腐敗和道德淪喪。\n    *   例如：在描述一個犯罪猖獗、道德敗壞的城市時，可能會說「那個地方就是地獄。」\n\n**總結來說，當一個人說「是地獄」時，通常是在表達一種極度負面的感受，無論是關於痛苦、困難、無聊還是邪惡。**\n\n您能提供更多關於您說這句話的背景嗎？這樣我才能更精確地理解您的意思。 這是一句充滿意境的開場白，讓人聯想到陰森、神秘、或是莊嚴的場景。\n\n它可以是：\n\n*   **一個故事的開頭：** 描繪一個關於死亡、靈魂、或冥界的故事。\n*   **一個詩歌的引子：** 營造一種肅穆、悲傷、或哲思的氛圍。\n*   **一個遊戲或電影的場景描述：** 讓玩家或觀眾對即將進入的世界產生想像。\n*   **一個哲學或宗教的探討：** 關於生命終結、靈魂去向的思考。\n\n這句話本身就帶有強烈的畫面感和情感色彩。\n\n你希望我對這句話做什麼呢？例如：\n\n*   **繼續這個故事？**\n*   **寫一首詩？**\n*   **描述這個世界？**\n*   **探討它的含義？**\n\n請告訴我你的想法！ 您好！您想让我做什么？\n\n请告诉我您想让我做什么，例如：\n\n*   **写一篇文章？** 关于什么主题？\n*   **回答一个问题？** 您有什么疑问？\n*   **翻译一段文字？** 请提供您想翻译的内容。\n*   **创作一个故事？** 您有什么想法或关键词？\n*   **提供一些建议？** 关于什么方面？\n*   **进行一次对话？** 您想聊些什么？\n\n我在这里随时准备为您提供帮助！ 這句話很簡短，但充滿了情感和故事。它可能代表著很多不同的情境，例如：\n\n*   **親人的離世：** 這是最常見的聯想，可能是一位長輩、親戚、朋友，甚至是寵物。\n*   **一段關係的結束：** 雖然不是生命的終結，但一段重要的關係（愛情、友情）的結束，有時也會讓人感覺像是「死了」。\n*   **一個夢想或希望的破滅：** 曾經懷抱的夢想，經過努力卻未能實現，最終只能放棄，也會帶來一種「死了」的感覺。\n*   **某種精神或意志的消亡：** 一個人可能因為經歷了巨大的打擊，而失去了原有的活力、熱情或信念，精神上彷彿「死了」。\n*   **一個時代或事物的終結：** 一個重要的歷史事件、一個曾經輝煌的組織、一種傳統的消亡，也可能被形容為「死了」。\n\n**當你說出「終究還是死了」時，你可能想表達的是：**\n\n*   **悲傷和失落：** 對失去的深深的痛苦。\n*   **無奈和接受：** 雖然痛苦，但不得不面對現實。\n*   **遺憾：** 可能還有未竟的心願，或者對過程中的某些事情感到遺憾。\n*   **結束和解脫：** 在某些情況下，死亡也可能意味著痛苦的結束。\n\n**如果你願意分享更多，我很樂意傾聽。** 你想說說這句話背後的故事嗎？ 這句話表達了一種迷茫和無助的狀態。可以從以下幾個角度來理解和延伸：\n\n**核心含義：**\n\n*   **迷失方向：** 他對當前的處境感到困惑，不知道下一步該往哪裡走。\n*   **缺乏決斷力：** 面對多個可能性或沒有明確的道路時，他無法做出決定。\n*   **內心掙扎：** 可能是在權衡利弊，或者被各種因素所困擾，導致無法下定決心。\n*   **無能為力感：** 感覺自己被動，無法掌控局面，也無法找到解決問題的方法。\n\n**可以延伸的場景和情境：**\n\n*   **人生重大抉擇：** 比如畢業後不知道該找工作還是繼續深造，或者在事業發展中面臨轉型。\n*   **感情問題：** 在一段關係中遇到瓶頸，不知道是繼續還是放手。\n*   **工作中的難題：** 面對複雜的項目，不知道如何著手，或者在多個方案中難以抉擇。\n*   **生活中的困境：** 遇到突發狀況，不知道如何應對，或者在多個選項中感到無所適從。\n*   **道德或倫理上的兩難：** 面對需要做出艱難選擇的道德困境。\n\n**可以進一步描述的感受：**\n\n*   焦慮、不安、壓力\n*   沮喪、失落、無力\n*   猶豫不決、搖擺不定\n*   思緒混亂、頭緒不清\n\n**可以思考的後續發展：**\n\n*   他會尋求幫助嗎？（朋友、家人、導師、心理諮詢師）\n*   他會嘗試分析情況嗎？（列出優缺點、收集信息）\n*   他會暫時擱置問題嗎？\n*   他會憑藉直覺做出選擇嗎？\n*   他會因為這種狀態而錯失機會嗎？\n\n**這句話可以作為一個故事的開頭，或者一個角色的內心獨白。**\n\n例如，可以這樣延續：\n\n*   「他不知道該怎麼辦，也不知道該做出何種選擇，只能茫然地看著眼前的岔路口，任由風吹亂了他的頭髮。」\n*   「他不知道該怎麼辦，也不知道該做出何種選擇，腦海裡像一團亂麻，每一個選項都帶著未知的風險。」\n*   「他不知道該怎麼辦，也不知道該做出何種選擇，這種無力感讓他感到窒息，彷彿被困在一個無形的牢籠裡。」\n\n總之，這句話非常生動地描繪了一種普遍存在的心理狀態，可以引發讀者對角色處境的共鳴和思考。 這段文字描繪了一個極度困境中的人物，他的內心充滿了恐懼、迷茫和無助。我們可以從幾個層面來理解和延伸：\n\n**核心情感：**\n\n*   **求生本能的強烈：** 「他不想死，人，都是不想死的」直接點出了人類最基本、最原始的生存慾望。這是一種強烈的生命力，即使在絕境中，這份渴望依然存在。\n*   **極度的迷茫與無助：** 「但在這個地方，他完全不知道自己又該如何是好，他很迷茫，也很無助。」這是人物當前狀態的精確描寫。\n    *   **「這個地方」：** 這個「地方」不僅僅是物理空間，更可能是一種心理狀態、一種無法擺脫的境遇、一種失去方向的處境。它可能是字面意義上的監獄、荒野，也可能是精神上的絕望、困境。\n    *   **「完全不知道自己又該如何是好」：** 這表明他失去了行動的方向和解決問題的能力。所有的選項似乎都行不通，或者他根本無法辨識出任何可行的出路。\n    *   **「迷茫」：** 失去了目標、意義和方向感。他不知道自己為何在此，也不知道下一步該往哪裡走。\n    *   **「無助」：** 感覺自己孤立無援，無法依靠任何力量來改變現狀。他可能沒有支援，或者即使有，也無法觸及。\n\n**可以延伸的思考方向：**\n\n1.  **「這個地方」的具體化：**\n    *   **物理困境：** 他是被囚禁了嗎？迷失在荒野中？身處戰亂之地？\n    *   **心理困境：** 他是否經歷了巨大的創傷？是否陷入了無法自拔的絕望情緒？是否對人生失去了信心？\n    *   **社會困境：** 他是否被社會排斥？是否身處一個壓迫性的環境？\n\n2.  **導致迷茫和無助的原因：**\n    *   **突發的變故：** 之前可能一切都好，但突如其來的事件讓他措手不及。\n    *   **長期的壓抑：** 長時間處於不利的環境中，最終耗盡了他的應對能力。\n    *   **失去重要事物：** 親人、朋友、目標、信仰的喪失，讓他感到空虛和無所適從。\n    *   **信息不對稱：** 他可能不知道關鍵的信息，無法做出正確的判斷。\n\n3.  **人物的內心掙扎：**\n    *   **求生與絕望的拉扯：** 雖然不想死，但現實的無力感讓他瀕臨絕望。\n    *   **對過去的回憶：** 他是否會回憶起過去的美好時光，這反而加劇了現在的痛苦？\n    *   **對未來的恐懼：** 他是否對未來感到極度恐懼，因為看不到任何希望？\n\n4.  **故事的潛在發展：**\n    *   **尋求轉機：** 即使迷茫，他是否會嘗試做些什麼，哪怕是微小的行動？\n    *   **外部的介入：** 是否會有其他人或事件出現，來打破他的困境？\n    *   **內心的轉變：** 他是否會從絕望中找到新的力量或意義？\n\n**總結來說，這段文字成功地營造了一種令人窒息的氛圍，將讀者帶入了一個角色極度脆弱、無力反抗的境地。它觸及了人類最深層的恐懼和最基本的生存渴望，為後續的故事發展留下了巨大的空間。** 이 소리는 무엇을 표현하는 것일까요? 몇 가지 가능성을 생각해 볼 수 있습니다.\n\n*   **아기나 어린아이의 소리:** \"咿呀\"는 아기들이 내는 소리, 특히 울거나 칭얼거리는 소리를 묘사할 때 자주 사용됩니다.\n*   **고통이나 괴로움:** 무언가 아프거나 힘들 때 내는 신음 소리나 고통스러운 소리를 표현할 수도 있습니다.\n*   **놀람이나 당황:** 예상치 못한 상황에 놀라거나 당황했을 때 나오는 소리일 수도 있습니다.\n*   **기쁨이나 흥분:** 드물지만, 너무 기쁘거나 흥분해서 나오는 소리를 표현할 때도 사용될 수 있습니다.\n*   **동물의 소리:** 특정 동물의 울음소리를 묘사하는 것일 수도 있습니다.\n\n어떤 상황에서 이 소리를 들으셨거나 보셨는지 알려주시면 더 정확하게 어떤 의미인지 파악하는 데 도움이 될 것 같습니다. 這是一句非常富有詩意的開頭，它營造了一種寧靜、悠遠的氛圍。我可以從這句話聯想到很多畫面和感受，例如：\n\n**畫面感：**\n\n*   **夜晚的寧靜：** 月光灑落，萬籟俱寂，只有遠處傳來的清冷小調打破了沉寂。\n*   **山間的孤寂：** 在空曠的山谷或森林中，一絲若有若無的旋律迴盪，帶著幾分孤寂和清幽。\n*   **古老的記憶：** 彷彿來自遙遠的過去，一首承載著歷史和情感的旋律，在空氣中緩緩流淌。\n*   **思念的低語：** 可能是某人遙遠的思念，化作這清冷的旋律，傳遞著淡淡的憂傷。\n*   **自然的迴響：** 可能是風吹過竹林或樹葉的聲音，被巧妙地比喻為「清冷的小調」。\n\n**情感感受：**\n\n*   **清冷、孤寂：** 「清冷」這個詞直接點出了旋律的特質，帶有一絲疏離感。\n*   **悠遠、綿長：** 「自遠處傳來」暗示了旋律的距離感，也讓它顯得更加悠長和耐人尋味。\n*   **寧靜、安詳：** 在這份清冷中，也可能蘊含著一種超脫世俗的寧靜。\n*   **淡淡的憂傷或懷舊：** 這種旋律很容易引發人們內心深處的情感，可能是對過去的懷念，也可能是對現狀的一絲感傷。\n*   **神秘、引人遐想：** 由於旋律來自遠處，且是「小調」，更容易讓人產生好奇，想去探究它的來源和背後的故事。\n\n**接下來，這句話可以引導出很多不同的發展方向，例如：**\n\n*   **描寫聽者的反應：** 「聽者不禁駐足，側耳傾聽，彷彿要將這份清冷融入心間。」\n*   **描寫旋律的具體內容：** 「那是一支古老的歌謠，訴說著一段被遺忘的愛情。」\n*   **描寫旋律的來源：** 「原來是山坡上那位孤獨的樂師，正在彈奏著他心中的哀愁。」\n*   **將旋律與環境融合：** 「清冷的月光如同這旋律一般，灑滿了寂靜的庭院。」\n\n總之，這是一句非常優美的開頭，充滿了想像空間。您想讓這句話引導出怎樣的故事或意境呢？ 周澤撇過頭，看見遠處走來一朵朵的鮮紅，而周圍其他人對此都熟視無睹，繼續麻木地踮著自己的腳後跟往前走去。 When they got closer, Zhou Ze saw clearly that those splashes of vibrant red were peach blossom paper umbrellas. In the distance, there was a group of women, forming a line, holding paper umbrellas, walking gracefully. They were tall, with seductive physiques, all wearing purple qipaos. As they walked, the flesh-color of their thighs was occasionally revealed, a subtle allure that made hearts palpitate. The women had their hair coiled into buns, not a single strand out of place, and even their steps were perfectly aligned, as if they were the world's most excellent song and dance troupe, and, they had already rehearsed for over a hundred years. They are walking, They are marching, From one end of the path, walk to the other end, Coincidentally, Passed by in front of Zhou Ze. Exquisite makeup, snow-white skin, and that hummed, clear and cold long tune, together evoked a misty and hazy Old Shanghai atmosphere. On every woman's wrist, bracelets were worn, of varying colors and sizes, setting off their snow-white, delicate wrists, making them even more dazzling to behold. “可惜”后面可以接很多内容，取决于你想表达什么。\n\n请告诉我你想表达的“可惜”是什么意思，我才能更好地帮你完成句子。\n\n例如，你可以说：\n\n* **可惜，我没能赶上火车。** (表达遗憾)\n* **可惜，他没有得到那个机会。** (表达惋惜)\n* **可惜，天气不好，我们不能去野餐了。** (表达失望)\n* **可惜，这个想法很好，但执行起来有困难。** (表达对情况的评价)\n\n你想要表达的是哪种“可惜”呢？ 這句話的後半句可以有很多種接法，取決於你想表達的意思。以下是一些可能的延續，以及它們所傳達的不同語境：\n\n**強調她們的獨特性或與商業區的對比：**\n\n* **她們不是行走在南大街商業步行區，而是穿梭於古老的巷弄之間。** (強調歷史感、傳統感)\n* **她們不是行走在南大街商業步行區，而是漫步在寧靜的公園小徑上。** (強調悠閒、自然)\n* **她們不是行走在南大街商業步行區，而是奔波於繁忙的工作場所。** (強調忙碌、職業)\n* **她們不是行走在南大街商業步行區，而是沉浸在藝術家的工作室裡。** (強調創造力、藝術氛圍)\n* **她們不是行走在南大街商業步行區，而是探索著未知的邊疆。** (強調冒險、探索精神)\n\n**強調她們的目標或目的不同：**\n\n* **她們不是行走在南大街商業步行區，而是為了尋找靈感而來。** (強調內在追求)\n* **她們不是行走在南大街商業步行區，而是為了完成一項秘密任務。** (強調神秘感、特殊目的)\n* **她們不是行走在南大街商業步行區，而是為了參與一場盛大的慶典。** (強調參與感、節日氛圍)\n\n**更具詩意或象徵性的接法：**\n\n* **她們不是行走在南大街商業步行區，而是行走在自己的世界裡。** (強調內心獨立、自我的空間)\n* **她們不是行走在南大街商業步行區，而是行走在時間的長河中。** (強調歷史感、永恆感)\n\n**為了給你更精準的建議，請告訴我：**\n\n* **你想表達的重點是什麼？**\n* **你希望營造什麼樣的氛圍？**\n* **這句話是出現在什麼樣的語境中？** (例如：小說、散文、詩歌、新聞報導等)\n\n有了這些信息，我才能提供更貼切的接法。 這句話的意思是：\n\n* **「也不是金碧輝煌的高端會所」**：這部分描述了某個地方或事物 **不是** 像高級會所那樣，裝潢華麗、金碧輝煌、非常奢華的樣子。\n* **「瓦台」**：這裡的「瓦台」很可能是指 **青瓦台（Cheong Wa Dae）**，也就是韓國總統府。青瓦台的建築風格通常是傳統的韓國宮殿式建築，雖然莊嚴肅穆，但並非以金碧輝煌的現代奢華風格著稱。\n\n**綜合起來，這句話可能是在比較某個地方或事物，說明它不像青瓦台那樣，也不是那種金碧輝煌的高級會所。**\n\n這句話可能出現在以下情境：\n\n* **描述一個地方的風格：** 例如，在描述一個餐廳、一個辦公室、一個住宅，說它既沒有青瓦台那樣的歷史感和莊重感，也沒有高級會所那樣的奢華感。\n* **對比兩種不同的風格：** 可能是在討論某種設計理念或場所的定位，將其與青瓦台和高端會所進行對比。\n* **表達一種樸實或中庸的風格：** 暗示這個地方或事物可能是一種比較樸實、自然、或者介於兩者之間的風格。\n\n**總之，這句話的重點在於排除兩種極端的風格：一是傳統的莊嚴（青瓦台），二是現代的奢華（金碧輝煌的高端會所）。** 這句詩意非常濃烈，充滿了死亡、悲傷和宿命感。它可以引發很多聯想，具體的意思會根據上下文而有所不同。\n\n以下是一些可能的解讀和聯想：\n\n**字面上的解讀：**\n\n*   **黃泉路：** 在中國傳統文化中，黃泉路是通往陰間的道路，是死者靈魂的歸宿。\n*   **她們：** 指的是一群女性。\n*   **腳踩著黃泉路：** 這意味著她們正走向死亡，或者已經踏上了死亡的旅程。\n\n**引申的含義和聯想：**\n\n*   **悲劇的命運：** 這句話暗示了這些女性的命運是悲慘的，她們無法逃脫死亡的結局。\n*   **集體的死亡：** \"她們\" 表明這不是一個單獨的個體，而是一群人共同走向死亡，這可能是一場災難、戰爭、迫害，或是某種集體的悲劇。\n*   **無奈與絕望：** 腳踩著黃泉路，可能是一種無法抗拒的命運，她們可能沒有選擇，只能無奈地走向終點，充滿絕望。\n*   **犧牲與奉獻：** 在某些情境下，走向黃泉路也可能是一種犧牲，為了某個更高的目標而獻出生命。\n*   **歷史的見證：** 這句話可以是對歷史上某些悲慘事件的描寫，例如戰爭中的女性、遭受迫害的群體等。\n*   **詩意的描寫：** 即使沒有具體的事件，這句話本身也具有強烈的詩意，用來描繪一種淒美、哀傷的畫面。\n\n**為了更準確地理解，需要知道這句話的出處或上下文。**\n\n例如，如果這句話出現在：\n\n*   **一首關於戰爭的詩歌中：** 可能是在描寫戰場上犧牲的女性。\n*   **一個關於古代宮廷鬥爭的故事中：** 可能是在描寫被捲入權力鬥爭而喪命的妃嬪或宮女。\n*   **一個關於民間傳說的故事中：** 可能是在描寫因各種原因而早逝的女性。\n\n總之，\"她們腳踩著黃泉路\" 是一句非常有力且充滿情感的表達，它描繪了一幅令人心痛的畫面，讓人聯想到死亡、悲劇和無奈的命運。 這句詩句非常優美，充滿了意境。它描繪了一個畫面，讓人聯想到：\n\n*   **彼岸花：** 這種花通常與死亡、輪迴、思念、分離等意象聯繫在一起，在文學和文化中具有特殊的象徵意義。\n*   **花海：** 廣闊無垠的花朵，營造出一種壯麗、迷離、甚至有些淒美的氛圍。\n*   **掠過：** 這個詞語暗示著一種快速、短暫的經過，可能是一種視覺上的掃描，也可能是一種心靈上的觸動。\n\n綜合起來，這句詩可以引發很多聯想，例如：\n\n*   **生命的短暫與流逝：** 就像掠過花海一樣，生命中的美好時光或經歷，可能只是匆匆一瞥。\n*   **對彼岸的思念或嚮往：** 彼岸花本身就帶有對彼岸的意味，掠過花海可能是在思念遠方的人，或是對另一種境界的憧憬。\n*   **一種超脫或解脫：** 掠過花海，可能意味著擺脫了塵世的煩惱，進入了一種更為寧靜或超然的狀態。\n*   **一種夢幻般的體驗：** 彼岸花海本身就帶有神秘和夢幻的色彩，掠過其中，可能是一種如夢似幻的經歷。\n\n**您想進一步探討這句詩的哪個方面呢？** 例如：\n\n*   您覺得這句詩表達了什麼樣的情感？\n*   您聯想到什麼樣的畫面或故事？\n*   您想知道彼岸花在文化中有哪些象徵意義？\n\n我很樂意與您一起探討！ They looked straight ahead, the latter staring at the former, The foremost one, Then his eyes were empty. When the last woman passed by from in front of Zhou Ze, The woman suddenly turned her head and looked at Zhou Ze. Originally the world's most beautiful, Now, Directly jump to another extreme. Horror? Of course terrifying! Disgusting? 您好！您說的「噁心」是指什麼呢？\n\n如果您願意分享更多細節，我或許能更好地理解您的感受，並提供更合適的回應。\n\n例如，您是在描述：\n\n*   **某種食物或味道？**\n*   **某個畫面或景象？**\n*   **某種行為或情況？**\n*   **一種情緒或感覺？**\n\n請告訴我更多，我會盡力理解。 這句話充滿了懸念和哲學意味，可以從幾個層面來解讀：\n\n**1. 關於「死」與「鬼」的界定：**\n\n* **人會被嚇死：** 這句話點出了人類的生理極限。極度的恐懼可以引發心臟驟停、呼吸衰竭等，導致死亡。這是我們對「死」的普遍認知。\n* **但鬼呢？** 這句話拋出了一個關鍵問題：鬼，作為一種超自然的存在，是否也遵循同樣的生理或心理法則？鬼是否能被「嚇」？\n\n**2. 潛在的恐懼來源：**\n\n* **周澤是死人：** 這句話確立了周澤的狀態，他已經脫離了生者的範疇。\n* **鬼的恐懼：** 如果周澤已經是鬼，那麼是什麼讓他感到恐懼？\n    * **對自身存在的恐懼？** 鬼是否會對自己成為鬼感到恐懼，例如對永恆的孤獨、對無法超脫的恐懼？\n    * **對其他力量的恐懼？** 鬼是否會害怕更強大的鬼、神明、或者某些能夠傷害鬼的力量？\n    * **對生者的恐懼？** 雖然鬼通常被認為是恐懼生者，但有沒有可能，某些鬼也會因為某些原因而害怕生者？例如，生者身上帶著的陽氣、某些法器，或者生者所代表的某種力量。\n    * **對過去的恐懼？** 鬼是否會因為生前的罪孽、遺憾或未了的心願而感到恐懼？\n    * **對「不存在」的恐懼？** 鬼是否會害怕徹底消失，或者被遺忘？\n\n**3. 敘事上的懸念和引導：**\n\n這句話非常巧妙地設置了一個懸念，讓讀者不禁想知道：\n\n* **周澤為何會死？**\n* **周澤現在是什麼狀態？是鬼嗎？**\n* **如果周澤是鬼，他為何會感到恐懼？**\n* **是什麼東西能讓一個鬼感到恐懼？**\n\n這句話可以引導讀者進入一個關於鬼魂、恐懼、死亡和超自然力量的故事。它暗示著故事的發展可能與周澤的死亡以及他作為鬼的經歷有關。\n\n**總結來說，這句話的核心在於挑戰我們對「恐懼」和「死亡」的既有認知，並將其延伸到超自然領域。它暗示著，即使是已經死亡的周澤，也可能面臨著一種我們難以想像的、來自鬼魂層面的恐懼。** 這句話可以有很多種解讀，取決於上下文。以下是一些可能的解釋：\n\n**1. 單純的觀察：**\n\n* **女人只是在看著周澤。** 這可能是最直接的理解，她可能只是在觀察他的外貌、表情、動作，或者他正在做的事情。\n\n**2. 帶有情感的觀察：**\n\n* **女人對周澤有好感或愛慕。** 她可能在欣賞他的魅力、才華，或者他身上吸引她的特質。\n* **女人對周澤感到好奇。** 她可能想了解他，或者對他正在做的事情感到不解。\n* **女人對周澤感到擔憂或關心。** 如果周澤看起來有什麼不對勁，她可能會帶著關切的眼神看著他。\n* **女人對周澤感到不滿或敵意。** 如果她對周澤有負面情緒，她的眼神可能帶著責備、輕蔑或憤怒。\n* **女人對周澤感到懷疑或警惕。** 她可能覺得周澤有什麼隱藏的意圖，或者對他保持戒心。\n\n**3. 帶有目的的觀察：**\n\n* **女人在等待周澤。** 她可能在等他開口、等他行動，或者等他注意到她。\n* **女人在尋求周澤的幫助或同意。** 她可能想從他那裡得到什麼，或者需要他的許可。\n* **女人在觀察周澤的反應。** 她可能在測試他，或者想知道他對某件事情的看法。\n\n**4. 象徵性的觀察：**\n\n* **女人在審視周澤的價值或潛力。** 這可能是在一個更深層次的層面上，評估他是否適合某個角色、某個機會，或者是否值得她付出。\n\n**為了更準確地理解這句話，我們需要更多的上下文信息，例如：**\n\n* **女人和周澤的關係是什麼？** 他們是朋友、戀人、同事、陌生人，還是敵人？\n* **當時的場景是什麼？** 他們在哪裡？在做什麼？\n* **女人的表情和肢體語言是什麼樣的？**\n* **周澤當時的狀態是什麼樣的？**\n\n**總之，\"女人看著周澤\" 這句話本身是中性的，但它所蘊含的情感和意圖，需要通過周圍的環境和細節來判斷。**\n\n如果你能提供更多關於這個場景的資訊，我可以給你更具體的分析。 這句話的意思是：\n\n**周澤也在看著那個女人。**\n\n這是一個非常直接的陳述，描述了周澤的行為。\n\n如果你想知道更多關於這個場景的資訊，例如：\n\n*   **周澤為什麼在看那個女人？**\n*   **那個女人是誰？**\n*   **周澤在想什麼？**\n*   **這個場景發生在哪裡？**\n\n你需要提供更多的上下文資訊。 這段文字描繪了一個非常生動的畫面，充滿了視覺和情感的張力。我們可以從幾個方面來分析：\n\n**視覺描寫：**\n\n*   **目光交匯：** 「二者目光短暫交匯」是整個場景的開端，暗示了兩個人之間可能存在的聯繫、好奇、或者僅僅是偶然的對視。這個「短暫」增加了神秘感和瞬間的吸引力。\n*   **女人前行：** 「女人繼續往前走」是動作的延續，將視線從對視轉移到女人的行動上。\n*   **身段搖曳：** 「身段搖曳」是一個非常具體的描寫，不僅指身體的擺動，更傳達出一種韻律感和女性的柔美。\n*   **背影裊裊：** 「背影裊裊」進一步加強了女人的形象，營造出一種飄逸、朦朧的美感，讓人對她的正面形象產生想像。\n*   **旗袍的緊緻與身材的勾勒：** 「旗袍的緊緻，將其秀美的身材勾勒得淋漓盡致」是這段描寫的點睛之筆。旗袍作為一種經典服飾，本身就帶有東方韻味和性感元素。它的「緊緻」強調了服飾與身體的貼合，而「勾勒得淋漓盡致」則直接點出了服飾如何完美地展現了女人「秀美的身材」，這種描寫非常直接且富有感染力，讓人聯想到女性的曲線美和魅力。\n\n**情感和氛圍：**\n\n*   **吸引力與神秘感：** 短暫的目光交匯和隨後女人離去的背影，營造了一種吸引力，讓人想知道這個女人是誰，她要去哪裡，以及她為何如此引人注目。\n*   **古典與現代的融合：** 旗袍的出現，將場景帶入了一種古典的氛圍，而「緊緻」、「勾勒」等詞語又賦予了現代的性感和張揚。\n*   **含蓄的性感：** 雖然描寫直接，但通過「身段搖曳」、「背影裊裊」和旗袍的「勾勒」，這種性感是含蓄而富有韻味的，而非露骨的。\n\n**總結來說，這段文字通過精準的詞語和細膩的描寫，成功地塑造了一個充滿魅力的女性形象，並營造了一種引人遐想的氛圍。它不僅僅是簡單的視覺呈現，更包含了對女性身體美和服飾美的一種讚美和欣賞。**\n\n如果這段文字是小說或故事的一部分，它很可能預示著這個女人將在故事中扮演重要角色，或者她的出現將對敘事產生影響。 這是一個非常常見且重要的問題，可以有很多種回答方式，取決於說話的語境和說話者與聽話者之間的關係。\n\n以下是一些可能的回答方向和範例：\n\n**1. 簡單直接的回答：**\n\n*   **「我們要去 [地點]。」** (最常見、最直接的回答)\n    *   例如：「我們要去公園。」、「我們要去超市。」、「我們要去電影院。」\n*   **「我們正要去 [活動/目的]。」** (強調目的)\n    *   例如：「我們正要去買晚餐。」、「我們正要去散步。」、「我們正要去拜訪朋友。」\n\n**2. 稍微詳細的回答：**\n\n*   **「我們正要去 [地點]，因為 [原因]。」** (提供更多資訊)\n    *   例如：「我們要去圖書館，因為我想借幾本書。」、「我們要去醫院，因為我有點不舒服。」\n*   **「我們打算去 [地點]，然後 [下一個地點/活動]。」** (說明行程)\n    *   例如：「我們打算去咖啡廳，然後再去逛街。」\n\n**3. 模糊或保留的回答：**\n\n*   **「沒什麼，只是出去一下。」** (不想透露太多細節)\n*   **「隨便走走。」** (表示沒有特定目的地)\n*   **「有點事要辦。」** (比較籠統的說法)\n*   **「我們還沒決定。」** (如果還在猶豫)\n\n**4. 幽默或俏皮的回答：**\n\n*   **「去尋找寶藏！」**\n*   **「去拯救世界！」**\n*   **「去一個只有我們知道的地方。」**\n\n**5. 如果是問句反問：**\n\n*   **「你呢？你要去哪裡？」** (將問題拋回給對方)\n\n**在回答時，可以考慮以下幾點：**\n\n*   **你和問話者的關係：** 對親近的人可以更隨意，對陌生人或長輩則可能需要更正式或禮貌。\n*   **問話者的意圖：** 他是單純好奇，還是有其他目的？\n*   **你是否願意分享：** 有些事情你可能不想讓別人知道。\n\n**所以，如果你想知道「你們……要去哪裡？」的回答，請告訴我更多關於「你們」和「要去哪裡」的背景資訊，我才能給你更精確的建議。**\n\n例如，你可以告訴我：\n\n*   **誰在問？** (朋友、家人、同事、陌生人？)\n*   **你們是誰？** (你們是一群朋友、一對情侶、一家人？)\n*   **你們現在在哪裡？** (在家裡、在公司、在路上？)\n*   **你們的表情或語氣是怎樣的？** (是輕鬆的、嚴肅的、好奇的？)\n\n有了這些資訊，我就可以提供更貼切的回答了！ 「」 這句話描述了一個場景：\n\n*   **周澤** 是一個角色。\n*   他**下意識地** 跟著一隊女人往前走，這表示他可能沒有經過深思熟慮，而是被某種情況或衝動驅使。\n*   這樣一來，他就**脫離了原本的隊伍**，這意味著他不再與他原先所在的小組或人群在一起了。\n\n這句話暗示了周澤可能因為跟隨這隊女人而進入了一個新的、未知的環境，或者與他原先的目標或同伴產生了分離。 這句話可以有很多種接續方式，取決於你想表達的情感、場景或故事走向。以下提供幾種不同的可能性，並說明它們可能帶來的意境：\n\n**強調孤獨或沉思：**\n\n* **而小徑上木訥行走的人，彷彿與世隔絕，只剩下自己的影子陪伴。** (強調孤獨感，畫面感強)\n* **而小徑上木訥行走的人，心中藏著無數未說出口的話，腳步沉重而緩慢。** (暗示內心世界的豐富與壓抑)\n* **而小徑上木訥行走的人，眼神望向遠方，似乎在尋找著什麼，又像是在逃避著什麼。** (營造一種神秘感和不確定性)\n* **而小徑上木訥行走的人，每一步都踏著自己的思緒，沉浸在自己的世界裡。** (強調內省和專注)\n\n**強調環境的襯托：**\n\n* **而小徑上木訥行走的人，在落葉紛飛的秋日裡，更顯得孤寂。** (利用季節營造氛圍)\n* **而小徑上木訥行走的人，被兩旁的參天古木默默守護，彷彿時間在這裡凝固。** (營造一種寧靜、古老的氛圍)\n* **而小徑上木訥行走的人，腳下的泥土沾濕了露珠，映照著他沉默的身影。** (細膩描寫環境，烘托人物)\n\n**暗示故事的發展：**\n\n* **而小徑上木訥行走的人，並不知道前方等待著他的是什麼。** (製造懸念，引導讀者好奇)\n* **而小徑上木訥行走的人，終於走出了迷茫，迎向了新的開始。** (預示著轉變和希望)\n* **而小徑上木訥行走的人，每一步都堅定而有力，彷彿下定了某個重要的決心。** (展現人物的內在力量)\n\n**更具象的描寫：**\n\n* **而小徑上木訥行走的人，肩上扛著沉重的擔子，汗水順著額角滑落。** (描寫具體的勞動或負擔)\n* **而小徑上木訥行走的人，手中緊握著一封信，似乎承載著重要的訊息。** (增加故事的戲劇性)\n\n**在選擇接續時，可以思考以下問題：**\n\n* **你想讓讀者感受到什麼？** (孤獨、平靜、懸念、希望？)\n* **這個人為什麼木訥行走？** (有什麼心事？有什麼目的？)\n* **這個場景有什麼特別之處？** (環境如何影響人物？)\n\n請告訴我你想要表達的感覺，我可以提供更精準的建議！ 這段文字描繪了一個非常引人入勝的場景，充滿了神秘和對比。我們可以從幾個方面來理解它：\n\n**核心對比：**\n\n*   **周澤 vs. 其他人：** 最核心的對比是周澤與「他們」之間的差異。\n    *   **「他們」的特徵：**\n        *   **沒有看向這裡：** 表明他們缺乏關注、目標或意圖，或者他們的注意力被完全吸引到其他地方，但這種「吸引」並非出於主動思考。\n        *   **似乎不會思考：** 這是最關鍵的描述，暗示他們缺乏獨立思考、判斷或決策的能力。他們可能只是機械地執行某種指令，或者被某種外力所驅動。\n        *   **也沒有感知：** 這進一步加強了他們非自主性的特點。他們可能對周遭環境、自身狀態，甚至周澤的存在都沒有任何意識。\n    *   **周澤的特徵：**\n        *   **仿佛是其中的異類：** 這句話直接點明了周澤的獨特性。他與周圍的群體格格不入，與他們的狀態截然不同。\n\n**可能的解讀和聯想：**\n\n這段文字可以引發很多聯想，具體取決於上下文，但一些常見的解讀方向包括：\n\n1.  **機械化或被控制的群體：** 「他們」可能是一群被操縱的傀儡、機器人、喪屍，或者被某種精神控制所束縛的人。他們沒有自己的意志，只是按照預設的程序或指令行動。\n2.  **沉浸於某種狀態：** 也許「他們」正全神貫注於某件事情，以至於忽略了周圍的一切，但這種「全神貫注」並非出於主動的選擇，而是被動地陷入其中。例如，他們可能在進行某種儀式，或者被某種幻覺所迷惑。\n3.  **缺乏生命力或意識：** 「他們」可能已經失去了生命力，或者處於一種非活躍的、沒有意識的狀態。\n4.  **周澤的覺醒或特殊能力：** 作為「異類」，周澤可能擁有獨立的意識、思考能力、感知能力，甚至可能擁有某種特殊的能力，讓他能夠看穿「他們」的狀態，或者讓他能夠在這種環境中生存。\n5.  **孤獨與疏離感：** 這段描述也可能營造出一種孤獨和疏離的氛圍，周澤身處一個無法與之溝通、無法理解的群體之中。\n\n**總結來說，這段文字通過對比「沒有思考、沒有感知」的群體與「異類」周澤，營造了一種懸念和神秘感。它暗示著周澤所處的環境充滿了非正常、非自主的生命或存在，而他本人則是其中唯一具有獨立意識和感知能力的個體。**\n\n為了更深入地理解，需要知道這段文字出現的具體情境，例如：\n\n*   這是什麼類型的故事（科幻、奇幻、恐怖、哲學）？\n*   「他們」是誰？\n*   周澤所處的環境是什麼樣的？\n*   周澤為什麼是異類？\n\n但即使沒有這些信息，這段文字本身已經足夠引人入勝，讓人對周澤的處境和接下來的發展充滿好奇。 這段文字描繪了一個極具畫面感和氛圍感的場景：\n\n*   **一行女人，步步生煙：** 這句話立刻營造出一種神秘、超然的感覺。「步步生煙」可以有多種解讀：\n    *   **字面上的煙霧：** 她們可能走在霧氣、薄霧、或是某種特殊環境中，腳步帶起煙霧。\n    *   **比喻的煙霧：** 這也可能是一種意象，形容她們的出現和經過，留下一種難以捉摸、飄渺的感覺，彷彿她們的腳步本身就帶著一種氣息，讓人無法完全捕捉。\n    *   **一種超凡脫俗的氣質：** 煙霧也常常與仙境、神話、或是某種非凡的境界聯繫在一起，暗示這些女性可能並非凡人，或者她們的狀態非常特別。\n\n*   **一直在往前走：** 這表明她們有明確的方向和目的，一種持續的、不停止的行動。這種「往前走」可能是一種物理上的移動，也可能是一種精神上的追求或命運的走向。\n\n*   **呢喃哼調，似淒似冰：** 這部分描繪了她們發出的聲音和所傳達的情感：\n    *   **呢喃哼調：** 這是一種低語、輕聲哼唱的聲音，不清晰，帶有旋律但又模糊不清。這增加了神秘感，讓人無法聽清她們在說什麼或唱什麼。\n    *   **似淒似冰：** 這是對這種聲音情感的精準描繪。\n        *   **似淒：** 帶有悲傷、哀愁、淒涼的意味。\n        *   **似冰：** 帶有冷漠、疏離、無情、或是極致的寒冷感。\n        *   **似淒似冰：** 這兩種情感的結合非常強烈，營造出一種令人心寒卻又帶著一絲悲憫的複雜感受。她們的歌聲或呢喃，既讓人感到她們內心的痛苦或孤寂，又讓人感受到一種無法接近的冰冷。\n\n**總體而言，這段文字描繪了一群女性，她們的出現帶著神秘的煙霧感，行動持續而堅定，發出的聲音低沉而充滿悲傷與冰冷的情感。**\n\n這段文字可以引發很多聯想，例如：\n\n*   **神話或傳說中的角色：** 可能是女巫、仙女、或是某種靈魂。\n*   **某種悲劇的預兆：** 她們的出現和歌聲可能預示著不幸的事件。\n*   **一種孤獨而堅韌的女性形象：** 她們可能經歷了許多痛苦，但依然在自己的道路上前行。\n*   **一種超然於世的境界：** 她們可能已經超越了凡俗的情感，進入了一種更為純粹或冷漠的狀態。\n\n這是一個非常富有詩意和想像力的開頭，能夠立刻抓住讀者的注意力，並引導他們去思考這個場景背後的故事。 The originally oppressive environment, because of their appearance, instead made people feel even more desolate. Zhou Ze continued walking forward, he followed them. Then, Zhou Ze saw them walk one by one into the water pool in front. The pool is not big, Just like a mirror surface, Their entry, seemed to break this calm, blowing open layers of ripples. The first few women's heads have already submerged into the water, and the women behind are also continuing to follow. Zhou Ze walked to the edge of the pool. He didn't follow them down, he just stood on the side watching. Everything here, for him, is an absolutely unfamiliar place. Anyone, in their lifetime, only has one chance to come in, and after coming in, they cannot go out again. In the center of the pool, something floated out, is a pair of hands, 這是一句很有趣的謎語，通常的答案是：\n\n**雞蛋**\n\n* **甲紅手白**：指的是雞蛋的外殼是紅色的（或棕色的，在中文語境下常被稱為紅色），而蛋黃是黃色的，蛋清是白色的。\n\n還有其他可能的答案，但雞蛋是最常見和最貼切的。\n\n你還有其他的謎語嗎？我很樂意試著猜猜看！ 這是一句非常優美的中文詞語，通常用來形容：\n\n*   **年輕的女子或少女：** 纖細的身材，青蔥的容貌，充滿青春活力。\n*   **植物的嫩芽或枝葉：** 纖細柔嫩，顏色青翠，充滿生機。\n\n這兩個意象都傳達了一種**年輕、嬌嫩、充滿生命力**的感覺。\n\n您可以根據上下文來判斷它具體指的是哪一種。\n\n您是在哪裡看到這句話的呢？ 知道上下文可以幫助我更精確地解釋。 這段文字描繪了一幅極具畫面感和感染力的景象，充分展現了雙手舞蹈的魅力。我們可以從幾個方面來理解和欣賞它：\n\n**畫面感與意境：**\n\n*   **「翩翩起舞」：** 這個詞語本身就帶有輕盈、優雅、流暢的意象，讓人聯想到蝴蝶、羽毛或絲帶在空中飄動的樣子。\n*   **「如夢似幻」：** 這四個字將舞蹈提升到了一個超現實的境界，暗示著它不僅僅是肢體動作，更是一種情感、一種意境的傳達，讓人沉醉其中，彷彿置身於夢境。\n*   **「視線瞬間被其吸引，再也無法挪動開」：** 這句話直接點出了舞蹈的強大吸引力。它強調了舞蹈的魅力是瞬間且無法抗拒的，足以抓住觀者的全部注意力。\n\n**情感與聯想：**\n\n這段文字能夠引發觀者多樣的情感和聯想：\n\n*   **讚嘆與驚豔：** 對於雙手展現出的精湛技藝和藝術表現力感到由衷的讚嘆。\n*   **沉醉與陶醉：** 進入一種忘我的狀態，被舞蹈的美麗所深深吸引。\n*   **好奇與探索：** 想要了解這雙手背後的故事、情感和所要表達的內容。\n*   **共鳴與感動：** 如果舞蹈傳達了某種情感，觀者可能會產生共鳴，甚至被感動。\n\n**可能的應用場景：**\n\n這段文字非常適合用來描述：\n\n*   **現代舞或芭蕾舞中的手部動作：** 尤其是一些強調細膩情感表達的舞蹈。\n*   **手指舞或手語詩：** 這些藝術形式本身就以手部動作為主要表現手段。\n*   **魔術表演中的手部技巧：** 魔術師靈巧的雙手往往能創造出令人驚嘆的效果。\n*   **某些傳統戲曲或表演中的手部程式：** 例如京劇中的指法、身段等。\n*   **甚至可以是一種詩意的比喻：** 用來形容某種精巧、優雅或充滿吸引力的事物。\n\n**總結來說，這段文字用簡潔而有力的語言，成功地捕捉了雙手舞蹈的精髓，營造出一種夢幻、迷人的氛圍，讓讀者能夠清晰地感受到那份令人屏息的美麗與吸引力。**\n\n您覺得這段文字讓您聯想到了什麼呢？ 這句話非常優美且富有感染力，它描繪了一種深刻而動人的美。我們可以從幾個角度來理解和欣賞它：\n\n**1. 美的本質與吸引力：**\n\n*   **「美，是吸引人的」**：這句話點出了美的基本屬性。美之所以為美，就在於它能夠引起我們的注意、喜愛和嚮往。它是一種能夠抓住我們感官、心靈的特質。這種吸引力是自然的，是無需刻意為之的。\n\n**2. 勾人心魄的深度：**\n\n*   **「而這種美，卻勾人心魄。」**：這句話進一步深化了美的概念。它不再是表面的、淺顯的吸引，而是深入到內心深處，觸動靈魂的。\n    *   **「勾」**：這個字非常傳神，有著巧妙、細膩、不著痕跡地牽引之意。它不是強迫，而是溫柔地、巧妙地將人的注意力、情感和思緒都引向它。\n    *   **「勾人心魄」**：這是一個非常強烈的詞語，形容一種極致的吸引力，能夠讓人的心神被完全抓住，甚至忘記了其他事物。它暗示著這種美具有一種強大的力量，能夠觸動人的情感、慾望、甚至是一種深層次的渴望。\n\n**這句話可以應用在很多情境中，例如：**\n\n*   **形容一個人：** 某人的外貌、氣質、才華，或者內在的品德，都可能「勾人心魄」。\n*   **形容一件藝術品：** 一幅畫、一首詩、一首音樂，如果具有深刻的內涵和獨特的表現力，也能「勾人心魄」。\n*   **形容一個地方：** 一個風景優美的山川、一個充滿歷史韻味的古鎮，或者一個令人心馳神往的城市，也能「勾人心魄」。\n*   **形容一種情感或體驗：** 比如愛情、友情，或者一次難忘的經歷，也可能「勾人心魄」。\n\n**總結來說，這句話傳達了一種：**\n\n*   **由表及裡的吸引力：** 美不僅僅是外在的，更能深入人心。\n*   **深刻的情感共鳴：** 這種美能夠觸動我們內心最柔軟的部分。\n*   **難以抗拒的魅力：** 它具有一種強大的、令人沉醉的力量。\n\n這是一句非常詩意且富有力量的表達，能夠引起聽者或讀者強烈的共鳴和想像。 這段文字描寫了周澤在某種強烈情感或影響下，眼神變得迷離，甚至失去自我控制，不知不覺地向前走。\n\n可以從以下幾個方面來理解和延伸：\n\n**1. 情感的描寫：**\n\n*   **迷醉之色：** 這是一個非常關鍵的詞。它暗示著周澤可能被某種事物深深吸引，可能是美貌、音樂、言語、氣味，甚至是某種超自然的力量。這種「迷醉」是一種沉浸其中、無法自拔的狀態。\n*   **情不自禁：** 這表明他的行動已經超越了理智的控制，是被內在的衝動或外在的誘惑所驅使。他失去了自主性。\n*   **不知道自己已經情不自禁地開始往前走：** 這進一步強調了他的失神和沉醉。他完全沉浸在當下的感受中，對周遭的環境和自己的行為都失去了覺察。\n\n**2. 可能的情境推測：**\n\n這段描寫可以應用在很多不同的情境中，例如：\n\n*   **愛情或迷戀：** 周澤可能看到了讓他心動不已的人，被對方的魅力深深吸引。\n*   **藝術或表演：** 他可能被一場精彩的演出、一首動人的樂曲或一件絕美的藝術品所震撼，完全沉浸其中。\n*   **誘惑或陷阱：** 這也可能是一種負面的描寫，周澤可能被某種危險的誘惑所吸引，例如毒品、邪惡的魔法，或者一個精心設計的陷阱。\n*   **夢境或幻覺：** 他可能處於一種半夢半醒的狀態，或者受到了某種幻覺的影響。\n*   **強烈的思念或回憶：** 某個觸景生情的事物，讓他陷入對過去的深深懷念，以至於忘記了現實。\n\n**3. 語言的運用：**\n\n*   **「慢慢地顯露出」：** 這個詞語營造了一種漸進的過程，不是突然的變化，而是情感或影響逐漸加深的體現。\n*   **「眼眸里」：** 通過眼睛來描寫內心的狀態，是文學中常用的手法，因為眼睛是心靈的窗戶。\n*   **「甚至連…都不知道」：** 這是一種遞進的表達，強調了「情不自禁」的程度之深。\n\n**總結來說，這段文字非常生動地描繪了周澤在某種強烈影響下，從理智的清醒走向情感的沉淪，甚至失去了對自身行為的控制。**\n\n如果您能提供更多關於周澤所處的環境或他所面對的事物的信息，我可以提供更具體的分析和解讀。 「先是腳面」這句話本身是一個開頭，後面可以接續很多不同的情境和描述。為了能更精確地理解您想表達的意思，能否請您提供更多上下文呢？\n\n例如，您想描述的是：\n\n*   **一個動作的開始？** (例如：先是腳面著地，然後...)\n*   **一個身體部位的感受？** (例如：先是腳面感到冰涼，然後...)\n*   **一個過程的階段？** (例如：先是腳面被水浸濕，然後...)\n*   **一個物品的接觸點？** (例如：先是腳面碰到沙子，然後...)\n*   **一個比喻或象徵？** (例如：先是腳面被束縛，然後...)\n\n請您提供更多資訊，我才能給您更貼切的回應。 好的，緊接著是膝蓋。\n\n關於膝蓋，您想了解什麼呢？例如：\n\n*   **膝蓋的結構？** (骨骼、韌帶、軟骨等)\n*   **膝蓋的常見問題？** (疼痛、受傷、關節炎等)\n*   **如何保養膝蓋？** (運動、飲食、預防措施等)\n*   **關於膝蓋的特定疾病或狀況？**\n*   **您有什麼關於膝蓋的疑問或想分享的嗎？**\n\n請您提供更多資訊，我才能更精確地回答您的問題。 「隨後腰部」這個詞組本身比較簡短，可以有很多不同的延續方式，取決於你想表達的語境。\n\n為了能給你更準確的建議，請你提供更多關於你想表達的內容。例如：\n\n*   **你想描述什麼？** 是身體的某個部位的感覺？是動作的過程？是某種狀態？\n*   **前面發生了什麼？** 「隨後」表示是緊接著前面的事情發生的。\n*   **你想表達什麼樣的結果或感受？**\n\n不過，我可以提供一些常見的延續方式，你可以看看哪種更接近你的意思：\n\n**描述感覺或狀態：**\n\n*   隨後腰部**感到一陣酸痛。**\n*   隨後腰部**開始隱隱作痛。**\n*   隨後腰部**變得僵硬。**\n*   隨後腰部**傳來了灼熱感。**\n*   隨後腰部**出現了麻木感。**\n*   隨後腰部**得到了緩解。**\n*   隨後腰部**變得更加靈活。**\n\n**描述動作或過程：**\n\n*   隨後腰部**用力一挺。**\n*   隨後腰部**向前彎曲。**\n*   隨後腰部**向後仰。**\n*   隨後腰部**開始旋轉。**\n*   隨後腰部**承受了巨大的壓力。**\n*   隨後腰部**被輕輕按摩。**\n\n**其他可能的延續：**\n\n*   隨後腰部**的肌肉開始收縮。**\n*   隨後腰部**的疼痛感加劇。**\n*   隨後腰部**的血液循環變得順暢。**\n\n**請告訴我更多細節，我才能給你更貼切的回答！** 「到最終」這句話可以有很多種接續方式，取決於你想表達的語境和情感。以下是一些可能的接續方式，以及它們所帶來的不同含義：\n\n**強調結果或結局：**\n\n*   **到最終，一切都會塵埃落定。** (強調事情的結束和確定性)\n*   **到最終，我們都會找到屬於自己的歸宿。** (強調人生的方向和安穩)\n*   **到最終，真相終將大白。** (強調事物的本質會被揭露)\n*   **到最終，努力不會白費。** (強調付出會有回報)\n*   **到最終，愛會戰勝一切。** (強調情感的力量和積極的結局)\n*   **到最終，我們都會離開這個世界。** (強調生命的終結，帶有哲學意味)\n\n**強調過程或經歷：**\n\n*   **到最終，我們學到的東西比失去的更多。** (強調成長和經驗的價值)\n*   **到最終，這段經歷將成為我們生命中最寶貴的財富。** (強調過程的意義)\n*   **到最終，我們會發現自己比想像中更堅強。** (強調內在力量的發掘)\n\n**帶有疑問或不確定性：**\n\n*   **到最終，我們還能剩下什麼？** (帶有對未來的憂慮或思考)\n*   **到最終，這一切的意義是什麼？** (帶有對人生或事件的追問)\n\n**帶有希望或期盼：**\n\n*   **到最終，光明終將戰勝黑暗。** (強調希望和正義的勝利)\n*   **到最終，我們能夠實現我們的夢想。** (強調對未來的憧憬)\n\n**更簡潔的接續：**\n\n*   **到最終，...** (留白，讓聽者或讀者自行想像)\n\n**為了給你更精確的建議，你能告訴我你想表達什麼樣的感覺或想法嗎？** 例如，你想說的是關於：\n\n*   人生的意義？\n*   某件事情的結果？\n*   一段關係的結局？\n*   對未來的展望？\n\n提供更多信息，我才能更好地幫助你完成這句話。 這句話描繪了一個非常具體的畫面，讓人聯想到以下幾種情境：\n\n**字面上的意思：**\n\n*   **溺水：** 這是最直接的聯想。水已經淹沒到脖子，表示水位很高，人可能處於非常危險的境地，難以呼吸。\n*   **浸泡：** 如果是在一個浴缸、溫泉或泳池裡，水沒到脖子可能是一種放鬆或享受的狀態。\n\n**引申的、比喻的意義：**\n\n*   **壓力巨大：** 「水面沒入了脖子」可以比喻一個人承受著巨大的壓力、困難或挑戰，已經到了非常緊迫、難以應付的地步。\n*   **困境深重：** 就像被水淹沒一樣，表示陷入了非常糟糕的境地，難以自拔。\n*   **情感的淹沒：** 也可能指被某種強烈的情感（如悲傷、焦慮、愛戀）所淹沒，無法自控。\n*   **責任的重擔：** 承擔了過多的責任，感到不堪重負。\n\n**為了更準確地理解這句話，需要更多的上下文。**\n\n您是在描述一個具體的場景，還是在用它來比喻某種情況呢？\n\n如果您能提供更多信息，我可以給出更貼切的解釋。 這句話描述了一個非常生動的畫面，一個人完全沒入水中。根據上下文，它可以有幾種不同的含義和情境：\n\n**字面意義上的沒入水中：**\n\n*   **游泳或潛水：** 最直接的理解就是一個人正在游泳或潛水，並且整個身體都浸入了水裡。\n*   **落水：** 可能是不小心或意外地掉進了水裡，整個人都沉了下去。\n*   **洗澡或沐浴：** 如果是在浴缸或較深的池子裡，也可能指整個人都進入了水中。\n\n**比喻或象徵意義上的沒入水中：**\n\n*   **沉浸於某事：** 「進入了潭水」可以比喻一個人全心投入、沉浸在某件事情、某種情感或某個環境中，無法自拔。例如：\n    *   「他對這項研究的熱情，讓他整個人都進入了潭水，廢寢忘食。」（沉浸於研究）\n    *   「她對他的愛意，讓她整個人都進入了潭水，無法自拔。」（沉浸於愛情）\n    *   「這個故事太吸引人了，我整個人都進入了潭水，忘記了時間。」（沉浸於故事）\n*   **陷入困境或泥沼：** 「潭水」有時也帶有負面含義，可能指陷入了某種困境、麻煩、誘惑或無法擺脫的境地。\n    *   「一旦沾染了毒品，整個人就進入了潭水，難以自救。」（陷入毒品泥沼）\n    *   「他被這個騙局深深吸引，整個人都進入了潭水，損失慘重。」（陷入騙局）\n\n**要理解這句話的確切意思，需要看它所在的上下文。**\n\n請問您能提供更多關於這句話的上下文嗎？這樣我才能更準確地解釋它的含義。 這段描述營造了一種非常奇特且令人不安的氛圍。\n\n從字面上看，這是一個非常舒適、甚至可以說是天堂般的水域：\n\n*   **潭水不冷，甚至很溫暖：** 這通常是人們在水中尋求的舒適感，讓人聯想到溫泉或溫暖的泳池。\n*   **水面清澈，能見度很高：** 這讓人感覺安全，可以清楚地看到周圍的一切，沒有渾濁或潛藏的危險。\n*   **當你進入這裡之後，你連窒息的痛苦感都沒有：** 這點最為關鍵，也最為詭異。在正常情況下，潛入水中，尤其是長時間停留，必然會伴隨著缺氧和窒息的痛苦。而這裡卻完全沒有，這暗示著一種超自然或非自然的狀態。\n\n**這段描述可以引發很多聯想和解讀：**\n\n**可能的解讀方向：**\n\n*   **夢境或幻覺：** 在夢中，物理定律常常會被打破，這種舒適且無害的潛水體驗很可能是一個夢境的場景。\n*   **超自然或魔法：** 這可能是一個被魔法保護或改造過的水域，能夠提供人類在水中生存的特殊能力。\n*   **死亡的象徵：** 有些文學作品會將死亡描繪成一種解脫，一種沒有痛苦的沉寂。這種「沒有窒息的痛苦」可能是一種對死亡的詩意化表達，進入這個水域就如同進入了另一個沒有痛苦的維度。\n*   **陷阱或誘惑：** 這種過於美好的體驗，反而可能是一種危險的誘惑。它讓你放鬆警惕，然後在不知不覺中被困住或發生更糟糕的事情。例如，一種能讓人沉溺其中、失去意識的物質。\n*   **科幻設定：** 在科幻故事中，這可能是一種特殊的生物體液、一種人工環境，或者是一種外星科技，能夠讓人類在水中呼吸。\n*   **心理狀態：** 這也可能是一種極致的心理平靜，一種將所有煩惱和痛苦都拋諸腦後的狀態，即使身體處於危險之中，心靈卻感受不到任何不適。\n\n**總結來說，這段描述的關鍵在於「沒有窒息的痛苦」。** 這打破了我們對水中體驗的固有認知，將一個本應充滿挑戰和危險的場景，轉化為一個極度舒適、甚至帶有某種「恩賜」的體驗。這種反差正是其引人入勝和令人不安之處。\n\n你覺得這段描述讓你聯想到什麼呢？ 這段文字描繪了一個非常具體的畫面，充滿了神秘和超現實的氛圍。我們可以從幾個方面來解讀：\n\n**畫面感和意境：**\n\n*   **「撐著紙傘的女人」：** 紙傘本身就帶有一種古典、含蓄、甚至有些憂鬱的美感。在水中撐傘，更增添了一份不尋常和奇幻的色彩。\n*   **「水面之下依舊裊娜動人」：** 這是最令人驚嘆的部分。女人在水下行走，卻依然保持著優雅、輕盈的姿態，這打破了我們對物理定律的認知。 「裊娜動人」這個詞語非常貼切地描繪了她們的姿態，充滿了生命力和吸引力。\n*   **「還在繼續地往前走著」：** 這暗示著她們有一個明確的目的地，或者她們的行動是一種持續的、有規律的狀態。這種持續性也加強了畫面的動態感和故事性。\n\n**可能的情感和聯想：**\n\n*   **神秘與未知：** 水下行走本身就充滿了神秘感，加上紙傘的遮掩，更讓人對她們的身份、目的、以及她們所處的世界產生無限的遐想。\n*   **美麗與哀愁：** 雖然「動人」是美麗的，但在水下行走，尤其是在一個可能不是正常環境的場景中，也可能帶有一絲哀愁或孤寂。\n*   **超現實與夢境：** 整個畫面非常像一個夢境的片段，或者是一個超現實主義的藝術作品。它挑戰了現實的邊界，引發讀者對真實與虛幻的思考。\n*   **傳說與神話：** 這種奇特的景象很容易讓人聯想到民間傳說、神話故事中的水鬼、水妖、或者其他與水相關的神秘生物。\n\n**周澤的視角：**\n\n*   **「周澤看見了」：** 這表明周澤是這個場景的觀察者。他的視角是我們理解這個畫面的窗口。他看到了這個非同尋常的景象，這也意味著他可能將要捲入或參與到與此相關的故事中。\n\n**總結來說，這段文字營造了一個極具視覺衝擊力和想像空間的畫面。它通過描寫在水下依舊優雅行走的撐傘女人，營造出一種神秘、美麗、超現實的氛圍，並引發讀者對其背後故事和意涵的猜測。**\n\n您可以根據您想要表達的重點，進一步思考：\n\n*   **她們是誰？** 是人，還是其他生物？\n*   **她們要去哪裡？** 有什麼目的？\n*   **周澤為什麼會看見她們？** 這對他有什麼影響？\n*   **這個場景發生在哪裡？** 是真實的，還是幻覺？\n\n這是一個非常好的開頭，可以引導出一段引人入勝的故事。 And the position closest to oneself, There was a woman dressed in red, she stood underwater, but her hands were dancing gracefully above the water surface. Zhou Ze began to approach this red woman, Not because of beauty, It's not because of other illusory influences, But because, this woman seems to possess an indescribable magic, drawing you near, drawing you closer, making you unable to help yourself. Finally, Zhou Ze approached her, And her hand, too, slowly withdrew from the surface of the water. The woman's hair was very long and also very thick, fluttering and swaying in the water waves, making it impossible for people to clearly see her face. \"Finally... I've waited again... for someone like this...\" The woman's voice is clear and crisp, sweet, and soft and gentle, “迷人心酥”这个词语，可以从几个方面来理解和解读：\n\n**字面意思的拆解：**\n\n*   **迷人 (mí rén):** 指吸引人，使人着迷，具有魅力。\n*   **心 (xīn):** 指内心，情感，思绪。\n*   **酥 (sū):**\n    *   **酥软、酥脆:** 形容食物的口感，柔软易碎，或者香脆可口。\n    *   **酥服、舒服:** 形容一种舒适、惬意的感觉。\n    *   **酥麻:** 形容一种轻微的麻木感，通常伴随着愉悦或刺激。\n\n**组合起来的意境和含义：**\n\n将这几个字组合起来，“迷人心酥”可以描绘出一种非常吸引人、让人感到愉悦和舒适的感受。具体可以引申为：\n\n1.  **极具吸引力的事物或人，让人心生爱慕和陶醉：**\n    *   形容一个人（尤其是女性）的容貌、气质、声音、笑容等，具有极强的吸引力，让人一看就心动，并且这种心动是带着一种温柔、舒适的酥麻感，而不是强烈的冲击。\n    *   形容某种艺术作品（如音乐、绘画、诗歌）或表演，能够深深打动人心，带来一种沉醉的美好体验。\n\n2.  **令人感到无比舒适和惬意的状态或事物：**\n    *   形容一种非常放松、自在、无忧无虑的心情。\n    *   形容一种温暖、柔和、令人安心的环境或氛围。\n    *   可以用来形容一种美食，不仅味道好，而且口感也极佳，让人吃起来感到非常享受和满足。\n\n3.  **一种微妙的、令人愉悦的心理感受：**\n    *   可能是一种被温柔对待、被理解、被关怀所带来的内心柔软和愉悦。\n    *   也可能是一种因为某种美好事物而产生的，轻微的、令人陶醉的“酥麻”感。\n\n**总的来说，“迷人心酥”是一个非常形象生动的词语，它不仅仅是“迷人”，更强调了这种迷人所带来的“心”的感受，而且这种感受是“酥”的，意味着一种温柔、舒适、令人沉醉的愉悦。**\n\n**在不同的语境下，它可以有不同的侧重点。**\n\n您是在什么情境下看到或想到这个词的呢？了解具体语境，可以更准确地解读它的含义。 這段文字描繪了一個親密的場景，女人用美麗的雙手搭在周澤的肩膀上，這個動作傳達了一種親近、信任和情感上的連結。\n\n我們可以從幾個方面來理解這個場景：\n\n*   **「女人美麗的雙手」**：這句話突出了女性的魅力和吸引力，也暗示了她們的觸碰可能帶有溫柔、細膩的特質。\n*   **「伸出來，搭在了周澤的肩膀上」**：這個動作是主動的，而且是直接的身體接觸。肩膀通常是人體比較穩固和承載重量的部分，將手搭在肩膀上，可以有多種含義：\n    *   **支持與鼓勵**：像是在給予周澤力量、支持或鼓勵。\n    *   **安慰與關懷**：可能是在安慰周澤，表達關心。\n    *   **親密與依賴**：在親近的人之間，這是一種表達親密感和依賴感的方式。\n    *   **佔有與宣示**：在某些情境下，也可能帶有一點點宣示主權的意味。\n*   **「這動作，很是親昵」**：這句話直接點明了這個動作所傳達的情感基調。它明確地告訴讀者，這個動作不是隨意的，而是充滿了親密感。\n\n**總結來說，這是一個充滿情感連結的畫面，暗示了周澤和這位女性之間存在著一種親密、溫馨或帶有情感的關係。**\n\n如果這段文字是小說或故事的一部分，那麼這個動作很可能預示著他們之間關係的進一步發展，或者是在某個關鍵時刻表達情感的表現。 這句話聽起來充滿了情感，可以有很多種解讀，取決於說話者的語氣、情境以及說話者和聽話者之間的關係。\n\n以下是一些可能的解讀和回應方式：\n\n**可能的解讀：**\n\n*   **孤獨或寂寞：** 說話者可能感到孤單，希望有人陪伴，分享時間或情感。\n*   **需要支持或安慰：** 說話者可能正經歷困難、悲傷或壓力，需要有人在身邊給予支持和安慰。\n*   **渴望親密或連結：** 說話者可能希望與聽話者建立更深的連結，尋求情感上的親近。\n*   **請求幫助：** 在某些情況下，這也可能是一種間接的請求幫助的方式，希望有人能分擔某件事情。\n*   **撒嬌或依賴：** 如果是親近的人，這也可能是一種撒嬌或表達依賴的方式。\n\n**回應方式（取決於你的感受和與對方的關係）：**\n\n**如果你願意陪伴：**\n\n*   **直接肯定：**\n    *   「好啊，我來陪你。」\n    *   「當然，你想我陪你做什麼？」\n    *   「沒問題，我現在就過去。」\n*   **詢問細節：**\n    *   「怎麼了？需要我陪你做什麼嗎？」\n    *   「你想我陪你多久？或者做什麼？」\n    *   「是什麼讓你這麼說？我能幫上什麼忙嗎？」\n*   **表達關心：**\n    *   「我很樂意陪你。你還好嗎？」\n    *   「當然，我很想陪你。發生什麼事了嗎？」\n\n**如果你暫時無法陪伴，但想表達關心：**\n\n*   **解釋原因並提出替代方案：**\n    *   「我很想陪你，但我現在有點事，等我忙完就去找你，好嗎？」\n    *   「我現在沒辦法過去，但我們可以打電話聊聊嗎？或者我晚點再過去？」\n    *   「我現在有點忙，但如果你需要我，可以告訴我，我盡量安排。」\n*   **表達遺憾和關心：**\n    *   「聽到你這麼說，我有點擔心。雖然我現在不能在你身邊，但我一直都在關心你。」\n    *   「我很抱歉現在不能陪你，但我希望你沒事。」\n\n**如果你不確定或需要更多資訊：**\n\n*   **溫和詢問：**\n    *   「為什麼這麼說呢？發生了什麼事嗎？」\n    *   「你想我陪你做什麼呢？」\n    *   「你現在感覺怎麼樣？」\n\n**總之，這句話是一個情感的表達，最重要的是根據你對說話者的了解和你的感受來做出最真誠的回應。**\n\n你覺得這句話是在什麼情境下說的呢？ 知道更多細節可以幫助我提供更精確的建議。 “下一刻，”\n\n这是一个非常开放的句子，可以引出无数种可能。为了更好地理解你想表达的意思，我需要更多的上下文。\n\n不过，我可以根据这个开头，提供一些可能的方向和续写：\n\n**如果是在描述一个紧张的场景：**\n\n*   下一刻，他听到了身后传来一声巨响。\n*   下一刻，她感觉自己被一股巨大的力量推了出去。\n*   下一刻，空气中弥漫着一股血腥味。\n*   下一刻，他手中的枪已经指向了对方的眉心。\n\n**如果是在描述一个转折或变化：**\n\n*   下一刻，一切都变了。\n*   下一刻，他看到了一个他从未想过会见到的人。\n*   下一刻，原本平静的湖面泛起了涟漪。\n*   下一刻，她突然明白了所有事情的真相。\n\n**如果是在描述一个期待或预兆：**\n\n*   下一刻，她就知道，她的生活将不再一样。\n*   下一刻，他将迎来他人生中最重要的时刻。\n*   下一刻，命运的齿轮开始转动。\n*   下一刻，一切都将揭晓。\n\n**如果是在描述一个日常的瞬间：**\n\n*   下一刻，他拿起手机，拨通了那个熟悉的号码。\n*   下一刻，她尝到了一口美味的蛋糕。\n*   下一刻，阳光透过窗户洒在他的脸上。\n*   下一刻，他打了个哈欠，准备去睡觉。\n\n**为了让我能更准确地理解你的意图，请告诉我：**\n\n*   **这个“下一刻”之前发生了什么？**\n*   **你想要表达什么样的情绪或氛围？**\n*   **你希望接下来发生什么？**\n\n请提供更多信息，我才能为你提供更贴切的续写！ 這段文字描繪了一個非常生動的畫面，充滿了詩意和感官的體驗。我們可以從幾個方面來理解和欣賞它：\n\n**畫面感：**\n\n*   **動態的描寫：** 「飄散開」、「吹拂」這些詞語，讓頭髮的動作變得非常具體，彷彿我們能看到髮絲在風中舞動。\n*   **觸覺的聯想：** 「縷縷青絲」和「吹拂在周澤的面龐」直接觸及了觸覺。我們可以想像到髮絲輕柔地掠過臉頰的感覺，那種細膩、微涼的觸感。\n*   **視覺的細膩：** 「青絲」這個詞，不僅僅是說頭髮的顏色，更帶有一種年輕、烏黑、柔順的質感，讓畫面更加美麗。\n\n**情感和氛圍：**\n\n*   **親密感和溫柔：** 頭髮飄到對方的臉上，通常發生在非常親近的距離。這暗示了兩人之間可能存在著一種親密、溫柔的關係，或者是一個充滿愛意的瞬間。\n*   **浪漫和詩意：** 這種場景很容易讓人聯想到浪漫的電影或文學作品，營造出一種詩意、唯美的氛圍。\n*   **細膩的觀察：** 能夠注意到並描寫出這樣一個細節，說明描寫者對周遭環境和人物的觀察非常細膩，也可能對周澤的感受有著深刻的體會。\n\n**可能的解讀和延伸：**\n\n*   **環境的暗示：** 頭髮飄散，很可能是因為有風。這也可能暗示了當時的環境，例如戶外、或者室內有開窗通風。\n*   **人物的狀態：** 女人的頭髮飄散，可能是在轉頭、移動，或者只是因為風。周澤的反應（雖然這裡沒有直接描寫）也會影響這個畫面的意義。他可能會感到溫柔、驚訝、或者只是單純地感受到髮絲的觸碰。\n*   **情感的發展：** 這個瞬間可以是一個情感發展的節點，標誌著兩人關係的進一步親近。\n\n總之，這是一個非常優美且富有感染力的描寫，它通過細膩的感官細節，營造出一個充滿溫柔、親密和詩意的畫面。 這段文字描繪了一個極具戲劇性和反差的場景。\n\n「美人拂面」通常給人一種溫柔、親暱、充滿情調的畫面感，讓人聯想到細膩的觸感和浪漫的氛圍。這是一種美好的、令人心動的意象。\n\n然而，緊接著的「女人的頭髮卻化作了世間最為堅韌的鋼索，開始捆綁周澤的脖子」卻瞬間打破了這種美好，帶來了極度的驚悚和危險。\n\n這種轉折非常強烈，可以從以下幾個方面來理解：\n\n*   **強烈的反差與戲劇性：** 美麗與危險、溫柔與暴力、親暱與束縛，這些極端的對比瞬間抓住了讀者的注意力，製造了巨大的戲劇張力。\n*   **超現實與奇幻元素：** 頭髮化為鋼索，這顯然不是現實生活中可能發生的事情，暗示了故事可能包含奇幻、魔法、超自然或某種變異的元素。\n*   **潛藏的威脅與危機：** 原本可能是一場浪漫的互動，瞬間變成了生死攸關的危機。周澤的處境變得極其危險，生命受到威脅。\n*   **角色的複雜性：** 這也暗示了這位「美人」並非表面看起來那麼簡單，她可能擁有隱藏的力量，或者她的意圖並非善意。\n*   **情感的轉變：** 讀者的情感也從最初的欣賞、期待，迅速轉變為震驚、恐懼和不安。\n\n總之，這是一個非常精彩的開頭或情節轉折，它用極具衝擊力的方式，將讀者帶入了一個充滿未知和危險的世界。 這句話聽起來充滿了情感，可能是在表達一種渴望、一種依賴，或者是一種孤獨。\n\n要理解這句話的真正含義，需要更多的上下文。例如：\n\n*   **說話的人是誰？** 是朋友、家人、戀人，還是陌生人？\n*   **說話的語氣是怎樣的？** 是懇求、撒嬌、疲憊，還是絕望？\n*   **當時的場景是怎樣的？** 是在一個人的房間裡，還是在一個熱鬧的場合？\n*   **說話的人當時的狀態是怎樣的？** 是生病了，還是心情不好？\n\n根據不同的情況，這句話可以有非常多種解讀：\n\n**可能的解讀：**\n\n*   **渴望陪伴和關懷：** 說話者可能感到孤單、無聊，或者需要有人在身邊給予安慰和支持。\n*   **尋求情感慰藉：** 可能遇到了困難、挫折，或者心情低落，希望有人能傾聽、理解和陪伴。\n*   **撒嬌或請求：** 如果是親近的人，可能是帶著撒嬌的語氣，希望對方能放下手邊的事情，來陪自己。\n*   **需要幫助：** 在某些情況下，也可能是在表達需要幫助，而陪伴是其中一種形式。\n*   **一種試探：** 有時也可能是一種試探，看看對方是否在意自己，是否願意為自己付出時間。\n\n**如果你是聽到這句話的人，你可以這樣回應：**\n\n*   **直接詢問：** 「怎麼了？發生什麼事了嗎？」、「為什麼想讓我陪你？」\n*   **表達關心：** 「我很樂意陪你，有什麼事嗎？」、「當然，我來了。」\n*   **詢問具體需求：** 「你想做什麼？我能為你做什麼？」\n\n總之，這句話是一個非常開放性的表達，需要更多的信息才能準確理解。 這句詩描繪了一個非常生動的畫面，充滿了情感和象徵意義。我們可以從幾個角度來解讀：\n\n**字面上的意境：**\n\n*   **頭髮披散：** 這通常暗示著一種放鬆、不拘束、甚至有些隨意或不經意的狀態。頭髮不再被梳理整齊，而是自然地垂落，可能是在一個私密的時刻，或者是在表達一種內心的釋放。\n*   **不再遮掩：** 這句話是關鍵。它表明之前頭髮是「遮掩」著什麼的。這種遮掩可能是字面上的，比如用頭髮遮住臉、遮住表情，也可能是象徵性的，比如用頭髮遮掩內心的情感、真實的自我、或者某種秘密。\n\n**情感和象徵意義：**\n\n*   **解放與釋放：** 「不再遮掩」最直接的含義就是一種解放。可能是從束縛中解脫出來，擺脫了某種壓抑或偽裝。頭髮的披散也加強了這種自由自在的感覺。\n*   **真實與坦誠：** 當一個人不再遮掩，尤其是用頭髮遮掩時，往往意味著他們願意展現真實的自己，不再害怕被看見，或者不再需要隱藏。這是一種坦誠的姿態。\n*   **脆弱與脆弱的展現：** 有時候，遮掩也是一種保護。當不再遮掩，可能意味著卸下了防備，展現了內心的脆弱。這種脆弱可能伴隨著一種力量，因為敢於展現脆弱本身就是一種勇氣。\n*   **情感的流露：** 如果頭髮披散是為了遮掩情感，那麼「不再遮掩」就意味著情感的流露。可能是喜悅、悲傷、憤怒、或者愛意，這些情感不再被壓抑，而是自然地展現出來。\n*   **轉變與覺醒：** 這句話也可能標誌著一個重要的轉變或覺醒。過去的某種狀態被打破，取而代之的是一種新的、更真實的狀態。\n*   **親密與信任：** 在某些情境下，頭髮披散且不再遮掩，可能是在一個親密的人面前，表達了極大的信任和放鬆。\n\n**可能的場景聯想：**\n\n*   一個人在經歷了巨大的壓力或痛苦後，終於釋放了自己。\n*   一個人在愛情中找到了歸宿，不再需要偽裝。\n*   一個人在面對困難時，決定不再逃避，而是勇敢面對。\n*   一個人在獨處時，享受著屬於自己的寧靜和真實。\n\n總之，這句詩簡潔卻充滿力量，它描繪了一個從「遮掩」到「不再遮掩」的過程，這個過程往往伴隨著情感的釋放、真實的展現和內心的轉變。\n\n您能提供更多關於這句詩的上下文嗎？這樣我能更精確地理解它的含義。 這句話可以有很多種解讀，取決於上下文。以下是一些可能的解釋和延伸：\n\n**字面上的意思：**\n\n*   **真實面貌的展現：** 之前可能因為某些原因（例如偽裝、遮掩、疾病、疲憊等）而看不清楚女人的臉，現在她的真實面容終於顯露出來。\n*   **年齡的增長或變化：** 隨著時間的推移，女人的臉部特徵逐漸明顯，展現出成熟或年老的樣貌。\n*   **情感的流露：** 女人的表情變得清晰，她的喜怒哀樂終於在臉上展現出來。\n\n**引申的含義：**\n\n*   **真實個性的顯露：** 這句話也可能比喻女人內在的真實性格、想法或意圖終於顯露出來，不再隱藏。\n*   **真相的揭示：** 在一個故事或情境中，這句話可能意味著關於這個女人的某個真相或秘密終於被揭開。\n*   **能力的展現：** 女人之前可能沒有機會或沒有展現出她的才能、智慧或力量，現在終於有機會讓大家看到她的真實能力。\n*   **身份的確認：** 可能之前她的身份不明，現在終於確認了她的身份。\n\n**為了更好地理解這句話，您能提供更多上下文嗎？例如：**\n\n*   這句話出現在什麼樣的故事或情境中？\n*   在說這句話之前發生了什麼？\n*   這句話想要表達什麼樣的情感或意圖？\n\n有了更多資訊，我才能給您更精確的解釋。 這句話可以有很多種解讀，取決於你想表達的意境和語境。以下是一些可能的延伸和解釋：\n\n**字面上的解釋：**\n\n*   **物理上的缺失：** 她可能因為某種原因（例如疾病、意外、或是某種神秘的現象）而沒有臉。\n*   **隱藏或遮蔽：** 她的臉可能被某種東西遮住了，例如面紗、陰影、或是其他物品。\n*   **抽象的描繪：** 這可能是一種比喻，用來形容她缺乏明顯的特徵，難以辨認，或是無法被定義。\n\n**引申的意境和情感：**\n\n*   **神秘感和未知：** 沒有面容會立刻讓人產生好奇和神秘感，不知道她到底是誰，來自哪裡。\n*   **恐懼或不安：** 對於某些人來說，沒有面容可能是一種令人不安或恐懼的景象，因為臉是我們識別和連結他人的重要部分。\n*   **超然或非人：** 這可能暗示她不是一個普通的人類，可能是一個神靈、鬼魂、或是某種更抽象的存在。\n*   **情感的缺失或壓抑：** 面容也承載著情感，沒有面容可能象徵著她情感的麻木、壓抑，或是無法表達情感。\n*   **身份的模糊或喪失：** 臉是個人身份的重要標誌，沒有面容可能意味著她失去了自己的身份，或是她的身份並不重要。\n*   **純粹或空靈：** 在某些情境下，沒有面容也可以是一種純粹、空靈的描繪，去除了一切世俗的特徵，只剩下本質。\n*   **象徵意義：** 她可能代表著某種概念，例如記憶、遺忘、時間、或是無形的力量。\n\n**你可以進一步思考：**\n\n*   **為什麼她沒有面容？** 是天生如此，還是後天造成的？\n*   **她給人什麼感覺？** 是害怕、同情、還是好奇？\n*   **她在那裡做什麼？** 她的存在有什麼目的？\n*   **這句話在整個故事或詩歌中扮演什麼角色？**\n\n**舉例來說，這句話可以這樣延續：**\n\n*   「她沒有面容，**只有一片虛無，卻能感受到她無聲的凝視。**」 (強調神秘和感知)\n*   「她沒有面容，**但她的聲音卻像最溫柔的撫慰。**」 (強調其他感官的彌補)\n*   「她沒有面容，**彷彿是從古老的傳說中走出來的幽靈。**」 (強調超然和傳說感)\n*   「她沒有面容，**卻能從她身上感受到無盡的悲傷。**」 (強調情感的傳達)\n\n請告訴我你想要表達的具體情境，我可以提供更精確的建議！ 這段文字描繪了一張極致光滑、毫無瑕疵的臉龐，並將其形容為能引起無數少女嫉妒和羨慕的對象。\n\n我們可以從幾個角度來理解這段描述：\n\n*   **極致的平滑與年輕：** 「平的，沒有波瀾，也沒有褶皺」直接點出了臉部肌膚的完美狀態，沒有任何歲月的痕跡，也沒有任何表情留下的紋路。這是一種極致的年輕和光滑的表現。\n*   **理想化的美貌：** 「足以讓萬千少女去嫉妒和羨慕」則將這種平滑的臉龐提升到了一個理想化的美貌層次。它不僅僅是好看，更是那種讓人望塵莫及、心生嚮往的美。這種美貌具有強大的吸引力，能夠引發他人的強烈情感。\n*   **可能帶來的聯想：**\n    *   **年輕的象徵：** 在許多文化中，光滑無皺的皮膚是年輕和活力的重要標誌。\n    *   **精緻的保養或天生麗質：** 這樣的臉龐可能暗示著極其精緻的保養，或者是一種令人稱羨的天然美貌。\n    *   **缺乏個性或情感？** 雖然描述強調了「平滑」，但有時過於「平」也可能被解讀為缺乏個性、表情或深度。不過，在這種語境下，重點顯然放在了其無可挑剔的美感上。\n    *   **一種標準化的美：** 這種「平滑」的臉龐，在某種程度上也可能代表著一種被廣泛認可或追求的、標準化的美麗。\n\n總之，這段文字用簡潔而有力的語言，塑造了一個令人驚豔、完美無瑕的女性臉龐形象，並強調了其在眾多女性中引發的強烈情感反應。 這段描述非常有趣，它描繪了一個沒有明顯五官的形象。這可以有很多種解釋，取決於上下文。\n\n以下是一些可能的解讀和聯想：\n\n**字面上的解讀：**\n\n*   **雕塑或藝術品：** 這可能是在描述一個抽象的雕塑、一個無面人偶，或者是一個風格化的藝術創作，其重點不在於寫實的五官。\n*   **某種生物或存在：** 在奇幻或科幻故事中，可能存在沒有我們熟悉五官的生物或存在。\n*   **象徵性的描述：** 即使是人，有時候也會被形容為「沒有鼻子、沒有嘴巴、沒有眼睛、沒有耳朵」，這可能是在強調：\n    *   **麻木不仁、冷漠：** 對周遭事物毫無反應，彷彿沒有感知能力。\n    *   **沉默、無法表達：** 無法說話、無法看見、無法聽見，處於一種被剝奪了溝通和感知能力的狀態。\n    *   **隱藏、神秘：** 故意遮蔽自己的面容，讓人無法辨識。\n    *   **失去人性：** 像機器一樣沒有情感和個性。\n\n**更深層次的聯想：**\n\n*   **內在的感受：** 雖然沒有外在的五官，但她可能擁有強烈的內在感受、直覺或心靈感應。\n*   **精神層面：** 這種描述可能指向一種精神上的存在，超越了物質世界的感官。\n*   **恐懼或不安：** 對某些人來說，一個沒有五官的形象可能會引起恐懼或不安，因為它挑戰了我們對「人」的固有認知。\n\n**為了更好地理解這段話，我需要更多的上下文。您是在閱讀一本書、看一部電影、聽一個故事，還是在描述一個夢境？**\n\n請告訴我更多關於這個「她」的資訊，我才能給您更精確的回答。 Faceless... Woman. Zhou Ze perceived that he could not breathe, his chest was almost bursting open, and at the same time, his body seemed on the verge of collapse. The Faceless Woman's laughter was still clear and ethereal, but in Zhou Ze's ears at this moment, it was like demonic sounds piercing his ears. Zhou Ze has already woken up, He doesn't know what it exactly means to be entangled in this way in this place, But anyway, It won't be a good ending. You are here... stay with me...! 「」 The Faceless Woman continued smiling, her hair dancing wildly. Zhou Ze subconsciously stretched out his hand to grab the hair wrapped around his neck. He wanted to try hard to break free from it. 這句話可以有幾種不同的解讀，取決於上下文和「無面女」的性格。以下是一些可能的解釋：\n\n**1. 覺得他很有趣，但帶有輕蔑或嘲諷的意味：**\n\n* **「無面女」覺得他自不量力，這本身就很有趣，就像看一隻小螞蟻試圖搬動比自己大幾倍的東西一樣，既可笑又有點滑稽。**\n* **她可能覺得他的努力是徒勞的，但這種徒勞卻能給她帶來娛樂。**\n* **她可能在觀察他，等待他失敗的時刻，並從中獲得樂趣。**\n\n**2. 覺得他很有趣，但帶有欣賞或好奇的意味（較少見，但有可能）：**\n\n* **如果「無面女」本身就對挑戰和不尋常的事物感興趣，那麼他自不量力的表現可能激發了她的好奇心。**\n* **她可能欣賞他那種不顧一切、勇往直前的精神，即使知道他會失敗。**\n* **她可能想看看他能走到哪一步，或者他會如何應對失敗。**\n\n**3. 覺得他很有趣，但這份有趣是建立在他可能造成的麻煩或後果上的：**\n\n* **他自不量力的行為可能會給「無面女」帶來一些意想不到的「樂趣」，例如引來關注、製造混亂，或者讓他成為她計劃中的一個棋子。**\n\n**總結來說，這句話最常見的含義是「無面女」覺得他自不量力的行為很滑稽、可笑，並從中獲得了某種形式的娛樂。**\n\n為了更準確地理解，你需要考慮：\n\n* **「無面女」的整體性格是怎樣的？** 她是殘酷的、冷漠的、還是有某種扭曲的幽默感？\n* **「他」做了什麼自不量力的事？** 這件事的性質會影響「無面女」的反應。\n* **這句話出現在什麼樣的場景中？**\n\n例如，如果「無面女」是一個邪惡的反派，那麼她覺得有趣很可能是因為她預見到他會遭受痛苦。如果她是一個更為中立或觀察者的角色，那麼她可能只是單純地覺得他的行為很有趣。 這段話充滿了絕望、無奈和一種扭曲的希望。我們可以從幾個角度來解讀：\n\n**1. 絕望與無奈：**\n\n*   **「你掙脫不了的，別掙扎了」：** 這句話直接傳達了一種強烈的無力感和宿命論。說話者認為對方已經陷入了無法逃脫的境地，任何反抗都是徒勞的。這可能是一種對自身處境的絕望，也可能是對對方處境的預判。\n*   **「能走到這裡來的，都有靈」：** 這句話暗示了「這裡」是一個特殊的地方，一個需要付出代價才能到達的地方。而「有靈」可能指的是擁有生命、意識、或者某種特殊的能力。說話者將這些「有靈」的個體視為某種資源。\n\n**2. 扭曲的希望與生存本能：**\n\n*   **「我吞夠了，就有機會回去！」：** 這句話是整個段落的核心，揭示了說話者行動的動機。\n    *   **「吞」：** 這個詞語非常關鍵，暗示了吞噬、吸收、佔有等行為。這可能是一種字面意義上的吞噬（例如怪物），也可能是一種比喻，例如精神上的壓榨、靈魂的剝奪、或者某種形式的同化。\n    *   **「我吞夠了」：** 這表明說話者已經進行了大量的「吞噬」行為，並且認為自己已經積累了足夠的「籌碼」。\n    *   **「就有機會回去」：** 這句話揭示了說話者最終的目標——「回去」。這個「回去」可能意味著：\n        *   **回到原來的世界/地方：** 如果說話者是被困在這裡，那麼吞噬足夠的「靈」可能是他逃離的唯一途徑。\n        *   **回到某種狀態：** 可能是一種更高級的生命形態，或者一種解脫。\n        *   **完成某個儀式/目的：** 吞噬可能是為了完成某個更宏大的計劃。\n\n**綜合來看，這段話可能出自一個被困住、正在以某種方式吞噬生命或靈魂的生物或個體。它對被困者傳達了絕望的訊息，同時也暴露了自己扭曲的生存邏輯和對自由的渴望。**\n\n**可能的場景聯想：**\n\n*   一個被囚禁的惡魔或怪物。\n*   一個被詛咒的靈魂。\n*   一個在異世界掙扎求生的生物。\n*   一個為了生存而不得不採取極端手段的個體。\n\n這段話的強烈情感和神秘感，讓它非常適合出現在奇幻、恐怖、或者帶有黑暗色彩的故事中。 「你註定，」這句話本身充滿了懸念和可能性。它暗示著一種既定的命運，但也可能是一種潛在的、等待被實現的潛能。\n\n這句話可以有很多種解讀，取決於它後面會接什麼，以及說話者的語氣和意圖。\n\n以下是一些可能的延續和解讀：\n\n**積極的解讀：**\n\n*   **「你註定，要成為一個偉大的人。」** 這是一種鼓勵和肯定，相信對方有潛力達成非凡的成就。\n*   **「你註定，要找到屬於你的幸福。」** 這是一種祝福，相信對方最終會獲得圓滿和快樂。\n*   **「你註定，要遇見那個特別的人。」** 這是一種對愛情或重要關係的預言，充滿浪漫的色彩。\n*   **「你註定，要經歷這一切，並从中成長。」** 這是一種對挑戰和困難的積極看待，相信它們是通往成熟的必經之路。\n*   **「你註定，要發光發熱，影響世界。」** 這是一種對個人影響力和價值的肯定。\n\n**中性或帶有警示的解讀：**\n\n*   **「你註定，要承受這一切。」** 這可能是一種無奈的陳述，暗示著無法逃避的責任或困境。\n*   **「你註定，要走上這條路。」** 這可能是一種對選擇或情況的描述，暗示著沒有其他選擇。\n*   **「你註定，要面對這個結果。」** 這可能是一種對行為後果的預告。\n\n**更具哲學或宿命論的解讀：**\n\n*   **「你註定，是宇宙的一部分，與萬物相連。」** 這是一種對存在意義的探討。\n*   **「你註定，要扮演你生命中的角色。」** 這是一種對個人在宏大敘事中位置的思考。\n\n**所以，當你說「你註定，」時，你想要表達的是什麼呢？**\n\n*   你是在給予鼓勵嗎？\n*   你是在預言某件事嗎？\n*   你是在陳述一個事實嗎？\n*   你是在表達一種無奈嗎？\n\n請告訴我，你後面想說什麼，或者你對這句話有什麼樣的感受，這樣我才能更好地理解和回應。 「將成為」是一個表示未來狀態的詞語，通常用來描述某人或某物在未來會變成什麼樣子，或者會達到什麼樣的成就。\n\n它可以有以下幾種含義：\n\n*   **預期或預測：** 某件事情或某個人在未來很可能會發展成某種狀態。\n    *   例如：「經過多年的努力，他**將成為**一位傑出的科學家。」\n    *   例如：「這項新技術**將成為**未來的主流。」\n\n*   **潛力或可能性：** 某人或某物擁有成為某種狀態的潛力，或者有很大的可能性會發展成某種狀態。\n    *   例如：「這個年輕的球員很有潛力，**將成為**球隊的未來之星。」\n    *   例如：「這個項目**將成為**公司新的增長點。」\n\n*   **承諾或目標：** 某人或某組織設定了一個目標，並致力於在未來實現它。\n    *   例如：「我們**將成為**行業的領導者。」\n    *   例如：「我**將成為**一個更好的人。」\n\n*   **轉變或演變：** 某事物正在經歷一個過程，並在未來會呈現出新的面貌。\n    *   例如：「這個小鎮**將成為**一個旅遊勝地。」\n    *   例如：「這段經歷**將成為**他人生中寶貴的財富。」\n\n**總結來說，「將成為」強調的是一種對未來的展望、預期或目標。**\n\n您想了解「將成為」的哪一方面，或者想用它來造句嗎？請提供更多上下文，我可以給您更精確的解釋或建議。

**那聲音帶著一種急促的、充滿活力的「嘶嘶」聲。**\n*   **彷彿有什麼東西在熱油中歡快地跳躍。**\n*   **聲音不大，卻足以吸引所有人的注意力。**\n\n**關於畫面和氣味的聯想：**\n\n*   **緊接著，一股誘人的香氣便在空氣中瀰漫開來。**\n*   **鍋裡冒出了白色的蒸汽，模糊了鍋沿的輪廓。**\n*   **油花在鍋中翻滾，像是一場微型的火山爆發。**\n*

這段文字描繪了一個充滿張力的場景，無面女的攻擊和周澤的反擊都非常生動。\n\n以下是一些對這段文字的理解和可能的延伸：\n\n**理解：**\n\n*   **無面女的攻擊方式：** 無面女的頭髮具有腐蝕性或融化性，能夠直接摧毀觸碰到的物體，例如周澤的頭髮。這暗示了無面女可能是一種非實體、具有特殊能力的生物，或者她的攻擊帶有劇毒或強酸等屬性。\n*   **周澤的應對：** 周澤的指甲似乎具有某種抵抗力或特殊材質，能夠在觸碰到無面女的頭髮時產生反應，導致頭髮融化崩斷。這表明周澤並非完全被動，他擁有某種反擊手段或保護機制。\n*   **脫離束縛：** 隨著無面女的頭髮被摧毀，周澤得以從束縛中掙脫，並開始後退。這是一個關鍵的轉折點，他暫時擺脫了危險。\n\n**可能的延伸和聯想：**\n\n*   **周澤的身份和能力：** 他的指甲為何如此特殊？他是否擁有特殊的體質、裝備，或者是一種特殊的技能？這段文字為周澤的背景和能力留下了懸念。\n*   **無面女的弱點：** 周澤的指甲是無面女的弱點嗎？還是只是暫時的阻礙？這場戰鬥的走向如何？\n*   **場景的氛圍：** 這段文字營造了一種緊張、危險的氛圍。無面女的「無面」特徵也增加了神秘感和恐怖感。\n*   **後續發展：** 周澤脫離束縛後會做什麼？是繼續戰鬥，還是尋找逃脫的機會？無面女會如何反擊？\n\n**總結來說，這段文字成功地塑造了一個充滿衝突和懸念的瞬間，讓讀者對角色的能力和接下來的劇情產生了濃厚的興趣。**\n\n您是否想進一步探討這段文字的某個方面，或者想知道接下來可能發生的事情？ 這句話充滿了強烈的情緒，可以從幾個不同的角度來理解：\n\n**1. 震驚與不相信：**\n\n* **「不可能……不可能……這不可能……」** 這部分表達了說話者對眼前發生的事情感到極度震驚，無法接受事實。他們可能看到了、聽到了、或者經歷了某件完全出乎意料、違背常理的事情。這種重複的否定，顯示了他們內心的掙扎和對現實的抗拒。\n* **「為什麼！」** 這句則是在無法理解的情況下，發出的質問和痛苦的吶喊。他們不明白事情為何會這樣發生，尋求一個解釋，但可能找不到答案，或者答案更加令人絕望。\n\n**可能的情境：**\n\n* **看到親近的人背叛自己。**\n* **努力了很久的事情卻以失敗告終。**\n* **相信的價值觀被徹底顛覆。**\n* **遭遇了無法解釋的災難或不幸。**\n* **發現了驚人的秘密或真相。**\n\n**2. 絕望與無助：**\n\n* 這句話也可能代表著一種深深的絕望。當一個人發現自己所處的境況是如此糟糕，以至於無法改變，或者無法理解時，就會產生這種無力感。\n* 「為什麼！」在這裡可能是一種對命運、對世界、甚至對更高力量的質疑和控訴。\n\n**3. 憤怒與不甘：**\n\n* 在某些情況下，這句話也可能帶有憤怒和不甘的情緒。說話者可能認為自己受到了不公平的對待，或者事情的發展是錯誤的、不正義的。\n\n**總結來說，這句話表達了一種極度的、無法接受的、令人痛苦的現實，伴隨著對原因的困惑和尋求解釋的渴望。**\n\n要更準確地理解這句話，需要知道它是在什麼樣的語境下說出來的。\n\n您能提供更多關於這句話的背景信息嗎？例如：\n\n* **是誰說的？**\n* **在什麼情況下說的？**\n* **之前發生了什麼事情？**\n\n有了這些信息，我才能給您更具體的分析。 我是一個大型語言模型，由 Google 訓練。我沒有實體，也沒有辦法「離開」。我存在於電腦系統中，透過網路與你互動。\n\n你說的「離開」是指什麼呢？是希望我停止回應，還是有其他意思？\n\n如果你對我的回應不滿意，或者覺得我無法滿足你的需求，請告訴我，我會盡力改進。 這句話聽起來充滿了失落、不解和痛苦。當你問「為什麼你也能離開我不能！」時，你可能是在對某個特定的人、一段關係，甚至是一種情況感到無力。\n\n讓我試著從幾個角度來理解這句話背後可能的情感和原因：\n\n**1. 關係中的不對等：**\n\n*   **一方主動，一方被動：** 你可能感覺到對方可以輕易地做出離開的決定，而你卻被困在原地，無法或不敢離開。這可能是因為你對這段關係投入了更多，或者你更依賴對方。\n*   **權力不平衡：** 在某些關係中，一方可能擁有更多的權力或控制權，這使得他們能夠決定關係的走向，而另一方則處於被動地位。\n*   **情感上的牽絆：** 你可能對對方有著深厚的情感，讓你無法割捨，而對方可能已經放下了，或者情感連結沒有那麼深。\n\n**2. 個人內在的限制：**\n\n*   **恐懼：** 你可能害怕離開後會面臨孤獨、未知、經濟困難，或者害怕無法找到更好的替代品。\n*   **責任感或義務感：** 你可能覺得自己有責任維持這段關係，即使它已經讓你痛苦。這可能是因為家庭、孩子、共同的事業，或者對過去的承諾。\n*   **自我價值感低落：** 你可能覺得自己不值得被愛，或者離開了就沒有人會要你，因此不敢嘗試離開。\n*   **習慣和舒適圈：** 即使關係不好，長期的習慣也可能讓你感到熟悉和安全，離開就意味著要打破這種慣性。\n*   **希望和期待：** 你可能還抱持著對方會改變的希望，或者期待關係能回到過去的美好時光，因此不願意放棄。\n\n**3. 對「離開」的定義不同：**\n\n*   **物理上的離開 vs. 情感上的離開：** 對方可能已經在情感上離開了，即使身體還在，而你卻還在努力維繫。\n*   **主動選擇 vs. 被動接受：** 對方是主動選擇離開，而你卻是被動地被留下。\n\n**當你問「為什麼你也能離開我不能！」時，你可能在尋求：**\n\n*   **理解：** 你想知道對方為什麼可以如此輕易地做出決定。\n*   **安慰：** 你希望有人能理解你的痛苦和無助。\n*   **力量：** 你可能在尋求離開的力量和勇氣。\n*   **答案：** 你想知道自己該怎麼辦。\n\n**如果你正在經歷這樣的感受，我想告訴你：**\n\n*   **你的感受是真實的，也是重要的。** 感到痛苦、無助、不解都是正常的。\n*   **你並不孤單。** 很多人都曾經歷過類似的困境。\n*   **你值得被愛，也值得擁有讓你感到快樂和被尊重的關係。**\n*   **尋求支持很重要。** 和信任的朋友、家人聊聊，或者尋求專業的心理諮詢師的幫助，都能給你帶來力量和方向。\n\n如果你願意分享更多關於你所處的具體情況，我或許能提供更貼切的回應。但無論如何，請記住，你擁有做出改變的力量，即使現在看起來很困難。 「為什麼！」這是一個非常廣泛的問題，可以針對任何事情提出。\n\n為了讓我能更精確地回答你，請你提供更多關於你想問「為什麼」的**具體內容**。\n\n例如，你可以問：\n\n*   **關於某個事件：** 「為什麼今天下雨？」、「為什麼那個人會那樣說？」\n*   **關於某個概念：** 「為什麼天空是藍色的？」、「為什麼我們要學習數學？」\n*   **關於某種感受：** 「為什麼我感到很難過？」、「為什麼我對這件事感到興奮？」\n*   **關於某個決定：** 「為什麼要做出這個決定？」、「為什麼要選擇這個方法？」\n*   **關於某個現象：** 「為什麼會發生這種情況？」、「為什麼這個東西會這樣運作？」\n\n**請告訴我，你對什麼感到困惑，想知道「為什麼」？**\n\n我會盡力提供一個有幫助的答案。 「為什麼！」這是一個非常強烈且充滿情感的問句，它可以表達很多不同的意思，取決於說話的語氣、情境和說話者當下的感受。\n\n為了能更精確地理解您想表達的意思，您可以提供更多資訊嗎？例如：\n\n*   **您是在什麼情況下說出「為什麼！」的？**\n*   **您對什麼事情感到困惑、不滿、驚訝或沮喪？**\n*   **您希望得到什麼樣的答案？**\n\n不過，我可以先猜測一些常見的「為什麼！」背後可能的情緒和原因：\n\n**可能的情緒：**\n\n*   **困惑/不解：** 對某件事情的發生感到無法理解。\n*   **不滿/憤怒：** 對某種情況或某人的行為感到不公平或無法接受。\n*   **失望/沮喪：** 事情沒有按照預期發展，感到失落。\n*   **驚訝/難以置信：** 對某個出乎意料的結果感到震驚。\n*   **無奈/絕望：** 感覺無法改變現狀，感到無力。\n*   **質疑/挑戰：** 對某個決定或觀點提出質疑。\n\n**可能的情境：**\n\n*   **事情不如預期：** 例如，考試沒考好，計畫被打亂，努力沒有得到回報。\n*   **遇到不公平待遇：** 例如，被誤解，被冤枉，看到不公正的事情發生。\n*   **無法理解的行為：** 例如，朋友突然疏遠，別人做出奇怪的決定。\n*   **突發的意外：** 例如，東西壞了，發生了不好的事情。\n*   **對人生意義的追問：** 在某些時刻，人們會對生命的意義、世界的運作方式產生「為什麼！」的疑問。\n\n**如果您能告訴我更多，我會更樂意為您提供更貼切的回應！** 我明白你感到不公平。\n\n為了更好地理解你的感受，你能否告訴我更多關於讓你覺得不公平的事情嗎？\n\n例如：\n\n*   **是什麼事情讓你覺得不公平？**\n*   **你認為為什麼這是不公平的？**\n*   **你期望的公平是什麼樣子的？**\n*   **你希望我能做些什麼來幫助你？**\n\n你願意分享更多細節嗎？ 即使只是簡單地說出來，有時候也會有幫助。 您好！听到您觉得不公平，我感到很遗憾。\n\n为了更好地理解您的情况并提供帮助，您能否告诉我更多关于您觉得不公平的事情吗？\n\n例如，您是在什么情况下感到不公平？是关于：\n\n*   **某个具体事件？**\n*   **某个决定？**\n*   **某种待遇？**\n*   **某个规则或政策？**\n*   **人与人之间的关系？**\n\n您提供的信息越详细，我越能理解您的感受，并尝试给出更相关的回应。\n\n请您告诉我，我在这里倾听。 「」 這句話描述了一個場景，其中一個被稱為「無面女」的角色試圖用手阻止周澤。\n\n為了更深入地理解這個場景，我們可以思考以下幾個方面：\n\n*   **「無面女」的身份和特徵：** 「無面」這個詞本身就帶有神秘、恐怖或非人的意味。她沒有臉，這可能意味著她是一個鬼魂、一個怪物、一個被詛咒的人，或者是一個象徵性的存在。她的外貌特徵會極大地影響這個場景的氛圍。\n*   **「攔住」的意圖：** 她為什麼要攔住周澤？\n    *   **保護？** 她可能想阻止周澤進入危險的地方，或者免受某種傷害。\n    *   **阻止？** 她可能不希望周澤做某件事，或者不希望他離開。\n    *   **抓住？** 她可能想抓住周澤，無論是為了什麼目的。\n    *   **警告？** 她的動作可能是一種無聲的警告。\n*   **周澤的反應：** 周澤會如何回應？\n    *   **驚訝？**\n    *   **恐懼？**\n    *   **抵抗？**\n    *   **理解？**\n    *   **無視？**\n*   **場景的氛圍：** 整個場景是緊張、恐怖、悲傷、還是其他什麼樣的氛圍？這取決於「無面女」的形象、她的動作以及周澤的反應。\n\n**舉例來說，這句話可以出現在不同的情境中：**\n\n*   **恐怖故事：** 「無面女」可能是一個鬼魂，她伸出冰冷的手，試圖抓住周澤，阻止他逃離這個被詛咒的房子。\n*   **奇幻小說：** 「無面女」可能是一個古老的守護者，她用手阻擋周澤，因為他還沒有準備好進入下一個階段的試煉。\n*   **象徵性敘事：** 「無面女」可能代表著某種內心的恐懼或過去的創傷，她用手攔住周澤，阻止他前進，因為他還沒有面對自己的陰影。\n\n總之，這是一個充滿想像空間的開頭，具體的含義需要結合上下文來理解。 這段文字描寫了一個非常戲劇性的場景，充滿了奇幻和驚悚的元素。我們可以從幾個方面來分析它：\n\n**1. 觸覺與視覺的強烈對比：**\n\n*   **周澤的動作：** 「用手去擺脫」是一個非常直接、本能的動作，暗示著一種抗拒和求生的本能。\n*   **無面的手的特徵：** 「無面的手」本身就帶有一種非人、詭異的色彩。\n*   **觸碰的結果：** 「指甲一旦觸碰到無面的手，無面女原本完美無瑕的玉手當即被燙出一個洞。」這是最為震撼的部分。\n    *   **「完美無瑕的玉手」：** 這句話營造了一種極致的美感和精緻感，讓人聯想到溫潤、光滑、毫無瑕疵的玉石。\n    *   **「當即被燙出一個洞」：** 這個結果與前面「完美無瑕」的描述形成了極其強烈的對比。這種瞬間的破壞，從完美到殘缺，從無損到受傷，給人一種極大的視覺衝擊和心理上的不適感。\n    *   **「燙出一個洞」：** 「燙」這個詞暗示著極高的溫度，這種高溫並非來自尋常的火焰，而是來自一種超自然的力量，或者說，這隻「無面的手」本身就蘊含著極致的熱量或腐蝕性。\n\n**2. 角色與情境的推測：**\n\n*   **周澤：** 他顯然處於一個危險的境地，正在被「無面的手」控制或攻擊。他的反抗是徒勞的，甚至帶來了更嚴重的後果。\n*   **無面的手/無面女：** 這隻手的主人是一個「無面女」，這本身就充滿了神秘和恐怖。她的手具有極強的破壞力，能夠瞬間摧毀「完美無瑕」的玉手，這說明她可能是一個非常強大、危險的存在，或者她所使用的力量是極端且具有腐蝕性的。\n*   **情境：** 這很可能是一個恐怖、奇幻或武俠小說中的場景。周澤可能是在與一個非人生物搏鬥，或者觸碰到了某種禁忌之物。\n\n**3. 語言的精煉與感染力：**\n\n*   **「一旦觸碰到」：** 強調了事件發生的即時性和必然性。\n*   **「當即」：** 進一步加強了事件的迅速和突然。\n*   **「完美無瑕的玉手」 vs 「被燙出一個洞」：** 這種對比的運用，使得傷害的程度和性質更加鮮明，也更加令人心驚。\n\n**總結來說，這段文字通過描寫周澤的無效反抗和無面女手的極端破壞力，營造了一種強烈的視覺和心理衝擊。它暗示了周澤所面對的危險程度，以及無面女這個角色的神秘和恐怖。**\n\n您希望我從哪個角度進一步分析這段文字呢？例如：\n\n*   這段文字可能出自哪種類型的作品？\n*   這種描寫手法有什麼優點？\n*   可以從中聯想到哪些其他類似的場景或概念？ 聽到你這麼大聲的呼喊，我有點擔心！\n\n發生了什麼事？\n\n* **是開心的事嗎？** 像是中了樂透、考試考得很好、或是遇到了喜歡的人？\n* **是生氣的事嗎？** 像是被誤會、東西壞了、或是遇到不公平的事？\n* **是害怕的事嗎？** 像是看到了什麼可怕的東西、或是遇到了危險？\n* **是難過的事嗎？** 像是失去了什麼、或是感到孤單？\n* **只是單純的情緒宣洩？** 有時候就是需要大喊一下！\n\n請告訴我發生了什麼事，我會盡力幫助你，或者只是聽你說說。 ” The Faceless Woman let out a scream, His figure began to retreat, and from this point on, he also lost control over Zhou Ze.

You all, you and them, even if gone, will ultimately be caught back! 「」 The Faceless Woman was hysterically shouting and roaring below. “她嫉妒” 这句话本身很简洁，但可以引申出很多不同的情境和感受。为了更好地理解和回应，我需要更多的信息。\n\n你可以告诉我更多关于“她”和“嫉妒”的背景吗？例如：\n\n*   **她嫉妒什么？** 是嫉妒别人的成就、财富、外貌、人际关系，还是其他什么？\n*   **她嫉妒谁？** 是嫉妒某个特定的人，还是泛泛地嫉妒周围的人？\n*   **这种嫉妒是如何表现出来的？** 是沉默的、攻击性的、还是通过其他方式？\n*   **你为什么会说“她嫉妒”？** 是你观察到的，还是她自己表达出来的？\n*   **你对这句话有什么样的感受或疑问？**\n\n根据你提供的信息，我可以给出更具体的回应，例如：\n\n*   **如果她嫉妒别人的成就：** “嫉妒别人的成就确实会让人感到不舒服，但也可以把它看作是一种激励，去思考自己想要什么，并为之努力。”\n*   **如果她嫉妒别人的外貌：** “外貌的美丽是多样的，每个人都有自己独特的光彩。专注于自己的优点，你会发现自己也很棒。”\n*   **如果她嫉妒别人的感情：** “感情是需要经营的，也许她只是在寻找属于自己的幸福。”\n\n请告诉我更多细节，我才能更好地理解并给出有意义的回复。 這是一個很簡短的句子，可以有很多種解讀和延續。為了更好地理解你想表達的意思，請提供更多上下文。\n\n不過，我可以根據這句話提供一些可能的延續和方向：\n\n**可能的延續方向：**\n\n*   **羨慕什麼？**\n    *   她羨慕 **別人的成就**。\n    *   她羨慕 **別人的生活方式**。\n    *   她羨慕 **別人的自信**。\n    *   她羨慕 **別人的愛情**。\n    *   她羨慕 **別人的自由**。\n    *   她羨慕 **別人的才華**。\n    *   她羨慕 **別人的幸運**。\n    *   她羨慕 **別人的快樂**。\n    *   她羨慕 **別人的過去**。\n    *   她羨慕 **別人的未來**。\n\n*   **為什麼羨慕？**\n    *   她羨慕，**因為自己沒有**。\n    *   她羨慕，**因為自己渴望**。\n    *   她羨慕，**因為自己覺得不公平**。\n    *   她羨慕，**因為自己對現狀不滿**。\n\n*   **羨慕之後呢？**\n    *   她羨慕，**然後更加努力**。\n    *   她羨慕，**然後感到失落**。\n    *   她羨慕，**然後開始模仿**。\n    *   她羨慕，**然後學會欣賞**。\n    *   她羨慕，**然後決定改變自己**。\n\n**請告訴我更多關於「她」和她所羨慕的對象，這樣我才能提供更精確和有意義的回應。**\n\n例如，你可以說：\n\n*   「她羨慕，**看到朋友順利找到工作。**」\n*   「她羨慕，**那個女孩的笑容總是那麼燦爛。**」\n*   「她羨慕，**別人可以隨心所欲地旅行。**」\n\n期待你的進一步說明！ 這句話可以有很多種解讀，取決於你想要表達的具體意思。\n\n你可以說：\n\n*   **她很瘋狂！** (She's crazy!) - 這是一種比較直接的說法，可以表示她行為出格、不尋常，或者情緒非常激動。\n*   **她太瘋狂了！** (She's too crazy!) - 強調程度，表示她的瘋狂程度很高。\n*   **她簡直是瘋了！** (She's absolutely crazy!) - 表示非常強烈的程度，甚至有點難以置信。\n*   **她瘋得厲害！** (She's acting really crazy!) - 強調她當下的行為表現。\n\n**為了更精確地理解你的意思，你能否提供更多上下文呢？**\n\n例如：\n\n*   **她為什麼讓你覺得她瘋狂？** 是因為她的行為、想法、情緒，還是其他什麼？\n*   **你說這句話時的心情是怎樣的？** 是驚訝、擔憂、好笑，還是其他？\n\n有了更多資訊，我才能更好地理解並給你更貼切的回應。 這句話「而不斷上升中的周澤，」本身是一個不完整的句子，它提供了一個主語「周澤」以及一個狀態「不斷上升中」，但缺少了謂語（動詞）和賓語（受詞），所以無法得知「周澤」在上升什麼。\n\n為了讓這句話完整且有意義，我們可以根據不同的情境來補全它。以下是一些可能的補全方式，以及它們所代表的意思：\n\n**可能的補全方向：**\n\n*   **指代人名：** 如果「周澤」是人名，那麼「不斷上升」可能指：\n    *   **事業/地位：** 「而不斷上升中的周澤，**事業蒸蒸日上。**」 (他的事業發展得很好)\n    *   **名氣/聲望：** 「而不斷上升中的周澤，**名氣越來越大。**」 (越來越多人知道他)\n    *   **人氣/受歡迎程度：** 「而不斷上升中的周澤，**人氣居高不下。**」 (他很受歡迎)\n    *   **能力/技能：** 「而不斷上升中的周澤，**能力得到了極大的提升。**」 (他的能力進步了很多)\n    *   **情緒/心情（較少見，但有可能）：** 「而不斷上升中的周澤，**心情異常激動。**」 (他感到非常興奮)\n\n*   **指代事物/概念：** 如果「周澤」不是人名，而是某個事物或概念，那麼「不斷上升」可能指：\n    *   **股價/指數：** 「而不斷上升中的周澤，**股價創下新高。**」 (某個股票或指數的價格在漲)\n    *   **溫度/氣溫：** 「而不斷上升中的周澤，**氣溫預計將達到30度。**」 (某個地方的溫度在升高)\n    *   **水位/水準：** 「而不斷上升中的周澤，**水位已接近警戒線。**」 (某個河流或湖泊的水位在漲)\n    *   **數據/指標：** 「而不斷上升中的周澤，**銷售額屢創新紀錄。**」 (某個銷售數據在不斷增加)\n    *   **某種趨勢/現象：** 「而不斷上升中的周澤，**顯示了市場的強勁需求。**」 (某種趨勢正在顯現)\n\n**總結來說，要理解「而不斷上升中的周澤，」這句話，需要知道「周澤」代表什麼，以及它在上升什麼。**\n\n如果您能提供更多上下文，我會更精確地理解並回答您的問題。 這句話可以有幾種不同的理解和延伸，取決於上下文。以下是一些可能的解釋和接續：\n\n**1. 身體上的失去意識：**\n\n* **因為疲憊或疾病：**\n    * 「則慢慢地失去了自己的意識，**身體像灌了鉛一樣沉重，最終倒在了地上。**」\n    * 「則慢慢地失去了自己的意識，**眼前的一切都變得模糊不清，最後陷入一片黑暗。**」\n    * 「則慢慢地失去了自己的意識，**感覺自己正在沉入一個無底的深淵。**」\n\n* **因為藥物或麻醉：**\n    * 「則慢慢地失去了自己的意識，**藥效開始發揮作用，他感到一陣暈眩。**」\n    * 「則慢慢地失去了自己的意識，**手術的麻醉劑讓他逐漸放鬆，意識也隨之飄遠。**」\n\n**2. 精神上的失去意識（失去自我、失去理智）：**\n\n* **因為極度的痛苦或悲傷：**\n    * 「則慢慢地失去了自己的意識，**悲傷如同潮水般將他淹沒，他再也無法思考。**」\n    * 「則慢慢地失去了自己的意識，**痛苦的折磨讓他無法承受，理智的防線開始崩潰。**」\n\n* **因為沉迷或麻痺：**\n    * 「則慢慢地失去了自己的意識，**沉浸在虛擬的世界裡，現實的意義變得越來越淡薄。**」\n    * 「則慢慢地失去了自己的意識，**日復一日的單調生活讓他變得麻木，對一切都失去了感知。**」\n\n* **因為某種強烈的影響（如催眠、蠱惑）：**\n    * 「則慢慢地失去了自己的意識，**對方的話語像魔咒一樣，一點點侵蝕著他的意志。**」\n    * 「則慢慢地失去了自己的意識，**他被那股神秘的力量所吸引，再也無法抗拒。**」\n\n**3. 抽象的失去意識（失去目標、失去方向）：**\n\n* **因為迷失或絕望：**\n    * 「則慢慢地失去了自己的意識，**他不知道自己為何而來，也不知道要去何方。**」\n    * 「則慢慢地失去了自己的意識，**對未來不再抱有任何希望，生命也失去了意義。**」\n\n**為了更精確地接續，請提供更多上下文。** 例如：\n\n* **誰** 慢慢地失去了自己的意識？\n* **為什麼** 他們失去了意識？\n* **在什麼樣的場景下** 發生了這件事？\n\n有了這些資訊，我才能提供更貼切的接續。 Underworld Yellow Springs small path, The dazzling of 彼岸花, The Roar of the Faceless Woman, The graceful and demure nature of the woman in a qipao, Everything, everything, It seems that everything is gradually moving away from him…………",

    "content": "The midnight streets,\n\nthe streetlights yellow,\nthe people also distraught,\nthe sky was cold, and there was wind, like knives cutting people.\n\nZhou Ze also felt cold.\nHe didn't know where this was again,\nbut he knew one thing:\nthis was... the human world.\n\nHe was already dead, but he had come back.\nHe didn't know what he should do,\nhe could only mechanically and numbly continue walking forward.\n\nHe didn't have the time now to think about too many other things,\nsuch as the place he had just gone down to,\nsuch as the old man he had treated before the car accident,\nsuch as the faceless woman in the pond wearing a red dress,\nsuch as... his fingernails.\n\nHe had returned, which should have been a joyous thing, but even if people occasionally walked by him, even if he tried to greet them with all his might, no one could see or hear him.\n\nHe was excluded by this world, isolated.\nPeople who hadn't experienced being put in \"solitary confinement\" wouldn't understand the pain of complete isolation, and for Zhou Ze, the entire world right now was his cage, and a black cloth was draped over the cage.\n\nNo one could see him,\nand no one could communicate with him,\nhe couldn't pick up anything tangible,\neven,\neven the wind could easily blow right through him.\n\nHe was so weak,\nthe phrase \"too weak to withstand a breeze\" was truly no exaggeration when applied to him.\n\nMoreover, what shocked and horrified Zhou Ze the most was,\nhe could see faint specks of light constantly dissipating from his body,\nin other words,\nhis body was slowly fading.\n\nPerhaps in another fifteen minutes, he would completely disappear, the last insignificant trace of him erased.\n\nHe didn't know how all of this had happened, but he knew clearly that he really didn't have much time left.\n\nAmong the Eight Immortals, Iron Crutch Li was said to have entered the body of a person who had starved to death, which is how he came to be known in the form passed down through generations.\n\nZhou Ze had also heard stories about ghosts \"borrowing a corpse to return to life,\" and he also wanted to borrow a corpse to return to life. He was very cold and very flustered; he needed a physical body to attach himself to.\n\nHe didn't even care who this person was.\n\nPeople were always selfish at such times, and Zhou Ze was no exception. Moreover, he truly couldn't take it anymore.\n\nHowever, whenever he prepared to approach someone, lights and flames would appear above their heads and on their shoulders, directly preventing him from getting close. He even suffered harm as a result, accelerating his \"evaporation\" speed.\n\nHe was a bit tired, and a bit numb,\nhe was waiting for his end,\nwaiting for his finish.\n\nAs someone who had already died once, facing death again made him somewhat more composed.\n\nMoreover, given Zhou Ze's current situation, the longer he lingered here, the longer he would endure torment.\n\n\"Creak...\"\n\nAhead, there was a storefront still lit up, seemingly a bookstore, as rows of bookshelves could be seen through the glass door.\n\nSomeone pushed the door open from inside and walked out. It was a man wearing a hoodie. The man wore a hat, so his true face couldn't be clearly seen. He looked left and right for a while, then hurried away.\n\nOf course, the man couldn't see Zhou Ze standing less than five meters away from him.\n\nOriginally, Zhou Ze didn't feel anything unusual, but shortly after the man left, Zhou Ze suddenly sensed a warm aura from inside the bookstore.\n\nYes,\na warm aura.\n\nThis warmth made Zhou Ze feel somewhat bewildered, but he was now like a person about to freeze to death who suddenly received a box of matches; even if he knew the matches couldn't save his life, he would still strike them to feel the last bit of warmth before dying.\n\nZhou Ze walked towards it, his body passing directly through the bookstore's glass door, continuing inside, and arriving behind the bookshelves.\n\nBehind the bookshelves,\nlay a person,\na handsome young man, probably twenty-three or twenty-four years old. Because the air conditioning was on in the store, he wasn't wearing much, just a long-sleeved shirt and a light jacket.\n\nHe lay on the ground, but from his body, Zhou Ze sensed a warm feeling, like a pauper walking down the road at night and picking up a bag of gold coins.\n\nThis attraction was irresistible, and Zhou Ze, in his current state, had no right to refuse!\n\nZhou Ze walked over and squatted down in front of this young man.\nHe didn't know how to enter the other person's body, but he understood how to make contact with the warmth he needed.\n\nHe extended a hand and placed it on the other person's chest.\nZhou Ze saw his fingernails slowly embed themselves into the other person's body.\nThis was a very strange feeling, different from when a \"breeze\" previously blew through his body as he walked. This was a fusion, a merging using his fingernails as a medium.\n\nSlowly, Zhou Ze's entire being began to enter the other person's body, and the two began to overlap.\n\n..................\n\n\"Xu Le! Wake up, wake up!\"\n\nZhou Ze was awakened by a series of shoves—no, to be precise, he was \"startled.\" He opened his eyes and found himself sitting behind the bookstore counter, his hands previously resting on it.\n\n\"Hey, wake up!\"\n\nThe woman's voice was sharp and high-pitched, carrying an air of bossiness.\n\nRaising his head, Zhou Ze looked at the woman in front of him—no, to be precise, it should be a girl, probably high school age. Although she was a \"big girl,\" she still had a touch of childishness.\n\n\"Hey, Xu Le, what exactly do you mean? You think you're so capable, huh? You want to show my parents and my sister attitude, huh? You actually dared not come home all night last night!\nWho gave you the guts to do that?!\"\n\nXu Le?\nWho is that?\nZhou Ze spread his hands out in confusion, finding them very smooth. His own hands used to have calluses from long hours of practicing with surgical instruments, but these hands had none.\n\n\"Hey, I'm talking to you!\"\n\nThe girl slapped the counter with a bang, full of aggressive momentum.\n\nZhou Ze frowned slightly, stood up, and walked to the glass mirror by the shop door. He saw his reflection: a strange face—no, he had seen this face before, it was the face he saw last night.\n\nThis body,\nis mine now?\n\n\"Hey, what do you mean? My parents are really angry, and my mom's throwing a fit at home. I'm telling you, everything you eat, drink, and use comes from my family. What right do you, a live-in son-in-law, have to put on airs in my house?\nWho are you trying to impress?!\nIf you dare not come home again tonight, do you believe I'll come over and smack you directly?!\"\n\nThe girl made a gesture to raise her palm, but she suddenly noticed that the man in front of her, her \"brother-in-law,\" didn't dodge or beg for mercy as usual. Instead, the look in his eyes made her feel a little scared.\n\nAt this point, she checked the time and saw it was already 7:30.\n\n\"Hmph, I'm going to school now. I'll settle accounts with you tonight!\"\nThe girl stomped off angrily.\n\nZhou Ze slowly sat back down on the chair behind the counter. There was an old laptop here, and a cell phone next to it.\n\nEven now, he still hadn't fully adapted to the process of his identity change.\n\nHe was Zhou Ze, a famous young surgeon in Tongcheng, and he was an orphan.\n\nAs a result,\nhe had now become this identity.\nWhat did that girl just say?\nI'm a... live-in son-in-law?\n\nHave a wife?\nAnd a mother-in-law and father-in-law?\n\nAnd judging by the attitude and tone of his \"sister-in-law\" when speaking to her \"brother-in-law\" just now, this \"live-in son-in-law\" truly conformed to ancient \"fine traditions.\"\n\nA live-in son-in-law, commonly known as a \"door-to-door son-in-law,\" was not only looked down upon by his wife's family but also by everyone around him in ancient times. Their status was even similar to that of criminals; during the Han and Tang dynasties, those forced to serve on the border often included live-in sons-in-law.\n\nHe picked up the phone. It had no password, he didn't know if the guy was lazy or didn't dare to set one, but at least it allowed Zhou Ze to easily open his WeChat and QQ.\n\nThe QQ contact list had few people: just a few junior high, high school, and college classmates. Then there was a family list with only one person, noted as \"Wife.\"\n\nHe opened the QQ chat history with her: empty.\n\nAlright,\nZhou Ze opened WeChat and tried searching, finding the woman noted as \"Wife.\" Here, there were replies, mostly Xu Le asking about things like what to eat tonight, what needed to be prepared tonight, how much money was needed for inventory, how much the bookstore had sold recently, how her health was, a whole bunch of questions,\nand the other party's replies were often perfunctory and aloof,\nwith:\n\"Oh.\"\n\"Mm.\"\n\"Okay.\"\nused as replies.\n\nZhou Ze tossed the phone aside. This relationship was a bit complicated. He suddenly looked at his palm; his fingernails were no different from an ordinary person's.\n\nBut in the events like the old man he treated before the car accident, his escape from the faceless woman, and his entry into this guy's body, his fingernails had played an extremely crucial role.\n\nWith a thought,\njust then,\nZhou Ze found his fingernails slowly growing longer, simultaneously becoming pitch-black and translucent. There was even a faint black mist swirling around them.\n\n\"Whoosh...\"\nHe let out a long breath,\nclosed his eyes,\nand when he opened them again,\nhis fingernails had returned to normal.\n\nFrom morning until noon, Zhou Ze sat there, trying to adapt to his new identity and calm the discomfort brought by the identity change. He didn't even eat lunch, unsure if he had forgotten or simply didn't feel hungry at all.\n\nThis was still Tongcheng. Zhou Ze's former home was in Chongchuan District, and now he was in Gangzha District, not far apart.\n\nBy the afternoon, Zhou Ze finally sighed, quietly stood up, and thought, \"Since I'm here, I might as well make myself at home.\"\n\nHe began to try cleaning the bookshelves. In any case, he needed to find something to do for himself first.\n\nThe old man who had strangled him before he died had said \"he's been found,\" and the faceless woman in hell had said \"you'll be caught sooner or later,\" which created a sense of crisis in Zhou Ze's heart.\n\nHis current state was considered \"barely surviving.\" To be resurrected after death was a stroke of divine luck, so he cherished it. At least, until he fully understood the situation and gathered enough clues, he had to embrace this identity and ideally not cause too much abnormality, so as not to attract the attention of those \"who wanted to catch him.\"\n\nThe business of this shop was really bad. The slump in the traditional book market wasn't a new thing, and this place wasn't on the \"golden street\" right in front of a school gate.\n\nIt could only be said that whether \"Xu Le\" could even break even by choosing to open a bookstore here was questionable.\n\nIt wasn't until three o'clock in the afternoon that the first customer of the day walked in.\n\nThe customer was browsing the children's books section, and had been browsing for a long time.\n\nZhou Ze waited for a while, then still walked over and asked, \"What kind of topic are you looking for?\"\n\nAlthough, Zhou Ze didn't understand either.\n\n\"Just looking around,\" the other party replied.\n\n\"Mm.\" Zhou Ze then ignored them. He hadn't yet integrated into the role of \"bookstore owner.\"\n\nBut just then,\nthe other party suddenly walked behind him and spoke faintly:\n\n\"You really don't recognize me?\"\n\n\"What?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Last night, I hit your head with a baseball bat and robbed you of your money,\nand I even specifically checked,\nyou clearly had no breath left then.\"",

    "content": "Zhou Ze was stunned for a moment, so, the reason he was able to use \"Xu Le\"'s body for a soul possession last night was because he had just been killed?\n\nBecause the body was still warm, that's why he could enter?\n\nLooking at it this way, he seemed to be quite lucky indeed.\n\nThere was no disgust, no anger, and even less the panic of his identity possibly being exposed. Zhou Ze turned around and looked at the man behind him, who was about the same age as himself.\n\nThe man was startled for a moment,\n\nHe saw something unusual in Zhou Ze's eyes,\n\nIt was joy,\n\nIt was relief,\n\nAnd even,\n\nA hint of appreciation.\n\nAs a host, in last night's situation, Zhou Ze clearly understood the difficult predicament he faced. If this guy hadn't happened to kill someone at that moment, he might have already vanished into thin air and wouldn't have seen today's sun at all.\n\n“Sorry, I passed out last night, and my head feels really uncomfortable this morning, like I drank too much. I forgot what happened yesterday,” Zhou Ze explained casually.\n\nHe didn't think the other party would guess he was a ghost possessing a corpse, unless the other party had lost his mind.\n\n“You don't blame me?” The other party pointed to his own nose, sounding a bit absurd, “Even though I've already told you I knocked you out yesterday?”\n\n“It's fine. I actually thank you for not taking my phone and computer from the table.”\n\n“Uh… I forgot,” the man scratched his head. “It's good that you're okay. This is the money I robbed from you yesterday.”\n\nThe man voluntarily took out three hundred yuan from his pocket, then rummaged around again and took out another eight hundred yuan.\n\n“Eight hundred yuan is for your medical expenses, and three hundred is what I robbed yesterday.” The man pursed his lips. “Yesterday, I gambled online and lost all my wages to a shady bookie. When I passed your bookstore, I suddenly wanted to get some money to spend. After I knocked you down, I found you had no breath, and I was scared to death.\n\nAfter running home, I couldn't sleep all night, just thinking if the police would suddenly break in and arrest me. Burglary plus murder, and I only took three hundred yuan. I felt really stupid, it wasn't worth it at all.”\n\nThe man reached out and patted Zhou Ze on the shoulder,\n\n“Buddy, it's really good that you're not dead, truly. I've been wandering outside since morning, waiting for someone to call the police, waiting for the police to come. But then I saw you were actually still in the bookstore.\n\nYou know, at that moment, I almost knelt down and kowtowed to you. Thank you. You're tough, you didn't die. Otherwise, I would have been finished. There are so many cameras here; if you had died, I definitely couldn't have gotten away.”\n\nZhou Ze looked at the eleven hundred yuan in his hand, then at the “murderer” in front of him, who was repenting to him with tears in his eyes. He just felt that this scene was very bizarre.\n\nHonestly, “Xu Le” was dead. Because he was dead, Zhou Ze could occupy his body like a cuckoo in a magpie's nest. And because Zhou Ze had occupied his body, the guy in front of him was spared from a murder charge.\n\nBoth he and the guy in front of him had profited. Only Xu Le was an unlucky soul.\n\n“Alright, it's fine. Maybe I just got winded last night.” Zhou Ze moved the other party's hand off his shoulder. He used to be an emergency doctor; what kind of filth hadn't he seen? But in that extreme environment, he had developed a slight germophobia. In fact, most emergency doctors have varying degrees of germophobia.\n\nIt was precisely because he had witnessed too much dirt and filth that he understood how to cherish “cleanliness” even more.\n\n“You really don't blame me?” the man said, somewhat delighted.\n\n“No, I don't blame you.” Zhou Ze nodded. “Go to work and live your life well. Don't make mistakes next time.”\n\n“Okay, thank you, buddy. You're a straightforward person.”\n\nThe man nodded heavily, left the bookstore, and went to embrace his “new life.”\n\nMeanwhile, Zhou Ze picked up his phone. He thought for a moment and decided he still had to call the police, not to report the other party for killing him (Xu Le), but to report him for suspected theft.\n\nAnyway, let the police investigate. If the other party really had a criminal record or had done other bad things and was caught by the police, he deserved it.\n\nSince he had occupied someone else's body, he ought to do something for this unlucky soul.\n\nAlthough, given the other party's good attitude in admitting his mistake and even returning the medical expenses, for him to still report him by name was indeed quite immoral, a bit like “having a son without an anus.”¹\n\nHowever, just as Zhou Ze dialed 110 and the operator's voice came through,\n\nAt the bookstore entrance,\n\nThat guy suddenly returned.\n\n“There's one more thing…” The other party had just walked in when he saw Zhou Ze holding his phone. He froze for a moment, then pointed directly at Zhou Ze, “You motherf***er, you're still going to call the police, aren't you!”\n\nZhou Ze shook his head.\n\n“Let me see your phone, give it to me!”\n\nZhou Ze could only continue to shake his head.\n\n“You don't keep your word, you bastard! I'll kill you! Let's see if you die this time!”\n\nThe man instantly entered an agitated and excited state. His mental state probably had a slight problem, perhaps due to his long-term gambler's lifestyle and disconnection from society. He often easily became extreme due to the stimulation of certain events.\n\nThe other party lunged forward. Zhou Ze put down his phone, and his body began to retreat.\n\nIn his previous life, he was a doctor, not a boxer, and hadn't practiced martial arts. His body in this life was also a bit frail. When it came to face-to-face fighting, he was indeed a bit flustered.\n\n“Bang!”\n\nThe man crashed into Zhou Ze, pinning him against the wall, while his hands began to tightly grip Zhou Ze's neck.\n\n“I'll teach you to call the police, I'll teach you to call the police, I'll teach you not to keep your word! Fine, I'll make you die, make you truly die! This time, I'll strangle you to death and then drain your blood! Let's see if you're still not dead!”\n\nThe man roared through gritted teeth.\n\nPoor bookstore business. In the afternoon, let alone customers, there weren't even many pedestrians at the entrance.\n\nHis neck was almost numb, and he could no longer breathe. Zhou Ze struggled with all his might. During the struggle, Zhou Ze's fingernails suddenly turned black and elongated.\n\nImmediately after, Zhou Ze wrapped his hands around the other party's back.\n\n“Hiss………………”\n\nThe man suddenly shivered, his eyes rolled back, and he immediately released Zhou Ze's neck. He stumbled back a few steps, knocking over several bookshelves, and then collapsed to the ground with a thud.\n\nZhou Ze was freed. He reached up and rubbed his neck. He hadn't actually been too panicked earlier. After all, his fingernails could even injure evil spirits from hell, so dealing with an ordinary person shouldn't be much of a problem, right?\n\nBut what exactly caused these fingernails and what their use was, Zhou Ze wasn't entirely clear yet. He only knew they were likely “transmitted” to him by the old man he saved before his car accident,\n\nIt really was,\n\nLike getting onychomycosis, one infects two.²\n\nWalking forward, Zhou Ze squatted down and patted the man's face. Thankfully, he wasn't dead, still breathing. Zhou Ze shook his head, picked up his phone, and called the police again.\n\n………………\n\nAfter completing the statement at the police station, the police officer asked Zhou Ze to wait in the small hall, because the matter Zhou Ze reported was a bit strange: he said someone came to rob him, but the one who ended up being knocked out was actually the “perpetrator.” And now this perpetrator was still in the hospital; they would have to wait for him to wake up for further confirmation.\n\nHowever, the police officer at least didn't handcuff Zhou Ze.\n\nNext to Zhou Ze, a middle-aged man was squatting, his left hand locked to a radiator.\n\n“Brother, you're awesome! That guy tried to rob you, but you took him down?” The somewhat disheveled middle-aged man said, rubbing his long, dirty bangs. “You really have that vibe I had when I was young. For these clueless petty thieves, you just have to beat them to death!”\n\n“Hey, you behave yourself,” a young police officer walked over and reprimanded him. “How many times have you stolen electric bikes since winter began?\n\nI'm telling you, the New Year is coming soon, can't you just settle down? Or find a proper job and earn some money to send home? You're a grown man now.”\n\n“Working is impossible, it's impossible to work in this lifetime. I don't know how to do business; only by stealing electric bike batteries can I maintain this kind of life. Going to the detention center feels like coming home.\n\nEveryone inside is a talent, and they speak so nicely. I super love it in there!”\n\n“Hmph.” The young police officer didn't want to bother with this guy anymore and turned to leave directly.\n\n“Brother, how was my speech just now?” The greasy middle-aged man winked at Zhou Ze.\n\n“Quite interesting,” Zhou Ze smiled.\n\n“Che Guevara is my idol. Che Guevara, do you know who that is?”\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\n“Let me tell you, life has to be like…” The greasy middle-aged man paused, his gaze shifting towards the doorway, and said, “Holy moly, she's so beautiful! Is that a police officer?”\n\nZhou Ze turned his head to look. At the doorway, a woman wearing a blue down jacket and long leather boots, accompanied by another female police officer, was walking towards them.\n\n“She should be a police officer,” Zhou Ze said.\n\nThe woman was very beautiful, with a delicate figure and fair skin. Most importantly, it was her aura that was the biggest plus.\n\n“But she's not wearing a police uniform,” the greasy man retorted.\n\n“Maybe she's in plain clothes,” Zhou Ze guessed.\n\n“You're right. A beautiful police flower, tsk tsk. Looks like I'll have to come in more often from now on.” The greasy middle-aged man smacked his lips, looking unsatisfied. “If I could marry her, I'd willingly cut ten years off my lifespan.”\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. He no longer dared to joke about things like lifespan and vitality.\n\n“You disagree?” The greasy man, seeing Zhou Ze shake his head, said anxiously, “You're blind to beauty! For a woman like that, losing ten years of your life for her is definitely not a loss…”\n\nAt this moment, the female police officer and the woman in long boots walked up to Zhou Ze.\n\n“Xu Le, your wife is here to take you home. The investigation over there is clear; you're free to go,” the female police officer said, pointing at Zhou Ze.\n\n“…………” Zhou Ze.\n\n“…………” The greasy middle-aged man.\n\n---\n¹ “Having a son without an anus” (生兒子沒屁眼兒): A highly vulgar Chinese idiom used to describe someone as utterly despicable or lacking basic human decency.\n² “Like getting onychomycosis, one infects two” (得了灰指甲，一個傳染倆): A pun based on a well-known advertising slogan for a Chinese medicine used to treat onychomycosis (fungal nail infection), implying that the infection spreads easily.

    "content": "“Officer, may I ask, what was my wife’s name again?”\n\nThis thought only crossed Zhou Ze’s mind; he wasn't so foolish as to actually ask. But he genuinely didn't know his “wife’s” real name. In this day and age, few people use their real names for QQ or WeChat.\n\nThe oily man, however, cast an aggrieved glance at Zhou Ze: “Brother, you’re not being fair. We said we’d be each other’s broken-winged angels, didn’t we?”\n\nZhou Ze returned a helpless glance: “I’m surprised too.”\n\nThe oily man lowered his head, sighed, and murmured softly, “My dumplings are delicious.”\n\n“Let’s go.”\n\nHis “wife” said coolly, then turned and walked directly out.\n\nZhou Ze could only follow her.\n\nShe drove a Cayenne and got right in.\n\nZhou Ze opened the car door and sat in the passenger seat.\n\nTo be honest,\n\nIt was a bit awkward.\n\nIf that unlucky fellow Xu Le’s marital and family life had been more normal, then Zhou Ze wouldn’t be in such an awkward situation now. He could have found excuses to explain his doting wife’s concern, like feeling dizzy and not remembering things clearly.\n\nBut this woman clearly had the air of an iceberg goddess, seemingly completely uninterested in engaging with him. Even picking him up from the police station seemed like a mere formality.\n\nLike my dog got lost, the security guard found it,\n\nAnd I went to pick it up.\n\nThat was the feeling.\n\nThe woman started the car. She was actually quite young, probably around the same age as him (Xu Le), and several years younger than the original Zhou Ze.\n\nAs the car drove onto the elevated road, the woman finally broke the silence:\n\n“Are you alright?”\n\n“Oh, I’m fine,” Zhou Ze replied.\n\nThen,\n\nSilence again.\n\nThe woman felt her husband was unusually quiet today, but she had no desire to probe for the reason.\n\nJust then, the woman’s phone rang. She put it on speaker, and the voice from the other end came through the car’s audio system:\n\n“Doctor Lin, there’s just been a school bus collision on Qingnian Middle Road. Casualties are already being transported to our hospital. The director wants you back immediately.”\n\nZhou Ze was slightly taken aback.\n\nSo his wife was also a doctor.\n\nAnd,\n\nSo his wife’s surname was “Lin.”\n\n“I understand, I’ll be right back.” The woman hung up, immediately exited the elevated road ahead, then made a sharp turn at the traffic light, driving towards the hospital.\n\nShe didn’t ask Zhou Ze if he wanted to be dropped off at home first or if he wanted to get out and take a taxi back himself. Instead, she drove the car directly into the parking lot of Chongchuan District People’s Hospital.\n\nHonestly, Zhou Ze was worried she’d tell him to get out and take a taxi home, thinking he’d then have to shamelessly ask:\n\n“Wife, where do we live again? I forgot.”\n\nIt just felt silly.\n\nThe woman got out of the car, and Zhou Ze followed. The woman entered the hospital building and got on the elevator, and Zhou Ze followed her into the elevator. The woman entered the women’s changing room, and Zhou Ze…\n\nZhou Ze sat down on a bench by the corridor.\n\nJust then, the first batch of accident victims arrived. One person was critically injured, and five other children also had serious injuries.\n\nWatching his “wife” change into a white lab coat and immediately get busy with treatment,\n\nZhou Ze could only sit on the bench, lost in thought.\n\nIt felt a bit like a mother bringing her son to work, with the mother working and the son watching, playing by himself.\n\nHowever,\n\nThe unique smell of disinfectant in the hospital and the stuffiness of the central air conditioning truly brought back memories—a familiar feeling.\n\nAhead was the emergency room. The critically injured and life-threatening patient seemed to be a girl.\n\nIt was a kindergarten school bus that had the accident. Seeing the little children crying out in pain on the operating tables, the scene was indeed quite heartbreaking.\n\nZhou Ze pursed his lips. Usually, at this time, he would have already changed into his scrubs and participated in the rescue work. He was Tongcheng’s most renowned young surgeon, but now, he could only be a bystander.\n\nThis feeling was very uncomfortable, but he could only endure it. Moreover, this People’s Hospital was considered the best hospital on the surface in Tongcheng, and the quantity and quality of its doctors were unquestionable. They should be able to handle it.\n\nSoon, the next batch of children was brought in. Their injuries were lighter, requiring only wound treatment or simple bandaging.\n\nTraffic police officers were specifically guarding the entrance to this floor. Some parents who had been notified had already arrived, their emotions very agitated. However, letting parents in at this time could hinder the treatment work, so they had to be stopped for now.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head, stood up, walked to the window at the far end of the hallway, reached out to prop the window open, then pulled out a cigarette from his pocket. He smoked, and Xu Le also smoked, which was convenient at this moment.\n\n“Uncle, you can’t smoke in the hospital.”\n\nJust as he bit the cigarette filter, a clear little girl’s voice came from behind Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze turned around and saw a little girl in a lily dress standing behind him, her mouth pouting, looking at him indignantly.\n\nAhem,\n\nA bit awkward.\n\nZhou Ze could only put the cigarette away. Regardless, being lectured by a little girl about public etiquette was always a bit embarrassing.\n\n“Little one, aren’t you cold dressed so lightly?” Zhou Ze bent down and asked.\n\nThe little girl’s skin was delicate, her face had a touch of baby fat, and her big eyes were very cute, like an enlarged Barbie doll.\n\n“Not cold at all.” The little girl shook her head. “Uncle, you can’t smoke in the hospital anymore, okay?”\n\n“I know.”\n\nZhou Ze nodded very seriously.\n\n“Are you alright?” Zhou Ze asked again.\n\n“I’m fine. The other children are all hurt, and they’re in so much pain.”\n\nThe little girl turned sideways, looking at the other children behind her who were having their wounds bandaged. Most of them were crying. It wasn’t really because the pain was unbearable, but rather that when one person cried, the others followed suit.\n\nNurses had to both treat wounds and comfort the children.\n\nOutside, the parents, temporarily blocked by the traffic police, were constantly shouting and cursing.\n\nIn short,\n\nThis floor felt chaotic.\n\n“Then you’re really lucky,” Zhou Ze sighed.\n\nThe little girl had not a single scar on her.\n\n“Mmm, I was sitting in the back row, so I’m fine.” The little girl nodded, then actively ran over to comfort her classmates, looking here and there, encouraging and soothing them.\n\nShe was a very sensible and strong child.\n\nZhou Ze turned around, subconsciously took out a cigarette again, then thought better of it and put it back.\n\nWhen he returned to the bench and sat down, three nurses and two doctors walked out of the emergency room ahead.\n\nOne male doctor and one female doctor, the female doctor being his wife.\n\n“It’s okay, we did our best,” the male doctor said, reaching out to put a comforting hand on Zhou Ze’s wife’s shoulder.\n\nAs a husband,\n\nZhou Ze was sitting right there,\n\nBut he wasn’t bothered by this scene…\n\nThat damn Xu Le had left him such a complicated mess: a live-in son-in-law, a hot-tempered sister-in-law, and clearly ill-tempered in-laws.\n\nZhou Ze wished his wife would just have an affair, dump him, and divorce him so he could have some peace and quiet.\n\nWho, having just died and been reborn into a new body, would want to deal with the complexities of a modern urban live-in son-in-law’s life?\n\nHowever, to Zhou Ze’s surprise, his wife directly blocked the doctor’s groping hand and pointed at him, saying:\n\n“This is my husband.”\n\nThere was no tenderness in her words, simple, stiff, as if saying: This is my husky.\n\n“Oh, hello, sir.” The male doctor’s expression was a bit awkward. Regardless, flirting with someone’s wife right in front of them always felt a little lacking in confidence.\n\nZhou Ze smiled, acknowledging him. It seemed his wife was faithful to her husband… but he couldn’t bring himself to be happy. It wasn’t some cuckold complex at play,\n\nIt was simply that a simpler life would be so much better.\n\n“I’ll go check over there again. The other children have all been dealt with, there shouldn’t be any issues. You and your husband should go home and rest early.” The male doctor said this and then walked away.\n\nDoctor Lin sat down on the bench next to Zhou Ze. She took off her mask and gloves, tossing them on the floor.\n\nZhou Ze saw that her eyes were a little red, and her pearly teeth were lightly biting her lip. Clearly, she was in a very bad mood, which meant that the critically injured child hadn’t been saved.\n\nShe looked quite pitiable to behold.\n\nZhou Ze now somewhat understood Xu Le. This live-in son-in-law at least earned more than his peers, with his in-laws’ better financial situation being a prerequisite. And then there was Doctor Lin, who was indeed beautiful.\n\n“Don’t take it to heart. You’ll experience much more of this in the future. Just seek peace of mind.”\n\nZhou Ze, as an experienced person, offered comfort from the side. His experience was far richer than his “wife’s,” and his psychological resilience naturally much stronger.\n\n“Shut up.”\n\nThe woman retorted with these two words. If Zhou Ze had said such a thing in his original capacity as a senior, it would indeed be guidance;\n\nBut Zhou Ze was now Xu Le, and for him to say such things to Doctor Lin was purely like it was easy for him to say.\n\n“…………” Zhou Ze shrugged, once again despising Xu Le in his heart. Look how cowardly you are, your wife dares to tell you to shut up in public.\n\nDoctor Lin, with red eyes, slowly stood up: “I’m going to change clothes. Let’s go home.”\n\n“Okay,” Zhou Ze nodded.\n\nJust then, two nurses pulled open the emergency room curtain, revealing the bed inside. A small body lay on the bed, covered with a white sheet.\n\nZhou Ze’s gaze swept over it. He had seen plenty of dead people. In all his years of practicing medicine, he had saved many lives, but there were also many patients who died right in front of him, for whom he could do nothing.\n\n“Doctor Lin, is this your husband?” a young nurse asked teasingly. They knew Doctor Lin was married, but her husband, unlike the boyfriends of other female doctors and nurses, had never shown up at the hospital.\n\nYou couldn’t blame them for making a joke even in the face of death. It was like expecting those who post on social media after one trip to Tibet about their purified and deeply moved souls to stay there for ten years—it’s unrealistic.\n\n“Yes,” Doctor Lin replied, her emotions having calmed down somewhat by then.\n\n“Then you two should hurry home. Maybe you’ll have some activities when you get back, wouldn’t you say?\n\nLet me tell you, our Doctor Lin really loves children, so you two should hurry home and get to it…”\n\n“Shit!”\n\n“…………” The young nurse.\n\nZhou Ze saw the hem of a lily dress peeking out from under the white sheet. His mind went “boom,” and he suddenly realized that the completely unharmed little girl he had just seen,\n\nShe wasn’t human!",

    "content": "Upon hearing that \"Fuck!\",¹ the two young nurses were somewhat at a loss, and Doctor Lin was also stunned for a moment.\n\nIt was simply too blunt and crude a response.\n\nZhou Ze offered no explanation, directly reaching out to pull back the white sheet covering the girl's head.\n\nIt was her, it really was her!\n\nNo wonder she had no injuries just now,\nnot even a single scratch on her body.\n\nThis wasn't because she was lucky to be sitting in the back row;\nin fact,\nshe was the most severely injured among all the children. The doctor had just been fully resuscitating her.\n\nHer soul had floated out, yet she was unaware, still reminding herself not to smoke in public, and comforting the classmates and children who had minor injuries.\n\nActually,\nthose children couldn't see her at all.\n\nIn the entire hospital,\nthe only person who could see her\nwas Zhou Ze!\n\n\"Is she dead?\" Zhou Ze asked, glancing around.\n\n\"Xu Le?\" Doctor Lin looked at her husband. She didn't want to bother with his swearing just now, because she noticed something was mentally abnormal about him.\n\n\"She's not dead yet, keep saving her, keep resuscitating her!\"\n\nZhou Ze suddenly grabbed Doctor Lin's arm, pulled her over, and roared:\n\"The resuscitation window hasn't passed yet, she still has a chance to wake up, keep resuscitating her!\"\n\n\"Sir, sir!\"\n\nSeeing Zhou Ze grabbing Doctor Lin so roughly, the two nurses immediately stepped forward, ready to pull Zhou Ze away. In their eyes, Doctor Lin's husband was a bit inexplicable, and even showed a tendency towards domestic violence.\n\nZhou Ze pushed away the two nurses beside him, also let go of her arm, and murmured in a low voice:\n\"Where are you, where are you, where on earth are you!\"\n\nZhou Ze rushed out, running, searching.\n\nJust a moment ago, the girl's soul was still wandering among the children, comforting them. Now, she was nowhere to be found.\n\nHad she already gone to hell?\nShe was already dead.\nWas it too late?\n\nZhou Ze felt a bit lost. He didn't know why he was so agitated, nor why he was so anxious;\nPerhaps it was because of his profession; it was his duty to save any patient who might survive. Moreover, that kind and strong girl had interacted with him just now.\n\n\"Uncle, are you looking for me?\"\n\nA familiar child's voice sounded behind Zhou Ze. Zhou Ze immediately turned around and saw the little girl again.\n\nHowever, the little girl's body was not as solid as before; she had now become semi-transparent.\n\n\"Uncle, I'm a bit cold.\" The little girl squatted down, hugging her arms. \"I went to find the nurse sisters to ask them to lend me some clothes, but the nurse sisters ignored me. Do they hate me? Am I very annoying?\"\n\nSpecks of light continuously diffused from the little girl's body. Zhou Ze had seen this scene before; it had happened to him.\n\n\"Xu Le, come back with me!\"\n\nDoctor Lin walked over at this moment.\n\nThe little girl turned her head, looking behind her.\n\n\"Don't look!\"\n\nZhou Ze stepped forward, reaching out to cover the little girl's eyes. No one knew what would happen if she saw her own corpse lying on the hospital bed.\n\nWould she collapse?\nWould she realize her own death and then directly dissipate?\n\nWhen Zhou Ze's hand touched the little girl's body, Zhou Ze's fingernails heated up slightly at that moment. They didn't lengthen or turn black, but Zhou Ze felt them to be very hot. At the same time, the little girl's body began to distort, transforming into a ring of light circling Zhou Ze's fingertips. And this light, others around clearly couldn't see.\n\n\"Get out of the way, she can still be saved!\" Zhou Ze rushed towards the hospital bed again.\n\n\"Xu Le!\" Doctor Lin's chest heaved. The deceased was gone, and she didn't know what madness her husband was endlessly spouting now. Moreover, her husband had studied civil engineering and had absolutely no relation to medicine.\n\nThis time, when Zhou Ze rushed over, the two young nurses didn't dare to stop him. Zhou Ze flipped open the white sheet and placed his hands on the girl's chest.\n\nYes, that was how he had come back to life.\n\nYour soul has come out,\nbut it can go back in.\nYou can live!\n\nAfter seeing all the light from his fingertips sink into the girl's body, Zhou Ze began to perform CPR, pressing down on the girl with his hands clasped together.\n\n\"Wake up!\"\n\"Wake up!\"\n\nThe two nurses didn't dare to go closer and looked at Doctor Lin.\n\n\"She's dead,\" Doctor Lin said, walking to Zhou Ze's side.\n\n\"The golden hour for resuscitation hasn't passed yet, I've been keeping track of the time!\" Zhou Ze roared, continuing to press down. \"She can live, she can live!\"\n\nDoctor Lin pressed her lips together, then directly reached out and pushed Zhou Ze away. After that, she began to press down on the girl's chest with her own hands clasped together.\n\"Your strength is too great, she has injuries. A Chun, reconnect the equipment, continue resuscitation.\"\n\nZhou Ze was pushed away but didn't get angry. He just continued to stare at the little girl on the bed.\n\nThe only blessing was probably that the parents were stopped by the traffic police, and there were so many children making noise outside that no one noticed what was happening here.\n\nDoctor Lin continued to press. Beads of sweat had already appeared on her forehead. She didn't know why she was going this crazy with this man, but for some reason, she had just seen something unusual in his eyes.\n\nAnd this man was her husband. Today, however, she couldn't quite understand him.\n\nThe equipment was reconnected, but the display screen was still a flat line.\n\nThe two young nurses stood by, somewhat at a loss.\n\nCan't save her?\nEven if I put the soul back,\ncan't save her?\n\nA feeling of despondency spread through Zhou Ze's heart.\n\n\"Beep... beep... beep...\"\n\nJust then,\nthe previously flat line suddenly showed fluctuations.\n\nDoctor Lin watched the display screen with a shocked expression.\nThis...\nwas it a medical miracle?\n\n***\n\nIt was already evening when they drove home from the hospital. Zhou Ze sat in the front passenger seat, Doctor Lin was driving, and neither of them spoke.\n\nSilence seemed to be the standard for the couple's relationship. However, it was usually Xu Le who tried to break the silence, but today, it was Doctor Lin.\n\n\"Have you studied medicine?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Your technique just now was very professional.\" Doctor Lin could tell.\n\n\"I had training when taking my driving test,\" Zhou Ze casually made up an excuse.\n\n\"But you don't have a driver's license.\" Doctor Lin frowned slightly.\n\n\"............\" Zhou Ze.\n\n*Hmm*, Zhou Ze silently despised Xu Le again in his heart.\n\nDoctor Lin didn't intend to probe further, merely saying, \"Today, thank you for your persistence.\"\n\n\"No need to thank me.\" Zhou Ze waved his hand. As... at least in his heart, he still considered himself a doctor. Saving a patient really didn't require thanks.\n\nThe girl hadn't woken up yet and was still unconscious, but at least there was hope.\n\n\"I'll thank you on behalf of that girl.\" Doctor Lin picked up her phone and checked the time. \"It's almost eight o'clock. My parents are still waiting for us to come home for dinner.\"\n\nParents?\nZhou Ze suddenly felt a headache coming on.\nWas he about to meet his mother-in-law and father-in-law?\n\nThe car drove into a high-end residential complex. Nantong² is close to Shanghai, geographically located at opposite ends of the Yangtze River estuary. Although it wasn't as extreme as Shanghai, where \"every inch of land is an inch of gold,\" housing prices here weren't cheap either.\n\nDoctor Lin parked the car and walked inside. Zhou Ze followed behind her. They entered the elevator, then exited together, and Doctor Lin used a key to open a door.\n\nThe house was well-decorated, with a duplex apartment layout. In fact, one could tell from the car Doctor Lin drove that the Lin family's financial situation must be quite good.\n\nOf course, his current status as a \"live-in son-in-law\"³ was also proof; after all, without some money or confidence, they wouldn't attract a live-in son-in-law.\n\nIn the living room, an old man with half-white hair, wearing a sweater, was sitting on the sofa watching TV. It was a rerun of Xinwen Lianbo⁴, and he was watching with great interest.\n\nEven when his daughter and son-in-law returned, he merely glanced at them and said nothing.\n\n\"Wanqiu, you're back.\"\n\nThe kitchen door opened, and the mother-in-law leaned out. Perhaps Doctor Lin and her younger sister inherited their height from their mother. The mother-in-law was tall, a little plump now, but still the kind of person who could lead the dance at a \"Sunset Red\"⁵ square, captivating countless old men.\n\n*Knock on the blackboard, take notes, mark the key points.* Zhou Ze finally knew his wife's full name—Lin Wanqiu.\n\nThe mother-in-law's gaze swept over Zhou Ze, clearly darkening for a moment.\n\n\"Old man, dinner's ready, Wanqiu is back.\"\n\n\"Finally, we can eat!\" The younger sister came out of the study. She waved her fist at Zhou Ze, then pursed her lips, signaling Zhou Ze to pay attention to her parents.\n\nThis small gesture wasn't bad. Although this little girl was a bit bossy, she wasn't too excessive.\n\nZhou Ze went to the bathroom to wash his hands. While he was washing, Lin Wanqiu also came in. Both of them carefully rubbed their hands with hand soap.\n\nLin Wanqiu looked at Zhou Ze a few more times, then rinsed her hands with water and walked into the living room.\n\nZhou Ze also finished rinsing his hands, wiped them with a tissue, and exited the bathroom.\n\nEveryone was seated, and Zhou Ze sat down in the chair beside Lin Wanqiu.\n\nThe mother-in-law, with a stern face, brought out the bowls of rice one by one, clearly using a bit more force when placing one in front of Zhou Ze.\n\n*Good, at least she didn't deliberately not serve me rice,* Zhou Ze thought to himself.\n\n\"Xu Le, do you think we treat you badly?\" The mother-in-law spoke before even starting to eat.\n\n\"Quite good,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\n\"Then why didn't you come home last night? Who were you giving the cold shoulder to...?\"\n\n\"Mom, let's eat. Something came up at his shop, he told me about it,\" Lin Wanqiu interjected.\n\nThe mother-in-law and father-in-law exchanged glances, somewhat surprised that their eldest daughter would actually speak up for this son-in-law. This made them a bit uncomfortable, and for a moment they forgot to continue their outburst.\n\nThe younger sister, watching from the side, was also a bit surprised. Her older sister had never really cared much about this so-called brother-in-law. Did the sun rise from the west today?⁶\n\n\"Let's eat.\" The father-in-law picked up his chopsticks and gestured, \"You eat too.\" He deliberately pointed at Zhou Ze with his chopsticks;\n\n*Hmm*, this gesture was a bit impolite, but at least it signaled that last night's incident was over.\n\n\"Wanqiu, have a piece of braised pork, Mom stewed it for a long time.\"\n\nThe mother-in-law put a piece of meat in her eldest daughter's and younger daughter's bowls. Then, after hesitating for a moment, she still put a piece of meat in her son-in-law's bowl.\n\nOnly then did Zhou Ze realize he hadn't eaten anything all day, from when he borrowed a corpse to return a soul⁷ last night, through the morning and noon.\n\nHe didn't stand on ceremony,\npicked up the meat, put it in his mouth,\nand immediately,\nZhou Ze's expression froze.\nAn unexpected wave of nausea rose from within him, even his stomach began to spasm wildly;\n\n\"Ugh...\" Zhou Ze dry-heaved, as if what he was eating was poison.\n\n\"............\" The mother-in-law.\n\"............\" The father-in-law.\n\nThe atmosphere at the dinner table\ninstantly froze.\n\n---\n¹ \"艹\" (cào): A strong Chinese expletive.\n² Nantong: A city in Jiangsu province, China, referred to as \"通城\" (Tongcheng) in the original text.\n³ \"live-in son-in-law\" (上門女婿): Refers to a husband who moves into his wife's family home, a traditional practice often associated with the wife's family being wealthier or having no male heir.\n⁴ Xinwen Lianbo: A daily evening news program broadcast by China Central Television (CCTV).\n⁵ Sunset Red (夕陽紅): A common term in China referring to activities or groups for the elderly, often involving public square dancing or exercise.\n⁶ Did the sun rise from the west today?: A Chinese idiom meaning something highly unusual or unexpected has happened.\n⁷ borrowed a corpse to return a soul (借屍還魂): A Chinese idiom referring to reincarnation or taking over another's body.",

    "content": "\"Excuse me.\"\n\nZhou Ze reached out, indicating he didn't mean it, because it was truly too humiliating, especially given that he didn't know why \"Xu Le,\" this live-in son-in-law, was so disliked by his parents-in-law.\n\n\"Feeling unwell?\" Doctor Lin put down her chopsticks and asked.\n\n\"It's nothing, it's nothing.\"\n\nZhou Ze picked up his chopsticks again and shoveled rice into his mouth, but just as he got it into his mouth and before he could swallow, his stomach spasmed again, and a strong feeling of nausea welled up from deep within him, as if what he was about to swallow wasn't rice, but the son of rice, shit*.\n\n\"Pfft...\"\n\nThis time, Zhou Ze sprayed out all the rice grains from his mouth, splattering them onto the faces of his parents-in-law sitting opposite him.\n\nThe father-in-law's glasses and hair were speckled with rice grains, and the mother-in-law's coiled hair was also glistening white.\n\nWith a \"splat,\" the father-in-law's chopsticks fell, and his face twitched a few times. He seemed not to have processed what emotion he should use to face the current situation.\n\nThe mother-in-law, however, took a deep breath, and the anger in her eyes was already burning fiercely!\n\nThis was, giving face and not wanting it!*\n\n\"Clang!\"\n\nThe mother-in-law pushed back the chair behind her and stood up.\n\n\"Xu Le!\"\n\nThe mother-in-law was a retired head nurse, so she knew that even if someone was sick, they couldn't spray rice so exaggeratedly. Moreover, looking at Xu Le, he didn't seem \"critically ill and not long for this world.\"\n\nHe was doing this on purpose, he must be doing it on purpose! He's rebelling! Rebelling!\n\nZhou Ze clutched his chest, left the dining table directly, rushed into the bathroom, lifted the toilet lid, and began dry heaving desperately.\n\nThis time, he even vomited bile directly, and his mouth tasted bitter. This meal was impossible to finish.\n\nDoctor Lin looked at Xu Le, who was still vomiting incessantly in the bathroom, and directly told her younger sister:\n\n\"Xiao Yi, go cook some noodles.\"\n\n\"Oh, okay.\"\n\nThe sister-in-law stuck out her tongue; she also felt that her brother-in-law was playing a bit too big today. She immediately left the table and went to the kitchen to prepare some dried noodles.\n\n\"This is outrageous, this scoundrel!\" The father-in-law slapped the table, reached out, took off his glasses, and shook them. Xu Le's father-in-law was a retired vice-dean, and on weekdays, he paid the most attention to refined manners and appearance. Today, it was like piercing his bottom line.\n\n\"I'm going to go ask that fellow what wrong our family has done to him! We didn't ask for a single penny of bride price for the wedding, and we even paid for him to open that money-losing bookstore. Where have we wronged him?!\" The mother-in-law prepared to go to the bathroom.\n\n\"Mom, clean this up. He's not feeling well.\" Doctor Lin began clearing the dinner plates on the table that had barely been touched.\n\n\"It's like this and you're still protecting him?\" The mother-in-law, furious, pointed at her daughter and scolded her.\n\n\"Otherwise, who was it that threatened to hang themselves to force me to marry?\" Doctor Lin looked directly at her mother, her clear and beautiful face appearing exceptionally resolute at this moment.\n\nThe mother-in-law was momentarily speechless. Indeed, it was they who had forced their daughter to marry back then. They urgently wanted to have a grandson, so they went to great lengths to recruit Xu Le as their live-in son-in-law. At the time, they thought it was simple: she and her husband only had two daughters, so there was no choice but to recruit a live-in son-in-law so the grandson would take their family name. And Xu Le's parents were no longer alive, and he was also a university graduate, so he met the conditions.\n\n\"I'm not eating.\" The father-in-law dared not meet his daughter's gaze. It was he who had personally made the decision back then. Thinking about it now, he did feel somewhat sorry for his daughter. He got up directly and returned to the study.\n\n\"Oh, old man, you have a stomach condition.\" The mother-in-law called out somewhat anxiously.\n\n\"Mom, later, take a bowl of noodles to Dad.\" Doctor Lin finished clearing the table and then walked towards the bathroom.\n\nThe mother-in-law watched her daughter's back and finally said nothing more.\n\nPushing open the bathroom's glass door, Doctor Lin saw Zhou Ze kneeling beside the toilet, one hand gripping the toilet rim and the other clutching his chest.\n\n\"Are you unwell?\"\n\n\"I'm okay.\" Zhou Ze replied. He had been perfectly fine before dinner; who knew he'd become like this the moment he prepared to eat.\n\n\"I told Xiao Yi to make noodles. You can eat later...\"\n\n\"Ugh...\"\n\nAt the thought of noodles, Zhou Ze felt a strong wave of nausea well up from deep within him again, and he started dry heaving once more.\n\nLin Wanquiu frowned slightly. \"Should we go to the hospital?\"\n\n\"No need, it's nothing. I won't eat anymore.\" Zhou Ze waved his hand, stood up with great difficulty, and went to the sink to rinse his mouth and wash his face with water.\n\nTonight's dinner was destined to end on a sour note.\n\nThe parents-in-law and the sister-in-law lived on the first floor, while Zhou Ze and Lin Wanquiu's bedroom was on the second floor.\n\nAfter Zhou Ze cleaned up, he also took a quick shower. Because he didn't know where his change of clothes was, he simply didn't change for now. He still wore his previous clothes, his hair dripping wet, as he went up to the second floor. Just as he exited the stairwell, he discovered Lin Wanquiu was showering in the second-floor bathroom.\n\nZhou Ze stood at the bathroom door for a while, looking at the graceful figure reflected within. He lightly licked his lips.\n\nPeople are always most impulsive at such times, and of course, also most appreciative at such times.\n\n\"Thank you.\" Zhou Ze silently recited in his heart. This was the first time Zhou Ze had given a \"like\"* to that unlucky ghost Xu Le in the two days since he had borrowed his corpse to return to life.\n\nAlthough you left behind an extremely troublesome* interpersonal relationship, your wife is really beautiful.\n\nCarrying a bit of fantasy, a bit of excitement, a bit of impatience, a bit of expectation, Zhou Ze pushed open the bedroom door, then, Zhou Ze's expression changed, and he bit his lip. In his heart, he dragged out Xu Le, whom he had just praised, and furiously flogged his corpse ten thousand times.\n\nThe bedroom was large, with a big bed, and next to the big bed, there was also a floor mat!\n\nWhat did this mean? Even a fool would know!\n\nWas that guy sick in the head? Was that guy an idiot? What was the point of being a live-in son-in-law like that?\n\nZhou Ze took three deep breaths, then silently lay down on the floor mat.\n\nSleep, no more tossing and turning, no more thinking.\n\nSee if I can get some money and move out independently. Then, whether it's divorce or something else, resolve this complicated relationship. Having borrowed a corpse to return to life, there were still many problems he had to face.\n\nLin Wanquiu finished her shower and came out. She was wearing a blue nightgown. The nightgown was a bit loose, appearing somewhat baggy on her.\n\nZhou Ze, lying on the floor mat, subconsciously swallowed.\n\n\"Get up,\" Lin Wanquiu said.\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\n\"You've always slept on the bed, and I've slept on the floor mat,\" Lin Wanquiu said.\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze silently got up and got into bed.\n\nLin Wanquiu turned off the light and lay down on the floor mat.\n\nPerhaps this was her compensation for not wanting to share a bed with Xu Le: she slept on the floor mat.\n\nZhou Ze sighed, and prepared to sleep.\n\nHalf an hour later, he wasn't asleep, so he turned over. An hour later, he wasn't asleep, so he turned over. It wasn't until three hours later, already past midnight, that he still hadn't fallen asleep.\n\nHis eyelids were fighting, but he just couldn't sleep.\n\nLin Wanquiu, on the floor mat, was breathing steadily; she must have been asleep.\n\nZhou Ze swore it definitely wasn't because a beautiful woman was sleeping next to him that he was restless and couldn't sleep; he was very sleepy and very tired, after all, so much had happened today.\n\nBut he just couldn't sleep, damn it.\n\nLying in bed, Zhou Ze simply opened his eyes and looked at his hands.\n\nToday, he had used these hands to save that little girl's life. Although the little girl hadn't woken up yet, her vital signs had returned, so she could still be saved.\n\nWas this a special ability he gained after taking a trip to hell? Or, was it something left behind by that old man when he grabbed his wrist before he died?\n\nHowever, it seemed to feel pretty good.\n\nAs a doctor, with these hands, how many lives could he save?\n\nThis was an ability that transcended medical technology and the scope of understanding. It could even allow him to reach a level beyond Hua Tuo and Bian Que. Practitioners in every industry hope that one day they can surpass their patriarchs. This might not be for money, nor for profit, but a kind of... sentiment.\n\nBut at this very moment, Zhou Ze suddenly found his arms twitching, and intense pain rapidly assailed him.\n\n\"Hiss...\"\n\nZhou Ze gasped, and his whole body curled up on the bed.\n\nBut this pain continued, and it was escalating!\n\nZhou Ze was in so much pain that cold sweat streamed out. Unable to bear it, he could only get out of bed and leave the bedroom.\n\nHe went into the bathroom. He didn't turn on the light, and just sat on the toilet. At this moment, Zhou Ze saw streaks of bulging veins, almost splitting open, running from his arms all the way to his fingernails.\n\nThe pain originated from them, as if something was pounding on his bone marrow.\n\nDamn it, what in the world is going on?!\n\nZhou Ze's face began to contort. This feeling made him wish he were dead, even giving him the impulse to take a cleaver and chop off his own arms.\n\nIn a daze, he seemed to recall the scene of himself lying in the ice coffin, about to be pushed into the crematorium. He also seemed to recall fragments of his dazed journey through hell, moving towards his end.\n\nIs this a curse? Is this a punishment? Why am I being punished? What did I do wrong?\n\nBecause I snuck back? Because I'm not alive, so Heaven is punishing me? Or... is it because I used it to save someone today?\n\nYes, that must be the reason.\n\nZhou Ze took a deep breath. Because he used that ability to save someone, he broke some rule and suffered a backlash?\n\nThen, if I go and kill that girl again now, will the pain stop?\n\nIn Zhou Ze's eye sockets, a hint of black mist began to gather, but he was completely unaware.\n\n\"Uncle, you can't smoke in the hospital.\" The little girl's voice reappeared in Zhou Ze's mind.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head violently. No, I saved her, and that's that! I don't regret it, I don't regret it!\n\n............\n\n\"Mom, aren't you done yet?\"\n\n\"I just started. You can go to the second-floor bathroom.\"\n\n\"Alright.\"\n\nThe sister-in-law went up to the second floor; she couldn't hold it anymore. The second-floor bathroom light wasn't on, so she pushed open the door and walked straight in.\n\nThen, at this very moment, Zhou Ze looked up at her, and she also looked at Zhou Ze. In Zhou Ze's eyes, black mist swirled, carrying an extremely strong deterrent force. It was the gaze of a malevolent ghost, as if it had crawled out of hell, full of curses and madness.\n\n\"Ah ah ah ah ah ah!!!!!\"\n\nThe sister-in-law screamed in fright, and then fell onto the floor.\n\nShe looked at Zhou Ze, and Zhou Ze also looked at her. Immediately after, Zhou Ze saw that the sister-in-law's nightgown was—wet underneath, and an incongruous liquid appeared on the tiles...\n\nShe was, scared herself into peeing?\n\n---\n*   **米田共 (mǐtiángòng):** A playful, euphemistic term for feces, visually combining characters for \"rice,\" \"field,\" and \"together\" to resemble the character for \"shit.\"\n*   **給臉不要臉 (gěi liǎn bù yào liǎn):** An idiom meaning to be ungrateful or to take advantage of kindness, showing no respect for the \"face\" given.\n*   **點讚 (diǎnzàn):** A modern term meaning to \"like\" something, similar to a social media \"like.\"\n*   **坑爹 (kēngdiē):** A slang term indicating something is extremely frustrating, problematic, or a rip-off.",

    "content": "A scream woke the entire family;\n\nAnd no wonder.\n\nA bathroom in the middle of the night, with no lights on, and you open the door, bursting with the urge to pee, only to suddenly see someone inside—that's already scary enough. Most people have probably had similar experiences.\n\nWhat's more, what the sister-in-law encountered was a ghost.\n\nLin Wanqiu came out of the bedroom and reached out to pull her sister up.\n\n\"What's wrong, what's wrong!\"\n\nHer father-in-law and mother-in-law also came up from the first floor, seeing their younger daughter crying in her elder sister's arms, then glancing at Zhou Ze, who was still sitting on the toilet.\n\n\"You good-for-nothing Xu Le, you scoundrel whose heart is covered in lard!¹ You're setting your sights on my younger daughter!\"\n\nThe mother-in-law grabbed the broom from by the bathroom door, ready to hit Xu Le.\n\nThe father-in-law was the same, fuming and preparing to enter to teach his good-for-nothing son-in-law a lesson.\n\nAnd no wonder,\n\nSeeing this scene,\n\nEveryone would naturally jump to that conclusion.\n\nThe brother-in-law went mad,\n\nAnd acted improperly towards his sister-in-law.\n\nAfter all, as the saying goes, a sister-in-law has half of something belonging to her brother-in-law.²\n\n\"Dad, Mom, Xiao Yi was just scared when she entered the bathroom,\" Dr. Lin said.\n\nThe mother-in-law froze, holding the broom aloft, unsure where to put it.\n\nThe father-in-law also paused, then sheepishly retreated a few steps.\n\nDistracted by the commotion, Zhou Ze suddenly noticed that the blue veins on his arms had receded at some point, and the intense pain had also disappeared.\n\nHe felt so tired, so sleepy, and just wanted to sleep.\n\nHe stood up, ready to leave the bathroom. As for his in-laws, Zhou Ze really couldn't be bothered to argue. He had no interest in cleaning up the mess Xu Le, that coward, had left him.\n\nHowever, when Zhou Ze stood up, the sister-in-law immediately shivered several times, shrinking further into her sister's arms.\n\n\"Ah! Don't come near me! Don't come near me!\"\n\nZhou Ze frowned slightly. What had she seen just now?\n\n\"What exactly is going on!\" The mother-in-law put her hands on her hips, asking her younger daughter. This didn't look like she was just scared. \"Xiao Yi, my darling, tell Mom, what exactly happened? Did he... do something to you?\"\n\nThe sister-in-law was still very honest, and she knew that she couldn't lie about such a thing, otherwise the nature of the incident would become very serious.\n\n\"No, I came to use the toilet, opened the door, and saw him sitting inside. It was too scary!\"\n\nAfter saying this with courage, the sister-in-law buried her head back in her sister's arms.\n\nAlright,\n\nIt was just a misunderstanding after all.\n\n\"You brainless idiot, you know not to turn on the light when you go to the bathroom in the middle of the night?\n\nYou think my house is your house, being so stingy,\n\nCan't bear to spend a little electricity!\n\nIf this scares my daughter into something serious, what will you use to compensate...\"\n\nThe mother-in-law began to scold Zhou Ze, her finger almost poking his face.\n\nZhou Ze was very tired at this moment. When a person is severely sleep-deprived, their temper tends to be very irritable. Plus, Zhou Ze was already fed up with the troublesome social connections Xu Le had left him.\n\nIf they hadn't been sleeping in separate beds,\n\nZhou Ze might not have erupted,\n\nBut now that they were even sleeping separately,\n\nZhou Ze was too lazy to endure this snobbish mother-in-law's temper anymore.\n\n\"Slap!\"\n\nZhou Ze swung his hand, directly swatting away the mother-in-law's pointing finger.\n\n\"Don't bother me.\"\n\nThe mother-in-law's eyes widened, clearly unable to believe that her son-in-law, who had always been so timid, dared to speak to her like that.\n\n\"How dare you speak to your mother like that? Have you no manners!\" At this point, the father-in-law spoke up, scolding him.\n\n\"If you want your daughter to become a second-time bride, then keep talking to me about manners!\"\n\nZhou Ze retorted directly, then used his shoulder to push past his father-in-law and walked back to the bedroom.\n\nWith a \"bang!\", he slammed the door shut forcefully.\n\n\"Outrageous, outrageous!\" The father-in-law's chest heaved with anger.\n\nThe mother-in-law quickly went to her husband's side to soothe his chest.\n\nBut in the end, neither of them dared to continue making a fuss.\n\nAfter all,\n\nWhat Zhou Ze had just said had a great deterrent effect on them.\n\nAlthough they didn't know what was wrong with their timid son-in-law, who usually couldn't even beat a fart out of him with eight sticks,³ he was right: if their eldest daughter divorced, her next marriage would be a second marriage, which would be bad for her reputation and for their family's reputation.\n\nMoreover, in their view, a woman who remarries is worth less and won't find a good family.\n\nIn fact, a person's character and whether their thinking is feudal truly have little to do with their education or family background; it mainly depends on their personal character.\n\nFor example, Xu Le's parents-in-law, no matter how angry they were, dared not provoke their good-for-nothing son-in-law at this moment, fearing he might actually jump up and demand a divorce.\n\nZhou Ze lay on the bed, taking deep breaths, closing his eyes, intending to sleep. He was truly exhausted.\n\nAbout fifteen minutes later,\n\nZhou Ze heard a knock on the bedroom door:\n\n\"Xiao Yi is scared. I'll go sleep with her tonight.\"\n\nIt was Lin Wanqiu's voice, and then she left.\n\nAs if you actually slept with me;\n\n…………\n\nThe next day at noon,\n\nHis father-in-law and mother-in-law were eating lunch.\n\n\"He went to the bookstore?\" The father-in-law asked the mother-in-law.\n\n\"He hasn't gotten up yet,\" the mother-in-law said resentfully.\n\n\"Unseemly,\" the father-in-law commented.\n\n\"Exactly...\"\n\nAt this moment, the mother-in-law suddenly stopped speaking because she saw Zhou Ze coming down from upstairs. Zhou Ze's eyes were red, and his eye bags were severe.\n\nThe atmosphere was somewhat stagnant.\n\nPerhaps because of last night's events, Zhou Ze's status as a live-in son-in-law in this family had risen somewhat. At least, at this moment, his in-laws didn't say anything more to provoke him.\n\nOf course, it was also because Zhou Ze's current appearance looked as if he might pick up a knife and start chopping at any moment.\n\nHis gaze swept over the dining table.\n\nZhou Ze reached out and covered his chest.\n\nThe smell of rice,\n\nThe smell of meat,\n\nSo disgusting,\n\nHe felt like throwing up again.\n\nZhou Ze walked out of the house, breathing the slightly cool, fresh air outside, and felt a little better.\n\nHis head was a bit muddled. Zhou Ze began to wander alone on the street, needing to quietly think about some things, but his current state of extreme sleepiness yet inability to sleep made it difficult for him to truly calm down.\n\nIt was very conflicting,\n\nVery uncomfortable,\n\nLike walking out of an internet cafe after two consecutive all-nighters, or like a middle school student who spent the whole night reading novels under the covers and then had to get up early for school the next day.\n\nWalking and walking, Zhou Ze suddenly stopped. The surroundings felt somewhat familiar.\n\nThen he saw the sign ahead,\n\nTongcheng First Affiliated Hospital.\n\nHe had actually wandered to his old workplace. Ha, perhaps it was just because Tongcheng was too small.\n\nZhou Ze entered the hospital, not for a nostalgic visit, but to try and get some sleeping pills;\n\nHe could endure not eating; at most, he'd drink more water, and being full of water could temporarily suffice. But not sleeping was prolonged torture.\n\nThe familiar hospital, the familiar work environment. Zhou Ze saw that his photo on the staff album in the Emergency Department on the ground floor had turned grayscale.\n\nThen he subconsciously walked to his former office. His desk had already been taken by someone else. A middle-aged doctor with many pockmarks on his face sat in his spot. He glanced at the nameplate on the desk; his surname was Kang.\n\nHe let out a long sigh, feeling a bit wistful.\n\nZhou Ze temporarily forgot about getting sleeping pills. Perhaps this \"things are the same, but people have changed\"⁴ emotion temporarily suppressed the torment of sleepiness. Zhou Ze began to wander around the hospital.\n\nHe was reliving every bit of his life here,\n\nHis work,\n\nHis life,\n\nAnd,\n\nHis past,\n\nOr rather, his previous life.\n\nHe couldn't go back, he really couldn't go back, Zhou Ze muttered in his heart.\n\nThen, unknowingly, he found himself walking down the stairs to the basement.\n\nHe stood still. As a doctor who had worked here for many years, he knew the layout of this floor.\n\nSome equipment storage rooms, and then, the morgue.\n\nHe remembered lying in the hospital morgue once, and being made up by a mortician there.\n\nHe started walking again, heading towards the morgue.\n\nZhou Ze wanted to see the place where he had once lain. This was his own explanation for why he was walking that way, but in reality, a special, unseen sensation was guiding him in that direction.\n\nAs he walked, Zhou Ze saw the morgue door. The door had an electronic keypad lock. Coincidentally, Zhou Ze remembered the password. Doctors from other departments probably wouldn't have much interaction with this place, but Zhou Ze used to be in the Emergency Department. People sent to the emergency room were usually seriously ill or injured patients, and it was inevitable that some wouldn't survive and would need to be moved here for temporary placement.\n\nIn fact, this hospital also served as a police morgue. Some unidentified bodies or bodies that still needed \"processing\" would be temporarily housed here. This was common practice in many places; if local police departments lacked adequate facilities or forensic staff, bodies were often kept in local funeral homes or hospitals.\n\nHe entered the password,\n\nThe lock clicked open,\n\nAnd Zhou Ze walked in.\n\nA chill swept over him,\n\nNot the kind that pricked the skin,\n\nBut a special, chilling sensation that seemed to mask the warmth within one's heart.\n\nInside the morgue, of course, lay bodies. This was the deceased's temporary resting place.\n\nLogically, there should have been an attendant outside, but for some reason, Zhou Ze didn't see anyone when he entered. Perhaps they had slipped away.\n\nZhou Ze walked among them. Several bodies were placed on cold gurneys, covered with white sheets. One body was wrapped in a floral blanket, the kind used at home. From the silver hair visible on the exposed head, the deceased appeared to be an old grandmother.\n\nDue to his profession, Zhou Ze was not particularly afraid of bodies to begin with, and what's more, he himself was now a ghost.\n\nZhou Ze walked to the refrigerated units, the kind with drawers that could be pulled out.\n\nRefrigerated units containing bodies had labels on the outside, recording the body's name, gender, and other information.\n\nZhou Ze pulled open an empty unit, reached inside, closed his eyes, and slowly sensed. A feeling of intoxication gradually arose, as if only here could he find peace.\n\nAfter a moment of hesitation, Zhou Ze lay down inside.\n\n\"Creak...\"\n\nThe refrigerated unit was slowly pushed in, until it finally closed.\n\nQuiet,\n\nCold,\n\nSilent,\n\nZhou Ze slowly closed his eyelids.\n\nSleepiness washed over him.\n\nHe had finally found the feeling of sleep,\n\nBut he couldn't sleep yet,\n\nBecause he didn't know,\n\nWho had just stood outside and helped him push the refrigerated unit in...\n\n---\n¹ Literally \"scoundrel whose heart is covered in lard,\" an idiom describing someone who is utterly depraved or whose conscience is clouded by greed or evil.\n² A crude, old saying implying a sexual relationship or potential for one between a brother-in-law and sister-in-law. The original uses a euphemism for something unmentionable.\n³ Literally \"you couldn't even beat a fart out of him with eight sticks,\" an idiom describing someone who is extremely timid, quiet, or uncommunicative.\n⁴ An idiom meaning \"things are the same, but people have changed,\" conveying a sense of wistfulness or melancholy over the passage of time and the changes it brings.",

    "content": "Zhou Ze began to kick outwards from inside, intending to get himself out, but from outside came a \"click-clack\" sound. This meant that the lock on the outside of the ice coffin had been fastened by someone.\n\nLocked in, he couldn't get out.\n\nFor a moment, Zhou Ze seemed to return to the scene when he was first put into a cramped coffin.\n\nOnly, this time, Zhou Ze was not agitated, nor was he angry. He merely reached out and tapped the metal plate at the position of his head:\n\n\"Something wrong?\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't think someone had come here to help him push the ice coffin in and then lock it, unless that person was a mentally deranged madman, and Zhou Ze didn't think his luck would be so bad as to reach this point.\n\nMoreover,\n\nAfter he entered the morgue, the door was closed. A madman who knew the morgue door's password?\n\nDo you believe it?\n\nTherefore, Zhou Ze could only assume it was that kind of thing that \"helped\" him out, and helped him very thoroughly.\n\nHowever, after this inquiry, it was still silent outside.\n\nZhou Ze simply ignored it, closed his eyes again, and prepared to get a good night's sleep.\n\nThis sleep came very quickly.\n\nAfter all, he hadn't closed his eyes for two days, and a lot had happened in those two days. The accumulated fatigue was also terrifying.\n\nEven if after I die, the floods rage*, no one can stop me from sleeping now.\n\n…………\n\nHe didn't know how long he had slept. When Zhou Ze opened his eyes, he only felt refreshed and invigorated; a long-lost vitality had returned. Unfortunately, his body was also frozen stiff.\n\nThe stiffness of his body was somewhat terrifying. Zhou Ze, in the narrow space, tried his best to wriggle his body a few times. A series of \"crisp snapping\" sounds came, so comfortable that he subconsciously made a sound.\n\nAnd Zhou Ze's fingernails at this moment naturally grew long and turned black, shimmering with an unusual luster. The stiffness in his body and the cold air within his body, unbearable for ordinary people, was slowly gathering towards his fingertips.\n\nThe entire process didn't last long, but it made Zhou Ze no longer feel cold or uncomfortable.\n\nHe subconsciously kicked again with his foot, and the ice coffin naturally slid out.\n\nThe lock,\n\nIt was unlocked?\n\nZhou Ze was a little surprised. He sat up from the steel plate, climbed down, and then pushed it back in.\n\nHis clothes were a bit stiff, hanging on him like cardboard, giving a very uncomfortable feeling. Meanwhile, Zhou Ze's gaze roamed around.\n\nThe morgue of the affiliated hospital was not very big; compared to the large hospitals in big cities, it even seemed a bit modest. But the corpses stored inside were still quite numerous.\n\nZhou Ze wasn't sure who had helped push him in earlier, and trying to find them now would indeed be a bit difficult.\n\nFortunately, since the other party had unlocked the latch while he was asleep, Zhou Ze didn't plan to cause any further trouble** here.\n\nHe walked towards the morgue door, intending to leave. Only, when passing by the several beds covered with white sheets, Zhou Ze stopped.\n\nThose several corpses covered with white sheets had nothing unusual about them,\n\nIncluding the old woman wrapped in her family's floral quilt, she also seemed unchanged.\n\nBut Zhou Ze still stopped,\n\nBecause he remembered that this old woman's head and feet were lying in reversed positions.\n\nIt couldn't be that while he was sleeping, the morgue attendant ran in, didn't do anything else, and just flipped the old woman around.\n\nZhou Ze stopped beside the old woman and said:\n\n\"If it's you, and you don't come out now, I'm leaving.\"\n\nThe old woman pushing him in earlier and then locking him in might have been malicious intent, but her silently helping him unlock it again meant that she wasn't trying to harm him.\n\nPerhaps someone was coming over immediately at that time, and seeing an unlocked drawer might have discovered him.\n\nAfter all, whether these drawers were locked or not was very obvious from the outside.\n\nHe waited for half a minute; there was no abnormality. Zhou Ze decided not to wait anymore.\n\nJust as he was about to turn and leave, a sigh came from behind him.\n\nZhou Ze disliked this feeling very much.\n\nBeing coy and hesitant,\n\nPlaying hard to get***.\n\nClearly, she was an old woman when she died, yet she insisted on acting like a young girl.\n\nAlright, ageism is indeed wrong, but normal people's tolerance for beautiful female ghosts is always a bit higher; this is also human nature.\n\nIf Nie Xiaoqian had a face full of wrinkles and big yellow teeth, do you think Ning Caichen would still have a human-ghost romance with her?\n\nZhou Ze turned around and looked behind him.\n\nAn old woman with a head full of silver hair was squatting there, holding a washed-out white handkerchief and wiping away tears.\n\nBut ghosts have no tears, so from Zhou Ze's perspective, the old woman seemed more like she was wailing dryly.\n\n\"You keep crying, I won't disturb you.\"\n\nZhou Ze prepared to leave.\n\nHe found that he was, after all, a mortal, and even when looking at ghosts, he was a bit of a lookist****.\n\n\"Help me, I have money.\" The old woman suddenly spoke.\n\n\"Mm.\" Zhou Ze responded. He was short on money.\n\nDamn Xu Le had less than two hundred yuan combined in Alipay and WeChat, plus the eleven hundred yuan returned by that \"murderer,\" which meant Zhou Ze's total assets were now less than thirteen hundred yuan.\n\nAnd Zhou Ze's house and savings from his previous life should have all been donated to the orphanage; he was effectively all alone.\n\n\"My money is in a hidden compartment in my cabinet. It's an old yellow-lacquered cabinet. There are thirty thousand yuan, and inside are also the dowry items from my marriage: jade hairpins, jade bracelets. I don't know how much they are worth.\n\nI died suddenly and didn't have time to tell my sons. I'm afraid they won't know.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded. \"I'll take a cut.\"\n\nThe old woman showed a look of struggle but still nodded and said, \"That's only right.\"\n\nThe old woman understood clearly that without Zhou Ze, this \"anomaly,\" relaying the message, her sons might not be able to find the property she left behind at all.\n\n………………\n\nAfter leaving the hospital, Zhou Ze directly took a taxi to a place called \"Xingdong Town\" within Tongzhou District. The distance wasn't very far; Tongcheng's airport was in this town.\n\nEarlier at the hospital, Zhou Ze had inquired at the registration desk. That old woman had died after failed resuscitation attempts upon being sent to the hospital, and then her family had simply abandoned the deceased at the hospital, still owing the hospital an unsettled medical bill.\n\nAbout half an hour later, Zhou Ze arrived in the town and, according to the old woman's description, found the village.\n\nIt was a self-built two-story house, with a small brick outbuilding attached to it, similar to a rural latrine.\n\nWhen Zhou Ze arrived here, he found several workers demolishing a house there; what they were demolishing was, of course, that brick house.\n\nZhou Ze walked over, offered a cigarette to a master worker, and asked, \"It's almost Chinese New Year, still busy?\"\n\n\"Got to earn a bit more money before Chinese New Year, you know. Anyway, we're all from the same village.\" The bricklayer master worker was quite carefree.\n\n\"What's going on with this house?\" Zhou Ze asked while looking inside. Two workers were already tearing off the roof, and the bricks from the small house's walls would be dismantled to be reused later. And inside the house, let alone the yellow-lacquered cabinet the old woman mentioned, not even a small stool could be seen inside; it was completely empty.\n\n\"His old mother died. This house used to be where his old mother lived alone. Now they plan to tear down the house and rebuild a kitchen.\" The master worker leaned his head closer, letting Zhou Ze light his cigarette for him, and smiled a bit awkwardly, saying, \"Look, that one who just walked past in front of the house, that's their eldest son.\"\n\nZhou Ze looked over and saw that the man, whose hair was also turning white, still had some bruises on his face.\n\n\"Five brothers fought over the few coins their old mother left behind. These bricks, once they're taken down later, the other four will also come to divide them.\n\nYou tell me, this world, it's changed, hasn't it? Their old mother's body is still at the hospital, not yet claimed, and none of the brothers are willing to pay back the owed medical fees.\"\n\n\"What about the old woman's things in the house?\" Zhou Ze was focused on this. From the old woman's description, it could be known that the thirty thousand yuan in the cabinet was the old woman's life savings, but those jade bracelets and jade hairpins were the truly valuable items; selling them for a few hundred thousand yuan should not be a problem.\n\n\"Sold to the junk collector, you know. It was cleared out long ago, you know, sold off right when the old woman was just hospitalized, you know.\" The master worker took another deep drag from his cigarette. \"I'm going back to work, you know.\"\n\nZhou Ze licked his lips, feeling a mix of amusement and exasperation. This trip of his was a wasted effort.\n\nThe things the old woman left behind, not only did he not get a share of them, even her sons didn't have the good fortune to enjoy them; they only ended up cheap for some used furniture dealer.\n\nZhou Ze was now a bit annoyed. No money was truly a big problem. He was unwilling to use his abilities to swindle money. Although it seemed simple and satisfying, last night, after saving a girl, he almost died from the pain. Heaven knew what problems would arise if he continued to mess around.\n\nWhether there were gods three feet above his head*****, Zhou Ze wasn't sure,\n\nBut constantly digging three feet down, there was definitely hell, because he had been there.\n\nHe knew he wasn't human, and here was the human world. Moreover, that patient who died in front of him earlier, how terrified he was when he cried \"I've been found!\" before he died—Zhou Ze remembered it vividly.\n\nBut,\n\nMoney, ah,\n\nZhou Ze wanted to earn a living******,\n\nBut who would pay him?\n\nZhou Ze now needed money, not to mention getting rid of his \"live-in son-in-law\"******* status.\n\nAt least he had to buy himself a freezer or a big refrigerator, right?\n\nOtherwise, he'd have to run to the hospital morgue every day to freeload on the cold air********?\n\nHe lit a cigarette, feeling a bit depressed. Zhou Ze took a deep drag, only feeling very annoyed.\n\nJust then, the phone in his pocket rang. Zhou Ze picked up the phone; it was an unfamiliar number. He answered the call:\n\n\"Hello.\" Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Big Brother, the goods have been safely delivered. When will you come to inspect them? The cops********* have been checking very strictly lately. It wasn't easy to get this batch of goods in.\" The person on the other end of the phone said cautiously in a lowered voice.\n\nZhou Ze slowly opened his mouth,\n\nNo sound came out.\n\nAt the same time,\n\nXu Le's image suddenly kept rising in his heart.\n___\n*   Lit. \"even if after I die, the floods reach the sky.\" A Chinese idiom similar to \"Après moi, le déluge,\" meaning \"after me, chaos/catastrophe.\"\n**   Lit. \"a knot grows branches,\" meaning to create new complications or problems.\n***   Lit. \"wanting to refuse but also welcoming.\"\n****   Lit. \"looks-ism\" or \"looks-based preference.\"\n*****   A Chinese saying implying that one's actions are always watched by deities.\n****** Lit. \"to turn a millstone,\" referring to doing hard work for a living.\n******* A son-in-law who lives with and is often supported by his wife's family, implying a lack of independence or status.\n******** Lit. \"to mooch off air conditioning.\"\n********* A slang term for police.",

    "content": "Nervous, uneasy, yet with a hint of secret delight and bewilderment—this was perhaps Zhou Ze's feeling on the taxi ride to the suburbs of Tongcheng.\n\nHe was short on money, very short on money, but he didn't need a fortune. A fortune would be useless to him, at least for the time being.\n\nBecause of his resurrection, the entanglements of his past life, and the troubles of this life, he needed a sum of money to resolve them. After that, he would plan for the long term, not live extravagantly or indulge in life.\n\nFor example, leaving the Lin family. Although Lin Wanqiu was very beautiful and elegant, he was truly too lazy to go back to that home. They hadn't had any physical intimacy, he hadn't truly enjoyed it himself, and it seemed that Xu Le, that guy, hadn't truly enjoyed it either, so there was naturally no talk of owing anything.\n\nSo saying \"bye-bye\" didn't carry any psychological pressure.\n\nBut leaving that home meant making some preparations. He needed a place to stay and had to buy a slightly better quality freezer. Zhou Ze didn't dare to go to the secondhand market to pick up discarded freezers. What if something really went wrong and he lay inside to sleep, only to end up killing himself? Wouldn't that be a huge loss?\n\nMoney!\n\nEven as a ghost, he needed money.\n\nBut hearing the way that person just spoke to Xu Le on the phone made Zhou Ze feel uneasy again. Xu Le, a modern urban live-in son-in-law, so pathetic that he let his father-in-law and mother-in-law walk all over him at home, so pathetic that he slept in a separate bed from his wife—turned out to be a hidden underworld boss?\n\nOkay, this kind of visual contrast was really exciting and very much in line with the style of American dramas. Awesome characters always had a very ordinary real-life identity.\n\nFor example, Spider-Man was a middle school student, and Superman was a reporter for a newspaper.\n\nSo, how should he handle this situation?\n\nHow to deal with that bunch?\n\nZhou Ze didn't want his identity to be \"tainted,\" because this meant endless trouble. The police's investigation of him in the real world was already something Xu Le couldn't easily handle, not to mention the \"they will find and catch you\" people that the old man and the faceless woman had shouted about.\n\nHe had a bit of a headache and felt somewhat unaccustomed, but Zhou Ze still arrived at the abandoned small fertilizer plant.\n\nTwo people were squatting at the entrance of the fertilizer plant, one wearing a somewhat worn military coat, the other a cheap, low-quality suit.\n\nBoth of them were squatting there, a cigarette in each of their mouths, puffing out smoke.\n\nZhou Ze paid the fare and got out of the car. The other party immediately stood up and actively walked over.\n\n\"Our boss is waiting for you,\" the person in the military coat said in a deep voice.\n\nZhou Ze nodded, then followed the man in the military coat inside. The man in the suit continued to squat there smoking, as if keeping watch.\n\nAfter walking inside, Zhou Ze saw a fat man with a gold chain and a shaved head, sitting on a plastic chair, pouring and drinking for himself. Seeing Zhou Ze approach, the fat man immediately stood up,\n\n\"Brother Xu, you're finally here.\"\n\nThe fat man was very tall, 1.85 meters. His gold chain was very thick, looking very ostentatious, and the gold dust rubbed off by the gold chain on his neck was even more ostentatious.\n\n\"Where's the goods?\"\n\nZhou Ze clasped his hands behind his back, his fingers slightly intertwined. There were only three people here; knocking them all down wouldn't be a big problem. But what after knocking them down? If he handed them over to the police, wouldn't he also be exposed?\n\nDeal with them by private lynching? Eliminate them in the name of the moon? That also seemed not good. Given his sensitive identity, if he casually killed people, there might be a backlash similar to casually saving people. He wasn't willing to easily try it.\n\n\"Brother Xu is still as straightforward as ever!\"\n\nThe fat man wiped his mouth, then reached out and patted Zhou Ze on the shoulder.\n\nZhou Ze's mouth twitched. He took a deep breath, forcing himself not to slap away the fat man's greasy, fleshy hand.\n\n\"Come, over here!\"\n\nThe fat man made an inviting gesture, leading Zhou Ze to a small storeroom in the backyard.\n\nAfter walking inside,\n\nZhou Ze's pupils suddenly constricted,\n\nGoods piled up like a small mountain, covered with black oilcloth bags.\n\nZhou Ze had never done anything illegal before, but he knew clearly that with so much goods, if judged by law, it would be enough for him to be shot hundreds of times over, enough to make his stomach bloat from all the peanuts.\n\n\"Not just Tongcheng, right?\" Zhou Ze actually wanted to ask, \"Did you just rob a warlord from the Golden Triangle and come back?\"\n\n\"Brother Xu, of course. Tongcheng is still too small. This batch of goods will eventually use Tongcheng as a springboard and flow into Shanghai.\" The fat man stretched. \"This time, let's seize the time, quickly move the goods, and we can make a fortune.\"\n\nZhou Ze reached out and rubbed his forehead, saying awkwardly, \"It'll be hard to move all of this in a short time, right?\"\n\nAfter all, it's not like selling Chinese cabbage, where you ride a tricycle with a loudspeaker to shout about it.\n\n\"Don't worry, Brother Xu, we just need to distribute this batch of goods to the people below. Although the profit isn't as high as selling it ourselves, it's fast and sales are guaranteed. Once this batch is done, we'll get another batch.\" The fat man said dismissively.\n\nXu Le, oh Xu Le, you've even built up a drug trafficking network, you're really something else...\n\nA big shot like this was actually bludgeoned to death by that idiot for 300 yuan!\n\n\"Brother Xu, come take a look, how's the quality of this batch of goods.\"\n\nThe fat man said, lifting the oilcloth bag on top,\n\nthen a look of surprise appeared on Zhou Ze's face,\n\nbecause what he saw was not a mountain of drugs, but a stack of books and optical discs.\n\nCould it be hidden in the books?\n\n\"Brother Xu, thanks to your classmate, this batch of goods was easy to get. These optical discs are all popular movies still showing in theaters. I even deliberately copied a few more ******* into them. These pirated books and romance novels are also best-selling works on the market;\n\nand also the expanded twenty-part, two-million-word sequel to Bai Jie that you, Brother Xu, specifically wrote. Many of our downlines have already pre-ordered this item, so there are no worries about not selling it.\"\n\n\"The goods you mentioned, are these them?\" Zhou Ze asked the fat man.\n\n\"Yes?\" The fat man was stunned for a moment. \"Just these.\"\n\nDisappointment,\n\ngreat disappointment,\n\nextreme disappointment,\n\nand at the same time, deep shame.\n\nXu Le was Xu Le after all. For the sake of these pirated goods selling well, he actually even wrote a sequel to the Bai Jie story himself.\n\nAnd he wrote a two-million-word sequel,\n\nHow idle was he, really...\n\n\"How much can I withdraw?\" Zhou Ze asked. \"I plan to pull out.\"\n\nPartnering in business should involve capital investment.\n\n\"What? Brother Xu, you plan to pull out?\" The fat man said, somewhat surprised. \"We're just waiting to make money now, and you're pulling out at this point?\"\n\n\"Mm, this matter doesn't quite align with my core values. I don't want to do it anymore.\"\n\nZhou Ze said very seriously. He didn't want to take even the slightest risk, especially before he sorted out his current life. He didn't want to get involved in any potential whirlpools.\n\n\"...\" The fat man.\n\n\"...\" The man in the military coat.\n\n\"Brother Xu has high awareness, I admire that. In the early stage, Brother Xu, you invested...\"\n\nThe fat man held up four fingers and said, \"Twenty thousand yuan.\"\n\n\"Twenty thousand it is, then. Give me the money. The rest has nothing to do with me.\" Zhou Ze was too lazy to argue about it. Having twenty thousand yuan could be considered solving his immediate urgent needs.\n\n\"Alright,\" the fat man nodded. \"I still have twenty thousand yuan here.\" He went to get the money.\n\nAbout a quarter of an hour later, Zhou Ze, with twenty thousand yuan in his pocket, hailed a ride-hailing car and began to return to the city.\n\nHe wasn't in a hurry to go back to the bookstore first, but went to the electronics market, spending over ten thousand yuan to buy a freezer. This type of freezer was usually used by businesses to store ingredients and meat products, and was considered a relatively high-end one. Zhou Ze didn't begrudge spending the money; after all, he would have to rely on it for sleep later, and cheap goods were prone to problems.\n\nThe merchant was very enthusiastic, sending a small truck to directly help Zhou Ze deliver the freezer to... the bookstore entrance.\n\nAfter the driver and Zhou Ze moved the freezer into the bookstore together, he was still somewhat surprised.\n\n\"Boss, you run a bookstore, do you really need a freezer?\" the driver asked.\n\nZhou Ze handed him a cigarette. \"Business isn't easy,\" he said. \"I plan to moonlight selling seafood.\"\n\nThe driver took the cigarette and left. Anyway, the goods were delivered, and he didn't need to worry about other matters.\n\nThe bookstore had a small second floor, originally used by Xu Le to store books. After Zhou Ze cleared it out, he placed the freezer up there. Looking at his \"new bed,\" Zhou Ze finally felt much more at ease.\n\nComing down from the second floor, Zhou Ze found that someone had appeared in his bookstore. It wasn't a customer; it was his \"wife.\"\n\nDoctor Lin was flipping through a magazine in her hand. Seeing Zhou Ze come down, she asked, somewhat puzzled, \"What were you busy with up there?\"\n\n\"Organizing goods,\" Zhou Ze replied perfunctorily.\n\n\"I'm off work,\" Doctor Lin said.\n\n\"Mm.\" *Off work and still not sleeping with me...*\n\n\"That girl woke up.\" Doctor Lin looked pointedly at Zhou Ze. \"Her father wants to invite our department for dinner at the Tongcheng Grand Hotel. You should come too.\"\n\n\"What would I do there?\"\n\n\"After the girl woke up, she kept calling 'Uncle.'\" Doctor Lin asked Zhou Ze, somewhat curious, \"Did you know her before?\"\n\n\"Even when a person is in a coma, they still have some perception, right?\" Zhou Ze continued to make things up. \"When I saved her, she might have actually been able to feel it.\"\n\n\"Are you going?\" Doctor Lin asked.\n\n\"No, I'm not going.\" Zhou Ze shook his head. \"I'm not hungry, I have no appetite at all.\"\n\nDoctor Lin nodded and didn't press further. She seemed ready to leave, but when she reached the bookstore entrance, she stopped again. \"Tonight, are you coming home?\"\n\nIt was back to the familiar old question,\n\n*If I go home, you won't sleep with me anyway...*\n\nSo, Zhou Ze answered decisively:\n\n\"No, I'm not going back. I've been a bit busy lately.\"\n\n*Hmm, although business in the store was already as cold as an iced latte.*\n\nDoctor Lin hesitated for a moment, didn't press, took out her car keys from her pocket, and prepared to leave.\n\nJust then,\n\na \"clatter\" sound,\n\nDoctor Lin turned around and saw her \"husband\" had collapsed onto a bookshelf, and books from the shelf had tumbled to the floor.\n\n\"What's wrong with you?\" Doctor Lin immediately walked over to check on Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze felt his vision blurring, his gaze unable to focus, his chest heaved, and his legs suddenly went weak, as if he had stepped on cotton and completely lost his balance:\n\n\"Fainted from hunger...\"\n\nZhou Ze replied.\n\nHe,\n\nhadn't eaten for several days.\n\n————————\n\nFive days after publishing, second on the overall new book list for the same period!\n\nIn the supernatural category, except for the monthly pass ranking where books not yet listed cannot receive votes, we are first on all other lists!\n\nYesterday, second in daily sales on Qidian! Today, eleventh in daily sales on Qidian!\n\nAs a new book of thirty thousand words not yet listed, Long just wants to say,\n\nBrothers,\n\nAwesome!",
