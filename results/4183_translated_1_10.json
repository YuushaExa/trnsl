    "content": "Zhou Ze splashed a handful of water on his face and slowly raised his head, looking at his reflection in the mirror. He looked a bit haggard. As an emergency room doctor, this haggardness seemed to be a standard feature.\n\n\"Dr. Zhou, there's a new patient arriving soon. It looks like they fell from upstairs. Not sure if it was suicide!\" Nurse Wang Ya called from the doorway of the men's restroom.\n\n\"Got it, coming right away.\" Zhou Ze responded, then took out a tissue to dry the water drops and started walking out.\n\nThe ambulance soon pulled into the hospital. Lying on the stretcher was an old man in a gray Tang suit. The old man was coughing incessantly, occasionally expelling bloody foam and fragments of his spleen. His whole body was covered in bloodstains.\n\nZhou Ze hurried over, pushing the stretcher while observing the patient's condition. He shouted to those in front, \"Prepare the surgical instruments, quickly!\"\n\nThe patient's condition was very poor.\n\n\"I... I... don't want to die.\"\n\nThe old man's eyes were open, looking at Zhou Ze, who was closest to him.\n\n\"Don't worry, you'll be alright. We'll help you, you won't die.\"\n\nMost critically ill patients would say such things at this time. Those who could truly face death calmly were, after all, a minority. As a doctor, this was not the time to analyze the patient's condition and tell them their chances of survival. What the patient needed at this moment was psychological comfort.\n\n\"No... no... downstairs... downstairs... downstairs is really too scary...\"\n\nThe old man suddenly grabbed Zhou Ze's wrist, looking at him with a serious expression.\n\n\"Please calm down and relax. Your life will not be in danger.\" Although his wrist ached a bit, Zhou Ze did not try to break free.\n\n\"I don't want... don't want to go down anymore... they... they found me... I... they found me...\"\n\n\"Hiss...\" Zhou Ze suddenly felt a sharp pain in his wrist.\n\n\"Dr. Zhou, your hand!\" the nurse beside him immediately called out.\n\nThe old man's fingernails were very long, and for some reason, they were black. They were a translucent black, like amber, not like dirt accumulated on them.\n\nAt this moment, the old man's fingernails had dug into the flesh of Zhou Ze's wrist.\n\n\"I'm not going down anymore... not going down... not going down... haha... cough cough cough...\"\n\nThe old man suddenly sat up and coughed violently. Then, his body trembled, his hand that was gripping Zhou Ze's wrist fell away, and he became still.\n\n\"Prepare for resuscitation!\" Zhou Ze shouted.\n\nThe old man was pushed into the emergency room, and doctors and nurses began resuscitation measures. The defibrillator was also prepared.\n\n\"Dr. Zhou, let me treat your wound,\" Wang Ya said, walking over.\n\nAs doctors, they weren't really worried about this minor flesh wound. Their biggest concern was that if the old man had other diseases, it could put the doctors at risk of occupational exposure. After all, the old man's hands had been covered in blood, and no one knew if he had any contagious diseases.\n\nSome diseases, once contracted, could ruin one's life.\n\nAfter the wound was bandaged, another doctor came out of the emergency room and shook his head at Zhou Ze.\n\nThis meant the patient couldn't be saved.\n\nEveryone was a bit disappointed, but for them, this was a common occurrence, and they would soon adjust.\n\n\"Dr. Zhou, you should get checked,\" Wang Ya suggested.\n\n\"No, I have some things to do tonight,\" Zhou Ze shook his head, walked directly to the locker room to change his clothes, and then drove away from the hospital parking lot.\n\nAs soon as his car passed under the Jianghai Avenue overpass, Zhou Ze's phone rang.\n\n\"Hello, this is Zhou Ze.\"\n\n\"Dr. Zhou, the children are all waiting for you.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, Principal Wu. A patient delayed me. I'll be there immediately. Please ask the children to wait a bit longer.\"\n\n\"Okay, okay.\" The call ended quickly.\n\nZhou Ze glanced at the time again; it was already 8:30 PM. The children at the orphanage usually went to bed very early.\n\nThe red light turned green, and Zhou Ze pressed the accelerator, driving forward.\n\n\"BEEP!!!!!!!!!!!!\"\n\nAt this very moment,\n\nA heavy truck ran a red light and came speeding over. Zhou Ze only had time to turn his head to look at the blinding headlights outside the car window.\n\nThen,\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nThe world spun.\n\nIn front of the heavy truck, the small car was like a fragile piece of white paper, directly smashed and sent flying. It tumbled several times in the air before crashing to the ground.\n\n...\n\n\"Ugh...\"\n\nZhou Ze woke up.\n\nHe found that he couldn't move his body at all, as if he were trapped.\n\nAt the same time, he couldn't open his eyes. He knew he had been in a car accident, a very serious one. Out of professional habit, he really wanted to check his injuries right away, but he couldn't move.\n\nAround him, he could hear the sounds of other vehicles passing by, as well as various horns.\n\nAm I still at the accident scene?\n\nAm I still in the car?\n\nZhou Ze thought to himself.\n\nSoon,\n\nThe sound of police sirens approached, as well as the sound of fire trucks.\n\nFinally, the familiar sound of an ambulance siren reached him.\n\nZhou Ze sensed his body being moved. The temperature around him was slightly high. They should be cutting apart his car to rescue him.\n\nZhou Ze had participated in many such rescue operations and was familiar with some of the procedures.\n\nWhat a shame, the cake in my trunk, and the Children's Day party for the orphanage, it's all ruined.\n\n\"Dr. Zhou!\"\n\nA familiar call.\n\nIt should be Dr. Chen from the hospital.\n\nZhou Ze sighed in relief in his heart. At least, he had saved his life. This could be considered a stroke of bad luck, after all.\n\nHe could hear the voices of several nurses nearby. Because it was too noisy, Zhou Ze couldn't hear them clearly.\n\nBut then, Dr. Chen's words made Zhou Ze's heart sink to the bottom!\n\n\"Dr. Zhou has lost vital signs.\"\n\nNo,\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nI'm not dead yet!\n\nI'm not dead!!\n\nZhou Ze screamed desperately in his heart!\n\nHe wasn't dead; he still had consciousness. He wasn't dead!\n\nNext, Zhou Ze sensed someone performing CPR on him. He felt each heavy compression, but he couldn't open his eyes or speak.\n\nHe wasn't dead,\n\nHe hoped they would realize he wasn't dead soon!\n\nBut after a flurry of activity,\n\nZhou Ze heard the crying of a few nurses he knew.\n\nDr. Chen punched the car door nearby, appearing very distressed.\n\nHey!\n\nDon't give up!\n\nPlease don't give up!\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nI must be in a state of suspended animation right now,\n\nExcessive blood loss?\n\nSevere injuries?\n\nBut I'm really not dead!\n\nI should still be breathing, I should still have a heartbeat!\n\nZhou Ze roared wildly in his heart.\n\nBut then, he sensed himself being lifted onto a stretcher, presumably being put into an ambulance.\n\nImmediately, he heard the sound of the ambulance starting.\n\nThe nurses in the carriage were still crying.\n\nBut these cries were particularly jarring to Zhou Ze's ears.\n\nHe wasn't dead,\n\nWhy are you crying!\n\nWhy are you crying!\n\nLook at me again,\n\nLook at me again,\n\nCheck again,\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nThe ambulance stopped.\n\nThen, Zhou Ze heard the hospital leadership speaking:\n\n\"Little Zhou is gone just like that?\"\n\n\"The car accident was very severe. Dr. Zhou sustained excessive injuries and lost too much blood. He has been confirmed dead.\"\n\n\"Really? Is he gone just like that?\" Another vice president still didn't believe it.\n\n\"Little Zhou is gone.\" This was the voice of a department head. \"I just checked again.\"\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nYou quacks!\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nYou bastards!\n\nBastards!\n\nZhou Ze cursed endlessly in his heart. At this moment, the people around him were no longer his colleagues, nor his friends, nor his leaders or elders.\n\nThey actually declared him dead.\n\nBut can the dead still hear and perceive?\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nYou bastards,\n\nScoundrels,\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nSave me!\n\nSave me!\n\nThe stretcher began to be pushed. It was quiet all around, and the temperature gradually decreased.\n\n\"Xiao Ya, don't be too sad. The president said the hospital will hold a memorial service for Dr. Zhou tomorrow.\"\n\n\"Sister Suqin, I just can't believe it. Someone is just gone like that. Dr. Zhou was such a good person, how could he be gone like this.\"\n\n\"The weather is unpredictable, and fortune and misfortune are unpredictable for people. Just try to look on the bright side.\"\n\nAfter the two nurses finished speaking, they left.\n\nAround him,\n\nIt was empty.\n\nThat chilling coldness,\n\nWas so clear.\n\nZhou Ze kept struggling, constantly trying to resist. He wanted to wake up, he desperately yearned to make his voice heard.\n\nBut his current feeling was like being sleep-paralyzed. No matter how much he tried, his body simply wouldn't obey him.\n\nFinally,\n\nHe gave up with some despair.\n\nHe was tired,\n\nAnd exhausted.\n\nHe knew where he was now.\n\nIn the hospital's,\n\nMorgue.\n\n...\n\nWhen Zhou Ze \"woke up\" again, he felt a faint coolness on his face, and the stinging sensation was also clear.\n\n\"Is the makeup done yet?\" someone asked nearby.\n\n\"Don't rush, wait a moment. He was completely smashed up in the accident, so the makeup won't be that quick.\"\n\n\"The hospital is urging us. They need to send him to the memorial service soon.\"\n\n\"Why don't you do it?\"\n\nThe embalmer seemed a bit angry and applied more force while applying makeup. Of course, their clients were dead. The dead wouldn't complain about pain, and they didn't have to worry about receiving complaints. They just needed to show results to the living.\n\nZhou Ze no longer had the strength to struggle.\n\nHe stayed there quietly,\n\nEnduring the stinging sensation of the makeup brush pressing down on his face.\n\nFinally,\n\nThe makeup was finished.\n\n\"Alright, tell them to come in. Our work is done.\"\n\nZhou Ze felt himself being dressed, and then he was pushed out. The hospital orderly placed him in a soft, cramped space.\n\nThis,\n\nShould be a cold storage coffin.\n\nThen, all the noise around him was instantly isolated.\n\nThe lid should have been closed.\n\nShaking,\n\nWobbling,\n\nBumpy...\n\nAfter an unknown amount of time, Zhou Ze finally heard sounds again. The lid of the cold storage coffin should have been opened.\n\nWhat reached his ears,\n\nWas funeral music.\n\nThe hospital president was speaking into the microphone, praising him and lamenting his passing.\n\nThen came the vice president and the director, and so on.\n\nAround him,\n\nHe could hear footsteps passing by from time to time.\n\nSome people just walked by quietly to take one last look at him.\n\nSome even tried to call out to him a few times, their voices choked with sobs.\n\nThis was paying respects to the deceased.\n\nPaying respects,\n\nTo my remains!\n\nI'm not dead,\n\nI'm really not dead!\n\nI'm not dead yet!\n\nNot dead!\n\nZhou Ze wailed in his heart.\n\nHe began to try again,\n\nBut still couldn't.\n\nHe could only hear and feel,\n\nBut he couldn't speak,\n\nNor could he open his eyes.\n\nEveryone believed he was dead,\n\nBut he himself knew,\n\nHe wasn't dead yet!\n\nThe children from the orphanage also arrived and cried beside him.\n\nThey cried sincerely because Zhou Ze himself was a child from an orphanage. As a result, after starting his career, he donated most of his salary to the orphanage. The reason he was in a car accident was that he was rushing back to the orphanage to spend Children's Day with the children.\n\n\"Little Zhou, rest in peace. You died in the line of duty. You have no family, but the hospital will give your compensation to the orphanage. Don't worry.\" The vice president stood beside Zhou Ze and said.\n\nAfterward,\n\nZhou Ze sensed himself being isolated again. The lid of the cold storage coffin should have been closed again.\n\nThen came another series of bumps,\n\nFinally, it stopped.\n\nThe lid of the cold storage coffin was opened again.\n\nAround him, it was a bit quiet, with occasional human voices, but not noisy.\n\nTwo people, one holding his shoulders and the other holding his legs, lifted him up and placed him on another cold rack, seemingly made of steel plates.\n\nThese two people were very skilled, extremely skilled.\n\nAround him, he could vaguely hear faint crying.\n\nAt first, Zhou Ze couldn't figure out where he had arrived,\n\nBut at this moment,\n\nHe suddenly understood.\n\nBastards!\n\nThey sent him to the crematorium!\n\nThey're going to burn him!\n\nI'm not dead, you bastards!\n\nDamn your ancestors!\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nNot dead yet!\n\nDon't cremate me,\n\nDon't cremate me!\n\nI'm really not dead yet!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nYou bunch of beasts,\n\nMongrels!\n\nSons of bitches!!!!!\n\nThis was the most frenzied and most desperate Zhou Ze had ever been.\n\nHe knew,\n\nOnce he was cremated,\n\nThere would be no room for negotiation!\n\nHe would directly face death!\n\nAn utter end!\n\nHe was unwilling, truly unwilling. He wasn't even thirty years old, he hadn't married, he didn't have children, he still had a life to live, and he still had a long way to go!\n\n\"Mom, I just saw this uncle's hand move.\" A little girl's timid voice sounded nearby.\n\n\"Slap!\" A small slap landed.\n\n\"Don't talk nonsense. I'll deal with you when we get back.\" The girl's mother rebuked her.\n\nZhou Ze despaired,\n\nBecause no matter how much he struggled,\n\nOr how much he roared in his heart,\n\nThe people outside could not perceive it.\n\nHe was placed on a conveyor belt.\n\nThe machine started,\n\nHe was being pushed forward.\n\nHe knew what he was about to face,\n\nAnd because of that, he was immensely terrified!\n\nNo,\n\nNo,\n\nNo!\n\nI'm not dead, I'm really not dead!\n\nDon't burn me!\n\nDon't burn me!\n\nNo one could hear his calls.\n\nThey were only responsible for being sad,\n\nOnly responsible for being upset,\n\nOnly responsible for completing this process,\n\nAnd then going home for dinner and continuing their lives tomorrow.\n\nFinally,\n\nZhou Ze sensed that he had been pushed into a narrow space filled with the smell of oil residue.\n\nImmediately,\n\nSticky liquid was sprayed onto his body.\n\nHe knew what it was.\n\nIt was gasoline.\n\nThen,\n\n\"Sizzle...\"\n\nHot!\n\nVery hot!\n\nPain,\n\nIntense burning pain!\n\nFire,\n\nFire,\n\nA big fire,\n\nFire everywhere...",

    "content": "冷，\n\n\n\n  好冷……\n\n\n\n  周澤不知道為什麼這裡會這麼冷，\n\n\n\n  他行走在一條幽徑的小路上，小路的兩邊，開滿了鮮花，卻沒有絲毫浪漫美好的氣息，花朵嬌艷，像是一道道嘲諷，也像是圍觀的看客。\n\n\n\n  花開彼岸，人去往生；\n\n\n\n  周澤記得自己之前最後的記憶是火，大火，恐怖的火焰將自己完全吞噬，那令人心悸的炙熱溫度將自己烘烤成灰。\n\n\n\n  但轉眼間，\n\n\n\n  他卻來到了這裡。\n\n\n\n  在這條路上，其實還有許多人，\n\n\n\n  有老人，\n\n\n\n  有孩子，\n\n\n\n  也有年輕人和中年人，\n\n\n\n  有男有女，\n\n\n\n  大家穿的衣服各不相同。\n\n\n\n  有的人穿得很簡單，有的人穿著大紅大紫的衣服，臉上也畫著過分的腮紅。\n\n\n\n  大家都是踮著腳後跟在走路，\n\n\n\n  沒人說話，\n\n\n\n  也沒人發出其他聲音，\n\n\n\n  只剩下偶爾傳出的「擦擦擦」鞋底摩擦聲響。\n\n\n\n  周澤也在跟著所有人一起麻木地前行著，他不時地在張望，也在不時地回首，他隱約間意識到自己來到了什麼地方。 \n\n\n\n  他，已經死了；\n\n\n\n  而這裡，\n\n\n\n  是地獄。\n\n\n\n  這裡，是死者的世界，是亡者的歸宿，\n\n\n\n  自己，\n\n\n\n  終究還是死了。\n\n\n\n  他不知道該怎麼辦，也不知道該做出何種選擇，\n\n\n\n  他不想死，人，都是不想死的，但在這個地方，他完全不知道自己又該如何是好，他很迷茫，也很無助。\n\n\n\n  「咿呀……………………………………」\n\n\n\n  清冷的小調自遠處傳來，\n\n\n\n  周澤撇過頭，看見遠處走來一朵朵的鮮紅，而周圍其他人對此都熟視無睹，繼續麻木地踮著自己的腳後跟往前走去。\n\n\n\n  等近了之後，周澤看清楚了，那一朵朵鮮紅是一把把桃花紙傘，遠處，有一群女人，排著一條隊伍，撐著紙傘，婀娜走來。\n\n\n\n  她們身材高挑，體格風、、、騷，全都穿著紫色的旗袍，走動間，大腿的肉色不時露出，隱約的魅惑，讓人心悸。\n\n\n\n  女人們盤著髮髻，一絲不苟，甚至連她們的步履，都整整齊齊，仿佛世間最優秀的歌舞團，而且，她們已經排練了超過百年。\n\n\n\n  她們在走，\n\n\n\n  她們在行進， \n\n\n\n  從小徑的一端，走向另一端，\n\n\n\n  無巧不巧地，\n\n\n\n  自周澤面前經過。\n\n\n\n  精緻的妝容，雪白的肌膚，那哼出來的清冷長調，營造出了一種煙雨朦朧的老上海氛圍。\n\n\n\n  每個女人的手腕上，都戴著手鐲，顏色不一，大小也不同，襯托著她們的雪白皓腕，更令人目不暇接。\n\n\n\n  可惜，\n\n\n\n  她們不是行走在南大街商業步行區，\n\n\n\n  也不是金碧輝煌的高端會所瓦台，\n\n\n\n  她們腳踩著黃泉路，\n\n\n\n  掠過的是彼岸花海，\n\n\n\n  她們目不斜視，後者盯著前者，\n\n\n\n  最前者，\n\n\n\n  則目光空洞。\n\n\n\n  當最後一個女人自周澤面前經過時，\n\n\n\n  女人忽然側過頭，看向了周澤。\n\n\n\n  原本世界最美麗，\n\n\n\n  現在，\n\n\n\n  直接跳轉到另一種極端。\n\n\n\n  恐怖？\n\n\n\n  當然恐怖！\n\n\n\n  噁心？\n\n\n\n  當然噁心！ \n\n\n\n  但周澤，已經是一個死人了，人會被嚇死，但鬼呢？\n\n\n\n  女人看著周澤，\n\n\n\n  周澤也在看著女人，\n\n\n\n  二者目光短暫交匯，隨即，女人繼續往前走，身段搖曳，背影裊裊，旗袍的緊緻，將其秀美的身材勾勒得淋漓盡致。\n\n\n\n  「你們……要去哪裡？」\n\n\n\n  周澤下意識地跟著這一隊女人往前走，也就脫離了原本的隊伍。\n\n\n\n  而小徑上木訥行走的人，\n\n\n\n  卻沒有一個看向這裡，他們似乎不會思考，也沒有感知，而周澤，仿佛是其中的異類。\n\n\n\n  一行女人，步步生煙，一直在往前走，呢喃哼調，似淒似冰；\n\n\n\n  原本壓抑的環境，因為她們的出現，反而更讓人覺得蕭索。\n\n\n\n  周澤繼續往前走著，他跟著她們。\n\n\n\n  然後，周澤看見她們一個一個地走入了前面的水潭裡。\n\n\n\n  水潭不大，\n\n\n\n  宛如鏡面，\n\n\n\n  她們的進入，似乎打破了這種平靜，吹開了一層層漣漪。\n\n\n\n  最前面的幾個女人連頭都已經沒入了水面之中，後面的女人也在繼續跟著。\n\n\n\n  周澤走到了水潭邊，他沒有跟著一起下去，他只是站在邊上看著。 \n\n\n\n  這裡的一切，對於他來說都是一個絕對陌生的地方，任何人，一輩子，只有一次機會進來，而進來後，也就無法再出去了。\n\n\n\n  潭水中央，有東西浮出，\n\n\n\n  是一雙手，\n\n\n\n  甲紅手白，\n\n\n\n  纖細青蔥，\n\n\n\n  兩隻手翩翩起舞，如夢似幻，讓人的視線瞬間被其吸引，再也無法挪動開。\n\n\n\n  美，是吸引人的，而這種美，卻勾人心魄。\n\n\n\n  周澤的眼眸里，慢慢地顯露出迷醉之色，甚至連自己已經情不自禁地開始往前走都不知道。\n\n\n\n  先是腳面，\n\n\n\n  緊接著是膝蓋，\n\n\n\n  隨後腰部，\n\n\n\n  到最終，\n\n\n\n  水面沒入了脖子，\n\n\n\n  乃至於，整個人都進入了潭水之中。\n\n\n\n  潭水不冷，甚至很溫暖，水面清澈，能見度很高，當你進入這裡之後，你連窒息的痛苦感都沒有。\n\n\n\n  周澤看見了先前那一隊撐著紙傘的女人，她們在水面之下依舊裊娜動人，還在繼續地往前走著。\n\n\n\n  而距離自己最近的位置，\n\n\n\n  則有一位身穿著紅衣的女人，她站在水下，但雙手卻在水面之上起舞翩飛。 \n\n\n\n  周澤開始向這個紅色女人靠近，\n\n\n\n  不是因為美色，\n\n\n\n  也不是因為其他的虛妄影響，\n\n\n\n  而是因為，這個女人身上仿佛有著一種說不清道不明的魔力，讓你靠近，讓你貼近，讓你情不自禁。\n\n\n\n  終於，\n\n\n\n  周澤靠近了她，\n\n\n\n  而她的手，也慢慢地從水面上收了下來。\n\n\n\n  女人頭髮很長，也很茂密，在水波之中飛舞蕩漾，讓人看不清楚她的臉。\n\n\n\n  「終於…………又等到…………這樣子的人了…………」\n\n\n\n  女人聲音清脆，甜甜的，糯糯的，\n\n\n\n  迷人心酥。\n\n\n\n  女人美麗的雙手伸出來，搭在了周澤的肩膀上，這動作，很是親昵。\n\n\n\n  「你…………來陪我…………」\n\n\n\n  下一刻，\n\n\n\n  女人的頭髮開始飄散開，縷縷青絲開始吹拂在周澤的面龐；\n\n\n\n  美人拂面，這似乎是很有情調的一件事，但接下來，女人的頭髮卻化作了世間最為堅韌的鋼索，開始捆綁周澤的脖子。\n\n\n\n  「你來…………陪我…………」\n\n\n\n  頭髮披散，不再遮掩， \n\n\n\n  女人的面容終於顯露出來，\n\n\n\n  她沒有面容，\n\n\n\n  她的臉，是平的，沒有波瀾，也沒有褶皺，這是一場很平滑的臉，足以讓萬千少女去嫉妒和羨慕，\n\n\n\n  但她沒有鼻子，也沒有嘴巴，沒有眼睛，更沒有耳朵，\n\n\n\n  無面……女。\n\n\n\n  周澤感知到自己無法呼吸了，自己胸膛都快炸裂開來，同時，他的身體仿佛即將崩潰。\n\n\n\n  無面女的笑聲依舊清脆空靈，但在此時的周澤耳中，卻像是魔音貫耳。\n\n\n\n  周澤已經清醒過來，\n\n\n\n  他不知道在這個地方被以這種方式糾纏住到底意味著什麼，\n\n\n\n  但總之，\n\n\n\n  不會是好結局。\n\n\n\n  「你在這裡…………陪我…………！」\n\n\n\n  無面女繼續笑著，頭髮亂舞。\n\n\n\n  周澤下意識地伸出手，去抓住纏繞在自己脖頸位置的頭髮，他想要努力去將其掙脫。\n\n\n\n  無面女對他自不量力的表現感到很是有趣，\n\n\n\n  「你掙脫不了的，別掙扎了，能走到這裡來的，都有靈，有靈的人，我吞夠了，就有機會回去！\n\n\n\n  你註定， \n\n\n\n  將成為，\n\n\n\n  我的祭品！」\n\n\n\n  但就在話音剛落的瞬間，\n\n\n\n  無面女發出了一聲驚呼：「怎麼可能…………不可能…………」\n\n\n\n  周澤的十指指甲開始慢慢地變長，漆黑通透的顏色，在這個水潭之中，閃爍著屬於它的異樣光輝，這個指甲的顏色，和周澤死前救治的那位老者指甲顏色一模一樣。\n\n\n\n  「滋滋滋滋滋………………滋滋滋滋滋…………」\n\n\n\n  熱水下油鍋的聲音傳來，\n\n\n\n  無面女糾纏著周澤的頭髮在觸碰到周澤指甲時直接融化崩斷，而周澤的身形則開始慢慢地後退，開始脫離無面女的束縛。\n\n\n\n  「不可能……不可能……這不可能…………為什麼！為什麼你也能離開！\n\n\n\n  為什麼你也能離開我不能！\n\n\n\n  為什麼！\n\n\n\n  為什麼！\n\n\n\n  這不公平！\n\n\n\n  不公平！」\n\n\n\n  無面女用手去攔住周澤，\n\n\n\n  但當周澤用手去擺脫時，指甲一旦觸碰到無面的手，無面女原本完美無瑕的玉手當即被燙出一個洞。\n\n\n\n  「啊啊啊啊！！！」 \n\n\n\n  無面女發出了一聲慘叫，\n\n\n\n  身形開始後退，自此，也失去了對周澤的掌控。\n\n\n\n  周澤的身體開始上浮，\n\n\n\n  即將浮出水面。\n\n\n\n  「你跑不掉的……你會被……會被抓回來的！\n\n\n\n  這裡，\n\n\n\n  才是亡者的歸宿！\n\n\n\n  你們，你和他們，哪怕是走了，也終究會被抓回來！」\n\n\n\n  無面女在下方歇斯底里地吶喊咆哮著，\n\n\n\n  她嫉妒，\n\n\n\n  她羨慕，\n\n\n\n  她瘋狂！！！\n\n\n\n  而不斷上升中的周澤，\n\n\n\n  則慢慢地失去了自己的意識，\n\n\n\n  幽冥黃泉小路，\n\n\n\n  彼岸花的炫目，\n\n\n\n  無面女的咆哮，\n\n\n\n  旗袍女的婉約，\n\n\n\n  一切的一切，\n\n\n\n  似乎都正在漸漸離他遠去…………",

    "content": "On the streets at midnight,\n\nThe streetlights were a sickly yellow,\n\nPeople were in a state of panic.\n\nThe sky was cold, and there was wind, like knives cutting flesh.\n\nZhou Ze also felt the cold.\n\nHe didn't know where he was this time,\n\nBut he knew one thing,\n\nThis was... the human world.\n\nHe was already dead, but he had come back.\n\nHe didn't know what he should do,\n\nHe could only mechanically and numbly continue walking forward.\n\nHe didn't have the time to think about many other things,\n\nLike where he had just gone,\n\nLike the elder he had treated before his car accident,\n\nLike the faceless woman in the red dress in the pool,\n\nLike… his fingernails.\n\nHe had returned, which should have been a joyous occasion, but even if people occasionally walked by, even if he tried hard to greet them, no one could see or hear him.\n\nHe was ostracized and isolated by this world.\n\nThose who haven't experienced being put in \"solitary confinement\" won't understand the pain of being completely isolated. For Zhou Ze, the entire world was his cage, a cage covered with a black cloth.\n\nNo one could see him,\n\nAnd no one could communicate with him.\n\nHe couldn't pick up anything with substance,\n\nEven the wind could easily blow through him.\n\nHe was so frail,\n\nThe phrase \"delicate as a flower\" was truly not an exaggeration for him.\n\nAnd, what shocked and horrified Zhou Ze the most was,\n\nHe could see faint spots of light continuously scattering from his body.\n\nIn other words,\n\nHis body was slowly fading.\n\nPerhaps in another quarter of an hour, he would completely disappear, his last trace of insignificance erased.\n\nHe didn't know how all of this was happening, but he knew that his time was truly running out.\n\nAmong the Eight Immortals, Tieguai Li entered the body of a starved person who had fallen to the ground in the form of a soul, thus becoming the figure passed down through later generations.\n\nZhou Ze had also heard stories of ghosts \"borrowing corpses to return souls.\" He wanted to borrow a corpse to return his soul. He was cold and panicking. He needed a physical body to attach himself to.\n\nHe didn't even care who the person was.\n\nPeople are always selfish at such times, and Zhou Ze was no exception. Moreover, he really couldn't stand it anymore.\n\nHowever, every time he prepared to approach someone, a light or fire would appear above their head and shoulders, directly preventing him from getting close, and even causing him harm, accelerating his \"evaporation.\"\n\nHe was getting tired and numb,\n\nHe was waiting for his end,\n\nWaiting for his conclusion.\n\nAs someone who had already died once, facing death again made him a little more at ease.\n\nMoreover, in Zhou Ze's current situation, the longer he stayed here, the longer he would endure the torment.\n\n\"Creak...\"\n\nAhead, there was a shop still lit up, it looked like a bookstore, as rows of bookshelves could be seen through the glass door.\n\nSomeone opened the door and walked out. It was a man wearing a hoodie, with a hat covering his face, so his features were unclear. He looked around for a moment and then hurried away.\n\nOf course, the man couldn't see Zhou Ze, who was standing less than five meters away from him.\n\nZhou Ze didn't feel anything unusual at first, but shortly after the man left, Zhou Ze suddenly sensed a warm aura from inside the bookstore.\n\nYes,\n\nA warm aura.\n\nThis warmth made Zhou Ze feel inexplicable, but he was like a person on the verge of freezing to death who suddenly found a box of matches. Even if he knew the matches couldn't save his life, he would still strike them to feel the last warmth before dying.\n\nZhou Ze walked over there. His body passed directly through the bookstore's glass door and continued inside, coming to a stop behind the bookshelves.\n\nBehind the bookshelves,\n\nLay a person.\n\nIt was a handsome young man, probably around twenty-three or twenty-four years old. Because the store had air conditioning, he wasn't wearing many clothes, just a long-sleeved shirt and a thin jacket.\n\nHe was lying on the ground, but Zhou Ze sensed a warmth from him, like a beggar finding a bag of gold coins while walking on the street at night.\n\nThis attraction was irresistible, and Zhou Ze, in his current state, was in no position to refuse it!\n\nZhou Ze walked over and squatted down in front of the young man.\n\nHe didn't know how to enter the other person's body, but he knew how to get the warmth he needed.\n\nHe reached out a hand and placed it on the other person's chest.\n\nZhou Ze saw his fingernails slowly embed themselves into the other person's body.\n\nThis was a very strange feeling, unlike the \"gentle breeze\" that had passed through his body while he was walking on the street earlier. This was a merging, a fusion carried out with his fingernails as the medium.\n\nSlowly, Zhou Ze began to enter the other person's body, the two starting to overlap.\n\n...\n\n\"Xu Le! Wake up, wake up!\"\n\nZhou Ze was awakened by a shove, no, more accurately, startled. He opened his eyes and found himself sitting behind the bookstore counter. He had been resting his head on it with his hands.\n\n\"Hey, wake up!\"\n\nThe woman's voice was sharp and high-pitched, with a commanding tone.\n\nLooking up, Zhou Ze saw the woman in front of him, no, to be precise, it should be a girl, probably a high school student. Although she was an older girl, she still had a bit of childishness about her.\n\n\"Hey, Xu Le, what's your problem? You've gotten bold, haven't you? Trying to give my parents and sister a hard time by not coming home all night!\n\nWho gave you the guts!\"\n\nXu Le?\n\nWho is that?\n\nZhou Ze spread his hands in confusion and found them smooth. His own hands, from practicing with surgical instruments for a long time, had developed calluses, but these hands had none.\n\n\"Hey, I'm talking to you!\"\n\nThe girl slammed her hand on the counter, looking furious.\n\nZhou Ze frowned slightly, stood up, and walked to the glass mirror by the store entrance. He saw his reflection – a strange face. No, he had seen this face before; it was the face he had seen last night.\n\nThis body,\n\nIs it mine now?\n\n\"Hey, what do you mean, my parents are angry, and my mom is throwing a tantrum at home. I'm telling you, everything you eat, drink, and use now is from my family. What right do you, a live-in son-in-law, have to put on airs in my house?\n\nWho are you trying to impress!\n\nIf you dare not come home again tonight, believe me, I'll come over and slap you!\"\n\nThe girl raised her hand as if to slap him, but she suddenly realized that the man in front of her, her \"brother-in-law,\" did not flinch or beg for mercy as he usually did. Instead, the look in his eyes made her feel a little scared.\n\nAt this moment, she glanced at the time and found it was already 7:30.\n\n\"Hmph, I'm going to school first. I'll settle with you tonight!\"\n\nThe girl left in a huff.\n\nZhou Ze slowly sat back down in the chair behind the counter. There was an old laptop here, and a mobile phone next to the laptop.\n\nEven now, he still hadn't fully adapted to the change in his identity.\n\nHe was Zhou Ze, a renowned young surgeon in Tongcheng, and he was an orphan.\n\nAs a result,\n\nHe had become this person now.\n\nWhat did that girl just say?\n\nI am… a live-in son-in-law?\n\nI have a wife?\n\nAnd in-laws?\n\nAnd judging by the attitude and tone of his \"sister-in-law\" speaking to his \"brother-in-law\" just now, his \"live-in son-in-law\" was truly in line with ancient traditions.\n\nA live-in son-in-law, commonly known as a \"door-inserting son-in-law,\" was not only looked down upon by his wife's family but was also looked down upon by everyone around them in ancient times, their status almost comparable to that of criminals. During the Han and Tang dynasties, those forced to the frontier often included such sons-in-law.\n\nHe picked up the phone. The phone had no password set. He didn't know if the guy was lazy or too scared to set one. At least, at this moment, it made it easy for Zhou Ze to open his WeChat and QQ.\n\nThere were very few people in his QQ list, just a few junior high, high school, and college classmates, and then a \"family\" list with only one person, noted as \"wife.\"\n\nHe opened the QQ chat history with her, and it was empty.\n\nFine.\n\nZhou Ze opened WeChat and tried to find her. He found a woman noted as \"wife.\" There were replies here, mostly Xu Le asking things like what to eat tonight, what to prepare, how much it cost to restock, how much the bookstore had sold recently, how was your health, a bunch of things.\n\nAnd her replies were often perfunctory and cold,\n\nWith:\n\n\"Oh\"\n\n\"Mm\"\n\n\"Okay\"\n\nas replacements.\n\nZhou Ze put the phone aside. This interpersonal relationship was a bit complicated. He suddenly looked at his palm. His fingernails looked no different from those of ordinary people.\n\nBut the elder he had treated before the car accident, the way he escaped from the faceless woman, and how he entered this guy's body – his fingernails had played a crucial role.\n\nAs his thoughts shifted,\n\nAt this moment,\n\nZhou Ze found that his fingernails began to slowly grow longer, and at the same time, they became black and translucent. There was even a faint black mist swirling around his fingernails.\n\n\"Whoosh...\"\n\nHe let out a long sigh,\n\nClosed his eyes,\n\nAnd when he opened them again,\n\nHis fingernails had returned to normal.\n\nFrom morning until noon, Zhou Ze sat there, trying to adapt to his new identity and calm the discomfort caused by the change in his identity. He didn't even eat lunch, whether he forgot or simply didn't feel hungry, he didn't know.\n\nThis was still Tongcheng. Zhou Ze's former home was in Chongchuan District, and now he was in Gangzha District, not far away.\n\nIn the afternoon, Zhou Ze finally sighed and slowly stood up. Since he was here, he would make the best of it.\n\nHe started trying to clean the bookshelves. At any rate, he should find something to do first.\n\nThe elder who had choked him to death had said, \"He's been discovered,\" and the faceless woman in hell had said, \"You'll be caught sooner or later.\" These words gave Zhou Ze a sense of crisis.\n\nHis current state was \"barely surviving.\" Being resurrected from the dead was a great fortune, so he cherished it. At least, until he could fully understand the situation and gather enough clues, he had to blend into this identity, preferably without causing too much abnormality, without attracting the attention of those \"who wanted to catch him.\"\n\nThe business of this store was really bad. The decline of the traditional book market was not a new thing, and this wasn't located on a prime street right at the entrance of a school.\n\nIt could only be said that whether \"Xu Le\" could even break even by choosing to open a bookstore here was questionable.\n\nIt wasn't until three o'clock in the afternoon that the first customer of the day walked in.\n\nThe customer was browsing the children's reading materials and had been wandering for a long time.\n\nZhou Ze waited for a while, then walked over and asked, \"What subject are you looking for?\"\n\nAlthough, Zhou Ze didn't understand either.\n\n\"Just looking,\" the other person replied.\n\n\"Mm,\" Zhou Ze didn't say anything more. He hadn't yet integrated into the role of \"bookstore owner.\"\n\nBut at that moment,\n\nThe person suddenly walked up behind him and spoke faintly:\n\n\"You really don't recognize me?\"\n\n\"What?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Last night, I hit you on the head with a baseball bat and robbed you of your money.\n\nAnd I even specifically checked.\n\nYou clearly had no breath then.\"",

    "content": "Zhou Ze was stunned. So, the reason he was able to take over \"Xu Le's\" body last night for a second chance at life was because the guy had just been killed?\n\nBecause his body was still warm, he was able to enter it?\n\nLooking at it this way, he was actually quite lucky.\n\nWithout any resentment, anger, or the panic of his identity being exposed, Zhou Ze turned around and looked at the man behind him, who was around his own age.\n\nThe man was taken aback.\n\nHe saw something unusual in Zhou Ze's eyes.\n\nIt was joy.\n\nIt was relief.\n\nAnd even...\n\nA little bit of appreciation.\n\nAs a host, Zhou Ze knew how difficult the situation was last night. If this guy hadn't happened to kill someone at that exact moment, he might have been scattered to the winds and never seen the sun again.\n\n\"Sorry, I fainted last night, and my head felt fuzzy when I woke up this morning, like I'd been drinking. I forgot what happened yesterday,\" Zhou Ze explained casually.\n\nHe didn't think the other person would guess he was a ghost possessing a body unless the guy was out of his mind.\n\n\"You're not blaming me?\" The man pointed to his nose, incredulously, \"Even though I already told you I gave you a good whack yesterday?\"\n\n\"It's fine, I'm actually thankful you didn't take my phone and computer from my desk.\"\n\n\"Uh... I forgot,\" the man scratched his head. \"It's good you're okay. This is the money I took from you yesterday.\"\n\nThe man voluntarily took out three hundred yuan from his pocket, then rummaged through it again and took out another eight hundred yuan.\n\n\"Eight hundred is for your medical expenses, and three hundred is from yesterday's robbery,\" the man pursed his lips. \"I lost my entire salary to the bookie gambling online yesterday. I was passing by your bookstore and suddenly wanted some cash. After I knocked you down, I realized you weren't breathing, and I was terrified.\n\nI ran home and couldn't sleep all night, wondering if the police would suddenly break down the door and arrest me for home invasion and murder. I only took three hundred yuan; I feel so stupid, it wasn't worth it.\"\n\nThe man reached out and patted Zhou Ze on the shoulder.\n\n\"Brother, I'm so glad you're not dead. Really, I've been hanging around outside since this morning, waiting for someone to call the police, waiting for them to come. Then I saw you were still in the bookstore.\n\nDo you know, I almost knelt down and kowtowed to you then? Thank you, you're resilient, you didn't die, otherwise, I'd be finished. There are so many cameras here; if you had died, I definitely wouldn't have gotten away with it.\"\n\nZhou Ze looked at the eleven hundred yuan in his hand, then at the \"murderer\" in front of him who was shedding tears and repenting. He felt the whole scene was very bizarre.\n\nTo be honest, \"Xu Le\" was dead. Because he died, Zhou Ze could take over his body. And because Zhou Ze took over his body, this guy in front of him was spared a murder charge.\n\nBoth he and this guy had benefited, only that poor Xu Le was out of luck.\n\n\"Okay, it's fine. Maybe I just choked last night,\" Zhou Ze removed the man's hand from his shoulder. He used to be an emergency doctor and had seen all sorts of filth, but in that extreme environment, he had developed a slight germophobia. In fact, most emergency doctors have varying degrees of germophobia.\n\nIt was precisely because he had witnessed so much dirt and filth that he cherished \"cleanliness\" even more.\n\n\"You really don't blame me?\" The man asked, somewhat delighted.\n\n\"No, I don't blame you,\" Zhou Ze nodded. \"Go back to work and live your life. Don't make mistakes next time.\"\n\n\"Okay, thank you, brother, you're a good person.\"\n\nThe man nodded heavily and left the bookstore, heading towards his \"new life.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Zhou Ze picked up his phone. He thought about it and decided he still had to report it. Not for the fact that the man had supposedly killed him (Xu Le), but to report him for suspected theft.\n\nLet the police investigate. If the man really had a criminal record or had done other bad things and was caught by the police, then it would serve him right.\n\nSince he had taken over someone else's body, he felt he had to do something for that unlucky guy.\n\nAlthough, given the man's sincere apology and his act of returning the medical fees, Zhou Ze still reporting him by name was indeed rather heartless and akin to the saying \"having sons but no grandsons.\"¹\n\nHowever, just as Zhou Ze dialed 110 and the voice on the other end just came through,\n\nAt the entrance of the shop,\n\nThe guy suddenly returned.\n\n\"There's one more thing...\" As soon as he walked in, he saw Zhou Ze holding his phone. He was stunned and pointed directly at Zhou Ze, \"You're still going to report me, aren't you!\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head.\n\n\"Let me see your phone! Give it to me!\"\n\nZhou Ze could only continue to shake his head.\n\n\"You broke your promise, you bastard! I'll kill you! Let's see if you die this time!\"\n\nThe man instantly became agitated and frenzied. He probably had some mental issues, possibly due to the lifestyle of a gambler being disconnected from society. He tended to become extreme when stimulated by something.\n\nThe man lunged forward, Zhou Ze put down his phone and started to retreat.\n\nHe was a doctor in his past life, not a boxer, nor had he practiced martial arts. The body he was in now was also somewhat frail. When it came to a face-to-face fight, he was actually a bit flustered.\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nThe man slammed Zhou Ze against the wall and simultaneously began to choke him tightly with both hands.\n\n\"I'll let you report! I'll let you report! I'll let you break your promise! Fine, I'll kill you, really kill you! This time, after I strangle you, I'll bleed you dry. Let's see if you die or not!\"\n\nThe man roared through clenched teeth.\n\nPoor bookstore. It was afternoon, and forget customers; there weren't even many pedestrians outside.\n\nHis neck felt almost numb, and he couldn't breathe. Zhou Ze struggled as hard as he could. During his struggle, Zhou Ze's fingernails suddenly turned black and grew longer.\n\nImmediately after, Zhou Ze wrapped his arms around the man's back.\n\n\"Hiss...\"\n\nThe man suddenly shivered, rolled his eyes, and let go of Zhou Ze's neck. He stumbled back several steps, knocking over a few bookshelves, and then crashed to the ground with a thud.\n\nZhou Ze managed to escape. He reached up and rubbed his neck. He hadn't been too panicked before. After all, his fingernails could injure even the ghosts in hell. Dealing with an ordinary person should be no problem, right?\n\nBut Zhou Ze hadn't fully understood the reason or the use of these fingernails. He only knew that it was probably \"infected\" by the old man he had saved before his car accident.\n\nIndeed,\n\nGet athlete's foot, infect two.\n\nHe walked forward, squatted down, and reached out to pat the man's face. Fortunately, he wasn't dead, and he was still breathing. Zhou Ze shook his head, picked up his phone, and called the police again.\n\n...\n\nAfter finishing his statement at the police station, the police officers asked Zhou Ze to wait in the small hall. This was because the matter Zhou Ze reported was a bit strange: the robber who had intended to rob him and was knocked out was actually the \"killer,\" and this killer was currently in the hospital, so they had to wait for him to wake up to confirm further.\n\nHowever, at least the police officers didn't put handcuffs on Zhou Ze.\n\nNext to Zhou Ze, a middle-aged man squatted. The man's left hand was chained to a radiator.\n\n\"Brother, you're awesome! That guy was going to rob you and you knocked him out?\" The somewhat scruffy middle-aged man said, rubbing his long, dirt-caked bangs. \"You've got that vibe I had when I was young. You've got to beat these clueless petty thieves to a pulp!\"\n\n\"Hey, you behave yourself,\" a young police officer walked over and reprimanded him. \"How many times have you stolen electric bikes this winter?\n\nI mean, it's almost the New Year, can't you just settle down? Or find a job and earn money honestly to send home? You're a grown man.\"\n\n\"Working is impossible, it's impossible to work in this lifetime. I don't know how to do business, so only by stealing electric bike batteries can I sustain my life. Going to the detention center feels like going home.\n\nEveryone in there is talented, they talk nicely, I really like it in there!\"\n\n\"Hmph.\" The young police officer didn't want to deal with this guy anymore and turned to leave.\n\n\"Brother, how was my speech just now?\" The greasy middle-aged man gave Zhou Ze a flirtatious glance.\n\n\"Quite interesting,\" Zhou Ze smiled.\n\n\"Che Guevara is my idol. Che Guevara, do you know who that is?\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"Let me tell you, this life is about...\" The greasy middle-aged man paused, then looked towards the entrance. \"Oh my god, so beautiful! Is she a police officer?\"\n\nZhou Ze turned his head to look. At the entrance, a woman wearing a blue down jacket and long leather boots was walking towards them with another female police officer.\n\n\"She's probably a police officer,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nThe woman was very beautiful, with a delicate figure and fair skin. Most importantly, the aura she exuded was a significant plus.\n\n\"But she's not wearing a police uniform,\" the greasy man countered.\n\n\"Maybe she's undercover,\" Zhou Ze guessed.\n\n\"You're right, a beautiful police flower, tsk tsk. Looks like I'll have to come in more often,\" the greasy middle-aged man smacked his lips, looking like he couldn't get enough. \"If I could marry her, I'd happily give up ten years of my life.\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. He dared not joke about lifespan or fate anymore.\n\n\"You don't agree?\" The greasy man, seeing Zhou Ze shake his head, said anxiously, \"You're being blind! A woman like that, trading ten years of life for her, it's absolutely worth it...\"\n\nAt this moment, the female police officer and the woman in the long boots walked up to Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Xu Le, your wife is here to pick you up. The investigation over there is clear; you're okay,\" the female police officer said, pointing at Zhou Ze.\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze.\n\n\"...\" The greasy middle-aged man.\n\n---\n¹ This idiom, \"生兒子沒屁眼的\" (shēng érzi méi pìyǎn de), literally means \"to give birth to a son without an anus.\" It's a very vulgar insult implying extreme misfortune or bad luck for the person's descendants, or more broadly, a very harsh curse. The translator chose to interpret it as a more general expression of being \"heartless\" or \"wicked\" in context, which fits Zhou Ze's internal monologue about his actions.",

    "content": "\"Officer, can you tell me what my wife's name is?\"\n\nThis thought only crossed his mind for a moment; Zhou Ze wasn't that foolish. However, he genuinely didn't know his \"wife's\" real name. In this era, very few people used their real names for their QQ or WeChat IDs.\n\nThe greasy man, on the other hand, cast a resentful glance at Zhou Ze: \"Brother, you're not being fair. We agreed to be fallen angels for each other, remember?\"\n\nZhou Ze shot back a helpless glance: \"I'm just as surprised.\"\n\nThe greasy man lowered his head, sighed, and murmured softly, \"My dumplings are very tasty.\"\n\n\"Let's go.\"\n\nHis \"wife\" said coolly, then turned and walked directly outside.\n\nZhou Ze had no choice but to follow.\n\nShe was driving a Cayenne and got into the car.\n\nZhou Ze opened the door and sat in the passenger seat.\n\nTo be honest,\n\nit was a bit awkward.\n\nIf that unfortunate fellow Xu Le had a more normal marital and family life, he wouldn't be feeling this awkward right now. He could have found some excuse to explain his forgetfulness when his beautiful wife showed concern, like saying he felt dizzy and couldn't remember things clearly.\n\nBut this woman clearly had the demeanor of an ice queen, seeming to completely ignore him. Even picking him up from the police station felt like a mere formality.\n\n\"My dog got lost and was found by a security guard, and I'm going to pick it up.\"\n\nThat was the feeling.\n\nThe woman started the car. She was quite young, likely around the same age as himself (Xu Le), and several years younger than the original Zhou Ze.\n\nAs the car merged onto the elevated road, the woman finally broke the silence:\n\n\"Are you okay?\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm fine,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\nThen,\n\nsilence fell again.\n\nThe woman felt her husband was unusually quiet today, but she had no intention of probing for the reason.\n\nJust then, the woman's phone rang. She pressed the speakerphone button, and a voice came from the car's audio system:\n\n\"Dr. Lin, there's just been a school bus collision on Qingnian Middle Road. Some injured individuals are already being transported to our hospital. The director wants you to come back immediately.\"\n\nZhou Ze was slightly startled.\n\nSo his wife was also a doctor.\n\nAnd,\n\nhis wife's surname was \"Lin.\"\n\n\"I know, I'll be right back.\" The woman hung up the phone, exited the elevated road ahead, and made a sharp turn at the traffic light, heading towards the hospital.\n\nShe didn't ask Zhou Ze if he wanted to be dropped off at home or if he wanted to get out and take a taxi back. Instead, she drove straight into the Chongchuan District People's Hospital parking lot.\n\nHonestly, Zhou Ze was worried she might make him get out and take a taxi home. He thought about having to shamelessly ask then:\n\n\"Wife, where do we live again? I forgot.\"\n\nHe found the thought incredibly foolish.\n\nThe woman got out of the car, and Zhou Ze followed. The woman entered the hospital building and took the elevator. Zhou Ze also got into the elevator. The woman went into the women's locker room, and Zhou Ze...\n\nZhou Ze sat down on a bench in the hallway.\n\nJust then, the first batch of accident victims was brought in. One person was critically injured, and five children also sustained significant injuries.\n\nWatching his \"wife\" change into a white coat and busily start treating the injured,\n\nZhou Ze could only sit on the bench and stare blankly.\n\nIt felt a bit like a mother bringing her son along to work, with the son watching from the side and playing by himself.\n\nHowever,\n\nthe characteristic smell of disinfectant and the stuffy warmth of the central air conditioning were quite nostalgic. A familiar feeling.\n\nThe emergency room was just ahead. The critically injured and life-threatening case seemed to be a young girl.\n\nIt was a kindergarten school bus. Seeing the little children crying out in pain on the operating table was indeed heartbreaking.\n\nZhou Ze pursed his lips. At this time, he would have already changed and joined the rescue efforts. He was the most famous young surgeon in Tongcheng, but now, he could only be a spectator.\n\nThis feeling was very uncomfortable, but he had to endure it. Besides, this People's Hospital was considered the best hospital in Tongcheng, and its number and quality of doctors were beyond doubt. They should be able to handle it.\n\nSoon, the next batch of children was brought in. Their injuries were lighter, only requiring wound treatment or simple bandaging.\n\nTraffic police were stationed at the entrance of this floor. Some parents who had been notified had already arrived, and they were very agitated. However, letting the parents in at this time might disrupt the rescue efforts, so they had to be held back for now.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head, stood up, walked to the window at the far end of the corridor, and pushed the window up. He then took out a cigarette from his pocket. He smoked, and Xu Le also smoked, so it was convenient at this moment.\n\n\"Uncle, you can't smoke in the hospital.\"\n\nJust as he bit the cigarette butt, a clear, childlike voice came from behind Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze turned around and saw a little girl in a lily dress standing behind him, pouting and looking at him indignantly.\n\nCough, cough,\n\nthis was a bit awkward.\n\nZhou Ze had to put the cigarette away. Regardless, it was somewhat embarrassing to be lectured by a little girl about public morality.\n\n\"Little one, aren't you cold wearing so little?\" Zhou Ze bent down and asked.\n\nThe little girl had delicate skin, a slightly chubby face, and big eyes. She was very cute, like a larger version of a Barbie doll.\n\n\"I'm not cold,\" the little girl replied, shaking her head. \"Uncle, you can't smoke in the hospital anymore.\"\n\n\"I know.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded seriously.\n\n\"Are you okay?\" Zhou Ze asked again.\n\n\"I'm fine. The other children are injured, and they're in a lot of pain.\"\n\nThe little girl turned sideways and looked at the children behind her who were having their wounds bandaged. Most of them were crying, not necessarily from unbearable pain, but because one child started crying, and then others joined in.\n\nThe nurses were treating wounds while also comforting the children.\n\nThe parents, temporarily held back by the traffic police outside, were continuously making noise and yelling.\n\nIn short,\n\nthis floor felt chaotic.\n\n\"Then you're really lucky,\" Zhou Ze sighed.\n\nThe little girl didn't even have a scratch on her.\n\n\"Mm-hmm, I was sitting in the last row, so I'm fine,\" the little girl nodded. Then, she voluntarily ran over to comfort her classmates, looking at them here and there, encouraging and soothing them.\n\nA very sensible and strong child.\n\nZhou Ze turned around, and subconsciously, he took out his cigarette again. After thinking for a moment, he put it back.\n\nWhen he walked back to the bench and sat down, three nurses and two doctors emerged from the emergency room ahead.\n\nOne male doctor and one female doctor. The female doctor was his wife.\n\n\"It's okay, we did our best,\" the male doctor said, reaching out to place a hand on Zhou Ze's wife's shoulder to comfort her.\n\nAs her husband,\n\nZhou Ze was sitting right there,\n\nbut he didn't find this scene objectionable...\n\nThe wretched Xu Le had left him with such a complicated mess: being a live-in son-in-law, having a very hot-tempered sister-in-law, and parents-in-law with clearly bad tempers.\n\nZhou Ze wished his wife would have an affair, divorce him, and leave him in peace.\n\nWho, after being resurrected and entering a new body, would want to bother with the myriad flavors of a modern urban son-in-law's life?\n\nHowever, what surprised Zhou Ze was that his wife directly pushed away the doctor's amorous hand and pointed at him, saying:\n\n\"This is my husband.\"\n\nHer words lacked any tenderness or affection. They were simple, blunt, like saying: \"This is the husky my family keeps.\"\n\n\"Oh, hello, sir.\" The male doctor looked somewhat embarrassed. After all, flirting with someone's wife in front of them always made one feel a bit uncertain.\n\nZhou Ze smiled, acknowledging the greeting. It seemed his wife was quite virtuous... but he couldn't bring himself to be happy. It wasn't about cuckoldry or anything like that.\n\nIt was simply that life would be so much better if it were simpler.\n\n\"I'll go check on them again. The other children have been treated, and everything should be fine. You should go back and rest with your husband soon,\" the male doctor said and then walked away.\n\nDr. Lin sat down on the bench next to Zhou Ze. She took off her mask, removed her gloves, and threw them on the ground.\n\nZhou Ze saw her eyes were a little red, and she was biting her lip. Clearly, she was in a bad mood, which meant the critically injured child hadn't been saved.\n\nShe looked quite pitiable.\n\nZhou Ze began to understand Xu Le a little. This live-in son-in-law earned considerably more than his peers. His in-laws' financial situation was better than his own, and on top of that, this Dr. Lin was indeed very good-looking.\n\n\"Don't dwell on it. You'll experience much more in the future. Just strive for peace of mind,\"\n\nZhou Ze said, offering comfort from his experience. His experience far surpassed his \"wife's,\" and his psychological resilience was naturally much stronger.\n\n\"Shut up.\"\n\nThe woman replied with those two words. If Zhou Ze, in his original capacity as a senior, had said this, it would indeed have been advice.\n\nBut Zhou Ze was currently Xu Le, and speaking these words with his appearance was purely speaking from a position of privilege.\n\n\"......\" Zhou Ze shrugged his shoulders and inwardly scorned that Xu Le again. Look how timid he was; his wife dared to tell him to shut up directly in front of others.\n\nDr. Lin, with red eyes, slowly stood up. \"I'm going to change. Let's go home.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" Zhou Ze nodded.\n\nAt this moment, two nurses pulled open the curtain of the emergency room, revealing the hospital bed inside. A small body lay on the bed, covered with a white sheet.\n\nZhou Ze's gaze swept over it. He had seen his fair share of deceased people. Over his years of practicing medicine, he had saved many, but there were also many patients who had died right before his eyes due to his helplessness.\n\n\"Dr. Lin, this is your husband, right?\" a young nurse asked teasingly. They knew Dr. Lin was married, but unlike other female doctors' or nurses' boyfriends, Dr. Lin's husband had never shown up at the hospital.\n\nYou can't blame them for making a joke even when facing death. It's like asking someone who goes to Tibet once and posts on social media about their soul being purified and how moved and devout they are to do that for ten years straight; they wouldn't be able to handle it, it's unrealistic.\n\n\"Yes,\" Dr. Lin replied, nodding. At this point, her emotions had calmed down a bit.\n\n\"Then you two should hurry back. Maybe you have some plans when you get home, right?\n\nI'm telling you, our Dr. Lin really likes children. Hurry home...\"\n\n\"Damn it!\"\n\n\"......\" the young nurse.\n\nZhou Ze saw the edge of a lily dress peeking out from under the white sheet. His mind went \"boom,\" and he suddenly realized that the unharmed little girl he had just seen...\n\nshe wasn't human!",

    "content": "\"Damn it,\"\n\n  After that outburst,\n\n  The two young nurses were at a loss, and Doctor Lin was also stunned.\n\n  It was because the retrieval was too simple and crude.\n\n  Zhou Ze offered no explanation. He directly reached out and removed the white cloth covering the girl's head.\n\n  It was her, it was indeed her!\n\n  No wonder she wasn't injured at all earlier.\n\n  There wasn't even a scratch on her body.\n\n  This wasn't because she was lucky enough to be in the last row.\n\n  In fact,\n\n  She was the most seriously injured among all the children. The doctor had been doing everything possible to save her.\n\n  Her soul had already drifted out, yet she was still unaware. She was still reminding herself not to smoke in public and went to comfort classmates and friends who had minor injuries.\n\n  In reality,\n\n  Those children couldn't see her at all.\n\n  In the entire hospital,\n\n  The only person who could see her\n\n  Was Zhou Ze!\n\n  \"She's dead?\" Zhou Ze asked, his gaze sweeping around.\n\n  \"Xu Le?\" Doctor Lin looked at her husband. She didn't want to deal with his earlier profanity because she noticed that her husband was exhibiting some abnormal behavior.\n\n  \"She's not dead yet. You continue saving her. Keep resuscitating her!\"\n\n  Zhou Ze suddenly grabbed Doctor Lin's arm and pulled her over, shouting:\n\n  \"The resuscitation window hasn't closed yet. There's still a chance she'll wake up. Continue the resuscitation!\"\n\n  \"Sir, Sir!\"\n\n  The two nurses, seeing Zhou Ze grabbing Doctor Lin so roughly, immediately stepped forward to pull Zhou Ze away. In their eyes, Doctor Lin's husband was somewhat incomprehensible and showed signs of domestic violence.\n\n  Zhou Ze pushed the two nurses aside and released his grip, murmuring softly:\n\n  \"Where are you? Where are you? Where on earth are you!\"\n\n  Zhou Ze rushed out. He was running, searching.\n\n  Just moments ago, the girl's soul had been wandering among the children, comforting them. Now, she had vanished.\n\n  Had she already gone to hell?\n\n  Was she dead?\n\n  Was it too late?\n\n  Zhou Ze felt a sense of bewilderment. He didn't know why he was so agitated or why he was so anxious.\n\n  Perhaps it was because of his profession; it was his duty to save any patient who had a chance of survival. Furthermore, that kind and resilient girl had interacted with him just now.\n\n  \"Uncle, are you looking for me?\"\n\n  A familiar child's voice sounded behind Zhou Ze. Zhou Ze immediately turned around and saw the little girl again.\n\n  However, the little girl's body was not as solid as before. She had now become semi-transparent.\n\n  \"Uncle, I'm a bit cold,\" the little girl said, hugging her arms and squatting down. \"I went to ask the nurses to lend me some clothes, but they ignored me. Do they hate me? Am I very annoying?\"\n\n  Small specks of light continuously emanated from the little girl. Zhou Ze had seen this scene before; it had happened to him.\n\n  \"Xu Le, come back with me!\"\n\n  Doctor Lin walked over at this moment.\n\n  The little girl turned her head and looked behind her.\n\n  \"Don't look!\"\n\n  Zhou Ze stepped forward and reached out to cover the little girl's eyes. No one knew what would happen if she saw her own body lying on the hospital bed.\n\n  Would she break down?\n\n  Would she realize she was dead and immediately dissipate?\n\n  When Zhou Ze's hand touched the little girl's body, his fingernails felt slightly warm. They didn't grow longer or turn black, but Zhou Ze sensed intense heat. Simultaneously, the little girl's body began to twist, transforming into a ring of light that circled around Zhou Ze's fingertips. This light was clearly invisible to everyone else.\n\n  \"Get out of the way, she can still be saved!\" Zhou Ze rushed towards the hospital bed again.\n\n  \"Xu Le!\" Doctor Lin's chest heaved. The deceased was gone. She didn't know why her husband was still ranting like a madman, and moreover, her husband had studied civil engineering and had nothing to do with medicine.\n\n  This time, when Zhou Ze rushed over, the two nurses did not dare to stop him. Zhou Ze lifted the white cloth and placed his hands on the girl's chest.\n\n  Yes, this was how he had come back to life himself.\n\n  Your soul has come out,\n\n  It can go back in.\n\n  You can live!\n\n  After seeing all the light from his fingertips enter the girl's body, Zhou Ze began performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation, pressing down on the girl with his hands clasped together.\n\n  \"Wake up!\"\n\n  \"Wake up!\"\n\n  The two nurses dared not approach and instead looked at Doctor Lin.\n\n  \"She's dead.\"\n\n  Doctor Lin walked to Zhou Ze's side and said.\n\n  \"The golden hour for resuscitation hasn't passed yet. I've been keeping track of the time,\" Zhou Ze shouted as he continued pressing. \"She can live, she can live!\"\n\n  Doctor Lin pursed her lips, directly reached out, pushed Zhou Ze aside, and then began pressing on the girl's chest with her own hands.\n\n  \"Your force is too great. She has injuries. Chun, reattach the equipment and continue the resuscitation.\"\n\n  Zhou Ze was pushed aside but did not get angry. He merely continued to stare at the little girl on the hospital bed.\n\n  The only fortunate thing was probably that the parents were stopped by the traffic police, and with so many children making noise outside, no one noticed what was happening here.\n\n  Doctor Lin continued pressing, beads of sweat appearing on her forehead. She didn't know why she was going along with this man's madness, but for some reason, she saw something unusual in this man's eyes.\n\n  And this man was her husband, yet today, she felt somewhat unable to fathom him.\n\n  The equipment was reconnected, but the display screen still showed a flat line.\n\n  The two nurses stood nearby, looking bewildered.\n\n  Couldn't save her?\n\n  Even if he returned her soul,\n\n  He couldn't save her?\n\n  A sense of loss pervaded Zhou Ze's heart.\n\n  \"Beep... beep... beep...\"\n\n  At this moment,\n\n  The previously flat line suddenly showed fluctuations.\n\n  Doctor Lin stared at the display screen in shock.\n\n  This,\n\n  Was a medical miracle?\n\n  ..................\n\n  It was already evening when they drove back home from the hospital. Zhou Ze sat in the passenger seat while Doctor Lin drove. They still didn't speak.\n\n  Silence was probably the standard for the couple's relationship. However, in the past, it was Xu Le who tried to break the silence, but today, it was Doctor Lin.\n\n  \"Did you study medicine?\"\n\n  \"No.\"\n\n  \"Your technique just now was very professional.\" Doctor Lin could tell.\n\n  \"I received training when I was getting my driver's license,\" Zhou Ze concocted a casual excuse.\n\n  \"But you don't have a driver's license,\" Doctor Lin frowned slightly.\n\n  \"...\" Zhou Ze.\n\n  Well, Zhou Ze silently despised Xu Le again in his heart.\n\n  Doctor Lin didn't intend to probe further, only saying, \"Thank you for your persistence today.\"\n\n  \"No need to thank me,\" Zhou Ze waved his hand. As... at least he still considered himself a doctor in his heart, saving a patient truly didn't require thanks.\n\n  The girl had not woken up yet and was still in a coma, but at least there was hope.\n\n  \"I thank you on behalf of that girl,\" Doctor Lin picked up her phone and checked it. \"It's almost eight o'clock. My parents are still waiting for us to go home for dinner.\"\n\n  Parents?\n\n  Zhou Ze suddenly felt a headache coming on.\n\n  Was he going to meet his in-laws already?\n\n  The car drove into a high-end residential area. Tongcheng was close to Shanghai. Geographically, it was at the opposite end of the Yangtze River estuary from Shanghai. Although it wasn't as extremely expensive as Shanghai, property prices were not cheap.\n\n  Doctor Lin parked the car and walked inside. Zhou Ze followed behind her. They entered the elevator and then exited together. Doctor Lin used her key to open a door.\n\n  The house was well-decorated, with a duplex layout. In fact, judging from the car Doctor Lin was driving, the Lin family's financial situation should be quite good.\n\n  Of course, his current identity as a \"son-in-law who lives with the wife's family\" also served as evidence. After all, one wouldn't be able to marry into a family without some financial backing.\n\n  On the living room sofa, an elder wearing a sweater and with half-white hair was sitting and watching television – the rebroadcast of Xinwen Lianbo (a major Chinese news program). He seemed engrossed.\n\n  Even when his daughter and son-in-law returned, he only glanced at them and said nothing.\n\n  \"Wanqiu, you're back.\"\n\n  The kitchen door was pushed open, and the mother-in-law poked her head out. Perhaps Doctor Lin and her younger sister inherited their heights from their mother. The mother-in-law was tall, and though slightly overweight now, she was still the type who could dominate the \"Sunset Red\" square and make countless elderly gentlemen vie for her attention.\n\n  Take note, take notes, highlight the key points.\n\n  Zhou Ze finally learned his wife's full name – Lin Wanqiu.\n\n  The mother-in-law's gaze swept over Zhou Ze and clearly lingered for a moment.\n\n  \"Old man, it's time to eat. Wanqiu is back.\"\n\n  \"Finally, we can eat,\" the younger sister walked out of the study. She gave Zhou Ze a friendly fist bump and then gestured with her mouth, signaling Zhou Ze to pay attention to her parents.\n\n  This small gesture was not bad. Although this girl was a bit bossy, she wasn't excessively so.\n\n  Zhou Ze went to the bathroom to wash his hands. Lin Wanqiu also came in while he was washing them. They both rubbed their hands with liquid soap, and they rubbed very carefully.\n\n  Lin Wanqiu's gaze lingered on Zhou Ze for a couple more seconds before she rinsed her hands and walked into the living room.\n\n  Zhou Ze also finished washing his hands, dried them with a paper towel, and walked out of the bathroom.\n\n  Everyone was seated, and Zhou Ze sat on the chair next to Lin Wanqiu.\n\n  The mother-in-law, with a somber expression, brought the bowls of rice one by one. When she placed one in front of Zhou Ze, she clearly used a bit more force.\n\n  Good,\n\n  At least she didn't deliberately skip serving me rice.\n\n  Zhou Ze thought to himself.\n\n  \"Xu Le, do you think we treat you badly?\" the mother-in-law asked before they started eating.\n\n  \"You treat me very well,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\n  \"Then why didn't you come home last night? Were you giving someone the cold shoulder...\"\n\n  \"Mom, let's eat. He had some things going on at his store, he told me,\" Lin Wanqiu intervened.\n\n  The mother-in-law and father-in-law exchanged a look. They were somewhat surprised that their eldest daughter was willing to speak up for this son-in-law. This made them feel a little uncomfortable, and they momentarily forgot to continue their scolding.\n\n  The younger sister, watching from the side, was also a bit surprised. Her elder sister had never really cared about this so-called brother-in-law. Was the sun rising from the west today?\n\n  \"Let's eat,\" the father-in-law picked up his chopsticks and gestured. \"You eat too.\" The father-in-law specifically pointed at Zhou Ze with his chopsticks.\n\n  Well, this action was a bit impolite, but fortunately, it indicated that the matter from last night was now past.\n\n  \"Wanqiu, have some braised pork. Mom simmered it for a long time.\"\n\n  The mother-in-law placed a piece of meat into the bowls of her elder and younger daughters, then hesitated before also placing a piece of meat into her son-in-law's bowl.\n\n  Only then did Zhou Ze realize that he hadn't eaten anything all day. From the moment he possessed this body last night, he hadn't eaten anything for breakfast or lunch.\n\n  He didn't stand on ceremony.\n\n  He picked up the meat and put it in his mouth.\n\n  Immediately after,\n\n  Zhou Ze's face stiffened.\n\n  An unexpected wave of nausea surged from within him, and his stomach began to spasm wildly.\n\n  \"Ugh...\" Zhou Ze gagged. It was as if what he was eating was poison.\n\n  \"...\" Mother-in-law.\n\n  \"...\" Father-in-law.\n\n  The atmosphere at the dinner table\n\n  Instantly plunged into freezing point.",

    "content": "\"Excuse me.\"\n\nZhou Ze held up his hand, signaling he wasn't doing it on purpose, because this was incredibly embarrassing, especially given the premise that \"Xu Le,\" the live-in son-in-law, was so disliked by his in-laws for reasons unknown.\n\n\"Feeling unwell?\" Doctor Lin put down his chopsticks and asked.\n\n\"It's nothing, nothing.\"\n\nZhou Ze picked up his chopsticks again and shoveled rice into his mouth.\n\nBut before he could swallow the mouthful,\n\nHis stomach cramped again, and a strong sense of nausea welled up from deep within, as if what he was about to swallow wasn't rice, but the son of rice, feces.\n\n\"Pfft...\"\n\nThis time,\n\nZhou Ze sprayed the rice in his mouth out,\n\nSplaying it onto the faces of his father-in-law and mother-in-law sitting opposite him.\n\nThe father-in-law's glasses and hair were speckled with rice grains,\n\nAnd the mother-in-law's coiled hair also had a sparkling white sheen.\n\nWith a \"splat,\"\n\nThe father-in-law's chopsticks fell from his hand, his face twitching a few times, seemingly still unsure how to process the situation.\n\nThe mother-in-law, however, took a deep breath, her eyes blazing with fury!\n\nThis was,\n\nAn insult to their generosity!\n\n\"Slap!\"\n\nThe mother-in-law pushed back the chair behind her and stood up.\n\n\"Xu Le!\"\n\nThe mother-in-law, a retired head nurse, knew that even if someone was sick, they wouldn't spray food so excessively. Moreover, looking at Xu Le, he didn't seem like he was \"on the verge of death.\"\n\nHe was doing it deliberately,\n\nHe was definitely doing it deliberately!\n\nHe was rebelling!\n\nRebelling!\n\nZhou Ze clutched his chest and left the dining table, rushing into the bathroom, flipping open the toilet lid, and starting to retch desperately.\n\nThis time, he even vomited bile, his mouth tasting bitter.\n\nThis meal was ruined.\n\nDoctor Lin looked at Xu Le, who was still vomiting in the bathroom, and directly said to his younger sister:\n\n\"Xiao Yi, go cook some noodles.\"\n\n\"Oh, okay.\"\n\nHis sister-in-law stuck out her tongue. She also felt her brother-in-law was pushing things a bit too far today. She immediately left the table and went to the kitchen to prepare some dried noodles.\n\n\"Preposterous, that scoundrel!\"\n\nThe father-in-law slammed the table and took off his glasses, shaking them. Xu Le's father-in-law, a retired vice-director, always valued decorum and dignified appearance. Today, his bottom line had been crossed.\n\n\"I'm going to find that guy and ask him what we've done to offend him! We didn't ask for any betrothal gifts when they got married, and we even funded that money-losing bookstore for him. What have we done to wrong him!\"\n\nThe mother-in-law prepared to go to the bathroom.\n\n\"Mom, let me clean this up. He's not feeling well.\"\n\nDoctor Lin began to clear away the dining plates, which had barely been touched.\n\n\"Even now, you're still protecting him?\" The mother-in-law, enraged, pointed at her daughter and scolded her.\n\n\"What else? Who threatened to hang themselves to force me into this marriage?\" Doctor Lin looked directly at her mother, her usually delicate face appearing particularly resolute at this moment.\n\nThe mother-in-law was momentarily speechless. It was true, they were the ones who had forced their daughter into marriage. They desperately wanted grandchildren and had gone to great lengths to find a live-in son-in-law like Xu Le. At the time, it seemed simple: they only had two daughters, so they had to take in a live-in son-in-law, with the grandson taking their surname. Xu Le's parents were deceased, and he was a college graduate, fitting their criteria.\n\n\"I'm not eating.\"\n\nThe father-in-law couldn't meet his daughter's gaze. He had personally made the decision back then, and now, he realized he had indeed wronged his daughter. He got up and returned to his study.\n\n\"Sigh, old man, you have a stomach condition.\" The mother-in-law called out anxiously.\n\n\"Mom, I'll bring Dad a bowl of noodles later.\"\n\nDoctor Lin cleared the table and then walked towards the bathroom.\n\nThe mother-in-law watched her daughter's retreating back and finally said nothing more.\n\nPushing open the glass door of the bathroom, Doctor Lin saw Zhou Ze kneeling beside the toilet, one hand gripping the rim, the other clutching his chest.\n\n\"Not feeling well?\"\n\n\"I'm alright.\" Zhou Ze replied. He had been fine before dinner; he didn't know why he had become like this as soon as he started eating.\n\n\"I asked Xiao Yi to cook noodles. You can eat them later...\"\n\n\"Gag... \"\n\nJust thinking about noodles made Zhou Ze feel a strong wave of nausea surge from deep within him, and he began to retch again.\n\nLin Wanqiu frowned slightly.\n\n\"To the hospital?\"\n\n\"No need, it's nothing. I won't eat.\"\n\nZhou Ze waved his hand, managing to stand up with difficulty. He went to the sink to rinse his mouth and wash his face.\n\nDinner today was destined to end unhappily.\n\nThe father-in-law, mother-in-law, and sister-in-law lived on the first floor, while Zhou Ze and Lin Wanqiu's bedroom was on the second floor.\n\nAfter cleaning himself up, Zhou Ze also took a shower. Since he didn't know where his spare clothes were, he didn't change and went upstairs wearing his wet hair in his previous clothes. As soon as he reached the top of the stairs, he noticed Lin Wanqiu was taking a shower in the second-floor bathroom.\n\nZhou Ze stood at the bathroom door for a while, watching the graceful figure reflected inside. He licked his lips lightly.\n\nPeople are most impulsive at times like these, and at times like these, they are also most grateful.\n\n\"Thank you.\"\n\nZhou Ze silently recited in his heart.\n\nThis was the first time in the two days since he had possessed Xu Le's body that Zhou Ze had given a thumbs-up to the unfortunate soul.\n\nAlthough you've left behind an incredibly problematic set of relationships, your wife is truly beautiful.\n\nWith a hint of fantasy, a bit of excitement, a touch of impatience, and a dash of anticipation,\n\nZhou Ze pushed open the bedroom door.\n\nAnd then,\n\nZhou Ze's expression changed. He bit his lip,\n\nAnd in his heart, he dragged out the Xu Le he had just praised and proceeded to flay him alive a million times.\n\nThe bedroom was huge,\n\nA large bed,\n\nAnd next to the bed,\n\nThere was also a futon!\n\nWhat did this mean? Even a fool would understand!\n\nWas that guy out of his mind?\n\nWas that guy an idiot?\n\nWhat was the point of being a live-in son-in-law like this?\n\nZhou Ze took three deep breaths and then silently lay down on the futon.\n\nSleep.\n\nNo more fussing.\n\nNo more thinking.\n\nHe would see if he could get some money, move out independently, and then, whether it was a divorce or something else, resolve these complicated relationships. He had a lot of problems to deal with after his transmigration.\n\nLin Wanqiu came out after her shower, wearing a blue pajama set that was a bit loose, making her look a bit small in it.\n\nZhou Ze, lying on the futon, instinctively swallowed.\n\n\"Get up.\" Lin Wanqiu said.\n\n\"Hmm?\"\n\n\"You always slept on the bed, and I slept on the futon.\" Lin Wanqiu said.\n\n\"......\" Zhou Ze silently got up and moved to the bed.\n\nLin Wanqiu turned off the lights and lay down on the futon.\n\nPerhaps, this was her compensation for not wanting to share a bed with Xu Le; she slept on the futon.\n\nZhou Ze sighed,\n\nAnd prepared to sleep.\n\nHalf an hour later, he was still awake, tossing and turning.\n\nAn hour later, he was still awake, tossing and turning.\n\nThree hours later, it was past midnight, and he was still awake.\n\nHis eyelids felt heavy, but he just couldn't fall asleep.\n\nLin Wanqiu on the futon, however, had steady breathing; she was likely asleep.\n\nZhou Ze swore it wasn't because he couldn't sleep due to the presence of a beautiful woman sleeping next to him;\n\nHe was very sleepy and tired, especially after all the things that had happened today.\n\nBut for some reason, he just couldn't sleep.\n\nLying in bed, Zhou Ze simply opened his eyes and looked at his hands.\n\nToday, with these hands, he had saved the little girl's life. Although the little girl hadn't woken up yet, her vital signs had returned, and she could be saved.\n\nWas this a special ability he gained after a trip to hell?\n\nOr,\n\nWas it something left behind by that old man when he grabbed his wrist before dying?\n\nHowever,\n\nIt felt pretty good.\n\nAs a doctor, with such hands, how many lives could he save?\n\nThis was an ability that surpassed medical techniques and understanding, and it could even allow him to reach a level beyond Hua Tuo or Bian Que. Every practitioner in every profession hopes to one day surpass their predecessors. Perhaps this wasn't for money or profit, but a kind of... sentiment.\n\nBut at this very moment,\n\nZhou Ze suddenly felt a spasm in both his arms, and intense pain quickly struck.\n\n\"Hiss...\"\n\nZhou Ze gasped, curling up on the bed.\n\nBut the pain continued and was even escalating!\n\nZhou Ze was sweating from the pain. Unable to bear it any longer, he got out of bed and walked out of the bedroom.\n\nHe went into the bathroom. Without turning on the light, he sat on the toilet. At this moment, Zhou Ze saw that from his arms all the way to his fingernails, there were veins that looked like they were about to burst.\n\nThe pain originated from them, as if something was pounding at his bone marrow.\n\nDamn it,\n\nWhat on earth was happening!\n\nZhou Ze's face contorted with pain.\n\nThis sensation made him suffer immensely, even giving him the urge to chop off his own arms with a cleaver.\n\nIn a daze, he seemed to recall the scene of lying in an ice coffin, about to be pushed into the crematorium.\n\nHe also seemed to recall the fragmented memories of stumbling through hell towards an inevitable end.\n\nWas this a curse?\n\nWas this a punishment?\n\nWhy was I being punished?\n\nWhat did I do wrong?\n\nBecause I snuck back?\n\nBecause I'm not a living person, so heaven is punishing me?\n\nOr perhaps... because I used it to save someone today?\n\nYes, it must be that reason.\n\nZhou Ze took a deep breath. Because he had used that ability to save someone, he had violated some rule and was suffering a backlash?\n\nThen,\n\nIf I went and killed that girl right now, would the pain stop?\n\nA slight black mist began to gather in Zhou Ze's eyes, but he was completely unaware.\n\n\"Uncle, you can't smoke in the hospital.\"\n\nThe little girl's voice resurfaced in Zhou Ze's mind.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head vigorously.\n\nNo,\n\nI saved her, so I saved her!\n\nI don't regret it,\n\nI don't regret it!\n\n...\n\n\"Mom, are you not done yet?\"\n\n\"I just started. You can use the bathroom on the second floor.\"\n\n\"Alright.\"\n\nHis sister-in-law went upstairs. She couldn't hold it any longer. The bathroom on the second floor had no lights on, so she directly pushed open the door and walked in.\n\nAnd then,\n\nAt this very moment,\n\nZhou Ze looked up at her.\n\nShe also looked at Zhou Ze.\n\nIn Zhou Ze's eyes, black mist swirled, carrying an intense aura of deterrence. It was the gaze of a vengeful, maddened ghost that had crawled out of hell.\n\n\"Aaaahhhhhhhh!!!!!\"\n\nHis sister-in-law screamed in terror,\n\nAnd then fell to the ground.\n\nShe looked at Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze was also looking at her.\n\nThen, Zhou Ze saw that under his sister-in-law's pajamas – it was wet, and an incongruous liquid appeared on the tile floor...\n\nShe had been scared to pee herself?",

    "content": "A scream woke the whole family.\n\nIt was understandable. A bathroom without lights late at night, opening the door with the urge to urinate and suddenly seeing someone inside was frightening enough. Most people have had similar experiences.\n\nWhat's more, the sister-in-law encountered a ghost.\n\nLin Wanqiu came out of the bedroom and pulled up her sister.\n\n\"What's wrong, what's wrong!\"\n\nHer father-in-law and mother-in-law also came up from the first floor. Seeing their youngest daughter crying in her elder sister's arms, and then looking at Zhou Ze still sitting on the toilet.\n\n\"You good-for-nothing Xu Le, you heartless scoundrel, you've set your sights on my youngest daughter!\"\n\nThe mother-in-law picked up the broom by the bathroom door and prepared to hit Xu Le.\n\nThe father-in-law was the same, angrily preparing to come in and teach his scoundrel son-in-law a lesson.\n\nIt was understandable.\n\nSeeing this scene,\n\nEveryone would naturally assume the worst.\n\nThe brother-in-law had gone mad,\n\nAnd was making improper advances on his sister-in-law.\n\nAfter all, as the saying goes, \"a sister-in-law is half of her brother-in-law's...\"¹\n\n\"Dad, Mom, it was Xiao Yi who was scared when she entered the bathroom,\" Dr. Lin said.\n\nThe mother-in-law froze, her raised broom unsure where to land.\n\nThe father-in-law also stopped short and took a few steps back awkwardly.\n\nThe interruption made Zhou Ze suddenly realize that the veins on his arms had faded and the intense pain had disappeared.\n\nHe felt very tired and sleepy, wanting only to sleep.\n\nHe stood up, ready to leave the bathroom. As for his in-laws, Zhou Ze couldn't be bothered. He had no interest in cleaning up Xu Le's messes.\n\nHowever, when Zhou Ze stood up, his sister-in-law immediately trembled several times, instinctively hiding in her sister's arms.\n\n\"Ah! Don't come near me! Don't come near me!\"\n\nZhou Ze frowned slightly. What had she seen?\n\n\"What exactly is going on!\" the mother-in-law asked her younger daughter, hands on her hips. This didn't look like she was just scared. \"Xiao Yi, my darling, tell Mom, what happened? Did he... did he do something to you?\"\n\nThe sister-in-law was quite honest and knew she couldn't lie about something like this, as it would have serious consequences.\n\n\"No, I came to use the toilet, opened the door, and saw him sitting inside. It was too scary!\"\n\nAfter bravely saying this, the sister-in-law buried her head in her sister's arms again.\n\nAlright,\n\nIt was a misunderstanding after all.\n\n\"You airhead, going to the bathroom late at night without turning on the lights?\n\nDo you think this is your home? So stingy,\n\nCan't bear to pay a little for electricity!\n\nIf you scared my daughter into having some kind of accident, what would you do to compensate...\"\n\nThe mother-in-law began to reprimand Zhou Ze, her finger almost poking his face.\n\nZhou Ze was very tired at this moment. When severely sleep-deprived, people tend to be irritable. Moreover, Zhou Ze was already tired of Xu Le's troublesome family ties.\n\nIf they hadn't been sleeping separately,\n\nZhou Ze might not have lost his temper.\n\nNow that they were even sleeping in separate beds,\n\nZhou Ze couldn't be bothered to endure the snobbish mother-in-law's attitude anymore.\n\n\"Slap!\"\n\nZhou Ze swatted away his mother-in-law's pointing finger.\n\n\"Don't bother me.\"\n\nThe mother-in-law's eyes widened, clearly not believing that her usually timid son-in-law dared to speak to her like this.\n\n\"How can you talk to your mother? Have you no manners!\" the father-in-law reprimanded at this moment.\n\n\"If you want your daughter to become a divorcee, then keep lecturing me about manners!\"\n\nZhou Ze retorted directly, then pushed his father-in-law aside with his shoulder and returned to the bedroom.\n\nWith a \"bang,\" he slammed the door shut forcefully.\n\n\"Preposterous, preposterous!\" The father-in-law's chest heaved with anger.\n\nThe mother-in-law quickly went to her husband and massaged his chest.\n\nBut they ultimately did not dare to escalate the situation.\n\nAfter all,\n\nWhat Zhou Ze had just said was a significant deterrent to them.\n\nAlthough they didn't know what had possessed their usually silent and timid son-in-law today, he was right. If their elder daughter divorced, her next marriage would be her second, which would be bad for her reputation and their family's reputation.\n\nFurthermore, in their view, a woman remarrying was \"less valuable\" and wouldn't find a good match.\n\nIn fact, a person's upbringing and their feudal mindset have very little to do with their education or family background. It primarily depends on their inherent character.\n\nJust like Xu Le's father-in-law and mother-in-law at this moment, no matter how angry they were, they didn't dare to provoke their scoundrel son-in-law further, fearing he might actually fly into a rage and demand a divorce.\n\nZhou Ze lay on the bed, took a deep breath, closed his eyes, and intended to sleep. He was truly exhausted.\n\nAbout fifteen minutes later,\n\nZhou Ze heard a knock on the bedroom door.\n\n\"Xiao Yi is scared, I'll sleep with her tonight.\"\n\nIt was Lin Wanqiu's voice, and then she left.\n\nAs if she was really going to sleep with me...\n\n...\n\nThe next day at noon,\n\nThe father-in-law and mother-in-law were having lunch.\n\n\"He went to the bookstore?\" the father-in-law asked the mother-in-law.\n\n\"He's not up yet,\" the mother-in-law said resentfully.\n\n\"Unacceptable,\" the father-in-law commented.\n\n\"Exactly...\"\n\nAt this moment, the mother-in-law suddenly stopped speaking because she saw Zhou Ze walking down from upstairs. Zhou Ze's eyes were red, and he had severe dark circles.\n\nThe atmosphere became somewhat stagnant.\n\nPerhaps because of last night's events, Zhou Ze's status as a live-in son-in-law in this household had improved somewhat. At least, at this moment, the father-in-law and mother-in-law didn't say anything to provoke him.\n\nOf course, it was also because Zhou Ze, in his current state, looked like someone who might grab a knife and start slashing at any moment.\n\nHis gaze swept across the dining table.\n\nZhou Ze reached out and covered his chest.\n\nThe smell of rice,\n\nThe smell of meat,\n\nWas so disgusting.\n\nHe felt like he was going to vomit again.\n\nZhou Ze walked out of the house, breathing in the slightly cool, fresh air outside, feeling a bit better.\n\nHis head was a little fuzzy. Zhou Ze began to wander the streets alone. He needed to think about some things quietly, but his current state of extreme sleepiness yet inability to sleep made it difficult for him to truly calm down.\n\nIt was a struggle,\n\nAnd it was uncomfortable,\n\nLike walking out of an internet cafe after staying up all night for two days, or like a middle school student who read novels under the covers all night and had to go to class the next morning.\n\nAs he walked, Zhou Ze suddenly stopped. The surroundings were somewhat familiar.\n\nThen he saw the sign ahead.\n\nTongcheng First Affiliated Hospital.\n\nHe had actually walked all the way to his old workplace. Ha, perhaps it was because Tongcheng was too small.\n\nZhou Ze walked into the hospital, not for a sentimental journey, but intending to get some sleeping pills to try.\n\nHe could bear not eating, drinking more water and feeling full would suffice temporarily. But not sleeping was a prolonged torment.\n\nThe familiar hospital, the familiar working environment, Zhou Ze saw that his photo on the name list album in the emergency department on the ground floor had turned gray-white.\n\nThen he instinctively walked to his original office. His desk had been replaced. A middle-aged doctor with a face full of pockmarks was sitting in his place. He glanced at the nameplate on the desk. His surname was Kang.\n\nHe let out a sigh, a little wistful.\n\nZhou Ze temporarily forgot about getting sleeping pills. Perhaps this \"things are no longer the same\" emotion temporarily suppressed the torment of his sleepiness, and Zhou Ze began to wander around the hospital.\n\nHe was reminiscing about the bits and pieces of his life here,\n\nHis work,\n\nHis life,\n\nAnd,\n\nHis past,\n\nOr rather, his previous life.\n\n\"I can't go back, I really can't go back,\" Zhou Ze thought to himself.\n\nThen, without realizing it, he had walked down the stairs and reached the basement level.\n\nHe stood still. As a doctor who had worked here for many years, he knew the layout of this floor.\n\nThere were equipment storage rooms, and then, the morgue.\n\nHe remembered that he had once lain in the hospital morgue and been made up by the embalmer.\n\nHe resumed walking towards the morgue.\n\nZhou Ze wanted to see the place where he had once lain. This was his own explanation for walking towards it now, but in reality, it was a special feeling, guided by some unseen force, that led him there.\n\nAs he walked, Zhou Ze saw the door to the morgue. It had an electronic keypad lock. Coincidentally, Zhou Ze remembered the password. If it were doctors from other departments, they probably wouldn't have any contact with this place. But Zhou Ze used to be in the emergency department. People sent to the emergency room were usually patients with severe injuries, and some might not be saved, so they would be sent here for temporary storage.\n\nIn fact, this hospital also served as a morgue for the police department. Bodies of unknown origin or those requiring \"processing\" would be temporarily stored here. This was common practice in many places. If the local police department lacked facilities or forensic staff, bodies were often kept at the local funeral home or hospital.\n\nHe entered the password.\n\nThe lock opened directly.\n\nZhou Ze went inside.\n\nA chill spread through him.\n\nNot the kind of chill that stimulates the skin,\n\nBut a special, chilling cold that seemed to extinguish the warmth within.\n\nIn the morgue, there were of course bodies lying there. This was a temporary resting place for the deceased.\n\nLogically, there should have been an administrator stationed outside. But for some reason, Zhou Ze didn't see anyone when he entered. Perhaps the person had taken a break.\n\nZhou Ze walked among them. Several bodies were placed on cold gurneys, covered with white sheets. There was also a body wrapped in a common household floral quilt. Judging by the silver hair visible from the head of the deceased, the deceased was likely an elderly grandmother.\n\nDue to his profession, Zhou Ze was not very afraid of bodies. Moreover, he himself was now a ghost.\n\nZhou Ze walked to the refrigerators. These were the pull-out drawer type.\n\nRefrigerators containing bodies had labels indicating the name, sex, and other information of the deceased.\n\nZhou Ze pulled open an empty refrigerator, reached inside, closed his eyes, and began to sense it. Gradually, he felt a sense of intoxication, as if only here could he find peace.\n\nAfter hesitating for a moment, Zhou Ze lay down inside.\n\n\"Creak...\"\n\nThe refrigerator was slowly pushed shut, sealing the closure.\n\nQuiet,\n\nCold,\n\nSilent.\n\nZhou Ze slowly closed his eyelids.\n\nSleepiness washed over him.\n\nHe had finally found the feeling of being able to sleep,\n\nBut he couldn't sleep yet.\n\nBecause he didn't know,\n\nWho had just stood outside and pushed the refrigerator in for him...\n\n***\n¹ A colloquial saying, often implying an incestuous relationship or undue familiarity.

    "content": "Zhou Ze’s legs began to push outwards from the inside, trying to get out, but the sound of “click, click” came from outside, meaning the lock on the outside of the ice coffin had been fastened.\n\nLocked in, unable to get out.\n\nFor a moment, Zhou Ze felt as if he had returned to the scene when he was first placed in the cramped coffin.\n\nHowever, this time, Zhou Ze wasn't frantic or angry. He simply reached out and tapped on the metal plate at his head:\n\n\"Something up?\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't believe anyone had come to push the ice coffin in and then lock it, unless that person was a mentally deranged lunatic, and Zhou Ze didn't think his luck was that bad.\n\nBesides,\n\nWhen he entered the morgue, he had closed the door. A lunatic who knew the morgue's door code?\n\nDo you believe it?\n\nTherefore, Zhou Ze could only assume that \"that thing\" had \"helped\" him, and helped him thoroughly.\n\nHowever, after this inquiry, there was still silence outside.\n\nZhou Ze decided to ignore it and closed his eyes again, preparing to get a good night's sleep.\n\nHe fell asleep very quickly.\n\nAfter all, he hadn't slept for two days, and there had been many things happening during those two days, accumulating a terrifying amount of fatigue.\n\nEven if the floods rage after my death,\n\nNo one can stop me from sleeping now.\n\n…\n\nHe didn't know how long he slept. When Zhou Ze opened his eyes, he felt refreshed and regained his long-lost vigor, but unfortunately, his body was also frozen stiff.\n\nThe stiffness of his body was somewhat terrifying. Zhou Ze wriggled his body a few times in the narrow space, and a series of \"crisp cracking\" sounds came out, so comfortable that he subconsciously made a sound.\n\nAt this moment, Zhou Ze’s fingernails naturally grew longer and turned black, shimmering with an unusual luster. The stiffness in his body and the cold air within him, which would be unbearable for ordinary people, were slowly gathering towards his fingertips.\n\nThe entire process did not take long, but it made Zhou Ze no longer feel cold or uncomfortable.\n\nHe instinctively kicked again, and the ice coffin naturally slid out.\n\nThe lock,\n\nWas it unlocked?\n\nZhou Ze was somewhat surprised. He sat up from the steel plate, got down, and then pushed it back.\n\nHis clothes were a bit stiff, hanging on him like cardboard, giving him a very uncomfortable feeling. Zhou Ze’s gaze swept around.\n\nThe morgue of the affiliated hospital wasn't very large. Compared to the large hospitals in big cities, it even seemed a bit shy, but it still stored quite a few corpses.\n\nZhou Ze didn't know who had helped him push it in earlier, and now it was indeed difficult to find them.\n\nFortunately, since the other party had unlocked it while he was asleep, Zhou Ze decided not to stir up more trouble here.\n\nHe walked towards the morgue door, intending to leave. However, as he passed by those beds covered with white cloth, Zhou Ze stopped.\n\nThose corpses covered with white cloth were nothing unusual.\n\nEven the old woman wrapped in a floral quilt from home seemed unchanged.\n\nBut Zhou Ze still stopped,\n\nBecause he remembered that the old woman's head and feet were in reversed positions.\n\nIt was impossible for the morgue attendant to run in while he was sleeping, do nothing else, and then flip the old woman around.\n\nZhou Ze stopped beside the old woman and said:\n\n\"If it's you, if you don't come out now, I'm leaving.\"\n\nThe old woman pushing him in and locking him might have had malicious intent, but she silently helped him unlock it, which meant she didn't want to harm him.\n\nPerhaps someone was about to arrive, and seeing a locked compartment, they might discover him.\n\nAfter all, whether these compartments were locked or not was very obvious from the outside.\n\nAfter waiting for half a minute with no abnormality, Zhou Ze decided not to wait any longer.\n\nJust as he was about to turn and leave, a sigh came from behind him.\n\nZhou Ze found this feeling annoying.\n\nHesitant,\n\nPlaying hard to get,\n\nClearly an old woman when she died, yet she had to act like a young maiden.\n\nAlright, age discrimination is indeed wrong, but normal people always have a slightly higher tolerance for pretty ghosts, which is only natural.\n\nIf Nie Xiaoqian had a face full of wrinkles and big yellow teeth, do you think Ning Caichen would still fall in love with her?\n\nZhou Ze turned around and looked behind him.\n\nAn old woman with silver hair was squatting there, holding a faded handkerchief and wiping away tears.\n\nBut ghosts have no tears, so to Zhou Ze, the old woman looked more like she was howling in vain.\n\n\"You can continue crying, I won't bother you.\"\n\nZhou Ze prepared to leave.\n\nHe realized that he was ultimately a commoner, and even when looking at ghosts, he had some aesthetic biases.\n\n\"Help me, I have money,\" the old woman suddenly said.\n\n\"Mhm,\" Zhou Ze replied. He was short of money.\n\nDamn Xu Le's Alipay and WeChat combined had less than two hundred yuan, plus the thousand yuan the \"murderer\" sent back, meaning Zhou Ze's total assets were less than thirteen hundred.\n\nAnd Zhou Ze's house and savings from his previous life should have been donated to the orphanage. He was essentially penniless.\n\n\"My money is in the interlayer of my cabinet, a lacquered yellow old cupboard. There's thirty thousand yuan in it, and also my dowry, jade hairpins, and jade bracelets. I don't know how much they're worth.\n\nI died in a hurry and didn't have time to tell my sons. I'm afraid they won't know.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded, \"I'll take a portion.\"\n\nThe old woman showed a struggling expression, but still nodded, \"This is only right.\"\n\nThe old woman knew that without an \"anomaly\" like Zhou Ze to relay the message, her sons might not be able to find the property she left behind at all.\n\n…\n\nAfter leaving the hospital, Zhou Ze took a taxi directly to Xingdong Town in Tongzhou District. It wasn't far; Tongcheng Airport was located in this town.\n\nEarlier, Zhou Ze had inquired at the hospital's registration desk. The old woman had been sent to the hospital and died after unsuccessful rescue. Her family then abandoned the body at the hospital and left, still owing the hospital medical fees.\n\nAbout half an hour later, Zhou Ze arrived at the town and found the village according to the old woman's description.\n\nIt was a self-built two-story house, with a small brick structure resembling a rural outhouse attached to it.\n\nWhen Zhou Ze arrived, he saw several workers demolishing the house, specifically the brick structure.\n\nZhou Ze walked over, offered a cigarette to a master worker, and asked, \"The New Year is coming, and you're still busy?\"\n\n\"Make more money as the New Year approaches, we're all from the same village anyway.\" The bricklayer master was quite carefree.\n\n\"What's going on with this house?\" Zhou Ze asked while looking inside. Two workers were already removing the roof, and the bricks of the small house's walls would be dismantled and reused later. Inside the house, let alone the lacquered yellow cabinet the old woman mentioned, there wasn't even a small stool, it was completely empty.\n\n\"His old mother died. This house used to be where his old mother lived alone. Now they plan to demolish it and build a kitchen,\" the master worker said, leaning his head over for Zhou Ze to help light his cigarette, smiling a bit reservedly. \"See, the one who just walked by in front of the house is their eldest son.\"\n\nZhou Ze looked over and saw that the man, whose hair was also turning white, had some bruises on his face.\n\n\"There are five brothers. They started fighting over the money their old mother left behind. These bricks will be unloaded soon, and the other four will come to divide them.\n\nTell me, this world, it's changed. Their old mother's body is still at the hospital waiting to be collected, yet none of the brothers are willing to pay back the medical fees.\"\n\n\"What about the things in the old woman's house?\" Zhou Ze was concerned about this. From the old woman's description, the thirty thousand yuan in the cabinet was her life's savings, but those jade bracelets and jade hairpins were the truly valuable items. Selling them would likely fetch a few hundred thousand yuan.\n\n\"Sold them to the scrap dealer. They were cleared out long ago. They were sold when the old woman was first hospitalized,\" the master worker said, taking another strong puff of his cigarette. \"I'm going back to work.\"\n\nZhou Ze licked his lips with a wry smile. This trip was a waste of time.\n\nThe things left by the old woman not only did he not get a share, but even her sons couldn't enjoy them. They could only be cheaply sold to some second-hand furniture dealer.\n\nZhou Ze was now somewhat vexed. Being short of money was really a big problem, and he was unwilling to use his own abilities to cheat for money. Although it seemed simple and satisfying, the last time he saved a girl, he almost died of pain all night. Who knows what problems would arise if he continued to mess around.\n\nWhether there are gods three feet above one's head, Zhou Ze didn't know.\n\nBut if you keep digging three feet down, there will definitely be a hell, because he had been there.\n\nHe knew he was not human, and this was the human world. Moreover, the patient who died in front of him, how terrified he was when he cried out \"I've been discovered\" before his death, Zhou Ze remembered it clearly.\n\nHowever,\n\nMoney,\n\nZhou Ze wanted to grind the millstone,\n\nBut who would pay?\n\nZhou Ze needed money now. Not to mention getting rid of his \"son-in-law\" identity,\n\nAt least he needed to buy himself an ice chest or a large refrigerator, right?\n\nOtherwise, would he have to run to the hospital morgue every day to mooch off the air conditioning?\n\nSlightly depressed, he lit a cigarette and took a deep drag, feeling very annoyed.\n\nJust then, his phone rang in his pocket. Zhou Ze picked up his phone. It was an unfamiliar number. He answered the call:\n\n\"Hello.\" Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Big brother, the goods have arrived safely. When are you coming to inspect them? The police are cracking down hard recently, and it wasn't easy to get this batch of goods in.\" The person on the other end of the line spoke in a low, cautious voice.\n\nZhou Ze slowly opened his mouth,\n\nMaking no sound.\n\nAt the same time,\n\nXu Le’s image suddenly began to rise in his mind.",

    "content": "Apprehensive, uneasy, yet with a sliver of smugness and confusion – this might best describe Zhou Ze's feelings as he took a taxi to the outskirts of Tongcheng.\n\nHe was short on money, desperately short. But he didn’t need vast sums, and even if he did, such wealth would be useless for now.\n\nBecause he had died and come back to life, his past entanglements and current troubles required a sum of money to resolve. After that, he would make long-term plans, not indulge in extravagant living.\n\nFor example, leaving the Lin family. While Lin Wanqiu was beautiful and refined, he really couldn't be bothered to return to that household. They weren't physically intimate, and he hadn't truly enjoyed anything there. It seemed Xu Le, that good-for-nothing, hadn't enjoyed anything either. Thus, he felt no guilt about saying goodbye.\n\nHowever, leaving that home meant making preparations. He needed a place to stay, and he had to buy a reasonably good quality freezer. Zhou Ze didn't dare to look for a used freezer on the second-hand market. What if something went wrong and he ended up sleeping inside, only to have it kill him? That would be a huge loss.\n\nMoney!\n\nEven as a ghost, he needed money.\n\nBut listening to the way the person on the phone earlier spoke to Xu Le made Zhou Ze uneasy again. Xu Le, a seemingly useless live-in son-in-law in modern society, so pathetic that his in-laws walked all over him, so pathetic that he slept in a separate room from his wife. Yet, he was a hidden triad boss?\n\nOkay, the contrast in this scenario was truly stimulating and fit the style of American dramas. Powerful characters always had an ordinary-seeming reality.\n\nLike Spider-Man being a high school student, or Superman being a reporter for a newspaper.\n\nSo, how should he handle this situation?\n\nHow should he deal with those guys?\n\nZhou Ze didn't want his current identity to be \"tainted,\" as that would mean endless trouble. The police investigation in the real world was already something Xu Le couldn't easily handle. Not to mention that old man and the faceless woman had shouted about \"those who will find and catch you.\"\n\nIt was a bit of a headache, and he was still adjusting, but Zhou Ze had arrived at the abandoned small fertilizer plant.\n\nTwo men were squatting at the entrance of the fertilizer plant. One wore a somewhat worn-out military coat, and the other wore a cheap, low-quality suit.\n\nBoth men were squatting there, a cigarette in their mouths, exhaling smoke.\n\nZhou Ze paid the taxi fare and got out. The two men immediately stood up and walked over.\n\n\"Our boss is waiting for you,\" the man in the military coat said in a deep voice.\n\nZhou Ze nodded and followed the man in the military coat inside. The man in the suit continued to squat there, smoking, as if on watch.\n\nEntering, Zhou Ze saw a plump man with a gold chain and a shaved head sitting on a plastic chair, drinking by himself. Seeing Zhou Ze approach, the fat man immediately stood up.\n\n\"Brother Xu, you're finally here.\"\n\nThe fat man was tall, at 1.85 meters, and his gold chain was thick, appearing ostentatious. The gold dust rubbed onto his neck from the chain made him even more so.\n\n\"Where's the merchandise?\"\n\nZhou Ze clasped his hands behind his back, his fingers interlaced slightly. There were only three people here, and taking them all down wouldn't be a problem. But what to do with them afterward? Handing them over to the police would expose him, wouldn't it?\n\nShould he execute them himself? \"In the name of the moon, I shall destroy you\"? That didn't seem right either. With his sensitive identity, killing indiscriminately might lead to a backlash similar to saving people indiscriminately. He wasn't willing to try it lightly.\n\n\"Brother Xu is as straightforward as ever!\"\n\nThe fat man wiped his mouth, then reached out and patted Zhou Ze's shoulder.\n\nZhou Ze's mouth twitched. He took a deep breath, suppressing the urge to swat away the fat man's greasy, large hand.\n\n\"Come, it's here!\"\n\nThe fat man made an inviting gesture and led Zhou Ze to a small storeroom in the backyard.\n\nUpon entering, Zhou Ze's pupils contracted sharply.\n\nA mountain of merchandise piled high, covered with black oilcloth.\n\nZhou Ze had never done anything illegal before, but he knew that with so much merchandise, according to the law, he would be shot hundreds of times over. He’d get a stomach ache from all the bullets.\n\n\"It's not just Tongcheng, is it?\" Zhou Ze really wanted to ask, \"Did you guys just rob a warlord from the Golden Triangle?\"\n\n\"Brother Xu, of course. Tongcheng is too small. This batch of merchandise will eventually use Tongcheng as a springboard and flow into Shanghai,\" the fat man said, stretching. \"This time, let's hurry up and move the merchandise. We'll make a lot of money.\"\n\nZhou Ze reached out and touched his forehead, saying with difficulty, \"It'll be hard to move it all in a short time, right?\"\n\nAfter all, it wasn't like selling cabbage, where you'd ride a tricycle and shout through a loudspeaker.\n\n\"Don't worry about that, Brother Xu. We just need to distribute this batch to our people below. Although the profit isn't as high as selling it ourselves, it's fast, and the sales are guaranteed. Once this batch is done, we'll get another batch,\" the fat man said dismissively.\n\nXu Le, oh Xu Le, you've even built a drug trafficking network. You're truly amazing…\n\nSuch a big boss was bludgeoned to death by that idiot for three hundred yuan!\n\n\"Brother Xu, take a look. How's the quality of this merchandise?\"\n\nAs the fat man spoke, he lifted the oilcloth.\n\nThen, Zhou Ze's face showed surprise.\n\nBecause what he saw wasn't a mountain of drugs, but stacks of books and CDs.\n\nCould they be hidden between the books?\n\n\"Brother Xu, thanks to your classmate, this batch of merchandise was easy to get. These CDs are all hot movies still showing in theaters. I even specially copied a few more adult films into them. These pirated books and romance novels are also popular works on the market; plus, there are the twenty sequels to Bai Jie that you specially wrote, totaling two million characters. Many of our contacts have already pre-ordered this batch. We won't have trouble selling them.\"\n\n\"The merchandise you're talking about is all this?\" Zhou Ze asked the fat man.\n\n\"Yeah?\" the fat man blinked. \"Just this.\"\n\nDisappointment,\n\nGreat disappointment,\n\nAnd extreme disappointment.\n\nAt the same time, he felt shame.\n\nXu Le was Xu Le after all. For the sales of these pirated items, he had even continued writing the story of Bai Jie himself.\n\nAnd he had written two million characters of sequels.\n\nHow idle was he…\n\n\"How much can I get out of this?\" Zhou Ze asked. \"I plan to withdraw.\"\n\nThere should be capital invested in a joint venture.\n\n\"What? Brother Xu, you plan to withdraw?\" the fat man asked, surprised. \"We're just waiting to make money now, and you want to withdraw?\"\n\n\"Yes, this matter doesn't align with my core values. I don't want to do it anymore.\"\n\nZhou Ze said very seriously. He didn't want to take any risks, especially before he got his current life sorted out. He didn't want to get involved in any potential whirlpools.\n\n\"…\" the fat man.\n\n\"…\" the man in the military coat.\n\n\"Brother Xu has high awareness. I admire that. For the initial investment, Brother Xu contributed…\"\n\nThe fat man held out four fingers and said, \"Twenty thousand yuan.\"\n\n\"Twenty thousand it is. Give me the money, and the rest has nothing to do with me,\" Zhou Ze said, too lazy to haggle. Having twenty thousand yuan would solve his immediate urgent need.\n\n\"Alright, I have twenty thousand yuan here,\" the fat man nodded and went to get the money.\n\nAbout fifteen minutes later, Zhou Ze, with twenty thousand yuan in his pocket, hailed a ride-hailing car and headed back to the city.\n\nHe didn't rush back to the bookstore. Instead, he went to the appliance market and spent over ten thousand yuan on a freezer. This type of freezer was generally used by businesses to store ingredients and meat, and it was considered a relatively high-end model. Zhou Ze didn't begrudge the expense, as he would be sleeping in it from now on. He was afraid of cheap ones causing problems.\n\nThe shopkeeper was very enthusiastic and sent a small truck to deliver the freezer directly to Zhou Ze's… bookstore entrance.\n\nAfter the driver and Zhou Ze moved the freezer into the bookstore, the driver seemed surprised.\n\n\"Boss, you need a freezer to run a bookstore?\" the driver asked.\n\nZhou Ze handed him a cigarette. \"Business is tough. I plan to do some part-time seafood sales.\"\n\nThe driver took the cigarette and left. After all, the goods had been delivered, and he didn't need to worry about anything else.\n\nThere was a small second floor in the bookstore, which Xu Le had originally used to store extra books. After Zhou Ze cleaned it up, he placed the freezer there. Looking at his \"new bed,\" Zhou Ze felt much more at ease.\n\nComing down from the second floor, Zhou Ze noticed someone in his bookstore. It wasn't a customer, but his \"wife.\"\n\nDr. Lin was flipping through a magazine. Seeing Zhou Ze come down, she asked with some confusion, \"What were you busy with upstairs?\"\n\n\"Organizing inventory,\" Zhou Ze replied perfunctorily.\n\n\"I'm off work,\" Dr. Lin said.\n\n\"Mm.\" Off work, but you still won't sleep with me…\n\n\"That girl has woken up,\" Dr. Lin said, looking pointedly at Zhou Ze. \"Her father wants to treat our department to dinner at Tongcheng Grand Hotel. You should come too.\"\n\n\"What am I going there for?\"\n\n\"After the girl woke up, she kept calling for 'Uncle',\" Dr. Lin asked Zhou Ze with some curiosity, \"Did you know her before?\"\n\n\"Even when people are unconscious, they can still sense things, right?\" Zhou Ze continued to bluff. \"When I saved her, she might have been able to feel it.\"\n\n\"Are you going?\" Dr. Lin asked.\n\n\"No,\" Zhou Ze shook his head. \"I'm not hungry. I have no appetite at all.\"\n\nDr. Lin nodded, not pressing further. She seemed ready to leave, but as she reached the bookstore entrance, she stopped. \"Are you going home tonight?\"\n\nThe familiar old question had resurfaced.\n\nIf I go home, you still won't sleep with me…\n\nSo, Zhou Ze answered decisively:\n\n\"I'm not going back. I've been a bit busy lately.\"\n\nYes, even though business at the shop had grown as cold as an iced latte.\n\nDr. Lin hesitated, didn't insist, and took her car keys out of her pocket, preparing to leave.\n\nAt that moment,\n\nWith a \"clang,\"\n\nDr. Lin turned around and saw her \"husband\" had collapsed onto a bookshelf, sending books scattering all over the floor.\n\n\"What's wrong?\" Dr. Lin immediately went over to check on Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze felt his vision blurring, his focus becoming difficult. His chest heaved, and his legs felt weak, as if he had stepped on cotton and completely lost his balance.\n\n\"Fainted from hunger…\"\n\nZhou Ze replied.\n\nHe\n\nhadn't eaten in days.\n\n————————、\n\nFive days since the book was published, second place on the new book charts for the same period!\n\nIn the supernatural category, except for the monthly ticket list, which we can't be on without being available for purchase, we're number one on all other charts!\n\nYesterday, daily sales on Qidian were second place!
