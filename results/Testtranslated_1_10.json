    "content": "Zhou Ze scooped up a handful of water and splashed it on his face. He slowly raised his head, looking at his reflection in the mirror. He looked a bit haggard. As an emergency room doctor, this haggardness seemed to be standard issue.\n\n\"Dr. Zhou, a new patient is arriving soon. They seem to have fallen from upstairs. We're not sure if it was suicide!\" Nurse Wang Ya called out from the doorway of the men's restroom.\n\n\"Got it, I'm coming right out,\" Zhou Ze replied. He then pulled out a tissue to dry the water droplets and started to walk out.\n\nThe ambulance soon pulled into the hospital. Lying on the gurney was an old man dressed in a grey Tang suit. The old man was coughing continuously, occasionally spitting out bloody foam and fragments of spleen. His entire body was covered in bloodstains.\n\nZhou Ze rushed over, pushing the gurney while observing the patient's condition. He shouted to those ahead, \"Prepare surgical instruments, quickly!\"\n\nThe patient's condition was very bad.\n\n\"I... I... I don't want to die.\"\n\nThe old man's eyes were open, and he looked at Zhou Ze, who was closest to him.\n\n\"Don't worry, you'll be alright. We'll help you. You won't die.\"\n\nMost critically ill patients would say such things at this time. Truly calm people facing death were few and far between. As a doctor, this was not the time to analyze the patient's condition and tell them their chances of survival. What the patient needed at this moment was psychological comfort.\n\n\"No... no... down there... down there... down there is really too terrifying...\"\n\nThe old man suddenly grabbed Zhou Ze's wrist, looking at him with a solemn expression.\n\n\"Calm down, relax. Your life won't be in danger.\" Although his wrist ached, Zhou Ze did not try to break free.\n\n\"I don't want to... I don't want to go down anymore... they... they found me... I... they found me...\"\n\n\"Hiss...\" Zhou Ze suddenly felt a sharp pain in his wrist.\n\n\"Dr. Zhou, your hand!\" the nurse beside him immediately exclaimed.\n\nThe old man's fingernails were very long, and for some reason, they were black. They were a transparent black, like amber, not like dirt had accumulated on them.\n\nAt this moment, the old man's fingernails had dug into the flesh of Zhou Ze's wrist.\n\n\"I'm not going down... not going down... not going down... haha... cough, cough, cough...\"\n\nThe old man suddenly sat up and coughed violently. Then, his body trembled, and the hand that was holding Zhou Ze's wrist fell away. The old man became still.\n\n\"Prepare for resuscitation!\" Zhou Ze shouted.\n\nThe old man was pushed into the emergency room. Doctors and nurses began to administer resuscitation measures, and the defibrillator was also ready.\n\n\"Dr. Zhou, let me tend to your wound,\" Wang Ya said as she approached.\n\nAs doctors, they were not really worried about this minor flesh wound. Their primary concern was the possibility that the old man had other diseases that could put them at risk of occupational exposure. After all, there was a lot of blood on the old man's hands, and no one knew if he had any infectious diseases.\n\nSome illnesses, once contracted, could ruin one's life.\n\nAfter the wound was bandaged, another doctor came out of the emergency room and shook his head at Zhou Ze.\n\nThis meant that the patient could not be saved.\n\nEveryone felt a bit dejected, but for them, this was a common occurrence, and they would quickly adjust.\n\n\"Dr. Zhou, let's get you checked,\" Wang Ya suggested.\n\n\"No, I have some matters to attend to tonight,\" Zhou Ze replied, shaking his head. He directly went to the locker room to change his clothes, then drove away from the hospital parking lot.\n\nAs soon as his car drove under the Jianghai Avenue elevated road, Zhou Ze's phone rang.\n\n\"Hello, this is Zhou Ze.\"\n\n\"Dr. Zhou, the children are all waiting for you.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, Principal Wu. A patient caused a delay. I'll be there shortly. Please ask the children to wait a little longer.\"\n\n\"Okay, okay.\" The other person quickly hung up.\n\nZhou Ze glanced at the time again. It was already 8:30 PM, and the children at the orphanage usually went to bed very early.\n\nThe red light turned green, and Zhou Ze stepped on the accelerator.\n\n\"BEEP!!!!!\"\n\nAt this very moment,\n\nA heavy truck ran a red light and sped over. Zhou Ze only had time to turn his head to look at the blinding high beams outside the car window,\n\nThen,\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nThe world spun.\n\nZhou Ze's small car, in front of the heavy truck, was like a delicate piece of paper, directly blown away. It tumbled several times in the air before crashing to the ground.\n\n...\n\n\"Ugh...\"\n\nZhou Ze woke up.\n\nHe found that he couldn't move his body at all, as if he were trapped.\n\nAt the same time, his eyes couldn't open. He knew he had been in a car accident, a very serious one. Out of professional duty, he wanted to check his injuries right away, but he couldn't move.\n\nAround him, he could hear the sounds of other vehicles passing by and various horns honking.\n\nAm I still at the accident scene?\n\nAm I still in the car?\n\nZhou Ze thought to himself.\n\nSoon,\n\nThe siren of a police car could be heard, as well as the sound of a fire truck.\n\nFinally, the ambulance siren, which sounded familiar to Zhou Ze, approached.\n\nZhou Ze sensed that his body was being moved. The temperature nearby was slightly high, indicating that they were cutting apart his car to rescue him.\n\nZhou Ze had participated in many such rescue operations and was familiar with some of the procedures.\n\nWhat a shame. The cake in my trunk and the orphanage children's Children's Day party will have to be canceled.\n\n\"Dr. Zhou!\"\n\nA familiar voice called out.\n\nIt should be Dr. Chen from the hospital.\n\nZhou Ze sighed in his heart. At least he had saved his life. This could be considered a stroke of bad luck.\n\nHe could hear the voices of several nurses nearby, but because of the loud noise, Zhou Ze couldn't hear them clearly.\n\nBut then, a word from Dr. Chen sent Zhou Ze's heart plummeting into the abyss!\n\n\"Dr. Zhou has lost vital signs.\"\n\nNo,\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nI'm not dead yet!\n\nI'm not dead!!\n\nZhou Ze shouted frantically in his heart!\n\nHe wasn't dead. He was still conscious. He wasn't dead!\n\nNext, Zhou Ze felt someone performing CPR on him. He felt those heavy compressions, but he couldn't open his eyes or speak.\n\nHe wasn't dead.\n\nHe hoped they would realize he wasn't dead soon!\n\nBut after a flurry of activity,\n\nZhou Ze heard the crying of a few nurses he knew.\n\nDr. Chen punched the door of a nearby car in grief.\n\nHey!\n\nDon't give up!\n\nPlease don't give up!\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nI must be in a state of apparent death,\n\nBlood loss?\n\nSevere injuries?\n\nBut I'm really not dead!\n\nI should still be breathing. I should still have a heartbeat!\n\nZhou Ze roared in his mind.\n\nBut then, he felt himself being lifted onto a stretcher, presumably being taken into an ambulance.\n\nImmediately after, he heard the sound of the ambulance starting.\n\nThe nurses in the carriage were still crying.\n\nBut their crying was particularly jarring to Zhou Ze's ears.\n\nHe wasn't dead.\n\nWhy are they crying!\n\nWhy are they crying!\n\nLook at me again,\n\nLook at me again,\n\nCheck again,\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nThe ambulance stopped,\n\nAnd then, Zhou Ze heard the hospital leadership speaking:\n\n\"Little Zhou is gone just like that?\"\n\n\"The car accident was very serious. Dr. Zhou was severely injured and lost too much blood. He has been confirmed dead.\"\n\n\"Really? Is he gone just like that?\" another vice-director couldn't believe it.\n\n\"Little Zhou is gone,\" said a department head. \"I just checked again.\"\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nYou incompetent doctors!\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nYou scoundrels!\n\nScoundrels!\n\nZhou Ze cursed inwardly. At this moment, the people around him were no longer his colleagues, friends, leaders, or elders.\n\nThey actually believed he was dead.\n\nBut could dead people still hear and perceive?\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nYou scoundrels,\n\nBastards,\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nSave me!\n\nSave me!\n\nThe gurney began to be pushed, and the surroundings became quiet, with the temperature gradually decreasing.\n\n\"Xiao Ya, don't be too sad. The director said the hospital will hold a memorial service for Dr. Zhou tomorrow.\"\n\n\"Sister Suqin, I just find it hard to believe that someone is gone just like that. Dr. Zhou was such a good person. How could he be gone like this?\"\n\n\"Life is unpredictable. Just try to look on the bright side.\"\n\nAfter the two nurses finished speaking, they left.\n\nThe surroundings,\n\nWere empty.\n\nThat chilling coldness,\n\nWas so clear.\n\nZhou Ze kept struggling, trying to resist. He wanted to wake up. He desperately wanted to make a sound.\n\nBut his current feeling was like being sleep-paralyzed. No matter how hard he tried, his body wouldn't obey him.\n\nFinally,\n\nHe gave up in despair.\n\nHe was tired,\n\nAnd exhausted.\n\nHe knew where he was.\n\nIn the hospital's,\n\nMorgue.\n\n...\n\nWhen Zhou Ze \"woke up\" again, he felt a faint coolness on his face, and a stinging sensation was also clear.\n\n\"Is the makeup done yet?\" someone asked from nearby.\n\n\"Don't rush. Give me a moment. He was so mangled in the accident, makeup isn't that quick.\"\n\n\"The hospital is urging us. They need to send him to the memorial service soon.\"\n\n\"Why don't you do it?\"\n\nThe mortician seemed a bit angry and applied more force while doing the makeup. Of course, their clients were dead. The dead wouldn't feel pain, nor would they complain. They just needed to show results to the living.\n\nZhou Ze no longer had the strength to struggle.\n\nHe just lay there quietly,\n\nEnduring the stinging sensation of the makeup brush pressing down on his face.\n\nFinally,\n\nThe makeup was finished.\n\n\"Alright, let them come in. Our work is done.\"\n\nZhou Ze felt his clothes being changed. Then, he was pushed out, and the hospital orderly lifted him and placed him in a soft, cramped space.\n\nThis,\n\nShould be an ice coffin.\n\nThen, all the surrounding noise was instantly isolated.\n\nThe lid should have been closed.\n\nShaking,\n\nWobbling,\n\nBumping...\n\nAfter an unknown amount of time, Zhou Ze finally heard sounds again. The lid of the ice coffin should have been opened.\n\nWhat greeted his ears,\n\nWas funeral music.\n\nThe director was speaking into a microphone, praising him and expressing his condolences.\n\nThen came the vice-director and other department heads.\n\nAround him,\n\nHe could hear the sound of footsteps from time to time.\n\nSome people walked past quietly, taking one last look at him.\n\nSome even tried to call out to him a few times, with a choked voice.\n\nThis was viewing the remains.\n\nViewing,\n\nMy remains!\n\nI'm not dead,\n\nI'm really not dead,\n\nI'm not dead yet!\n\nNot dead!\n\nZhou Ze wailed inwardly.\n\nHe began to try again,\n\nBut he still couldn't.\n\nHe could only hear, and feel,\n\nBut he couldn't speak,\n\nNor could he open his eyes.\n\nEveryone believed he was dead,\n\nBut he knew himself,\n\nHe wasn't dead yet!\n\nThe children from the orphanage also came and cried beside him.\n\nTheir crying was very sincere because Zhou Ze himself was a child from an orphanage. As a result, after starting his career, most of his salary was donated to the orphanage. The car accident this time was because he was rushing back to the orphanage to spend Children's Day with the children.\n\n\"Little Zhou, rest in peace. You died on duty. You have no family, but the hospital will give the compensation to the orphanage. Don't worry.\" The vice-director stood beside Zhou Ze and said.\n\nAfterward,\n\nZhou Ze felt himself being sealed off again. The lid of the ice coffin should have been closed again.\n\nThen there was more bumping,\n\nFinally, it stopped.\n\nThe lid of the ice coffin was opened again.\n\nThe surroundings were quiet, with occasional human voices, but not noisy.\n\nTwo people, one holding his shoulders and the other holding his legs, lifted him up and placed him on another cold shelf, seemingly made of steel plates.\n\nThese two people were very skilled, extremely skilled.\n\nAround him, he could faintly hear sounds of crying.\n\nAt first, Zhou Ze couldn't discern where he had arrived again,\n\nBut at this moment,\n\nHe suddenly understood.\n\nBastards!\n\nThey sent him to the crematorium!\n\nThey want to burn him!\n\nI'm not dead, you bastards!\n\nDamn your ancestors!\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nI'm not dead yet!\n\nDon't cremate me,\n\nDon't cremate me!\n\nI'm really not dead yet!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nYou bunch of beasts,\n\nMongrels!\n\nSons of bitches!!!!!\n\nThis time, Zhou Ze was the most frantic, the most insane.\n\nHe knew,\n\nOnce he was cremated,\n\nThere would be no turning back!\n\nHe would face death directly!\n\nA complete end!\n\nHe was unwilling. He was truly unwilling. He was not even thirty years old. He was not married. He had no children. He still had his life. He still had a long road ahead!\n\n\"Mom, I just saw this uncle's hand move.\" A little girl's timid voice sounded nearby.\n\n\"Slap!\" A small slap landed.\n\n\"Don't talk nonsense. I'll deal with you when we get back.\" The girl's mother reprimanded her.\n\nZhou Ze despaired,\n\nBecause no matter how much he struggled,\n\nOr how much he roared in his heart,\n\nPeople outside could not perceive it.\n\nHe was placed on the conveyor belt.\n\nThe machine started.\n\nHe was being pushed forward.\n\nHe knew what he was about to face,\n\nAnd because of that, he was filled with immense fear!\n\nNo,\n\nNo,\n\nNo!\n\nI'm not dead, I'm really not dead!\n\nDon't burn me!\n\nDon't burn me!\n\nNo one could hear his cries.\n\nThey were only responsible for being sad,\n\nFor being upset,\n\nFor completing the process,\n\nThen going home for dinner and continuing tomorrow.\n\nFinally,\n\nZhou Ze felt himself being pushed into a narrow space filled with the smell of grease.\n\nImmediately after,\n\nSticky liquid was sprayed onto his body.\n\nHe knew what it was.\n\nIt was gasoline.\n\nThen,\n\n\"Sizzle...\"\n\nHot!\n\nVery hot!\n\nPain,\n\nIntense burning pain!\n\nFire,\n\nFire,\n\nA raging fire,\n\nFire everywhere...",

    "content": "cold,\n\n\n\nSo cold...\n\n\n\nZhou Ze didn't know why it was so cold here.\n\n\n\nHe walked on a secluded path. On both sides of the path, he was filled with flowers, without any romantic and beautiful atmosphere. The flowers were full of laughter, like ridicule, or like a spectator.\n\n\n\nFlowers open to the other shore, and people go to rebirth;\n\n\n\nZhou Cheng remembered that his last memory was fire, fire, and the terrifying flames completely swallowed himself, and the heart-pounding heat temperature baked himself into ashes\n\n\n\nBut in the eyes,\n\n\n\nHe came here\n\n\n\nThere are actually many people on this road.\n\n\n\nThere is an old man,\n\n\n\nHave children,\n\n\n\nThere are also young and middle-aged people.\n\n\n\nThere are men and women,\n\n\n\nEveryone wears different clothes\n\n\n\nSome people wear very simple clothes, some people wear big and purple clothes, with overly divided cheeks on their faces\n\n\n\nEveryone was walking on tiptoe,\n\n\n\nNo one said anything,\n\n\n\nNo one made any other sounds.\n\n\n\nOnly the occasional \"scrub\" sole friction sound left\n\n\n\nZhou Ze was also walking numbly with everyone. He was constantly looking back and looking back, and he realized where he had come.\n\n\n\nHe is already dead;\n\n\n\nAnd here,\n\n\n\nIt's a landlord\n\n\n\nHere is the world of the dead and the fate of the dead.\n\n\n\n  Own,\n\n\n\nFinally, I'm still dead\n\n\n\nHe didn't know what to do, nor did he know what choice he should make.\n\n\n\nHe doesn't want to die, and people don't want to die, but in this place, he has no idea what to do. He is confused and helpless\n\n\n\n\"Yaah……………………………………………………………………”\n\n\n\nThe cool little tunes are transmitted from afar.\n\n\n\nZhou Ze glanced over and saw the red flowers coming from afar, while others around him were all familiar with it. He continued to tiptoe his feet and walked forward.\n\n\n\nAfter getting closer, Zhou Ze saw clearly that the flowers were peach blossom papers. Along the way, there was a group of women, standing in a team, holding the papers, and walking gracefully\n\n\n\nThey are tall and have a stylish body. They are all wearing purple cheongsams and walking. The flesh color of their thighs is constantly exposed. The confusing charm makes people palpitations.\n\n\n\nWomen wear hair buns, meticulous, and even their steps are neat, as if they are the most outstanding singing and dancing groups in the world. Moreover, they have been practicing for more than a hundred years.\n\n\n\nThey are walking,\n\n\n\nThey are moving forward,\n\n\n\nFrom one end of the little one to the other,\n\n\n\nBy chance,\n\n\n\nPassed in front of Zhou Ze\n\n\n\nElaborate makeup, snow-white skin, and the cool and cold tuning that made me hummed create an old Shanghai atmosphere with a hazy rain.Every woman wears a bell on her wrist, which is of different colors and sizes. She holds her snow-white wrists, which is even more dazzling.\n\n\n\n  pity,\n\n\n\nThey are not walking in the commercial pedestrian area of South Street.\n\n\n\nIt is not the golden and brilliant high-end clubhouse,\n\n\n\nThey stepped on the Huangquan Road,\n\n\n\nWhat is plundering is the sea of flowers on the other side.\n\n\n\nThey were blindly obedient, the latter stared at the former,\n\n\n\nThe former,\n\n\n\n  The eyes are empty\n\n\n\nWhen the last woman passed by Zhou Ze,\n\n\n\nThe woman suddenly turned her head and looked at Zhou Ze\n\n\n\nThe world is the most beautiful.\n\n\n\n  now,\n\n\n\nJump directly to another extreme\n\n\n\n  fear\n\n\n\nOf course it's terrifying\n\n\n\n  Nausea\n\n\n\nOf course I feel disgusted\n\n\n\nBut Zhou Ze is already a dead person, and people will be scared to death, but what about ghosts\n\n\n\nThe woman looked at Zhou Ze,\n\n\n\nZhou Ze was also looking at the woman.\n\n\n\nThe two have short eyes and a little intertwined. Then, the woman continued to walk forward, her figure was swaying, and her back was circling, and the tightness of the cheongsam outlined her beautiful figure very vividly.\n\n\n\n\"Where are you... going?\"\n\n\n\nZhou Ze subconsciously followed the woman forward, and then left the original team.\n\n\n\nAnd the little boy murmured the walking people,\n\n\n\nThere was no one looking here, they seemed to be unable to think or perceive, and Zhou Ze seemed to be the difference among them.\n\n\n\nA group of women, smoking step by step, kept walking forward, murmuring, as if purity was like ice;\n\n\n\nThe originally suppressed environment makes people feel more reckless because of their appearance.\n\n\n\nZhou Ze continued to walk forward, and he followed them\n\n\n\nThen, Zhou Ze saw them walking into the pool in front one by one.\n\n\n\nThe pool is not big.\n\n\n\nLike a lens,\n\n\n\nTheir entry seemed to break this silence and blow a layer of ripples\n\n\n\nThe women in the front were no longer in the water, and the women behind were also following.\n\n\n\nZhou Ze walked to the pool. He did not go down with him, he just stood on the side and watched.\n\n\n\nEverything here is a place that is absolutely unfamiliar to him. Anyone, a single child, only has one chance to come in, and after entering, he can't go out again.\n\n\n\nSomething floated out in the middle of the pond water.\n\n\n\nIt's a double handed,\n\n\n\n  A red hands are white,\n\n\n\n  Detailed green pills,\n\n\n\nThe two hands danced gracefully, like a dream, making people's eyes instantly attracted to it and could no longer move.\n\n\n\nBeauty is attractive, and this kind of beauty is fascinating\n\n\n\nZhou Ze slowly showed an intoxicated look in his eyes, and he couldn't help but start moving forward without even knowing thatFirst, the foot,\n\n\n\nThe tightness followed by the knees,\n\n\n\nNext to the waist,\n\n\n\nIn the end,\n\n\n\nThe water surface is not in the neck.\n\n\n\nEven the whole person entered the pond\n\n\n\nThe water in the pond is not cold, it is even very warm, the water surface is clear, and it is very visible. When you enter here, you will feel no pain of suffocation.\n\n\n\nZhou Ze saw the women who were holding paper in the previous team. They were moving under the water, and they continued to move forward.\n\n\n\nAnd the closest location to you,\n\n\n\nThere is a woman in red clothes. She is standing under the water, but her hands are dancing on the water surface.\n\n\n\nZhou Ze began to approach this red woman.\n\n\n\nNot because of beauty,\n\n\n\nIt is not because of other false influences.\n\n\n\nBut because this woman seems to have an indecipherable magic that makes you approach, get close, and make you unable to help yourself.\n\n\n\n  finally,\n\n\n\nZhou Ze approached her.\n\n\n\nAnd her hands slowly closed off the water\n\n\n\nThe woman has long and dense hair, and she is dancing in the waves, making it difficult for people to see her face clearly\n\n\n\n\"Finally... wait for someone like this again...\"\n\n\n\nThe woman's voice is crisp, sweet and glutinous.\n\n\n\nCharming heart\n\n\n\nThe woman's beautiful hands stretched out and put them on Zhou Ze's shoulder. This action was very affectionate\n\n\n\n\"You... come and accompany me...\"\n\n\n\nNext moment,\n\n\n\nThe woman's hair began to scatter, and the long green silk began to blow around the face;\n\n\n\nThe beauty brushed her face, which seemed to be a very emotional thing, but then the woman's hair turned into the most imperfect steel cable in the world, and began to tie up her neck.\n\n\n\n\"You come and accompany me...\"\n\n\n\nThe hair is loose and no longer covered.\n\n\n\nThe woman's face finally appeared.\n\n\n\nShe has no face.\n\n\n\nHer face is flat, without any wavy, and without pleats. This is a very smooth face, enough to make thousands of girls jealous and admiration.\n\n\n\nBut she has no nose, no mouth, no eyes, and no ears.\n\n\n\nFaceless...female\n\n\n\nZhou Ze felt that he could not breathe, and his chest was about to explode. At the same time, his body seemed to be about to collapse.\n\n\n\nThe faceless woman's smile is still crisp and empty, but at this time, Zhou Ze's ears are like magical sounds.\n\n\n\nZhou Ze has come to sober.\n\n\n\nHe didn't know what it meant to be scattered in this way in this place.\n\n\n\nBut in short,\n\n\n\nIt won't be a good ending\n\n\n\n\"You are here... accompanying me...\"\n\n\n\nThe faceless girl continued to smile and her hair dancedZhou Ze subconsciously reached out his hand to grab the hair that was lying on his neck. He wanted to try hard to remove it.\n\n\n\nThe faceless girl felt very interesting about his overestimating her abilities.\n\n\n\n\"If you can't kill, don't slap it. Those who can walk here are spirits, and those with spirits. If I swallow them, I will have the chance to go back.\n\n\n\nYou make a reservation,\n\n\n\nWill become,\n\n\n\nMy offerings”\n\n\n\nBut just as the voice just fell,\n\n\n\nThe faceless woman exclaimed: \"How is it possible... impossible...\"\n\n\n\nZhou Ze's ten-finger nails began to grow slowly, with a dark and transparent color. In this pool, the strange light belonging to it was flashing. The color of this nail was exactly the same as the nail color of the old man who Zhou Ze treated before his death.\n\n\n\n\"Sizzy......izzy......\"\n\n\n\nThe sound of the hot water oil kettle is transmitted,\n\n\n\nThe faceless woman's hair was furious and melted and collapsed when she touched Zhou Ze's nails, while Zhou Ze's figure began to slowly retreat and began to remove the faceless woman's thigh.\n\n\n\n\"Impossible...Impossible...This is impossible...Why can you leave too\n\n\n\nWhy can you leave me too?\n\n\n\n  Why\n\n\n\n  Why\n\n\n\nThis is unfair\n\n\n\nUnfair”\n\n\n\nThe faceless woman used her hands to hold Zhou Ze.\n\n\n\nBut when Zhou Ze used his hands to remove the nails, once his nails touched the faceless hand, the faceless girl's originally perfect and flawless jade hand was burned out.\n\n\n\n\"Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh\n\n\n\nThe faceless woman screamed,\n\n\n\nThe body began to retreat, and since then, he has lost control of Zhou Ze.\n\n\n\nZhou Ze's body began to float up.\n\n\n\n Absent from the surface\n\n\n\n\"You can't escape...you will be...you will be caught back\n\n\n\nHere,\n\n\n\nIt is the fate of the deceased\n\n\n\nYou, you and them, even if they leave, will eventually be caught back.\"\n\n\n\nThe faceless woman shouted and roared hysterically below.\n\n\n\nShe was jealous,\n\n\n\nShe admires it,\n\n\n\nShe was crazy\n\n\n\nAnd the rising circumstance,\n\n\n\nAnd I slowly lost my own consciousness,\n\n\n\nThe Netherworld Yellow Spring Road,\n\n\n\nThe dazzling beauty of the other side of the shore,\n\n\n\nThe roar of the faceless woman,\n\n\n\nThe cheongsam woman's polite appointment,\n\n\n\nEverything,\n\n\n\nIt seems that they are all moving away from him......",

    "content": "On the streets at midnight,\n\nThe streetlights cast a yellow glow,\n\nPeople were uneasy,\n\nThe sky was cold, with a wind that cut like a knife.\n\nZhou Ze also felt the cold.\n\nHe didn't know where he was this time,\n\nBut he knew one thing,\n\nThis was... the human world.\n\nHe was dead, but he had returned.\n\nHe didn't know what he should do,\n\nHe could only mechanically and numbly keep walking forward.\n\nHe didn't have the time to think about many other things,\n\nLike the place he had just been to,\n\nLike the old man he had treated before the car accident,\n\nLike the faceless woman in the red dress in the pool,\n\nLike... his fingernails.\n\nHe had returned, which should have been a joyous occasion, but even when people occasionally walked by, no matter how hard he tried to greet them, no one could see or hear him.\n\nHe had been rejected and isolated by this world.\n\nThose who have never experienced \"solitary confinement\" will not understand the pain of being completely isolated, and for Zhou Ze, the entire world was his prison, with a black cloth thrown over it.\n\nNo one could see him,\n\nAnd no one could communicate with him.\n\nHe couldn't pick up anything tangible,\n\nEven the wind could easily blow through him.\n\nHe was so frail,\n\nThe phrase \"frail as a twig\" was truly not an exaggeration for him.\n\nMoreover, what shocked and horrified Zhou Ze the most was,\n\nHe could see faint light spots continuously scattering from his body,\n\nIn other words,\n\nHis body was slowly fading.\n\nPerhaps in another fifteen minutes, he would completely disappear, his last trace wiped away.\n\nHe didn't know how all this was happening, but he knew that his time was running out.\n\nAmong the Eight Immortals, Tieguai Li entered the body of a starving man who had fallen and died, thus becoming the figure later passed down.\n\nZhou Ze had also heard stories of ghosts \"borrowing corpses to return to life.\" He also wanted to borrow a corpse to return to life. He was cold and panicked, and he needed a physical body to attach himself to.\n\nHe wouldn't even mind who the person was.\n\nPeople are always selfish at such times, and Zhou Ze was no exception. Moreover, he really couldn't take it anymore.\n\nHowever, every time he prepared to approach someone, lights would appear on their heads and shoulders, directly preventing him from getting close, and he even got hurt, accelerating his \"evaporation.\"\n\nHe was getting tired and numb,\n\nHe was waiting for his end,\n\nWaiting for his conclusion.\n\nAs someone who had already died once, facing death again made him a little more at ease.\n\nMoreover, in Zhou Ze's current situation, the longer he remained here, the longer he would suffer.\n\n\"Creak...\"\n\nAhead, there was a shop with lights still on, it seemed to be a bookstore, as rows of bookshelves could be seen through the glass door.\n\nSomeone opened the door and walked out. It was a man wearing a hoodie and a hat, his face unclear. He looked around and then left in a hurry.\n\nOf course, the man couldn't see Zhou Ze standing less than five meters away from him.\n\nOriginally, Zhou Ze didn't feel anything unusual, but shortly after the man left, Zhou Ze suddenly sensed a warm aura from inside the bookstore.\n\nYes,\n\nA warm aura.\n\nThis warmth made Zhou Ze feel somewhat inexplicable, but he was like a person about to freeze to death who suddenly got a box of matches. Even if he knew the matches wouldn't save his life, he would still strike them to feel the last warmth before death.\n\nZhou Ze walked towards it, his body directly passing through the glass door of the bookstore and continuing inside, arriving behind the bookshelves.\n\nBehind the bookshelves,\n\nLay a person,\n\nA handsome young man, perhaps around twenty-three or twenty-four years old. Because the store had air conditioning, he wasn't wearing many clothes, just a long-sleeved shirt and a light jacket.\n\nHe was lying on the ground, but Zhou Ze sensed a warmth from him, like a pauper finding a bag of gold coins while walking on the street at night.\n\nThis attraction was irresistible, and Zhou Ze, at this moment, was not in a position to refuse!\n\nZhou Ze walked over and crouched down in front of the young man.\n\nHe didn't know how to enter the other's body, but he knew how to contact the warmth he needed.\n\nHe reached out a hand and placed it on the other's chest.\n\nZhou Ze saw his fingernails slowly embedding themselves into the other's body.\n\nThis was a very strange feeling. Unlike the \"gentle breeze\" that blew through his body when he walked on the road earlier, this was a fusion, a merging using his fingernails as a medium.\n\nSlowly, Zhou Ze's entire being began to enter the other's body, the two starting to overlap.\n\n...\n\n\"Xu Le! Wake up, wake up!\"\n\nZhou Ze was woken up by a shove, no, to be precise, he was \"disturbed.\" He opened his eyes and found himself sitting behind the bookstore counter, his hands previously resting on it.\n\n\"Hey, wake up!\"\n\nThe woman's voice was sharp and high-pitched, with a commanding tone.\n\nLooking up, Zhou Ze looked at the woman in front of him, no, to be precise, it should be a girl, about high school age. Although she was a young woman, she still had a bit of immaturity.\n\n\"Hey, Xu Le, what's your problem? You've gotten bold, haven't you? You want to give my parents and my sister a hard time, right? How dare you not come home all night!\n\nWho gave you the guts!\"\n\nXu Le?\n\nWho is that?\n\nZhou Ze spread his hands in confusion and found them smooth. His own hands used to have calluses from practicing with surgical instruments for a long time, but these hands did not.\n\n\"Hey, I'm talking to you!\"\n\nThe girl slapped the counter, looking furious.\n\nZhou Ze frowned slightly, stood up, and walked to the glass mirror by the shop door. He saw his reflection, a strange face. No, he had seen this face before; it was the face he saw last night.\n\nThis body,\n\nIs it mine now?\n\n\"Hey, what do you mean? My parents are angry, and my mom is throwing a tantrum at home. I'm telling you, you eat, drink, and use everything from my family now. What right do you, a live-in son-in-law, have to put on airs in my house?\n\nWho are you trying to impress!\n\nIf you dare not come home tonight again, believe it or not, I'll come over and slap you!\"\n\nThe girl raised her hand as if to slap him, but she suddenly realized that the man in front of her, her \"brother-in-law,\" wasn't dodging or begging for mercy as usual. Instead, the look in his eyes made her feel a little scared.\n\nAt this moment, she checked the time and found it was already 7:30.\n\n\"Hmph, I'm going to school first. I'll settle the score with you tonight!\"\n\nThe girl left huffily.\n\nZhou Ze slowly sat back down on the chair behind the counter. There was an old laptop there, and a mobile phone next to it.\n\nEven now, he hadn't fully adapted to the transition of his identity.\n\nHe was Zhou Ze, a well-known young surgeon in Tongcheng, and he was an orphan.\n\nAs a result,\n\nHe had now become this person.\n\nWhat was that girl just saying?\n\nI am... a live-in son-in-law?\n\nHave a wife?\n\nAnd in-laws?\n\nAnd judging by the attitude and tone of his \"sister-in-law\" when speaking to his \"brother-in-law\" earlier, this \"live-in son-in-law\" truly lived up to the noble traditions of ancient times.\n\nA live-in son-in-law, commonly known as a \"down-the-door\" son-in-law, was not only looked down upon by his wife's family but also by everyone around him. In ancient times, their status was almost the same as criminals. During the Han and Tang dynasties, those forced to serve on the frontiers often included these dependent sons-in-law.\n\nHe picked up his phone. The phone had no password set. He didn't know if the guy was lazy or afraid to set a password, but at least at this moment, it made it very easy for Zhou Ze to open his WeChat and QQ.\n\nThere were very few people in his QQ list, just a handful of junior high, high school, and college classmates, and then a \"family\" list with only one person, noted as \"wife.\"\n\nHe opened the chat history with her on QQ; it was empty.\n\nFine,\n\nZhou Ze opened WeChat and tried to find her. He found a woman noted as \"wife.\" There were replies here, mostly Xu Le asking things like what to eat tonight, what to prepare tonight, how much money it would cost to stock up, how much the bookstore had sold recently, how his health was, and a lot more.\n\nAnd the other party's replies were often perfunctory and cold,\n\nWith:\n\n\"Oh\"\n\n\"Mm\"\n\n\"Okay\"\n\nIn place of actual responses.\n\nZhou Ze put the phone aside. This interpersonal relationship was a bit complicated. He suddenly looked at his palm; his fingernails were no different from ordinary people.\n\nBut the old man he treated before the car accident, his escape from the faceless woman, and his entering this guy's body were all events where his fingernails played a crucial role.\n\nAs his thoughts willed it,\n\nAt this moment,\n\nZhou Ze found his fingernails slowly growing longer, becoming dark and translucent, with faint black mist swirling around them.\n\n\"Hoo...\"\n\nHe let out a long sigh,\n\nClosed his eyes,\n\nAnd opened them again,\n\nHis fingernails had returned to normal.\n\nFrom morning until noon, Zhou Ze sat there trying to adapt to his new identity and calm the discomfort brought about by the change in identity. He didn't even eat lunch, not knowing if he had forgotten or simply didn't feel hungry.\n\nThis was still Tongcheng. Zhou Ze's previous home was in Chongchuan District, but now he was in Gangzha District, not far away.\n\nIn the afternoon, Zhou Ze sighed and slowly stood up. He had to accept his fate.\n\nHe started trying to clean the bookshelves, figuring he should at least find something to do.\n\nThe old man who had choked him before his death had said, \"He's been discovered,\" and the faceless woman in hell had said, \"You'll be caught sooner or later.\" These words made Zhou Ze feel a sense of crisis.\n\nHis current state could be described as \"living precariously.\" Dying and coming back to life was a stroke of luck from heaven, so he cherished it. At least, until he fully understood the situation and gathered enough clues, he had to blend into this identity, preferably without causing too much of an anomaly, and without attracting the attention of those \"who wanted to catch him.\"\n\nThe business of this store was really bad. The decline of the traditional book market had been a long time coming, and this place wasn't located on a prime street right at the school gate.\n\nIt could only be said that \"Xu Le\" choosing to open a bookstore here, whether it could break even was a question.\n\nIt wasn't until three in the afternoon that the first customer of the day walked in.\n\nThe customer was browsing in the children's book section and had been doing so for a long time.\n\nZhou Ze waited for a while, then walked over and asked, \"What genre are you looking for?\"\n\nAlthough, Zhou Ze didn't understand either.\n\n\"Just looking around,\" the other person replied.\n\n\"Mm,\" Zhou Ze said nothing more. He hadn't yet integrated into the role of \"bookstore owner.\"\n\nBut at this moment,\n\nThe other person suddenly walked behind him and spoke softly:\n\n\"You really don't recognize me?\"\n\n\"What?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Last night, I hit you on the head with a baseball bat and robbed you.\n\nAnd I specifically checked.\n\nYou clearly had no breath then.\"",

    "content": "Zhou Ze froze. So, the reason he was able to use \"Xu Le's\" body for soul transference last night was because the man had just been killed?\n\nBecause the body was still warm, he could get in?\n\nThinking about it, he seemed really lucky.\n\nWithout any aversion, anger, or panic about his identity being exposed, Zhou Ze turned around and looked at the man behind him, who was around the same age.\n\nThe man froze.\n\nHe saw something unusual in Zhou Ze's eyes.\n\nIt was joy,\n\nIt was relief,\n\nEven,\n\nA little bit of admiration.\n\nAs a host, Zhou Ze knew the difficult situation he faced last night. If this guy hadn't happened to kill someone at that moment, he might have been scattered into ashes, never seeing the sun today.\n\n\"Sorry, I fainted last night, and my head felt very uncomfortable when I woke up this morning, like I'd been drinking. I forgot what happened yesterday,\" Zhou Ze explained casually.\n\nHe didn't think the other party would guess he was a soul inhabiting a borrowed body, unless the guy was out of his mind.\n\n\"You don't blame me?\" The other party pointed to his nose, asking somewhat absurdly, \"Even though I already told you I knocked you out yesterday?\"\n\n\"It's fine. I'm actually grateful you didn't take my phone and computer from the desk.\"\n\n\"That… I forgot,\" the man scratched his head. \"It's good that you're okay. This is the money I stole from you yesterday.\"\n\nThe man voluntarily took out three hundred yuan from his pocket, then fumbled for more and took out another eight hundred yuan.\n\n\"Eight hundred yuan is for your medical expenses, and three hundred was what I stole yesterday,\" the man pursed his lips. \"I lost my salary to the bookie gambling online yesterday, and I suddenly wanted some money when I passed by your bookstore. After I knocked you down, I found you weren't breathing, and I was scared to death.\n\nI ran home and didn't sleep all night, thinking the police would suddenly break down the door and arrest me for robbery and murder. I only took three hundred yuan. I feel so stupid, so not worth it.\"\n\nThe man reached out and patted Zhou Ze on the shoulder.\n\n\"Bro, it's great that you're not dead, really. I've been hanging around outside since this morning. I was waiting for someone to call the police, for the police to come. Then I saw you were still in the bookstore.\n\nYou know, at that moment, I almost knelt down and kowtowed to you. Thank you, you're resilient, you didn't die. Otherwise, I'd be finished. With all these cameras, if you had died, I definitely wouldn't have gotten away.\"\n\nZhou Ze looked at the eleven hundred yuan in his hand and then at the \"murderer\" in front of him, who was shedding tears and repenting. He felt the whole situation was very bizarre.\n\nTo be honest, \"Xu Le\" was dead. Because he died, Zhou Ze could take over. And because Zhou Ze took over, this guy in front of him was spared the crime of murder.\n\nBoth he and this guy benefited, only that Xu Le was the unlucky one.\n\n\"Okay, it's nothing now. Maybe I just got winded last night,\" Zhou Ze moved the man's hand off his shoulder. He was an emergency doctor before and had seen all sorts of filth. But in that extreme environment, he had developed a bit of germophobia. In fact, most emergency doctors have germophobia to varying degrees.\n\nIt was precisely because he had seen too much dirt and filth that he cherished \"cleanliness\" even more.\n\n\"You really don't blame me?\" the man asked, somewhat delighted.\n\n\"No, I don't blame you,\" Zhou Ze nodded. \"Go back to work and live your life properly. Don't make mistakes next time.\"\n\n\"Okay, thank you, bro. You're a good person.\"\n\nThe man nodded heavily and left the bookstore to welcome his \"new life.\"\n\nZhou Ze picked up his phone. He thought about it and decided he still had to report it. Not for the man killing him (Xu Le), but to report him for suspected theft.\n\nLet the police investigate. If the other party really had a criminal record or had done other bad things that the police caught him for, he deserved it.\n\nSince he had taken over someone else's body, he had to do something for this unlucky guy.\n\nAlthough, given the other party's sincere repentance and repayment of his medical expenses, his continued real-name reporting was indeed rather unscrupulous, like a son who had no sons.\n\nHowever, just as Zhou Ze dialed 110, when the voice on the other end of the line came through,\n\nAt the entrance of the shop,\n\nThe guy suddenly returned.\n\n\"One more thing...\" As soon as the other party walked in, he saw Zhou Ze holding his phone. He froze and directly pointed at Zhou Ze, \"You're still going to report it, aren't you!\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head.\n\n\"Let me see your phone, give it to me!\"\n\nZhou Ze could only continue to shake his head.\n\n\"You broke your promise, you bastard! I'll kill you! Let's see if you die this time!\"\n\nThe man instantly entered an agitated state. His mental state was probably a bit problematic, possibly due to the long-term gambling lifestyle and detachment from society. He tended to become extreme when stimulated by certain events.\n\nThe other party lunged over, Zhou Ze put down his phone and began to retreat.\n\nHe was a doctor in his previous life, not a boxer, nor did he practice martial arts. The body in this life was also a bit frail. When it came to fighting head-on, he was actually a little flustered.\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nThe man crashed into Zhou Ze, pinning him against the wall. At the same time, his hands began to tightly grip Zhou Ze's neck.\n\n\"I'll let you call the police! I'll let you call the police! I'll let you break your promise! Fine, I'll let you die, let you truly die! This time I'll strangle you to death and then let you bleed. Let's see if you die or not!\"\n\nThe man roared through clenched teeth.\n\nThe poor bookstore was deserted in the afternoon, let alone customers, there weren't even many pedestrians at the entrance.\n\nHis neck was almost numb, and he couldn't breathe. Zhou Ze struggled with all his might. During the struggle, Zhou Ze's fingernails suddenly turned black and grew longer.\n\nImmediately after, Zhou Ze hugged the man's back with both hands.\n\n\"Hiss...\"\n\nThe man suddenly shivered, rolled his eyes, and directly let go of Zhou Ze's neck. He stumbled back several steps, knocked over a few bookshelves, and then crashed to the ground.\n\nZhou Ze was able to escape. He reached out and rubbed his neck. He actually wasn't too panicked before, after all, his fingernails could even injure demons in hell. Dealing with an ordinary person should be no problem, right?\n\nBut Zhou Ze hadn't fully understood the reason and use of these fingernails. He only knew that he had been \"infected\" by the old man he had saved before his car accident.\n\nIt's true,\n\nGot athlete's foot, infected two people.\n\nHe walked forward, squatted down, and reached out to pat the man's face. Fortunately, he wasn't dead, he was still breathing. Zhou Ze shook his head, picked up his phone, and called the police again.\n\n...\n\nAfter finishing his statement at the police station, the police officer asked Zhou Ze to wait in the small hall because the matter Zhou Ze reported was a bit strange. He reported that the person who came to rob him but was knocked out by him was the \"murderer,\" and this murderer was now in the hospital. They had to wait for him to wake up for further confirmation.\n\nHowever, the police officer at least didn't handcuff Zhou Ze.\n\nA middle-aged man squatted next to Zhou Ze. The man's left hand was cuffed to the radiator.\n\n\"Bro, you're awesome! That guy was going to rob you and you knocked him out?\" The middle-aged man with a somewhat disheveled face rubbed his long, muddy bangs as he spoke. \"You really have that vibe from when I was young. You gotta beat these blind thieves to death!\"\n\n\"Hey, you behave yourself,\" a young police officer walked over and reprimanded him. \"How many times have you stolen electric bikes this winter?\n\nI say, the Lunar New Year is coming soon, can't you be more well-behaved? Or find a job and earn some money properly to send home? How old are you already?\"\n\n\"Working is impossible, never possible in this life. I don't know how to do business, only by stealing electric bike batteries can I sustain my life. Going to the detention center feels like going home.\n\nEveryone in there is a talent, they speak nicely, I really like it in there!\"\n\n\"Hmph.\" The young police officer didn't want to bother with this guy anymore and turned away.\n\n\"Bro, how was my speech just now?\" The greasy middle-aged man winked at Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Quite interesting,\" Zhou Ze smiled.\n\n\"Che Guevara is my idol, Che Guevara, do you know who that is?\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"Let me tell you, life should be...\" The greasy middle-aged man paused, then looked towards the entrance and said, \"Oh my god, so beautiful! Is that a police officer?\"\n\nZhou Ze turned his head to look. At the entrance, a woman wearing a blue down jacket and knee-high leather boots was walking towards them with another female police officer.\n\n\"Probably a police officer,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nThe woman was very beautiful, with a delicate figure and fair skin. Most importantly, the aura she exuded was the most attractive.\n\n\"But she's not wearing a police uniform,\" the greasy man retorted.\n\n\"Maybe she's undercover,\" Zhou Ze guessed.\n\n\"You're right, beautiful police flower, tsk tsk. It seems I'll have to come in more often,\" the greasy middle-aged man smacked his lips, looking unsatisfied. \"If I could marry her, I'd be willing to lose ten years of my life.\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. He dared not joke about lifespan or good fortune anymore.\n\n\"You don't agree?\" The greasy man, seeing Zhou Ze shake his head, said anxiously, \"You're just unobservant! A woman like this, losing ten years of life for her is definitely not a loss...\"\n\nAt this moment, the female police officer and the woman in boots walked up to Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Xu Le, your wife is here to pick you up. The investigation over there is clear, you're fine,\" the female police officer said, pointing at Zhou Ze.\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze.\n\n\"...\" The greasy middle-aged man.",

    "content": "\"Officer, excuse me, what's my wife's name again?\"\n\nThis thought only occurred to him for a moment. Zhou Ze wasn't that foolish, but he genuinely didn't know his \"wife's\" real name. In this era, people rarely used their real names for their QQ or WeChat IDs.\n\nThe greasy man, however, cast a mournful glance at Zhou Ze: \"Brother, you're not being fair. We agreed to be each other's broken-winged angels, remember?\"\n\nZhou Ze returned a helpless glance: \"I'm surprised too.\"\n\nThe greasy man lowered his head, sighed, and mumbled softly, \"My dumplings are delicious.\"\n\n\"Let's go.\"\n\nThe \"wife\" said coldly, then turned and walked directly outside.\n\nZhou Ze could only follow.\n\nShe was driving a Cayenne and got into the car directly.\n\nZhou Ze opened the car door and got into the passenger seat.\n\nTo be honest,\n\nit was a bit awkward.\n\nIf that unfortunate fellow Xu Le's marital and family life had been more normal, he wouldn't be feeling this awkward now. Facing his beautiful wife's concern, he could have found some excuse to explain, like feeling dizzy and forgetting some things.\n\nBut this woman clearly had the demeanor of an ice queen, seeming completely indifferent to him. Even picking him up from the police station felt like a routine chore.\n\n\"My dog got lost, and a security guard found it.\n\nI'm going to go pick it up.\"\n\nIt felt like that.\n\nThe woman started the car. She was quite young, likely around the same age as him (Xu Le), and several years younger than the original Zhou Ze.\n\nAs the car drove onto the elevated highway, the woman finally broke the silence:\n\n\"Are you okay?\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm fine,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\nThen,\n\nsilence again.\n\nThe woman felt her husband was unusually quiet today, but she had no intention of probing the reason.\n\nJust then, the woman's phone rang. She pressed the speakerphone, and a voice came from the car's stereo:\n\n\"Dr. Lin, there's just been a school bus collision on Qingnian Middle Road. Injured individuals are already being transported to our hospital. The director wants you back immediately.\"\n\nZhou Ze was slightly stunned.\n\nSo his wife was also a doctor.\n\nAnd,\n\nhis wife's surname was \"Lin.\"\n\n\"I know, I'll be right back,\" the woman said, hung up the phone, took the next exit from the elevated highway, and made a sharp turn at the traffic light, heading towards the hospital.\n\nShe didn't ask Zhou Ze if he wanted to be dropped off at home first or if he wanted to get out and hail a taxi himself. Instead, she drove straight into the Chongchuan District People's Hospital parking lot.\n\nHonestly, Zhou Ze was worried she might make him get out and take a taxi home. He imagined having to shamelessly ask:\n\n\"Wife, what's our home address again? I forgot.\"\n\nHe found that thought ridiculous.\n\nThe woman got out of the car, and Zhou Ze followed. The woman entered the hospital building and took the elevator. Zhou Ze also entered the elevator. The woman went into the women's locker room, and Zhou Ze...\n\nZhou Ze sat down on a bench in the hallway.\n\nJust then, the first batch of accident victims was brought in. One person was seriously injured, and five children also sustained moderate injuries.\n\nWatching his \"wife\" change into a white coat and busily begin treatment,\n\nZhou Ze could only sit on the bench and stare blankly.\n\nIt felt a bit like a mother bringing her son to work, and the son just watching from the side, playing.\n\nHowever,\n\nthe hospital's distinctive smell of disinfectant and the stuffy heat from the central air conditioning were actually quite nostalgic, a familiar feeling.\n\nUp ahead was the emergency room. The severely injured person, who was critically ill, appeared to be a girl.\n\nIt was a kindergarten school bus that had been involved in the accident. Watching the children cry out in pain on the operating table, the scene was indeed quite heart-wrenching.\n\nZhou Ze pursed his lips. At this time in the past, he would have already changed and joined the treatment efforts. He was the most famous young surgeon in Tongcheng, but now, he could only be a spectator.\n\nThis feeling was uncomfortable, but he could only endure it. Besides, this People's Hospital was considered the best hospital in Tongcheng on the surface, and its number and quality of doctors were beyond doubt. They should be able to handle it.\n\nSoon, the next batch of children was brought in. They had sustained minor injuries and only needed wound treatment or simple bandaging.\n\nTraffic police were stationed at the entrance of this floor. Some parents who had been notified had already arrived and were very agitated. However, allowing parents in at this moment might disrupt the treatment process, so they could only be stopped for now.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head, stood up, walked to the window at the far end of the corridor, raised the window frame, and took out a cigarette from his pocket. He smoked, and Xu Le also smoked, so it was convenient at this moment.\n\n\"Uncle, you can't smoke in the hospital,\"\n\nJust as he bit the cigarette butt in his mouth, a clear, childish female voice came from behind Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze turned around and saw a little girl in a lily dress standing behind him, pouting, looking at him indignantly.\n\n*Ahem,*\n\nThis was a bit awkward.\n\nZhou Ze could only put the cigarette away. Regardless of anything, being lectured by a little girl about public etiquette was somewhat embarrassing.\n\n\"Little one, aren't you cold wearing so little?\" Zhou Ze asked, bending down.\n\nThe little girl had delicate skin, a bit of baby fat on her face, and big eyes. She was very cute, like an enlarged Barbie doll.\n\n\"I'm not cold,\" the little girl shook her head. \"Uncle, you can't smoke in the hospital anymore.\"\n\n\"I know.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded seriously.\n\n\"Are you okay?\" Zhou Ze asked again.\n\n\"I'm fine. The other children are injured, and they're in a lot of pain.\"\n\nThe little girl turned sideways and looked at the other children behind her who were having their wounds bandaged. Most of them were crying, not necessarily from unbearable pain, but because one person was crying, and then others followed suit.\n\nThe nurses were treating wounds while also trying to soothe the children.\n\nThe parents, temporarily held back by the traffic police outside, were making noise and yelling outside.\n\nIn short,\n\nthis floor felt chaotic.\n\n\"Then you're truly lucky,\" Zhou Ze sighed.\n\nThe little girl had no scars on her at all.\n\n\"Mhm, I sat in the last row, so I'm fine,\" the little girl nodded, then voluntarily ran over to comfort her classmates. She looked here, then there, and encouraged and consoled them.\n\nA very sensible and strong child.\n\nZhou Ze turned around and subconsciously took out his cigarette again, but then put it back.\n\nAs he walked back to the bench to sit down, three nurses and two doctors came out of the emergency room.\n\nOne male doctor and one female doctor. The female doctor was his wife.\n\n\"It's alright, we did our best,\" the male doctor said, reaching out to pat Zhou Ze's wife's shoulder to comfort her.\n\nAs her husband,\n\nZhou Ze was sitting right there,\n\nbut he didn't resent this scene...\n\nThe scoundrel Xu Le had left him such a complicated mess – a live-in son-in-law, an extremely ill-tempered younger sister-in-law, and equally bad-tempered in-laws.\n\nZhou Ze wished his wife would have an affair, leave him, and divorce him so he could be alone and peaceful.\n\nWho, after being resurrected and entering a new body, would want to deal with the complexities of a modern urban son-in-law's life?\n\nHowever, what surprised Zhou Ze was that his wife actually reached out and blocked the other doctor's inappropriate hand, pointing at him and saying:\n\n\"This is my husband.\"\n\nHer words lacked any warmth or affection. They were simple, blunt, as if she were saying, \"This is the husky we keep at home.\"\n\n\"Oh, hello, sir,\" the male doctor said, his face a little awkward. No matter what, trying to flirt with someone's wife in front of them always felt a bit lacking in confidence.\n\nZhou Ze smiled and greeted him. It seemed his wife was quite virtuous... but he couldn't feel happy about it. It wasn't about any cuckold complex,\n\nbut simply, how good it would be if life were simpler.\n\n\"I'll go check on the other side. The other children have been treated and should be fine. You should go back with your husband and rest early,\" the male doctor said and walked away.\n\nDr. Lin then sat down on the bench next to Zhou Ze. She took off her mask, removed her gloves, and dropped them on the floor.\n\nZhou Ze saw her eyes were a little red, and she was biting her lip. Clearly, she was upset, which meant the seriously injured child hadn't been saved.\n\nShe looked quite pitiful in this state.\n\nZhou Ze began to understand Xu Le a little. This live-in son-in-law at least earned more than his peers. His in-laws having better conditions was a given, and then there was this Dr. Lin, who was indeed very beautiful.\n\n\"Don't take it to heart. You'll experience more in the future. Just seek peace of mind,\"\n\nZhou Ze said comfortingly from the side as someone with more experience. His psychological resilience was naturally much stronger than his \"wife's.\"\n\n\"Shut up.\"\n\nThe woman replied with those two words. If Zhou Ze, in his original capacity as a senior, had said such a thing, it would have been genuine advice.\n\nBut Zhou Ze was now Xu Le, and saying this to Dr. Lin in his appearance was purely him speaking from a position of privilege without understanding.\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze shrugged and, in his heart, once again despised that Xu Le. Look how timid he was; his wife dared to tell him to shut up directly in public.\n\nDr. Lin, with red eyes, slowly stood up: \"I'm going to change. Let's go home.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" Zhou Ze nodded.\n\nAt this moment, two nurses pulled open the curtain of the emergency room, revealing the hospital bed inside. A small body lay on the bed, covered with a white sheet.\n\nZhou Ze glanced at it. He had seen many deceased people. In his years of practicing medicine, he had saved many, but there were also many patients who died before his eyes despite his inability to help.\n\n\"Dr. Lin, this is your husband, right?\" a young nurse asked playfully. They knew Dr. Lin was married, but unlike other female doctors' or nurses' boyfriends, Dr. Lin's husband had never shown up at the hospital.\n\nYou can't blame them for making a joke even when facing death. It's like asking someone who goes to Tibet once and posts on WeChat saying their soul has been purified and they're so moved and devout to do that for ten years if they were staying there; they wouldn't be able to handle it, it's unrealistic.\n\n\"Yes,\" Dr. Lin replied with a nod. At this moment, her emotions had calmed down a bit.\n\n\"Then you two should go back quickly. Maybe you have some activities planned for when you get back, right?\n\nI'm telling you, our Dr. Lin really loves children. You should hurry home...\"\n\n\"Damn!\"\n\n\"...\" The young nurse.\n\nZhou Ze saw the edge of a lily dress peeking out from under the white sheet. His mind went blank, and he suddenly realized that the little girl he had just seen, who was completely unharmed,\n\nshe wasn't human!",

    "content": "\"Tsk,\"\n\n  After that outburst,\n\n  The two young nurses were flustered, and Doctor Lin was also taken aback.\n\n  It was simply too blunt and crude.\n\n  Zhou Ze offered no explanation and directly reached out to lift the white cloth covering the girl's head.\n\n  It was her, it was indeed her!\n\n  No wonder she hadn't been injured at all earlier,\n\n  Not even a single scratch on her body.\n\n  This wasn't due to luck from sitting in the back row.\n\n  In reality,\n\n  She was the most severely injured among all the children. The doctor had been desperately trying to save her.\n\n  Her soul had already drifted out, yet she was unaware. She was still reminding herself not to smoke in public, and she even went to comfort classmates who had minor injuries.\n\n  In fact,\n\n  Those children couldn't see her at all.\n\n  In the entire hospital,\n\n  The only person who could see her\n\n  Was Zhou Ze!\n\n  \"She's dead?\" Zhou Ze asked, his gaze scanning the surroundings.\n\n  \"Xu Le?\" Doctor Lin looked at her husband. She couldn't be bothered with his recent profanity because she noticed her husband was acting rather strangely.\n\n  \"She's not dead yet! Continue the rescue, keep resuscitating her!\"\n\n  Zhou Ze suddenly grabbed Doctor Lin's arm and pulled her over, shouting,\n\n  \"The rescue window hasn't closed yet, she still has a chance to wake up. Keep resuscitating her!\"\n\n  \"Sir, sir!\"\n\n  The two nurses saw Zhou Ze grabbing Doctor Lin so roughly and immediately stepped forward to pull Zhou Ze away. In their eyes, Doctor Lin's husband seemed inexplicable and even displayed signs of domestic violence.\n\n  Zhou Ze pushed the two nurses aside and released his grip, murmuring,\n\n  \"Where are you, where are you, where exactly are you!\"\n\n  Zhou Ze rushed out, running, searching.\n\n  Just a moment ago, the girl's soul had been wandering among the children, comforting them. Now, its whereabouts were unknown.\n\n  Had she already gone to hell?\n\n  Was she dead?\n\n  Was it too late?\n\n  Zhou Ze felt a sense of bewilderment. He didn't know why he was so agitated, nor why he was so anxious.\n\n  Perhaps it was because of his profession; it was his duty to treat any patient who had a chance of survival. Moreover, that kind and resilient girl had interacted with him just now.\n\n  \"Uncle, are you looking for me?\"\n\n  The familiar child's voice sounded behind Zhou Ze. Zhou Ze immediately turned around and saw the little girl again.\n\n  However, the little girl's body was not as solid as before; she had become semi-transparent.\n\n  \"Uncle, I'm a little cold,\" the little girl squatted down, hugging herself. \"I went to ask the nurses for a piece of clothing, but they ignored me. Do they hate me? Am I very annoying?\"\n\n  Small specks of light continuously emanated from the little girl. Zhou Ze had seen this scene before; it had happened to him back then.\n\n  \"Xu Le, come back with me!\"\n\n  Doctor Lin arrived at this moment.\n\n  The little girl turned her head to look behind her.\n\n  \"Don't look!\"\n\n  Zhou Ze stepped forward, reaching out to cover the little girl's eyes. No one knew what would happen if she saw her own body lying on the hospital bed.\n\n  Would she break down?\n\n  Would she realize she was dead and instantly dissipate?\n\n  When Zhou Ze's hand touched the little girl's body, his fingernails felt slightly warm. They didn't grow longer or turn black, but Zhou Ze perceived them as very hot. Simultaneously, the little girl's body began to twist, transforming into a halo that wrapped around Zhou Ze's fingertips. This light was clearly invisible to everyone else around.\n\n  \"Get out of the way, she can still be saved!\" Zhou Ze rushed towards the hospital bed again.\n\n  \"Xu Le!\" Doctor Lin's chest heaved. The deceased was gone. She didn't know why her husband was still ranting like a madman. Furthermore, her husband had studied civil engineering and had no connection to medicine whatsoever.\n\n  This time, when Zhou Ze charged forward, the two young nurses didn't dare to stop him. Zhou Ze lifted the white cloth and placed his hands on the girl's chest.\n\n  Yes, this was how he had come back to life back then.\n\n  Your soul has left,\n\n  It can go back in.\n\n  You can live!\n\n  Seeing all the light from his fingertips enter the girl's body, Zhou Ze began performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation, pressing down on her chest with his hands clasped together.\n\n  \"Wake up!\"\n\n  \"Wake up!\"\n\n  The two nurses dared not approach and looked towards Doctor Lin.\n\n  \"She's dead.\"\n\n  Doctor Lin walked over to Zhou Ze and said.\n\n  \"The golden hour for rescue hasn't passed yet, I've been keeping track of the time,\" Zhou Ze shouted while continuing to press down. \"She can live, she can live!\"\n\n  Doctor Lin pursed her lips, reached out, pushed Zhou Ze aside, and then began pressing on the girl's chest with her own hands.\n\n  \"Your force is too great; she has injuries. Ah Chun, reattach the equipment and continue the rescue.\"\n\n  Zhou Ze was pushed aside but didn't get angry. He just continued to stare at the little girl on the hospital bed.\n\n  The only fortunate thing was that the parents were likely stopped by traffic police, and with so many children making noise outside, no one noticed what was happening here.\n\n  Doctor Lin continued pressing, sweat beading on her forehead. She didn't know why she was indulging in this madness with this man, but for some reason, she saw a hint of something unusual in his eyes.\n\n  And this man was her husband, yet today, she couldn't quite figure him out.\n\n  The equipment was reconnected, but the display screen still showed a flat line.\n\n  The two nurses stood by, feeling somewhat lost.\n\n  Couldn't bring her back?\n\n  Even if he returned her soul,\n\n  He couldn't save her?\n\n  A feeling of loss permeated Zhou Ze's heart.\n\n  \"Beep... beep... beep...\"\n\n  Just then,\n\n  The once flat line suddenly showed fluctuations.\n\n  Doctor Lin stared at the display screen in shock.\n\n  This,\n\n  Was a medical miracle?\n\n  ……………………\n\n  It was evening by the time they drove back home from the hospital. Zhou Ze sat in the passenger seat, with Doctor Lin driving. They remained silent.\n\n  Silence was probably the standard for their marital relationship. However, it was usually Xu Le who tried to break the silence. Today, it was Doctor Lin.\n\n  \"Did you study medicine?\"\n\n  \"No.\"\n\n  \"Your technique just now was very professional.\" Doctor Lin could tell.\n\n  \"I received some training when I was getting my driver's license,\" Zhou Ze made up a casual excuse.\n\n  \"But you don't have a driver's license,\" Doctor Lin frowned slightly.\n\n  \"........\" Zhou Ze.\n\n  Well, Zhou Ze silently despised Xu Le again in his heart.\n\n  Doctor Lin didn't intend to probe further, only saying, \"Thank you for your persistence today.\"\n\n  \"No need to thank me,\" Zhou Ze waved his hand. As... at least in his heart, he still considered himself a doctor. Saving a patient didn't require thanks.\n\n  The girl hadn't woken up yet; she was still in a coma, but there was hope.\n\n  \"Thank you on behalf of that girl,\" Doctor Lin picked up her phone and glanced at it. \"It's almost eight o'clock. My parents are waiting for us to go home for dinner.\"\n\n  Parents?\n\n  Zhou Ze suddenly felt a headache coming on.\n\n  Was he going to meet his in-laws now?\n\n  The car drove into a high-end residential area. Tongcheng was close to Shanghai, and geographically, it was at opposite ends of the Yangtze River estuary. Although it wasn't as extremely expensive as Shanghai, the property prices weren't cheap either.\n\n  Doctor Lin parked the car and walked inside. Zhou Ze followed behind her. They entered the elevator and then came out together. Doctor Lin used her key to open a door.\n\n  The house was nicely decorated, with a duplex layout. In fact, one could tell from the car Doctor Lin was driving that the Lin family's financial situation was likely quite good.\n\n  Of course, his current identity as a \"live-in son-in-law\" was also evidence. After all, one wouldn't be able to recruit a live-in son-in-law without some family wealth and backing.\n\n  On the living room sofa sat an elderly man with half-white hair, wearing a sweater, watching television. It was a rebroadcast of the evening news, and he was watching it with great interest.\n\n  Even when his daughter and son-in-law returned, he only glanced at them and said nothing.\n\n  \"Wan Qiu, you're back.\"\n\n  The kitchen door was pushed open, and the mother-in-law poked her head out. Perhaps Doctor Lin and her younger sister inherited their heights from their mother. The mother-in-law was tall, and though a bit stout now, she was still the type who could dominate the \"Sunset Red\" square and capture the hearts of countless elderly gentlemen.\n\n  Pay attention, take notes, highlight important points.\n\n  Zhou Ze finally knew his wife's full name: Lin Wan Qiu.\n\n  The mother-in-law's gaze swept over Zhou Ze, and her expression clearly faltered for a moment.\n\n  \"Old man, it's time to eat. Wan Qiu is back.\"\n\n  \"Finally, we can eat,\" the younger sister came out from the study. She waved a fist at Zhou Ze, then pursed her lips, signaling Zhou Ze to pay attention to her parents.\n\n  This little gesture was quite good. Although this girl was a bit headstrong, she wasn't too excessive.\n\n  Zhou Ze went to the bathroom to wash his hands. Lin Wan Qiu also came in while he was washing. They both rubbed their hands with hand sanitizer, carefully.\n\n  Lin Wan Qiu looked at Zhou Ze a couple more times, then rinsed her hands and walked into the living room.\n\n  Zhou Ze also finished washing his hands, dried them with a paper towel, and walked out of the bathroom.\n\n  Everyone was seated, and Zhou Ze sat down on the chair next to Lin Wan Qiu.\n\n  The mother-in-law, with a stern expression, served the rice one by one, placing it in front of Zhou Ze with noticeably more force.\n\n  Fortunately,\n\n  She didn't deliberately skip serving me rice.\n\n  Zhou Ze thought to himself.\n\n  \"Xu Le, do you think we treat you badly?\" the mother-in-law spoke before they even started eating.\n\n  \"Quite well,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\n  \"Then why didn't you come home last night, were you showing us a bad attitude........\"\n\n  \"Mom, let's eat. He had some issues at his shop, he told me,\" Lin Wan Qiu interjected.\n\n  The mother-in-law and father-in-law exchanged glances, somewhat surprised that their eldest daughter was actually speaking up for this son-in-law. This made them a little uncomfortable, and they momentarily forgot to continue their scolding.\n\n  The younger sister watching from the side was also a bit surprised. Her older sister usually didn't care much about this so-called brother-in-law. Was the sun rising from the west today?\n\n  \"Let's eat,\" the father-in-law picked up his chopsticks and gestured. \"You eat too.\" The father-in-law specifically pointed at Zhou Ze with his chopsticks.\n\n  Well, this gesture was a bit impolite, but fortunately, it signaled that the matter from last night was over.\n\n  \"Wan Qiu, have some braised pork. Mom simmered it for a long time.\"\n\n  The mother-in-law put a piece of meat into the bowls of her elder and younger daughters, then hesitated before finally placing a piece of meat into her son-in-law's bowl as well.\n\n  Zhou Ze then realized he hadn't eaten anything all day. From possessing the body last night, through the morning and afternoon, he hadn't eaten.\n\n  He didn't stand on ceremony either.\n\n  He picked up the meat and put it in his mouth.\n\n  Immediately afterward,\n\n  Zhou Ze's expression stiffened.\n\n  An unexpectedly nauseating feeling surged from his core, and his stomach began to cramp violently.\n\n  \"Ugh...\" Zhou Ze retched directly, as if what he was eating was poison.\n\n  \"........\" Mother-in-law.\n\n  \"........\" Father-in-law.\n\n  The atmosphere at the dining table\n\n  Instantly plunged into an ice age.",

    "content": "\"Excuse me.\"\n\nZhou Ze raised his hand, indicating he wasn't doing it on purpose. It was incredibly embarrassing, especially given the unexplained disdain his in-laws had for \"Xu Le,\" their live-in son-in-law.\n\n\"Are you feeling unwell?\" Dr. Lin asked, putting down his chopsticks.\n\n\"I'm fine, I'm fine.\"\n\nZhou Ze picked up his chopsticks again and shoveled rice into his mouth.\n\nBut before he could even swallow,\n\nhis stomach cramped again, and a wave of intense nausea washed over him. It felt as though he were about to swallow not rice, but the son of rice, feces.\n\n\"Pfft...\"\n\nThis time,\n\nZhou Ze spat out the rice in his mouth,\n\nspraying it onto the faces of his father-in-law and mother-in-law, who were sitting opposite him.\n\nRice grains stuck to his father-in-law's glasses and hair.\n\nHis mother-in-law's pinned-up hair was also dotted with glistening white specks.\n\nWith a \"splat,\"\n\nthe chopsticks in his father-in-law's hand dropped. His face twitched, seemingly unable to process how to react to the situation.\n\nHis mother-in-law took a deep breath, her eyes burning with rage!\n\nThis was\n\ninsulting them when they were already being generous!\n\n\"Slap!\"\n\nHis mother-in-law pushed back her chair and stood up.\n\n\"Xu Le!\"\n\nHis mother-in-law, a retired head nurse, knew that even if someone was sick, they wouldn't vomit rice so dramatically. Moreover, looking at Xu Le, he didn't appear to be \"on death's door.\"\n\nHe was doing this deliberately,\n\nhe must be doing this deliberately!\n\nHe was rebelling!\n\nRebelling!\n\nZhou Ze clutched his chest and rushed out of the dining table into the bathroom. He flipped open the toilet lid and began retching violently.\n\nThis time, he even vomited bile, his mouth filled with bitterness.\n\nThis meal was clearly ruined.\n\nDr. Lin looked at Xu Le, who was still retching in the bathroom, and said to his younger sister,\n\n\"Xiao Yi, go make some noodles.\"\n\n\"Oh, okay.\"\n\nHis sister-in-law stuck out her tongue. She also felt her brother-in-law was going a bit too far today. She immediately left the table and went to the kitchen to prepare some dried noodles.\n\n\"Outrageous, that scoundrel!\"\n\nHis father-in-law slammed the table and took off his glasses, shaking them. Xu Le's father-in-law, a retired associate hospital director, was usually very particular about his dignified appearance. Today, his boundaries had been crossed.\n\n\"I'm going to ask that guy why he thinks we've wronged him! We didn't ask for a single penny of bride price when they got married, and we even funded that money-losing bookstore he opened. What have we ever done to wrong him!\"\n\nHis mother-in-law was about to head to the bathroom.\n\n\"Mom, let's just clean this up. He's not feeling well.\"\n\nDr. Lin began clearing away the untouched dishes from the table.\n\n\"He's like this and you're still protecting him?\" His mother-in-law, furious, pointed at her daughter and scolded her.\n\n\"What else can I do? Who was it that threatened to hang themselves to force me into marriage?\" Dr. Lin looked directly at her mother, her usually delicate face now looking remarkably resolute.\n\nHis mother-in-law was momentarily speechless. It was true, they were the ones who had forced their daughter into marriage. They were desperate to have grandchildren and had gone to great lengths to recruit Xu Le as a live-in son-in-law. Their reasoning at the time was simple: they only had two daughters, so they had no choice but to take in a live-in son-in-law, and the grandson would take their family name. Xu Le's parents were gone, and he was a college graduate, so he met their criteria.\n\n\"I'm not eating.\"\n\nHis father-in-law couldn't meet his daughter's gaze. He had been the one to make the final decision. Now, he realized he had indeed wronged his daughter. He stood up and returned to his study.\n\n\"Oh, old man, you have stomach problems!\" his mother-in-law called out anxiously.\n\n\"Mom, I'll bring Dad some noodles later.\"\n\nDr. Lin cleared the table and then walked towards the bathroom.\n\nHis mother-in-law watched her daughter's retreating back and finally said nothing more.\n\nPushing open the glass door of the bathroom, Dr. Lin saw Zhou Ze kneeling by the toilet, one hand gripping the toilet rim and the other clutching his chest.\n\n\"Are you not feeling well?\"\n\n\"I'm better.\" Zhou Ze replied. He had been fine before dinner, and he didn't know why he had become like this the moment he started eating.\n\n\"I've asked Xiao Yi to make some noodles. You can eat them later...\"\n\n\"Gag...\"\n\nJust the thought of noodles made Zhou Ze feel another wave of intense nausea, and he started retching again.\n\nLin Wanqiu frowned slightly.\n\n\"Do you want to go to the hospital?\"\n\n\"No, it's fine. I won't eat anymore.\"\n\nZhou Ze waved his hand, standing up with great effort. He went to the sink to rinse his mouth and wash his face.\n\nThis dinner was destined to end unhappily.\n\nHis parents-in-law and sister-in-law lived on the first floor, while Zhou Ze and Lin Wanqiu's bedroom was on the second floor.\n\nAfter cleaning himself up, Zhou Ze took a shower. Not knowing where his spare clothes were, he didn't change and went upstairs in his wet hair and still-damp clothes. As he reached the top of the stairs, he noticed Lin Wanqiu was showering in the upstairs bathroom.\n\nZhou Ze stood at the bathroom door for a while, watching her graceful figure reflected in the glass. He licked his lips lightly.\n\nPeople are most impulsive at times like these, and also most grateful.\n\n\"Thank you.\"\n\nZhou Ze murmured in his heart.\n\nThis was the first time in two days since his transmigration that Zhou Ze had given a thumbs-up to the unfortunate ghost, Xu Le.\n\nAlthough you left behind a very troublesome interpersonal situation, your wife is truly beautiful.\n\nWith a mix of fantasy, excitement, impatience, and expectation,\n\nZhou Ze pushed open the bedroom door,\n\nand then,\n\nZhou Ze's expression changed. He bit his lip,\n\nand in his heart, he dragged out the Xu Le he had just praised and proceeded to flay him alive a million times.\n\nThe bedroom was large.\n\nThere was a large bed.\n\nBeside the large bed,\n\nthere was also a futon!\n\nWhat this meant, even a fool would understand!\n\nWas that guy mentally ill?\n\nWas that guy an idiot?\n\nWhat was the point of being a live-in son-in-law like this?\n\nZhou Ze took three deep breaths and then silently lay down on the futon.\n\nSleep,\n\nno more fuss,\n\nno more thinking.\n\nHe would try to find some money to move out independently, and then, whether it was a divorce or something else, he would resolve this complicated relationship. He had many problems to face after his return to life.\n\nLin Wanqiu came out after her shower, wearing a blue pajama set that was a bit loose, making her look a little swamped in it.\n\nZhou Ze, lying on the futon, instinctively swallowed.\n\n\"Get up,\" Lin Wanqiu said.\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\n\"You always slept on the bed, and I slept on the futon,\" Lin Wanqiu said.\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze silently got up and got into the bed.\n\nLin Wanqiu turned off the lights and lay down on the futon.\n\nPerhaps, this was her compensation for not wanting to share a bed with Xu Le. She slept on the futon.\n\nZhou Ze sighed,\n\npreparing to sleep.\n\nHalf an hour later, he hadn't fallen asleep and rolled over.\n\nAn hour later, he hadn't fallen asleep and rolled over.\n\nEven after three hours, it was past midnight, and he still couldn't sleep.\n\nHis eyelids were heavy, but he just couldn't sleep.\n\nLin Wanqiu on the futon, however, was breathing steadily; she should have been asleep.\n\nZhou Ze swore it wasn't because a beautiful woman sleeping next to him was making him restless and unable to sleep.\n\nHe was very sleepy and tired, after all, so much had happened today.\n\nBut he just couldn't sleep.\n\nLying in bed, Zhou Ze simply opened his eyes and looked at his hands.\n\nToday, he had used these hands to save the little girl's life. Although the little girl hadn't woken up yet, her vital signs had returned, and she could be saved.\n\nWas this a special ability he gained after his trip to hell?\n\nOr,\n\nwas it something left behind by that old man when he grabbed his wrist before dying?\n\nHowever,\n\nit felt pretty good.\n\nAs a doctor, with these hands, how many lives could he save?\n\nThis was an ability that transcended medical techniques and understanding, an ability that could even elevate him to a level beyond Hua Tuo and Bian Que. Every practitioner in every profession hopes to surpass their predecessors one day. Perhaps it's not for money or profit, but a kind of... passion.\n\nBut at this very moment,\n\nZhou Ze suddenly felt a twitch in both his arms, and intense pain quickly struck.\n\n\"Hiss...\"\n\nZhou Ze gasped, curling up on the bed.\n\nBut the pain continued and was even escalating!\n\nZhou Ze was sweating profusely from the pain. He couldn't stand it anymore, so he got out of bed and left the bedroom.\n\nHe went into the bathroom. Without turning on the light, he sat on the toilet. At this moment, Zhou Ze saw that from his arms all the way to his fingernails, there were veins that looked like they were about to split open.\n\nThe pain originated from them, as if something was pounding at his bone marrow.\n\nDamn it,\n\nwhat in the world was going on!\n\nZhou Ze's face contorted.\n\nThis feeling was making him miserable, even making him have the impulse to grab a cleaver and chop off both his arms.\n\nIn a daze, he seemed to recall the scene of him lying in an ice coffin, about to be pushed into the crematorium.\n\nHe also seemed to recall snippets of him wandering aimlessly in hell towards his end.\n\nWas this a curse?\n\nWas this a punishment?\n\nWhy was I being punished?\n\nWhat did I do wrong?\n\nBecause I smuggled myself back?\n\nIs it because I'm not alive that heaven is punishing me?\n\nOr perhaps... because I used it to save someone today?\n\nYes, it must be for that reason.\n\nZhou Ze took a deep breath. Because he had used that ability to save someone, he had broken some rule and suffered a backlash?\n\nThen,\n\nif he were to go and kill that girl again now, would the pain stop?\n\nA wisp of dark mist began to gather in Zhou Ze's eyes, but he was completely unaware.\n\n\"Uncle, you can't smoke in the hospital.\"\n\nThe little girl's voice reappeared in Zhou Ze's mind.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head sharply.\n\nNo,\n\nI saved her, and I saved her!\n\nI don't regret it,\n\nI don't regret it!\n\n.........\n\n\"Mom, are you still not done?\"\n\n\"I just started. You can use the bathroom on the second floor.\"\n\n\"Alright.\"\n\nHis sister-in-law walked upstairs. She couldn't hold it any longer. The second-floor bathroom was dark, so she pushed the door open and walked in.\n\nAnd then,\n\nat this very moment,\n\nZhou Ze looked up at her.\n\nShe also looked at Zhou Ze.\n\nIn Zhou Ze's eyes, dark mist swirled, carrying immense power and deterrence. It was a gaze like that of a demon crawling out of hell, filled with resentment and madness.\n\n\"Ahhhhhhh!!!!\"\n\nHis sister-in-law screamed in terror,\n\nthen fell to the ground.\n\nShe looked at Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze was also looking at her.\n\nImmediately after, Zhou Ze noticed that under his sister-in-law's pajamas, it was wet, and there was an unpleasant liquid on the tiles...\n\nShe had been scared into peeing herself?",

Most people have had similar experiences.\n\nWhat's more, the sister-in-law encountered a ghost.\n\nLin Wanqiu came out of the bedroom and pulled her younger sister to her.\n\n\"What's wrong? What's wrong!\"\n\nHer father-in-law and mother-in-law also came up from the first floor. Seeing their younger daughter crying in her elder sister's arms, and then looking at Zhou Ze still sitting on the toilet.\n\n\"You good-for-nothing Xu Le, you've gone completely mad to even lay hands on my younger daughter!\"\n\nThe mother-in-law picked up the broom by the bathroom door and prepared to hit Xu Le.\n\nThe father-in-law was also angry, ready to go in and scold his scoundrel son-in-law.\n\nIt was understandable.\n\nSeeing this scene,\n\nEveryone would naturally jump to that conclusion.\n\nThe brother-in-law had gone berserk,\n\nAnd made an improper move on his sister-in-law.\n\nAfter all, as the saying goes, a brother-in-law has half of his [redacted] belonging to his brother-in-law.\n\n\"Dad, Mom, it was Xiao Yi who got scared when she went into the bathroom,\" Dr. Lin said.\n\nThe mother-in-law paused. She raised the broom but didn't know where to put it.\n\nThe father-in-law also stopped in his tracks, then awkwardly took a few steps back.\n\nDistracted by this, Zhou Ze suddenly realized that the veins on his arms had receded, and the intense pain had also disappeared.\n\nHe felt very tired and sleepy, wanting to sleep.\n\nHe stood up, preparing to leave the bathroom. As for his father-in-law and mother-in-law, Zhou Ze couldn't be bothered. He had no interest in cleaning up Xu Le's mess.\n\nHowever, as Zhou Ze stood up, his sister-in-law immediately trembled, shrinking further into her sister's embrace.\n\n\"Ah! Don't come near me! Don't come near me!\"\n\nZhou Ze frowned slightly, wondering what she had seen.\n\n\"What's going on!\" The mother-in-law, hands on her hips, asked her younger daughter. This didn't look like someone who was just scared. \"Xiao Yi, my darling, tell Mom what happened, did he... did he do something to you?\"\n\nThe sister-in-law was quite honest, and she knew she couldn't lie about such a matter, as it would have serious consequences.\n\n\"No, I came to use the toilet, and when I opened the door, I saw him sitting inside. It was so scary!\"\n\nAfter saying this courageously, the sister-in-law buried her head in her sister's arms again.\n\nAll right,\n\nIt was all a misunderstanding.\n\n\"You blockhead! You don't turn on the light when you use the toilet at night?\n\nDo you think my house is yours, being so stingy?\n\nCan't afford that bit of electricity!\n\nIf you had scared my daughter into having nightmares, how would you compensate...\"\n\nThe mother-in-law began to scold Zhou Ze, her finger almost poking his face.\n\nZhou Ze was very tired at this moment. When one is severely sleep-deprived, their temper tends to be very volatile. Moreover, Zhou Ze was already tired of Xu Le's troublesome family connections.\n\nIf they hadn't been sleeping separately,\n\nZhou Ze might not have reacted.\n\nNow that they even slept in separate beds,\n\nZhou Ze couldn't be bothered to endure the snobbery of his mother-in-law anymore.\n\n\"Slap!\"\n\nZhou Ze swatted away his mother-in-law's finger.\n\n\"Don't bother me.\"\n\nThe mother-in-law's eyes widened. She clearly couldn't believe that her usually timid son-in-law dared to speak to her like this.\n\n\"How dare you speak to your mother like that? Have you no manners!\" The father-in-law reprimanded him.\n\n\"If you want your daughter to be divorced and remarried, then keep lecturing me about manners!\"\n\nZhou Ze retorted directly, then pushed his father-in-law aside with his shoulder and walked back into the bedroom.\n\n\"Bang!\" he slammed the door shut with considerable force.\n\n\"Outrageous, outrageous!\" The father-in-law's chest heaved with anger.\n\nThe mother-in-law quickly went to her husband's side to rub his chest.\n\nBut neither of them dared to escalate the situation further,\n\nAfter all,\n\nWhat Zhou Ze had just said was quite intimidating to them.\n\nAlthough they didn't know what had gotten into their usually reticent son-in-law today, he was right. If their elder daughter got divorced, her next marriage would be her second, which would be bad for her reputation and their family's reputation.\n\nMoreover, in their opinion, a woman who remarries is less valuable and won't find a good match.\n\nIn fact, a person's character and their feudalistic thinking are truly not greatly influenced by their education or family background; it primarily depends on their own personal qualities.\n\nJust like Xu Le's parents-in-law at this moment, no matter how angry they were, they didn't dare to provoke their scoundrel son-in-law further, for fear that he would really fly into a rage and demand a divorce.\n\nZhou Ze lay on the bed, took a deep breath, closed his eyes, and intended to sleep. He was truly exhausted.\n\nAfter about fifteen minutes,\n\nZhou Ze heard a knock on the bedroom door:\n\n\"Xiao Yi is scared, I'll sleep with her tonight.\"\n\nIt was Lin Wanqiu's voice, and then she left.\n\nAs if you really would sleep with me...\n\n...\n\nThe next day at noon,\n\nThe father-in-law and mother-in-law were eating lunch.\n\n\"He went to the bookstore?\" the father-in-law asked the mother-in-law.\n\n\"He hasn't gotten up yet,\" the mother-in-law said resentfully.\n\n\"Disgraceful,\" the father-in-law commented.\n\n\"Exactly...\"\n\nAt this moment, the mother-in-law suddenly fell silent because she saw Zhou Ze walking down from upstairs. Zhou Ze's eyes were red, and he had severe bags under his eyes.\n\nThe atmosphere became somewhat tense.\n\nPerhaps because of what happened last night, Zhou Ze's status as a live-in son-in-law in the family had somewhat improved. At least, at this moment, his father-in-law and mother-in-law didn't say anything to provoke him.\n\nOf course, it was also because Zhou Ze looked like he could grab a knife and attack at any moment.\n\nHis gaze swept across the dining table.\n\nZhou Ze covered his chest with his hand.\n\nThe aroma of rice,\n\nThe aroma of meat,\n\nIt was disgusting.\n\nHe felt like vomiting again.\n\nZhou Ze walked out of the house, breathing in the slightly cool, fresh air outside, feeling a bit more comfortable.\n\nHis head felt a bit groggy, and Zhou Ze began to wander aimlessly through the streets. He needed to think about some things quietly, but his current state of extreme sleepiness yet inability to sleep made it difficult for him to truly calm down.\n\nIt was a struggle,\n\nIt was uncomfortable,\n\nLike walking out after staying up for two consecutive nights at an internet cafe, or like a middle schooler who hid under the covers reading novels all night and had to go to class the next morning.\n\nAs he walked, Zhou Ze suddenly stopped. The surroundings were somewhat familiar.\n\nThen he saw the sign ahead:\n\nTongcheng First Affiliated Hospital.\n\nHe had coincidentally walked back to his old workplace. Ha, perhaps it was because Tongcheng was too small.\n\nZhou Ze walked into the hospital, not to revisit old memories, but to try and get some sleeping pills.\n\nHe could endure not eating, at most he would drink more water; he could temporarily get by with just drinking water, but not sleeping was a prolonged torment.\n\nThe familiar hospital, the familiar work environment, Zhou Ze saw his photo on the memorial album at the entrance of the emergency department had turned a grayish-white.\n\nHe then unconsciously walked to his former office. His desk had been replaced. A middle-aged doctor with a face full of acne was sitting in his position. He glanced at the nameplate on the desk; the surname was Kang.\n\nHe let out a long sigh, with a hint of melancholy.\n\nZhou Ze temporarily forgot about getting sleeping pills. Perhaps this emotion of \"things have changed, but people remain\" had temporarily suppressed the torment of sleepiness, and Zhou Ze began to wander around the hospital.\n\nHe was reminiscing about the bits and pieces of his life there,\n\nHis work,\n\nHis life,\n\nAnd,\n\nHis past,\n\nOr rather, his previous life.\n\nHe couldn't go back, he really couldn't go back, Zhou Ze murmured to himself.\n\nThen, without realizing it, he had walked down the stairs and arrived at the basement level.\n\nHe stood still. Having worked as a doctor there for many years, he knew the layout of this floor.\n\nThere were some equipment storage rooms, and then, the morgue.\n\nHe remembered that he had once lain in the hospital morgue and had his makeup done by the embalmer.\n\nHe took a step forward again, heading towards the morgue.\n\nZhou Ze wanted to see the place where he had lain before. This was his own explanation for walking towards it, but in reality, it was a special feeling guiding him forward.\n\nAs he walked, Zhou Ze saw the door to the morgue. It had an electronic keypad lock. Coincidentally, Zhou Ze remembered the password. Other department doctors likely wouldn't have much interaction here, but Zhou Ze was previously in the emergency department. Patients brought to the emergency room were generally those with severe injuries or illnesses. Some couldn't be saved and had to be sent here for safekeeping.\n\nIn fact, this hospital also served as the police department's morgue. Unidentified or bodies that needed \"processing\" would be temporarily stored here. This was common practice in many places. If the local police department lacked facilities or sufficient forensic staff, bodies were often placed in the local funeral home or hospital.\n\nHe entered the password,\n\nThe lock opened immediately,\n\nZhou Ze walked in.\n\nA chill swept over him,\n\nNot the kind that tingles the skin,\n\nBut a special, chilling sensation that seemed to suppress the warmth within.\n\nIn the morgue, of course, there were bodies. This was the temporary resting place for the deceased.\n\nNormally, there should be an administrator on duty outside, but for some reason, Zhou Ze didn't see anyone when he walked in. Perhaps the person had stepped out for a break.\n\nZhou Ze walked among them. Several bodies were placed on cold stretchers, covered with white sheets. There was also a body wrapped in a patterned quilt from home. Judging by the silver hair visible on the deceased's head, it was likely an elderly grandmother.\n\nDue to his profession, Zhou Ze wasn't particularly afraid of corpses. Moreover, he was a ghost himself now.\n\nZhou Ze walked to the refrigerators, which were tiered drawers.\n\nThe refrigerators with bodies had labels indicating the deceased's name, gender, and other information.\n\nZhou Ze pulled open an empty refrigerator, reached inside, closed his eyes, and began to sense it. Gradually, he felt a sense of intoxication, as if only here could he find peace.\n\nAfter a moment of hesitation, Zhou Ze lay down inside.\n\n\"Creak...\"\n\nThe refrigerator was slowly pushed in, and finally closed.\n\nQuiet,\n\nCold,\n\nSilent.\n\nZhou Ze slowly closed his eyelids.\n\nSleepiness washed over him.\n\nHe had finally found the feeling of sleep,\n\nBut he couldn't sleep yet,\n\nBecause he didn't know,\n\nWho had just stood outside and pushed the refrigerator in for him...",

    "content": "Zhou Ze’s feet began to push outward from inside, intending to get himself out, but the sound of “ka-cha, ka-cha” came from outside, meaning the lock on the outside of the ice coffin had been secured.\n\nLocked in, unable to get out.\n\nFor a moment, Zhou Ze felt as if he was back to the scene of himself being placed in the cramped coffin.\n\nHowever, this time, Zhou Ze did not become manic or angry; he simply reached out and tapped the metal plate at his head:\n\n“Something up?”\n\nZhou Ze didn’t believe someone had come to push his ice coffin in and then lock it, unless that person was a mentally deranged lunatic, and Zhou Ze didn’t think his luck would be that bad.\n\nMoreover,\n\nWhen he entered the morgue, he had closed the door. A lunatic who knew the morgue door password?\n\nDo you believe it?\n\nTherefore, Zhou Ze could only assume that some entity had “helped” him, and helped him thoroughly.\n\nHowever, after this inquiry, it remained silent outside.\n\nZhou Ze simply ignored it, closed his eyes again, and prepared to get some good sleep.\n\nHe fell asleep quickly.\n\nAfter all, he hadn’t slept for two days, and there had been many events in these two days, accumulating a terrifying level of fatigue.\n\nEven if floods rage after my death,\n\nNo one can stop me from sleeping now.\n\n…\n\nHe didn’t know how long he slept. When Zhou Ze opened his eyes, he felt refreshed and regained his long-lost vigor. It was a pity his body was also frozen stiff.\n\nThe stiffness of his body was somewhat terrifying. Zhou Ze wriggled his body as much as possible in the narrow space. A series of “crisp cracking” sounds came out, so comfortable that he instinctively made a noise.\n\nAt this moment, Zhou Ze’s fingernails naturally grew longer and turned black, shimmering with an unusual luster. The stiffness of his body and the coldness within, which would be unbearable for an ordinary person, were slowly gathering towards his fingertips.\n\nThe entire process did not take long, but it made Zhou Ze no longer feel cold or uncomfortable.\n\nHe instinctively kicked again, and the ice coffin slid out naturally.\n\nThe lock,\n\nWas it unlocked?\n\nZhou Ze was a little surprised. He sat up from the steel plate, got down, and then pushed it back.\n\nThe clothes on his body were stiff, hanging on him like hard cardboard, giving him an extremely uncomfortable feeling. Zhou Ze’s gaze was scanning all around.\n\nThe morgue of the affiliated hospital was not large. Compared to the large hospitals in big cities, it even seemed a bit shy. However, there were still quite a few bodies stored there.\n\nZhou Ze didn’t know who had pushed him in earlier, and now it was indeed a bit difficult to find them.\n\nFortunately, since the other party had unlocked the lock while he was sleeping soundly, Zhou Ze didn’t intend to cause any more trouble here.\n\nHe walked towards the morgue door, intending to leave. However, as he passed the few beds covered with white cloth, Zhou Ze stopped.\n\nThose corpses covered with white cloth seemed unremarkable,\n\nEven the old woman wrapped in a floral quilt from home seemed unchanged.\n\nBut Zhou Ze still stopped,\n\nBecause he remembered that the old woman’s head and feet were in reversed positions.\n\nIt was impossible for the morgue attendant to run in while he was sleeping, do nothing else, and turn the old woman upside down.\n\nZhou Ze stood by the old woman and said:\n\n“If it’s you, if you don’t come out now, I’ll leave.”\n\nThe old woman pushing him in and locking him might have had malicious intent, but her silent help in unlocking the lock meant she didn’t want to harm him.\n\nPerhaps someone was about to come, and seeing an unlocked compartment, they might discover him.\n\nAfter all, whether these compartments were locked or not was very obvious from the outside.\n\nAfter waiting for half a minute with no abnormality, Zhou Ze decided not to wait any longer.\n\nJust as he was about to turn and leave, a sigh came from behind him.\n\nZhou Ze found this feeling repulsive,\n\nHesitant and coy,\n\nDespite being an old woman when she died, she put on such a coy demeanor.\n\nFine, age discrimination was indeed wrong, but normal people always had a slightly higher tolerance for beautiful female ghosts, which was human nature.\n\nIf Nie Xiaoqian had a face full of wrinkles and big yellow teeth, do you think Ning Caichen would still fall in love with her across the realms of life and death?\n\nZhou Ze turned around and looked behind him.\n\nAn old woman with silver hair was crouched there, holding a faded handkerchief and wiping her tears.\n\nBut ghosts do not have tears, so in Zhou Ze’s view, the old woman looked more like she was crying in vain.\n\n“Keep crying, I won’t disturb you.”\n\nZhou Ze prepared to leave.\n\nHe realized that he was ultimately a mortal, and even when looking at ghosts, he had some prejudice towards appearance.\n\n“Help me, I have money,” the old woman suddenly said.\n\n“En,” Zhou Ze replied. He was short of money.\n\nXu Le’s Alipay and WeChat combined had less than two hundred yuan, plus the thousand yuan returned by the “murderer,” meaning Zhou Ze’s total assets were less than thirteen hundred.\n\nHis house and savings from his previous life had likely been donated to an orphanage, so he was essentially alone.\n\n“My money is in the hidden compartment of my cabinet, a yellow-painted old cupboard. There are thirty thousand yuan, and also the dowry from my wedding, jade hairpins, and jade bracelets. I don’t know how much they are worth.\n\nI died in a hurry and didn’t have time to tell my sons. I’m afraid they won’t know.”\n\nZhou Ze nodded, “I’ll take a portion.”\n\nThe old woman showed a struggling expression but still nodded, “This is only right.”\n\nThe old woman knew that without an “anomaly” like Zhou Ze to relay the message, her sons might not be able to find the property she left behind.\n\n…\n\nAfter leaving the hospital, Zhou Ze took a taxi directly to Xingdong Town in Tongzhou District. It wasn't very far; Tongcheng Airport was located in this town.\n\nEarlier, at the hospital, Zhou Ze had inquired at the registration desk. The old woman had been brought to the hospital and died after unsuccessful rescue. Her family had then directly abandoned the deceased at the hospital, still owing the hospital medical fees.\n\nAbout half an hour later, Zhou Ze arrived in the town and found the village according to the old woman’s description.\n\nIt was a self-built two-story house, with a small brick room resembling a rural privy attached to the house.\n\nWhen Zhou Ze arrived, he saw several workers dismantling the house, the brick house, of course.\n\nZhou Ze walked over, offered a cigarette to a master craftsman, and asked, “The New Year is coming soon, and you’re still busy?”\n\n“Earn more money before the New Year, anyway, we’re all from the same village,” the bricklayer master craftsman was quite carefree.\n\n“What’s with this house?” Zhou Ze asked while looking inside. Two workers were already lifting the roof, and the bricks of the small room’s walls were being removed to be reused later. Inside the room, let alone the yellow-painted cupboard the old woman mentioned, there wasn’t even a small stool, it was empty.\n\n“His mother died. This house used to be lived in by his mother alone. Now they plan to tear it down and build a new kitchen,” the master craftsman leaned his head over, asking Zhou Ze to help him light his cigarette, smiling a bit shyly, “Look, the one who just walked by in front of the house is their eldest son.”\n\nZhou Ze looked over and saw that the man with white hair also had some bruises on his face.\n\n“There are five brothers. They started fighting over the money their mother left behind. These bricks will be unloaded later, and the other four will come to share.\n\nTell me, this world is different, isn’t it? Their mother’s body hasn’t even been claimed from the hospital yet, but the brothers are unwilling to pay the outstanding medical fees.”\n\n“What about the things in the old woman’s house?” Zhou Ze was concerned about this. From the old woman’s description, the thirty thousand yuan in the cupboard was the old woman’s lifetime savings, but those jade bracelets and hairpins were the truly valuable items. They should fetch several hundred thousand yuan if sold.\n\n“Sold to the scrap dealers. They were cleared out long ago. They were sold when the old woman was just admitted to the hospital,” the master craftsman took a deep drag of his cigarette, “I’m going back to work.”\n\nZhou Ze licked his lips with a mix of amusement and exasperation. This trip of his was a waste of time.\n\nThe things left by the old woman not only did he not get a share of, but her sons also couldn’t enjoy them. They could only be sold to some second-hand furniture dealer.\n\nZhou Ze was a bit annoyed. Not having money was truly a big problem. He was unwilling to cheat money with his abilities. Although it seemed simple and satisfying, last time he saved a girl, he almost died of pain last night. Who knows what problems would arise if he continued to mess around.\n\nWhether there are gods three feet above one’s head, Zhou Ze didn’t know.\n\nBut if one keeps digging three feet down, there is definitely hell, because he has been there.\n\nHe knew he was not human, and this was the human world. Moreover, the patient who died in front of him, how terrified he was when he shouted “I’ve been discovered” before his death, Zhou Ze remembered clearly.\n\nBut,\n\nMoney,\n\nZhou Ze wanted to grind the millstone,\n\nBut who would pay?\n\nZhou Ze needed money now. Let alone shedding the identity of a “son-in-law who lives with his wife’s family,”\n\nAt least he needed to buy himself an icebox or a large refrigerator, right?\n\nOtherwise, would he have to run to the hospital morgue every day to leech off the air conditioning?\n\nHe lit a cigarette with some frustration and took a deep drag, feeling so vexed.\n\nJust then, his phone rang in his pocket. Zhou Ze picked up the phone; it was an unknown number. He answered:\n\n“Hello,” Zhou Ze.\n\n“Brother, the goods have been delivered safely. When will you come to inspect them? The police are checking very strictly lately, and it wasn’t easy to get this batch of goods,” the person on the other end said in a hushed, cautious voice.\n\nZhou Ze slowly opened his mouth,\n\nMaking no sound,\n\nAt the same time,\n\nXu Le’s image suddenly soared in his mind.",

    "content": "With trepidation, unease, and a touch of secret glee and confusion, this was likely how Zhou Ze felt on the taxi ride to the outskirts of Tongcheng.\n\nHe was short on cash, very short, but he didn't have any big money. He didn't need big money anyway; at least, for now, it was useless.\n\nBecause he had died and come back to life, due to past entanglements and present troubles, he needed a sum of money to resolve them. After that, he would plan long-term, not indulge in extravagant living.\n\nFor example, leaving the Lin family. Although Lin Wanqiu was beautiful and elegant, he really couldn't be bothered to return to that home. They had no physical intimacy, and he hadn't truly enjoyed anything. Judging by appearances, Xu Le, that scoundrel, hadn't truly enjoyed anything either, so there was no sense of guilt or indebtedness.\n\nTherefore, saying \"goodbye\" carried no psychological pressure.\n\nBut to leave that home, he needed to make preparations. He needed a place to stay, and he needed to buy a slightly better quality freezer. Zhou Ze didn't dare to look for discarded freezers in the second-hand market. What if something went wrong, and he ended up sleeping inside and accidentally killed himself? That would be a huge loss!\n\nMoney!\n\nEven as a ghost, he needed money.\n\nBut listening to the way the person on the phone just now spoke to Xu Le made Zhou Ze uneasy again. Xu Le, with his identity as a modern urban parasite, so pathetic that he let his father-in-law and mother-in-law walk all over him, so pathetic that he slept in a separate room from his wife, turned out to be a hidden underworld boss?\n\nOkay, the contrast in this scenario was truly stimulating, and it fit the style of American dramas. Powerful figures always had a seemingly ordinary real-world identity.\n\nLike Spider-Man being a high school student, or Superman being a reporter for a newspaper.\n\nSo, how should he handle this situation?\n\nHow should he deal with that gang?\n\nZhou Ze didn't want his current identity to be \"tainted,\" because that would mean endless trouble. The police's pursuit of him in the real world was already something Xu Le couldn't easily handle, let alone the elder and the faceless woman who had shouted about people who \"will discover and catch you.\"\n\nIt gave him a headache and made him feel uncomfortable, but Zhou Ze still arrived at the abandoned small fertilizer plant.\n\nTwo people were squatting at the entrance of the fertilizer plant, one wearing a somewhat worn military overcoat, the other a cheap, poor-quality suit.\n\nThe two men squatted there, each with a cigarette in their mouth, puffing away.\n\nZhou Ze paid the fare, got out of the car. The men immediately stood up and walked over proactively.\n\n\"Our boss is waiting for you,\" the man in the military overcoat said in a deep voice.\n\nZhou Ze nodded and followed the man in the military overcoat inside. The man in the suit continued to squat, smoking, as if keeping watch.\n\nAfter entering, Zhou Ze saw a fat man with a gold chain and a shaved head sitting on a plastic chair, drinking by himself. Upon seeing Zhou Ze approach, the fat man immediately stood up.\n\n\"Brother Xu, you're finally here.\"\n\nThe fat man was large, standing at 1.85 meters. The gold chain was very thick, appearing ostentatious. The gold powder rubbed off on his neck from the chain made him even more flamboyant.\n\n\"Where's the merchandise?\"\n\nZhou Ze clasped his hands behind his back, his fingers interlaced slightly. There were only three people here, and taking them all down wouldn't be a problem, but what would he do afterward? Handing them over to the police would expose him as well, wouldn't it?\n\nDeal with them himself through private justice? Representing the moon to eliminate them? That didn't seem right either. Given his sensitive identity, if he were to kill people indiscriminately, it might trigger a backlash similar to saving people indiscriminately. He was unwilling to try that lightly.\n\n\"Brother Xu is as straightforward as ever!\"\n\nThe fat man wiped his mouth and then reached out to pat Zhou Ze on the shoulder.\n\nZhou Ze's mouth twitched. He took a deep breath, restraining himself from swatting away the fat man's greasy, large hand.\n\n\"Come, it's here!\"\n\nThe fat man made an inviting gesture and led Zhou Ze to a small storage room in the backyard.\n\nUpon entering,\n\nZhou Ze's pupils contracted sharply.\n\nA pile of merchandise stacked like a small mountain, covered with black oilcloth.\n\nZhou Ze had never done anything illegal before, but he knew that with such a large quantity of merchandise, according to the law, he would be shot hundreds of times. He could eat so many peanuts that his stomach would swell.\n\n\"Not just Tongcheng, right?\" Zhou Ze actually wanted to ask, \"Did you guys just rob a warlord from the Golden Triangle?\"\n\n\"Of course, Brother Xu. Tongcheng is too small. This batch of goods will ultimately flow into Shanghai, with Tongcheng as a springboard.\" The fat man stretched lazily. \"This time, let's hurry up and get rid of the goods. We'll make a lot of money.\"\n\nZhou Ze reached out and touched his forehead, saying with difficulty, \"It will be hard to move this much in a short time, right?\"\n\nAfter all, it wasn't like selling cabbage. You wouldn't ride a tricycle and shout through a loudspeaker.\n\n\"Don't worry about that, Brother Xu. We just need to distribute this batch to our subordinates. Although the profit isn't as high as selling it ourselves, it's fast, and the delivery is guaranteed. After this batch is done, we'll get another one.\" The fat man said dismissively.\n\nXu Le, oh Xu Le, you've even built a drug trafficking network. You're truly amazing...\n\nSuch a boss was actually clubbed to death by that idiot for three hundred yuan!\n\n\"Brother Xu, take a look. How's the quality of this batch?\"\n\nThe fat man said this and lifted the oilcloth covering.\n\nThen Zhou Ze's face showed surprise.\n\nBecause what he saw wasn't a mountain of drugs, but stacks of books and CDs.\n\nCould they be hidden between the books?\n\n\"Brother Xu, thanks to your classmate, getting this batch was easy. These CDs are all popular movies still showing on screens. I even copied a few more ***** into them. These pirated books and romance novels are also bestsellers in the market.\n\nAnd also, the twenty sequels to Bai Jie, written by you, Xu Ge, totaling two million characters. Many of our contacts have already pre-ordered this. There's no worry about not selling it.\"\n\n\"The merchandise you're talking about is just these?\" Zhou Ze asked the fat man.\n\n\"Yeah?\" The fat man was taken aback. \"Just these.\"\n\nDisappointment,\n\nGreat disappointment,\n\nAnd extreme disappointment.\n\nAt the same time, he felt ashamed.\n\nXu Le was Xu Le after all. For the best-selling pirated goods, he even wrote sequels to Bai Jie's story himself.\n\nAnd he wrote two million characters for the sequels.\n\nJust how idle was he...\n\n\"How much can I withdraw?\" Zhou Ze asked, \"I plan to withdraw.\"\n\nIf they were partners in business, there should be initial capital invested.\n\n\"What? Brother Xu, you plan to withdraw?\" The fat man was a little surprised. \"We're just waiting to make money now, and you want to withdraw?\"\n\n\"Yes, this matter doesn't align with my core values, and I don't want to do it anymore.\"\n\nZhou Ze said very seriously. He didn't want to take any risks, especially before sorting out his current life, and he didn't want to get involved in any potential whirlpools.\n\n\"...\" The fat man.\n\n\"...\" The man in the military overcoat.\n\n\"Brother Xu has high awareness, I admire that. For the initial stage, Brother Xu invested...\"\n\nThe fat man held up four fingers and said, \"Twenty thousand yuan.\"\n\n\"Twenty thousand it is. Give me the money, and what happens below has nothing to do with me.\" Zhou Ze was too lazy to argue. Having twenty thousand yuan would solve his immediate pressing needs.\n\n\"Alright, I have twenty thousand yuan here.\" The fat man nodded and went to get the money.\n\nAbout fifteen minutes later, Zhou Ze, with twenty thousand yuan in his pocket, hailed an online car-hailing service and began his return to the city.\n\nHe didn't rush back to the bookstore first but went to the appliance market. He spent over ten thousand yuan to buy a freezer. This type of freezer is generally used by businesses to store ingredients and meat, and it's considered a relatively high-end model. Zhou Ze didn't begrudge spending money, as he would be sleeping in it from now on, and he feared problems with cheap ones.\n\nThe merchant was very enthusiastic and sent a small truck to deliver the freezer directly to Zhou Ze at the... bookstore entrance.\n\nAfter the driver and Zhou Ze moved the freezer into the bookstore, the driver was still a bit surprised.\n\n\"Boss, why do you need a freezer for running a bookstore?\" the driver asked.\n\nZhou Ze handed him a cigarette. \"Business is tough. I plan to do some part-time seafood sales.\"\n\nThe driver took the cigarette and left. After all, the goods had been delivered, and he didn't need to worry about anything else.\n\nThere was a small second floor in the bookstore that Xu Le had originally used to store books. After Zhou Ze cleaned it up, he placed the freezer on the upper level. Looking at his \"new bed,\" Zhou Ze finally felt a lot more at ease.\n\nComing down from the second floor, Zhou Ze discovered someone in his bookstore. It wasn't a customer, but his \"wife.\"\n\nDr. Lin was flipping through a magazine. Seeing Zhou Ze come down, she asked with some confusion, \"What were you busy with upstairs?\"\n\n\"Organizing inventory,\" Zhou Ze replied perfunctorily.\n\n\"I'm off work,\" Dr. Lin said.\n\n\"Mm.\" Off work, but you won't sleep with me...\n\n\"The girl woke up,\" Dr. Lin said, looking at Zhou Ze intently. \"Her father wants to treat our department to dinner at Tongcheng Grand Hotel. You should come too.\"\n\n\"What am I going for?\"\n\n\"The girl kept calling for her uncle after she woke up,\" Dr. Lin asked Zhou Ze curiously. \"Did you two know each other before?\"\n\n\"People can still have feelings even when they're unconscious,\" Zhou Ze continued to fabricate. \"When I saved her, she might have actually felt it.\"\n\n\"Are you going?\" Dr. Lin asked.\n\n\"I'm not going.\" Zhou Ze shook his head. \"I'm not hungry. I have no appetite at all.\"\n\nDr. Lin nodded and didn't insist further. She seemed to be preparing to leave, but as she reached the bookstore entrance, she stopped. \"Are you coming home tonight?\"\n\nIt was back to the familiar old question.\n\nI go home, but you won't sleep with me...\n\nSo, Zhou Ze answered decisively:\n\n\"I'm not going back. I've been very busy lately.\"\n\nWell, even though business at the store was as cold as iced coffee.\n\nDr. Lin hesitated and didn't insist. She took her car keys out of her pocket, preparing to leave.\n\nJust then,\n\nWith a \"clang,\"\n\nDr. Lin turned around and saw her \"husband\" had collapsed onto the bookshelf, books scattering all over the floor.\n\n\"What's wrong?\" Dr. Lin immediately went to check on Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze felt his vision blurring, his sight becoming unfocused. His chest heaved, and his legs felt weak, as if he had stepped on cotton and completely lost his balance:\n\n\"I fainted from hunger...\"\n\nZhou Ze replied.\n\nHe\n\nhadn't eaten in days.\n\n————————\n\nFive days since the book was published, second place on the overall new book list for the same period!\n\nIn the supernatural category, except for the monthly ticket list, which we can't vote on because we haven't started the paid subscription, we are number one on all other lists!\n\nYesterday, we were second in daily sales on Qidian! Today, we are eleventh in daily sales on Qidian!\n\nAs a new book with only 30,000 characters and not yet on paid subscription, Long can only say,\n\nBrothers,\n\nYou're awesome!",
