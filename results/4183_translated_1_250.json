    "content": "Scooping a handful of water and splashing it on his face, Zhou Ze slowly raised his head, looking at himself in the mirror, slightly haggard. As an emergency doctor, this haggardness seemed to be a standard feature.\n\n\"Doctor Zhou, a new patient is arriving soon. It seems they fell from upstairs, I wonder if it's a suicide!\" Nurse Wang Ya shouted from the entrance of the men's restroom.\n\n\"Got it, I'm coming,\" Zhou Ze responded, then pulled out a tissue to wipe off the water droplets and started walking out.\n\nThe ambulance quickly drove into the hospital. Lying on the stretcher was an elderly man in a gray Tang suit. The elder was coughing incessantly, occasionally spitting out blood foam and fragments of spleen. His whole body was covered in blood.\n\nZhou Ze immediately ran over, pushing the stretcher cart while observing the patient's condition, and at the same time shouted to those ahead, \"Prepare surgical instruments, quickly!\"\n\nThe patient's condition was very bad.\n\n\"I... I... don't want to die.\"\n\nThe elder opened his eyes, looking at Zhou Ze, who was closest to him.\n\n\"Don't worry, you'll be fine. We'll help you, you won't die.\"\n\nMost critically ill patients say these kinds of things at such times. After all, only a minority can truly face death calmly. And as a doctor, it's certainly not the time to analyze the illness with the patient and tell them what percentage chance they have of surviving. What the patient needs at this moment is psychological comfort.\n\n\"No... no... down there... down there... it's really too scary down there...\"\n\nThe elder suddenly grabbed Zhou Ze's wrist, looking at him with a serious expression.\n\n\"Calm yourself, relax. Your life won't be in danger.\" Although his wrist felt a bit sore, Zhou Ze didn't try to pull free.\n\n\"I don't want... don't want to go down again... They... they found me... I... they found me...\"\n\n\"Hiss...\" Zhou Ze suddenly felt a sharp pain in his wrist.\n\n\"Doctor Zhou, your hand!\" The young nurse beside him immediately cried out.\n\nThe elder's fingernails were very long, and for some unknown reason, they were black, a translucent black similar to amber, not like dirt accumulating inside.\n\nAnd at this moment, the elder's fingernails had already dug into the flesh of Zhou Ze's wrist.\n\n\"I won't go down... won't go down... won't go down... haha... cough cough cough...\"\n\nThe elder suddenly sat up and coughed violently. Immediately after, his body trembled, the hand gripping Zhou Ze's slipped away, and he became still.\n\n\"Prepare for resuscitation!\" Zhou Ze shouted.\n\nThe elder was wheeled into the emergency room. Doctors and nurses began resuscitation efforts, and the defibrillator was also ready.\n\n\"Doctor Zhou, let me treat your wound.\" Wang Ya walked over at this moment.\n\nAs doctors, they weren't really worried about this minor injury. Their biggest concern was if the elder had other diseases, which could put the doctor at risk of occupational exposure. After all, there was a lot of blood on the elder's hands just now, and no one knew if he had any infectious diseases.\n\nSome illnesses, once contracted, could ruin a lifetime.\n\nAfter the wound was bandaged, another doctor walked out of the emergency room and shook his head at Zhou Ze.\n\nThis meant that the person couldn't be saved.\n\nEveryone was a bit disappointed, but for them, this kind of thing was already common, and they would adjust quickly.\n\n\"Doctor Zhou, let's get you checked,\" Wang Ya suggested.\n\n\"No, I have something else tonight.\" Zhou Ze shook his head, walked directly to the changing room to change his clothes, then went to the hospital parking lot, got in his car, and drove away.\n\nAs soon as the car drove under the elevated section of Jianghai Avenue, Zhou Ze's phone rang.\n\n\"Hello, this is Zhou Ze.\"\n\n\"Doctor Zhou, the children are all waiting for you.\"\n\n\"Sorry, Principal Wu, a patient held me up. I'm on my way now. Please ask the children to wait a bit longer for me.\"\n\n\"Okay, okay.\" The call ended quickly.\n\nZhou Ze glanced at the time again; it was already 8:30 PM. The children at the orphanage usually went to bed early.\n\nThe red light turned green, Zhou Ze stepped on the gas and drove on.\n\n\"Honk!!!!!\"\n\nJust at that moment,\n\nA heavy truck ran a red light and drove over. Zhou Ze only had time to turn his head and look out the window at the dazzling high beam lights,\n\nThen,\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nThe world spun,\n\nThe small car, like a fragile piece of white paper, was directly flung away by the heavy truck, tumbling several times in the air before crashing to the ground.\n\n...\n\n\"Ugh...\"\n\nZhou Ze woke up,\n\nHe found his body completely unable to move, as if it was stuck.\n\nAt the same time, his eyes couldn't open. He knew he had been in a car accident, a very serious one. Out of professional habit, he really wanted to examine his injuries right now, but he couldn't move.\n\nAll around, there were occasional sounds of other vehicles passing by, and various honking noises.\n\nAm I still at the accident scene?\n\nAm I still in the car?\n\nZhou Ze thought to himself.\n\nSoon,\n\nThe siren of a police car sounded, and the sound of a fire truck,\n\nFinally, the familiar siren of an ambulance sounded, which was comforting to Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze felt his body being moved. The surrounding temperature was a bit high; they must be cutting open his car to rescue him.\n\nZhou Ze had participated in many such rescue operations and was familiar with some of the procedures.\n\nWhat a pity, the cake in his trunk and the Children's Day party for the orphanage kids would have to be canceled.\n\n\"Doctor Zhou!\"\n\nA familiar voice.\n\nIt must be Doctor Chen from the hospital.\n\nZhou Ze let out a long sigh of relief in his heart. At least, he had saved his life. This could be considered a sudden, unexpected disaster.\n\nThere were also sounds of a few nurses beside him. Because the surroundings were too noisy, Zhou Ze couldn't hear clearly.\n\nBut then, Doctor Chen's next sentence plunged Zhou Ze's heart into a deep abyss!\n\n\"Doctor Zhou has lost vital signs.\"\n\nNo,\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nI'm not dead yet!\n\nI'm not dead!!\n\nZhou Ze screamed desperately in his heart!\n\nHe wasn't dead, he was still conscious, he wasn't dead!\n\nNext, Zhou Ze felt someone performing CPR on him. He felt those heavy compressions again and again, but he couldn't open his eyes, nor could he speak.\n\nHe wasn't dead,\n\nHe hoped they would quickly realize he wasn't dead!\n\nBut after a flurry of activity,\n\nZhou Ze heard the crying voices of a few nurses he knew,\n\nDoctor Chen punched the nearby car door, looking very distressed.\n\nHey!\n\nDon't give up!\n\nDon't ever give up!\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nI should be in a state of suspended animation right now,\n\nExcessive blood loss?\n\nSevere injury?\n\nBut I'm really not dead!\n\nI should still be breathing, I should still have a heartbeat!\n\nZhou Ze roared wildly in his heart.\n\nBut then, he felt himself being lifted onto a stretcher and, presumably, carried into the ambulance.\n\nThen came the sound of the ambulance driving off.\n\nThe nurses in the ambulance were still crying.\n\nBut their crying sounded particularly harsh in Zhou Ze's ears,\n\nHe wasn't dead,\n\nWhy cry!\n\nWhy are you crying!\n\nLook at me again,\n\nLook at me again,\n\nCheck again,\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nThe ambulance stopped,\n\nThen, Zhou Ze heard the hospital leaders speaking:\n\n\"Is little Zhou really gone just like that?\"\n\n\"The car accident was very severe. Doctor Zhou was excessively injured, lost too much blood, and has been confirmed dead.\"\n\n\"Really? He's just gone?\" Another vice president still didn't believe it.\n\n\"Little Zhou is gone,\" came the voice of a department head, \"I just checked again.\"\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nYou quack doctors!\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nYou bastards!\n\nBastards!\n\nZhou Ze cursed incessantly in his heart. At this moment, these people beside him were no longer his colleagues, nor his friends, nor his superiors and elders,\n\nThey actually believed he was dead,\n\nBut can a dead person still hear and perceive?\n\nI'm not dead!\n\nYou bastards,\n\nYou mongrels,\n\nYou sons of bitches!!!!!\n\nThis was Zhou Ze's most frenzied outburst, his most desperate one.\n\nHe knew,\n\nOnce he was cremated,\n\nThere would be no turning back!\n\nHe would face death directly!\n\nA complete and utter end!\n\nHe was unwilling, he truly was unwilling. He was not yet thirty, he hadn't started a family, he didn't have children, he still had a life, he still had a long way to go!\n\n\"Mommy, I just saw this uncle's hand move,\" a little girl's timid voice sounded nearby.\n\n\"Slap!\" A small slap landed.\n\n\"Don't talk nonsense, I'll deal with you when we get home,\" the girl's mother scolded.\n\nZhou Ze despaired,\n\nBecause no matter how much he struggled,\n\nHow much he roared in his heart,\n\nThe people outside couldn't perceive it.\n\nHe was placed on the conveyor belt,\n\nThe machine started,\n\nHe was being pushed forward,\n\nHe knew what he was about to face,\n\nAnd because of that, he was utterly terrified!\n\nNo,\n\nNo,\n\nNo!\n\nI'm not dead, I'm really not dead!\n\nDon't burn me!\n\nDon't burn me!\n\nI'm really not dead yet!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nYou beasts,\n\nYou mongrels!\n\nYou sons of bitches!!!!!\n\nNo one could hear his cries,\n\nThey were only responsible for feeling sad,\n\nOnly responsible for being grief-stricken,\n\nOnly responsible for completing this process,\n\nThen going home for dinner, and continuing on tomorrow.\n\nFinally,\n\nZhou Ze felt himself being pushed into a narrow place full of a greasy smell,\n\nThen,\n\nA sticky liquid sprayed onto his body,\n\nHe knew what it was,\n\nIt was gasoline,\n\nThen,\n\n\"Sizzle...\"\n\nHot!\n\nVery hot!\n\nPain,\n\nIntense burning pain!\n\nFire,\n\nFire,\n\nBig fire,\n\nFire everywhere...",

    "content": "On the midnight street,\n\nThe streetlights glowed yellow,\nAnd people were terrified.\nThe weather was cold, with a wind like a knife cutting into one's skin.\n\nZhou Ze also felt cold.\nHe didn't know where he was again,\nBut he knew one thing,\nThis was... the human world.\n\nHe had died, but he had come back.\nHe didn't know what to do,\nSo he could only mechanically and numbly continue walking forward.\n\nHe didn't have the time to think about too many other things right now,\nSuch as the place he had just been to,\nSuch as the old man he had saved before his car accident,\nSuch as the faceless woman in the pond wearing a red dress,\nSuch as... his fingernails.\n\nHe had come back, which should have been a joyful thing, but even when people occasionally walked past him, and no matter how hard he tried to greet them, no one could see or hear him.\nHe was excluded, isolated by this world.\n\nThose who haven't experienced being put in \"solitary confinement\" won't understand the pain of complete isolation. For Zhou Ze, the entire world right now was his prison, and a black cloth had been draped over it.\n\nNo one could see him,\nNo one could communicate with him,\nHe couldn't pick up any solid object,\nIn fact,\nEven the wind could easily blow through him.\n\nHe was so frail,\nThe phrase \"weak as the wind\" was truly no exaggeration for him.\n\nMoreover, what shocked and horrified Zhou Ze the most was that\nHe could see faint specks of light constantly scattering from his body,\nIn other words,\nHis body was slowly fading.\nPerhaps in another quarter of an hour, he would completely disappear, every last insignificant trace of him erased.\n\nHe didn't know how any of this had happened, but he knew that he truly didn't have much time left.\n\nAmong the Eight Immortals, Tieguai Li entered the body of a man who had starved to death as a soul, which is how he became known in later generations.\nZhou Ze had also heard stories about ghosts \"possessing a body to return to life.\" He also wanted to possess a body to return to life. He was very cold and very panicked; he needed a physical body to attach himself to.\nHe didn't even care whose body it was.\n\nAt times like these, people are always selfish, and Zhou Ze was no exception. Moreover, he truly couldn't take it anymore.\n\nHowever, whenever he tried to approach someone, lights would appear above their head and on their shoulders, directly preventing him from getting close. He even suffered harm as a result, accelerating his \"evaporation.\"\n\nHe was a little tired, and a little numb,\nHe was waiting for his end,\nWaiting for his termination.\n\nAs someone who had already died once, facing death again made him more composed.\nFurthermore, given Zhou Ze's current situation, the longer he lingered here, the longer he would endure suffering.\n\n\"Creak...\"\nAhead, a shop was still lit, it seemed to be a bookstore, as rows of bookshelves could be seen through the glass door.\nSomeone pushed the door open and walked out; it was a man in a hoodie. The man wore a hat, so his face was unclear. He looked around for a while, then left in a hurry.\nOf course, the man couldn't see Zhou Ze standing less than five meters away from him.\n\nInitially, Zhou Ze didn't feel anything unusual, but shortly after the man left, Zhou Ze suddenly sensed a warm aura from inside the bookstore.\nYes,\nA warm aura.\nThis warmth bewildered Zhou Ze, but he was like a person about to freeze to death who suddenly finds a box of matches; even though he knows the matches won't save his life, he'll still strike one to feel the last warmth before dying.\n\nZhou Ze walked towards it, his body passing directly through the bookstore's glass door, continuing inward, and arriving behind the bookstore's bookshelves.\n\nBehind the bookshelves,\nLay a person,\nIt was a handsome young man, perhaps twenty-three or twenty-four years old. Because the air conditioning was on in the store, he wasn't wearing many clothes, just a long-sleeved shirt and a light jacket.\nHe lay on the floor, but on him, Zhou Ze felt a warm sensation, like a pauper walking down the road at night and picking up a bag of gold coins.\nThis attraction was irresistible, and Zhou Ze, in his current state, had no right to refuse!\n\nZhou Ze walked over and crouched in front of the young man.\nHe didn't know how to enter the other person's body, but he knew how to access the warmth he needed.\nHe extended a hand and placed it on the other person's chest.\nZhou Ze saw his fingernails slowly embedding into the other person's body.\nIt was a very strange feeling, different from when a \"breeze\" previously blew through his body as he walked down the street. This was a fusion, a merging using his fingernails as a medium.\nSlowly, Zhou Ze's entire being began to enter the other person's body; the two began to overlap.\n\n..................\n\n\"Xu Le! Wake up, wake up!\"\nZhou Ze was awakened by a series of shoves. No, to be precise, he was \"startled.\" He opened his eyes and found himself sitting behind the bookstore counter, where he had been resting his head on his hands.\n\n\"Hey, wake up!\"\nThe woman's voice was sharp and high-pitched, carrying an air of bossiness.\nRaising his head, Zhou Ze looked at the woman in front of him. No, to be precise, she should be a girl, probably high school age. Although she was a big girl, she still had a bit of childishness about her.\n\n\"Hey, Xu Le, what do you mean? You think you're tough, huh? You want to show face to my parents and my sister, huh? How dare you not come home all night!\nWho gave you the guts?!\"\n\nXu Le?\nWho is that?\nZhou Ze spread his hands in bewilderment, realizing his hands were smooth. His old hands used to have calluses from long hours of practicing surgical instruments, but these hands didn't.\n\n\"Hey, I'm talking to you!\"\nThe girl slapped the counter with a fierce look.\n\nZhou Ze frowned slightly, stood up, and walked to the glass mirror by the shop door. He saw his reflection, an unfamiliar face. No, he had seen this face before, it was the face he saw last night.\n\nThis body,\nIs mine now?\n\n\"Hey, what do you mean? My parents are both angry. My mom is throwing a fit at home. I'm telling you, everything you eat, drink, and use now is from my family. What right do you, a live-in son-in-law, have to put on airs in my house?\nWho are you trying to impress?!\nIf you dare not come home tonight, do you believe I'll come over and slap you directly?!\"\n\nThe girl raised her hand as if to slap him, but she suddenly noticed that the man in front of her, her \"brother-in-law,\" didn't dodge or beg for mercy as he usually would. Instead, the look in his eyes made her feel a little scared.\nAt this point, she checked the time and realized it was already seven-thirty.\n\n\"Hmph, I'm going to school first, I'll settle scores with you tonight!\"\nThe girl stomped off angrily.\n\nZhou Ze slowly sat back down in the chair behind the counter. There was an old laptop here, and a mobile phone next to it.\nEven now, he hadn't fully adapted to the change in his identity.\n\nHe was Zhou Ze, a famous young surgeon in Tongcheng, and he was an orphan.\nNow,\nHe had become this person.\nWhat did that girl just say?\nI am... a live-in son-in-law?\nDo I have a wife?\nAnd a mother-in-law and father-in-law?\n\nAnd judging by the attitude and tone of his \"sister-in-law\" when speaking to his \"brother-in-law\" just now, his status as a \"live-in son-in-law\" truly conformed to ancient traditions.\nA live-in son-in-law, also known as a \"daochamen,\" was not only looked down upon by his wife's family but also by everyone around him in ancient times. Their status was even comparable to that of criminals, and during the Han and Tang dynasties, those forced into border garrisons often included赘婿 (a man who marries into his wife's family).\n\nPicking up the phone, he found it wasn't password-protected. He didn't know if the guy was lazy or didn't dare to set a password, but at least it allowed Zhou Ze to easily open his WeChat and QQ.\nThere were very few people on his QQ list, just a few middle school, high school, and college classmates, and then a family list with only one person, labeled \"Wife.\"\nHe opened his QQ chat history with her; it was empty.\n\nAlright,\nZhou Ze opened WeChat and tried to find the woman labeled \"Wife.\" There were replies here, mostly Xu Le asking about things like what to eat tonight, what to prepare for tonight, how much money was needed for inventory, how much the bookstore had sold recently, how his body was, a whole bunch of questions.\nAnd the other party's replies were often perfunctory and aloof,\nLike:\n\"Oh\"\n\"Hmm\"\n\"Okay\"\nTo substitute.\n\nZhou Ze tossed the phone aside. This relationship was a bit complicated. He suddenly looked at his palm; his fingernails were no different from an ordinary person's.\nHowever, in the events involving the old man he saved before his car accident, his escape from the faceless woman, and his entry into this guy's body, his fingernails played a crucial role.\n\nWith a thought,\nJust then,\nZhou Ze found his fingernails slowly growing longer, and at the same time, they became dark and translucent. There was even a faint black mist swirling around them.\n\n\"Whew...\"\nHe let out a long breath,\nClosed his eyes,\nAnd when he opened them again,\nHis fingernails had returned to normal.\n\nFrom morning until noon, Zhou Ze sat there, trying to adapt to his new identity and calm the discomfort caused by his identity change. He didn't eat lunch, either forgetting or simply not feeling hungry.\nThis was still Tongcheng. Zhou Ze's old home was in Chongchuan District; now he was in Gangzha District, not far away.\n\nBy afternoon, Zhou Ze sighed and slowly stood up. \"When in Rome, do as the Romans do.\"\nHe began to try cleaning the bookshelves; at least he could find something to do for himself.\n\nThe old man who had choked him before he died had said \"he was discovered,\" and the faceless woman in Hell had said \"you'll be caught eventually,\" which instilled a sense of crisis in Zhou Ze.\nHis current state was considered \"barely surviving.\" Coming back from the dead was a stroke of luck, so he cherished it. At least, before fully understanding the situation and gathering enough clues, he had to embrace this identity and ideally not cause too much abnormality, so as not to attract the attention of those \"who want to catch him.\"\n\nThe business of this shop was truly terrible. The slump in the traditional book market hadn't been a one or two-day affair for a long time, and this place wasn't on the golden strip right outside a school.\nOne could only say that Xu Le choosing to open a bookstore here made it questionable whether he could even break even.\n\nIt wasn't until three o'clock in the afternoon that the first customer of the day walked in.\nThe customer browsed the children's books section for a long time.\nZhou Ze waited a while, then walked over and asked, \"What kind of topic are you looking for?\"\nAlthough, Zhou Ze didn't really understand either.\n\n\"Just looking around,\" the other party replied.\n\"Okay.\" Zhou Ze stopped bothering, he hadn't yet settled into his role as \"bookstore owner.\"\n\nBut just then,\nThe other person suddenly walked behind him and said eerily,\n\"You really don't recognize me?\"\n\"What?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\"Last night I hit your head with a baseball bat and stole your money,\nAnd I even specifically checked,\nYou clearly weren't breathing then.\"",

    "content": "Zhou Ze was stunned. So, the reason he was able to use Xu Le's body for a soul transmigration last night was because Xu Le had just been killed?\n\nBecause the body was still warm, he could enter it?\n\nLooking at it this way, he seemed to be quite lucky.\n\nWithout disgust, anger, or even panic about possibly having his identity exposed, Zhou Ze turned around and looked at the man, who was about his age.\n\nThe man was taken aback.\n\nHe saw something unusual in Zhou Ze's eyes.\n\nIt was joy.\n\nIt was relief.\n\nAnd even,\n\na hint of appreciation.\n\nAs the host, Zhou Ze clearly understood the difficult situation he faced last night. If this guy hadn't happened to commit murder at that time, he might have been annihilated, never to see the sun today.\n\n\"Sorry, I passed out last night, and my head feels terrible this morning, like I'm drunk. I've forgotten what happened yesterday,\" Zhou Ze explained casually.\n\nHe didn't think the other party would guess he was a ghost that had transmigrated into a body, unless the other party was crazy.\n\n\"You don't blame me?\" The other party pointed to his nose, a bit absurdly. \"Even though I've told you I clubbed you yesterday?\"\n\n\"It's fine. I even thank you for not taking my phone and computer from the table.\"\n\n\"Uh... I forgot.\" The man scratched his head. \"It's good that you're okay. This is the money I robbed from you yesterday.\"\n\nThe man voluntarily took out three hundred yuan from his pocket, then rummaged further and pulled out another eight hundred yuan.\n\n\"Eight hundred yuan is for your medical expenses, and three hundred is what I robbed yesterday.\" The man pursed his lips. \"Yesterday, I gambled online and lost all my salary to the bookie. When I passed your bookstore, I suddenly wanted to get some money. After I knocked you down, I found you weren't breathing, and it scared me to death.\n\nI ran home and couldn't sleep all night, just thinking if the police would suddenly break in and arrest me. Robbery and murder, I only took three hundred yuan, I felt so foolish, it wasn't worth it.\"\n\nThe man reached out and patted Zhou Ze's shoulder.\n\n\"Buddy, it's really good you didn't die. Seriously, I've been walking around outside since morning, waiting for someone to call the police, waiting for the police to come. But then I saw you were still in the bookstore.\n\nYou know, at that moment, I almost knelt down and kowtowed to you. Thank you. You're tough; you didn't die. Otherwise, I'd be finished. There are so many cameras here; if you had died, I definitely wouldn't have gotten away.\"\n\nZhou Ze looked at the eleven hundred yuan in his hand, then at the \"murderer\" in front of him, who was repenting with tears in his eyes. He felt that this scene was very bizarre.\n\nTo be honest, Xu Le *did* die. Because he died, Zhou Ze could take over his body. And because Zhou Ze took over, this guy in front of him was absolved of murder.\n\nBoth Zhou Ze and this guy benefited; only Xu Le, the unlucky one, got screwed.\n\n\"Alright, it's fine. Maybe I just had a stitch in my side last night.\" Zhou Ze moved the other party's hand from his shoulder. He used to be an emergency doctor; what kind of filth hadn't he seen? But in that extreme environment, he developed a slight潔癖 (germophobia/mysophobia). In fact, most emergency doctors have varying degrees of洁癖.\n\nIt was precisely because they had witnessed too much dirt and filth that they knew how to cherish \"cleanliness\" even more.\n\n\"You really don't blame me?\" The man said with some joy.\n\n\"No, I don't blame you.\" Zhou Ze nodded. \"Go live your life and work hard. Don't make mistakes next time.\"\n\n\"Okay, thank you, buddy. You're a straightforward guy.\"\n\nThe man nodded heavily, left the bookstore, and went to embrace his \"new life.\"\n\nZhou Ze, meanwhile, picked up his phone. He thought about it and decided he should still call the police, not to report the other party for killing him (Xu Le), but to report them for suspected theft.\n\nAnyway, let the police investigate. If the other party really had a criminal record or had done other bad things and was caught by the police, it would serve him right.\n\nHe occupied someone else's body; he had to do something for that unlucky guy.\n\nAlthough, given the other party's good attitude of admitting fault and even paying for his medical expenses, reporting him by name was indeed quite unethical, a real case of 生兒子沒* (having a son without an ass)¹.\n\nHowever, just as Zhou Ze dialed 110, and the voice from the operator came through,\n\nat the bookstore entrance,\n\nthat guy suddenly returned.\n\n\"There's something else...\" As soon as the other party walked in, he saw Zhou Ze holding his phone. He paused, then pointed directly at Zhou Ze, \"You're still calling the police, aren't you, you son of a bitch!\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head.\n\n\"Let me see your phone! Give it to me!\"\n\nZhou Ze could only continue to shake his head.\n\n\"You're going back on your word, you bastard! I'll kill you! Let's see if you die this time!\"\n\nThe man instantly entered an excited and agitated state. He must have had some mental issues, perhaps due to a long-term gambler's lifestyle and being out of touch with society. He tended to enter extreme states when provoked.\n\nThe other party lunged. Zhou Ze put down his phone and began to retreat.\n\nHe was a doctor in his previous life, not a fighter, nor had he practiced martial arts. His body in this life was also a bit frail. When it came to a face-to-face fight, he was indeed a bit flustered.\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nThe man slammed Zhou Ze against the wall, his hands tightly gripping Zhou Ze's neck.\n\n\"I'll let you call the police! I'll let you call the police! I'll let you go back on your word! Fine, I'll let you die, really die! This time I'll strangle you to death and then drain your blood! Let's see if you still don't die!\"\n\nThe man roared through gritted teeth.\n\nSuch a pathetic bookstore business; in the afternoon, let alone customers, there weren't even many pedestrians outside the door.\n\nHis neck was almost numb, and he couldn't breathe. Zhou Ze struggled with all his might. As he struggled, Zhou Ze's fingernails suddenly turned black and elongated.\n\nImmediately after, Zhou Ze wrapped his hands around the other party's back.\n\n\"Hiss...\"\n\nThe man suddenly shivered, his eyes rolling back. He immediately released Zhou Ze's neck, stumbled back a few steps, knocking over several bookshelves, and then collapsed to the ground.\n\nZhou Ze was freed. He reached up and rubbed his neck. He hadn't been too panicked earlier. After all, his fingernails could even harm ghosts in hell; dealing with an ordinary person shouldn't be a problem, right?\n\nBut Zhou Ze still wasn't entirely clear about the specific reason or use of these fingernails. He only knew they were likely \"infected\" from the old man he saved before his car accident.\n\nIt's truly,\n\n\"得了灰指甲，一个传染俩\" (got gray nail, infects two)².\n\nHe walked over, squatted down, and patted the man's face. Thankfully, he wasn't dead; he was still breathing. Zhou Ze shook his head, picked up his phone, and called the police again.\n\n...\n\nAfter the police station completed the report, the police officer asked Zhou Ze to wait in the small hall because the matter Zhou Ze reported was a bit odd. He said someone came to rob him, but the one who was knocked unconscious turned out to be the \"assailant.\" And now this assailant was still in the hospital; they had to wait for him to wake up for further confirmation.\n\nHowever, the police officer at least didn't put handcuffs on Zhou Ze.\n\nSquatting next to Zhou Ze was a middle-aged man whose left hand was locked to the radiator.\n\n\"Brother, you're awesome! That guy tried to rob you, but you took him down?\" The rather disheveled middle-aged man said as he rubbed his long, muddy bangs. \"You really have that vibe I had when I was young. For these clueless petty thieves, you have to beat them to death!\"\n\n\"Hey, you behave yourself.\" A young police officer walked over and reprimanded him. \"This is your how many times stealing electric bike batteries since winter started?\n\nI'm telling you, the New Year is coming soon. Can't you just settle down? Or find a proper job and earn some money to send home? You're a grown man.\"\n\n\"It's impossible to work, not in this lifetime. I don't know how to do business. Stealing electric bike batteries is the only way to make a living. Going to the detention center feels like coming home.\n\nEveryone inside is talented, and they speak so well. I love it in there!\"\n\n\"Hmph.\" The young police officer didn't want to bother with this guy anymore and turned to leave.\n\n\"Brother, how was my speech just now?\" The greasy middle-aged man winked at Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Quite interesting.\" Zhou Ze smiled.\n\n\"Che Guevara is my idol. Che Guevara, do you know who that is?\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"Let me tell you, life has to be...\" The greasy middle-aged man paused, looking towards the doorway. \"Oh my goodness, she's so beautiful! Is she a police officer?\"\n\nZhou Ze turned his head and saw a woman in a blue down jacket and long leather boots walking towards them with another female police officer at the door.\n\n\"She should be a police officer,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nThe woman was very beautiful, with a delicate figure and fair skin. Most importantly, it was her temperament that was the biggest plus.\n\n\"But she's not wearing a police uniform,\" the greasy man retorted.\n\n\"Maybe plainclothes,\" Zhou Ze guessed.\n\n\"You're right, a beautiful police officer, tsk tsk. Looks like I'll have to come in more often in the future.\" The greasy middle-aged man smacked his lips, still wanting more. \"If I could marry her, I'd be willing to shorten my life by ten years.\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. He dared not joke about lifespan and longevity anymore.\n\n\"You disagree?\" The greasy man, seeing Zhou Ze shake his head, said anxiously, \"You're blind, you know. For a woman like that, losing ten years of life is absolutely worth it...\"\n\nAt that moment, the female police officer and the woman in long boots walked up to Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Xu Le, your wife is here to pick you up. The investigation there is clear; you're free to go,\" the female police officer said, pointing at Zhou Ze.\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze.\n\n\"...\" The greasy middle-aged man.\n\n***\n¹ 生兒子沒** (shēng ér zi méi pì gu) - A very crude and strong Chinese idiom that literally means \"to have a son without an ass.\" It's used to describe someone who is extremely unethical, despicable, or heartless, implying they lack the basic human decency that even an \"ass\" would represent.\n² 得了灰指甲，一个传染俩 (dé le huī zhǐ jiǎ, yī gè chuán rǎn liǎ) - A play on a well-known advertising slogan for a foot fungus medicine, which originally said \"得了灰指甲，一个传染俩\" (got gray nail, one infects two), implying the highly contagious nature of fungal infections. Here, it's used humorously to suggest that the \"infection\" of special abilities (the black, long fingernails) also spread from the old man to Zhou Ze.",

    "content": "\"Officer, may I ask what my wife's name is?\"\n\nThis thought only crossed Zhou Ze's mind for a second; he wasn't that stupid. But he genuinely didn't know his \"wife's\" real name. In this era, few people used their real names for QQ or WeChat accounts.\n\nThe greasy man, however, cast a mournful glance at Zhou Ze: \"Brother, that's not cool. We said we'd be each other's broken-winged angels, remember?\"\n\nZhou Ze returned the look, equally helpless: \"I'm surprised too.\"\n\nThe greasy man lowered his head, sighed, and murmured softly, \"My dumplings are delicious.\"\n\n\"Let's go.\"\n\nHis \"wife\" said coolly, then turned and walked out.\n\nZhou Ze could only follow.\n\nShe drove a Porsche Cayenne and got straight into it.\n\nZhou Ze opened the door and sat in the passenger seat.\n\nTo be honest,\n\nit was a bit awkward.\n\nIf that unfortunate soul, Xu Le, had a more normal marital and family life, then Zhou Ze wouldn't be in such an embarrassing situation. If his wife showed concern, he could make excuses, like he felt dizzy and couldn't remember some things.\n\nBut this woman clearly had the vibe of an ice queen, seeming completely uninterested in engaging with him. Even picking him up from the police station felt like a mere formality.\n\nIt was like his dog got lost, was found by a security guard,\n\nand he went to pick it up.\n\nThat's how it felt.\n\nThe woman started the car. She was actually quite young, probably around the same age as him (Xu Le), a few years younger than the original Zhou Ze.\n\nAs the car drove onto the elevated road, the woman finally broke the silence:\n\n\"Are you alright?\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm fine,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\nThen,\n\nsilence again.\n\nThe woman thought her husband was unusually quiet today, but she had no desire to explore why.\n\nJust then, the woman's phone rang. She put it on speaker, and the voice from the other end came through the car's audio system:\n\n\"Dr. Lin, there's just been a school bus collision on Youth Central Road. Casualties are already being transported to our hospital. The director wants you back urgently.\"\n\nZhou Ze was slightly stunned.\n\nSo his wife was also a doctor.\n\nAnd,\n\nhis wife's surname was \"Lin.\"\n\n\"I understand, I'll be right back.\" The woman hung up, exited the elevated road at the next exit, made a sharp turn at the traffic light, and drove towards the hospital.\n\nShe didn't ask Zhou Ze if he wanted to be dropped off at home first, or if he wanted to get out and take a taxi back himself. Instead, she drove all the way into the parking lot of Chongchuan District People's Hospital.\n\nHonestly, Zhou Ze was actually worried she'd make him get out and take a taxi home. He imagined having to shamelessly ask:\n\n\"Wife, where do we live again? I forgot.\"\n\nIt felt so stupid.\n\nThe woman got out of the car, and Zhou Ze followed. The woman entered the hospital building and got into the elevator, and Zhou Ze followed her into the elevator. The woman entered the women's changing room, and Zhou Ze...\n\nZhou Ze sat down on a bench by the corridor.\n\nJust then, the first batch of accident victims arrived. One was critically injured, and five other children also had serious injuries.\n\nWatching his \"wife\" change into a white coat and immediately busy herself with treatment,\n\nZhou Ze could only sit on the bench, lost in thought.\n\nIt felt a bit like a mother bringing her son to work; the mother worked while the son watched and played by himself.\n\nHowever,\n\nthe unique smell of disinfectant in the hospital and the stuffy feeling from the central air conditioning were truly nostalgic, a familiar sensation.\n\nThe emergency room was ahead. The critically injured and dying person seemed to be a girl.\n\nIt was a kindergarten school bus accident. Seeing the little ones crying out in pain on the operating table, the scene was indeed heartbreaking.\n\nZhou Ze pursed his lips. Normally, at this time, he would have already changed his clothes and joined the treatment. He was the most famous young surgeon in Tongcheng. But now, he could only be an onlooker.\n\nThis feeling was uncomfortable, but he could only endure it. Moreover, this People's Hospital was publicly known as the best hospital in Tongcheng, and the number and quality of its doctors were unquestionable. They should be able to handle it.\n\nSoon, the next batch of children were also brought in. Their injuries were minor, only requiring wound treatment or simple bandaging.\n\nTraffic police were specifically guarding the entrance to this floor. Some parents who had been notified had already arrived, their emotions very agitated. However, letting parents in at this time could hinder the treatment, so they had to be held back for now.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head, stood up, walked to the window at the far end of the hallway, raised the window, then pulled out a cigarette from his pocket. He smoked, and Xu Le also smoked, so this was convenient.\n\n\"Uncle, you can't smoke in the hospital.\"\n\nJust as he put the cigarette to his mouth, a crisp voice of a little girl came from behind Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze turned around and saw a little girl in a lily dress standing behind him, pouting and glaring at him.\n\nCough, cough,\n\na bit awkward.\n\nZhou Ze could only put the cigarette away. No matter what, being lectured by a little girl about public etiquette was always a bit embarrassing.\n\n\"Little one, aren't you cold dressed like that?\" Zhou Ze bent down and asked.\n\nThe little girl had delicate skin, a touch of baby fat on her face, and big, lovely eyes, like an enlarged Barbie doll.\n\n\"Not cold at all.\" The little girl shook her head. \"Uncle, you can't smoke in the hospital anymore, okay?\"\n\n\"I know.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded earnestly.\n\n\"Are you alright?\" Zhou Ze asked again.\n\n\"I'm fine. The other children are all injured, and they're in a lot of pain.\"\n\nThe little girl turned sideways and looked at the children behind her who were having their wounds bandaged. Most of them were crying, not necessarily because the pain was unbearable, but because if one person cried, the others followed suit.\n\nNurses were not only treating wounds but also comforting the children.\n\nOutside, the parents, temporarily held back by the traffic police, were constantly yelling and cursing.\n\nIn short,\n\nthat entire floor felt chaotic.\n\n\"Then you're really lucky,\" Zhou Ze exclaimed.\n\nThe little girl didn't even have a single scratch on her.\n\n\"Yep, I was sitting in the back row, so I'm fine.\" The little girl nodded, then actively ran over to comfort her classmates, checking on them here and there, and encouraging and soothing them.\n\nShe was a very sensible and strong child.\n\nZhou Ze turned around, instinctively took out a cigarette again, but then thought better of it and put it back.\n\nWhen he returned to the bench and sat down, three nurses and two doctors walked out of the emergency room.\n\nOne male doctor and one female doctor, the female doctor being his wife.\n\n\"It's okay, we did our best,\" the male doctor said, reaching out to put a hand on Zhou Ze's wife's shoulder to comfort her.\n\nAs her husband,\n\nZhou Ze was sitting right there,\n\nbut he wasn't bothered by this scene...\n\nThat scoundrel Xu Le had left him in such a complicated mess: a live-in son-in-law, an extremely short-tempered sister-in-law, and clearly ill-tempered in-laws.\n\nZhou Ze wished his wife would quickly have an affair, dump him, and divorce him so he could have some peace and quiet.\n\nAnyone who had just died and been resurrected into a new body wouldn't want to deal with the complexities of a modern urban son-in-law's life, right?\n\nHowever, to Zhou Ze's surprise, his wife directly blocked the doctor's \"salty\" hand and pointed at him, saying:\n\n\"This is my husband.\"\n\nThere was no tenderness in her voice, just simple, stiff words, like she was saying: This is my pet husky.\n\n\"Oh, hello, sir.\" The male doctor's face was a bit awkward. No matter what, flirting with someone's wife in front of them always made one feel a little sheepish.\n\nZhou Ze smiled, acknowledging him. It seemed his wife was quite virtuous... but he couldn't bring himself to be happy. It wasn't about being cuckolded.\n\nIt was simply, how nice would it be if life were simpler.\n\n\"I'll go check on the other kids. They've all been taken care of, so there shouldn shouldn't be anything else. You and your husband should go back and rest early,\" the male doctor said before walking away.\n\nDr. Lin sat down on the bench next to Zhou Ze. She took off her mask, removed her gloves, and dropped them on the floor.\n\nZhou Ze noticed her eyes were a little red, and she was gently biting her lip. Clearly, she was in a very bad mood, which meant that critically injured child hadn't made it.\n\nShe looked quite 'pitiable'.\n\nZhou Ze felt a bit of understanding for Xu Le now. This live-in son-in-law at least earned a lot more than his peers, with his in-laws' better financial conditions as a prerequisite. And indeed, this Dr. Lin was truly beautiful.\n\n\"Don't take it to heart. You'll experience much more of this in the future. Just seek peace of mind.\"\n\nZhou Ze, as an experienced person, offered comfort. His experience was far richer than his \"wife's,\" and his psychological resilience was naturally much stronger.\n\n\"Shut up.\"\n\nThe woman replied with those two words. If Zhou Ze had spoken those words in his original capacity as a senior, it would have been guidance.\n\nBut Zhou Ze was now Xu Le, and for him to say such a thing to Dr. Lin, it just sounded like pure, detached advice.\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze shrugged, mentally scorning Xu Le again. Look how cowardly you are; your wife dares to tell you to shut up in public.\n\nDr. Lin, her eyes red, slowly stood up: \"I'm going to change clothes. Let's go home.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" Zhou Ze nodded.\n\nAt this moment, two nurses pulled open the curtain of the emergency room, revealing the bed inside. A small body lay on the bed, covered with a white sheet.\n\nZhou Ze's gaze swept over it. He had seen many dead people; in all his years of practicing medicine, he had saved many lives, but he had also seen many patients die before him, helpless.\n\n\"Dr. Lin, is this your husband?\" a young nurse asked teasingly. They knew Dr. Lin was married, but her husband was different from the boyfriends of other female doctors and nurses; he had never shown up at the hospital.\n\nYou can't blame them for joking in the face of death. It's like asking those fresh-faced people who go to Tibet once and post on WeChat Moments about their purified and pious souls to stay there for ten years; they wouldn't be able to handle it. It's unrealistic.\n\n\"Yes,\" Dr. Lin nodded, her emotions having somewhat calmed down by now.\n\n\"Then you two should hurry back. Maybe you'll have some 'activities' when you get home, right?\n\nLet me tell you, our Dr. Lin really loves children. You two should hurry home and...\"\n\n\"Damn it!\"\n\n\"...\" The little nurse paused.\n\nZhou Ze saw the hem of a lily dress peeking out from under the white sheet. His mind buzzed, and he suddenly realized that the unharmed little girl he had just seen,\n\nshe wasn't human!",

    "content": "That single expletive, \"Fuck,\"\n\nAfter it was uttered,\n\nThe two young nurses were at a loss, and Dr. Lin was also stunned for a moment.\n\nIt was just too simple and crude a response.\n\nZhou Ze offered no explanation, reaching out directly to pull back the white sheet covering the girl's head.\n\nIt was her, it really was her!\n\nNo wonder she had no injuries at all just now,\n\nNot even a single scratch on her body.\n\nThis wasn't because she was lucky to be in the back row.\n\nIn reality,\n\nShe was the most severely injured among all the children; the doctors had been working frantically to save her.\n\nHer soul had floated out, yet she was unaware, still reminding herself not to smoke in public, and even comforting the other children who had minor injuries.\n\nActually,\n\nThose children couldn't see her at all.\n\nIn the entire hospital,\n\nThe only person who could see her,\n\nWas Zhou Ze!\n\n\"Is she dead?\" Zhou Ze asked, his gaze scanning the surroundings.\n\n\"Xu Le?\" Dr. Lin looked at her husband. She didn't want to dwell on his recent cursing because she noticed her husband was acting strangely.\n\n\"She's not dead yet, keep saving her, keep resuscitating!\"\n\nZhou Ze suddenly grabbed Dr. Lin's arm, pulling her closer, and shouted:\n\n\"The resuscitation time limit hasn't passed, she still has a chance to wake up, keep resuscitating!\"\n\n\"Sir, sir!\"\n\nSeeing Zhou Ze roughly grab Dr. Lin, the two nurses immediately stepped forward, ready to pull Zhou Ze away. In their eyes, Dr. Lin's husband was a bit inexplicable, and also showed tendencies towards domestic violence.\n\nZhou Ze pushed the two nurses away from his side, also releasing his grip, and muttered softly:\n\n\"Where are you, where are you, where on earth are you!\"\n\nZhou Ze rushed out, running, searching.\n\nJust a moment ago, the girl's soul was still moving among the children, comforting them. Now, she was nowhere to be found.\n\nHad she already gone to hell?\n\nWas she already dead?\n\nWas it already too late?\n\nZhou Ze felt a bit lost. He didn't know why he was so agitated, nor why he was so anxious.\n\nPerhaps, it was because of his profession; it was his duty to save any patient who had a chance of survival. Moreover, that kind and resilient girl had interacted with him just now.\n\n\"Uncle, are you looking for me?\"\n\nA familiar child's voice sounded behind Zhou Ze. Zhou Ze immediately turned around and saw the little girl again.\n\nHowever, the little girl's body was not as solid as before; now she had become semi-transparent.\n\n\"Uncle, I'm a little cold.\" The little girl hugged her arms and squatted down. \"I went to find the nurse sisters to ask them to lend me some clothes, but the nurse sisters ignored me. Do they dislike me? Am I very annoying?\"\n\nSpecks of light continuously overflowed from the little girl's body. Zhou Ze had seen this scene before; it had happened to him back then.\n\n\"Xu Le, come back with me!\"\n\nDr. Lin walked over at this moment.\n\nThe little girl turned her head, looking behind her.\n\n\"Don't look!\"\n\nZhou Ze took a step forward, reaching out to cover the little girl's eyes. No one knew what would happen if she saw her own body lying on the hospital bed.\n\nWould she break down?\n\nWould she realize her death and then simply dissipate?\n\nWhen Zhou Ze's hand touched the little girl's body, Zhou Ze's fingernails became slightly warm at that moment. They didn't lengthen or turn black, but Zhou Ze felt they were very hot. At the same time, the little girl's body began to twist, turning into a circle of light that revolved around Zhou Ze's fingertips. And this light, others around clearly couldn't see.\n\n\"Get out of the way, she can still be saved!\" Zhou Ze rushed towards the hospital bed again.\n\n\"Xu Le!\" Dr. Lin's chest heaved. The deceased was gone; she didn't know why her husband was still rambling and acting insane, especially since her husband studied civil engineering and had no connection to medicine whatsoever.\n\nThis time, when Zhou Ze rushed over, the two young nurses didn't dare to stop him. Zhou Ze pulled back the white sheet and placed his hands on the girl's chest.\n\nYes, that's how he came back to life himself.\n\nYour soul has come out,\n\nIt can go back in,\n\nYou can live!\n\nAfter seeing the light from his fingertips completely enter the girl's body, Zhou Ze began to perform CPR, pressing down on the girl with his hands clasped together.\n\n\"Wake up!\"\n\n\"Wake up!\"\n\nThe two nurses dared not approach, looking at Dr. Lin instead.\n\n\"She's dead.\"\n\nDr. Lin walked up to Zhou Ze and said.\n\n\"The golden hour for resuscitation hasn't passed, I've been keeping track of the time,\" Zhou Ze shouted, still pressing. \"She can live, she can live!\"\n\nDr. Lin pursed her lips, then directly reached out and pushed Zhou Ze away. After that, she began to press on the girl's chest with her own hands clasped.\n\n\"Your force is too great; she has injuries. Ah Chun, hook up the instruments again, continue resuscitation.\"\n\nZhou Ze was pushed away, but he didn't get angry; he just kept staring at the little girl on the bed.\n\nThe only blessing was probably that the parents were stopped by the traffic police, and there were so many other children making noise outside that no one noticed what was happening here.\n\nDr. Lin continued pressing, beads of sweat already forming on her forehead. She didn't know why she was going along with this man's madness, but for some reason, she had seen something unusual in his eyes just now.\n\nAnd this man was her husband; today, she found him somewhat unfathomable.\n\nThe instruments were reconnected, but the display screen still showed a flat line.\n\nThe two young nurses stood by, somewhat at a loss.\n\nCouldn't be saved?\n\nEven if he put the soul back,\n\nStill couldn't be saved?\n\nA sense of loss spread through Zhou Ze's heart.\n\n\"Beep...beep...beep...\"\n\nJust then,\n\nThe previously flat line suddenly wavered,\n\nDr. Lin looked at the display screen with shock,\n\nThis,\n\nWas it a medical miracle?\n\n..................\n\nIt was already evening when they drove home from the hospital. Zhou Ze sat in the passenger seat, and Dr. Lin drove. They still weren't speaking.\n\nSilence seemed to be the default for a married couple's relationship. However, usually it was Xu Le who tried to break the silence, but today, it was Dr. Lin.\n\n\"Have you studied medicine?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Your technique just now was very professional.\" Dr. Lin could tell.\n\n\"I had some training when I was learning to drive,\" Zhou Ze casually made up an excuse.\n\n\"But you don't have a driver's license.\" Dr. Lin frowned slightly.\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze.\n\nHmm, Zhou Ze silently scorned Xu Le in his heart again.\n\nDr. Lin didn't intend to delve deeper, only saying, \"Today, thank you for your persistence.\"\n\n\"No need to thank me.\" Zhou Ze waved his hand. As... at least he still considered himself a doctor. Saving a patient really didn't require thanks.\n\nThe girl still hadn't woken up, remaining in a coma, but at least there was hope.\n\n\"I'll thank you on behalf of that girl.\" Dr. Lin picked up her phone and checked the time. \"It's almost eight, my parents are still waiting for us to come home for dinner.\"\n\nParents?\n\nZhou Ze suddenly felt a headache coming on.\n\nWas he about to meet his in-laws already?\n\nThe car entered a high-end residential complex. Tongcheng is close to Shanghai, geographically located on opposite sides of the Yangtze River estuary from Shanghai. While it's not as astronomically expensive as Shanghai, housing prices here are still not cheap.\n\nDr. Lin parked the car and walked inside, Zhou Ze following behind her. They entered the elevator, came out together, and Dr. Lin unlocked a door.\n\nThe house was well-decorated, with a split-level layout. Actually, one could tell from the car Dr. Lin drove that her family was quite well-off.\n\nOf course, his current status as a \"live-in son-in-law\" also served as proof; after all, a family without some money or backing wouldn't take in a live-in son-in-law.\n\nIn the living room, a half-gray-haired old man in a sweater was sitting on the sofa watching TV, a rerun of the News Broadcast. He was watching with great interest.\n\nEven when his daughter and son-in-law returned, he merely glanced at them and said nothing.\n\n\"Wanqiu, you're back.\"\n\nThe kitchen door opened, and his mother-in-law peered out. Perhaps, Dr. Lin and her younger sister's heights were inherited from their mother. His mother-in-law was tall, slightly plump now, but still the type who could dominate the \"Sunset Glow\" square and make countless old men and grandpas swoon.\n\nPencils out, take notes, mark this down,\n\nZhou Ze finally knew his wife's full name — Lin Wanqiu.\n\nHis mother-in-law's gaze swept over Zhou Ze, clearly deepening.\n\n\"Old man, dinner's ready, Wanqiu's back.\"\n\n\"Finally, we can eat,\" his sister-in-law walked out of the study. She shook her fist at Zhou Ze, then pursed her lips, signaling Zhou Ze to pay attention to his parents.\n\nThis small gesture was quite good; although this girl was a bit bossy, she wasn't too excessive.\n\nZhou Ze went to the restroom to wash his hands. As he was washing, Lin Wanqiu also came in. They both used hand soap to scrub their hands, both very thoroughly.\n\nLin Wanqiu glanced at Zhou Ze a couple more times, then rinsed her hands and walked into the living room.\n\nZhou Ze also finished rinsing his hands, dried them with a paper towel, and walked out of the restroom.\n\nEveryone had taken their seats. Zhou Ze sat on the chair next to Lin Wanqiu.\n\nHis mother-in-law, with a stern face, brought out the rice bowls one by one, placing Zhou Ze's with noticeably more force.\n\nLuckily,\n\nShe wasn't so petty as to not serve him rice.\n\nZhou Ze thought to himself.\n\n\"Xu Le, do you think we treat you badly?\" His mother-in-law asked, even before starting to eat.\n\n\"Quite well,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\n\"Then why didn't you come home last night? Who are you giving attitude to—\"\n\n\"Mom, let's eat. He had some things going on at his shop, he told me about it.\" Lin Wanqiu spoke up.\n\nHis mother-in-law and father-in-law exchanged glances, a bit surprised that their eldest daughter was actually willing to speak up for this son-in-law. This made them somewhat unaccustomed, and for a moment, they forgot to continue their scolding.\n\nHis sister-in-law, watching from the side, was also a bit surprised. Her sister usually didn't care much about this so-called brother-in-law. Had the sun risen from the west today?\n\n\"Let's eat,\" his father-in-law picked up his chopsticks and motioned. \"You eat too.\" His father-in-law specifically pointed at Zhou Ze with his chopsticks.\n\nHmm, this action was a bit impolite, but it was fine. It indicated that last night's incident was over.\n\n\"Wanqiu, have a piece of braised pork. Mom stewed it for a long time.\"\n\nHis mother-in-law put a piece of meat in her eldest daughter's and younger daughter's bowls, then hesitated for a moment and put a piece of meat in her son-in-law's bowl as well.\n\nOnly then did Zhou Ze realize he hadn't eaten anything all day, not since his body had been reanimated last night, through the morning and noon.\n\nHe didn't stand on ceremony,\n\nPicked up the meat, put it in his mouth,\n\nImmediately after,\n\nZhou Ze's expression stiffened,\n\nAn unexpected wave of nausea surged from his heart, even his stomach began to cramp wildly.\n\n\"Ugh...\" Zhou Ze dry-heaved directly, as if what he was eating was poison.\n\n\"...\" Mother-in-law.\n\n\"...\" Father-in-law.\n\nThe atmosphere at the dinner table,\n\nInstantly turned to ice.",

    "content": "\"Excuse me.\"\n\nZhou Ze reached out, indicating he hadn't meant it, because it was too much of a slap in the face, especially without knowing why \"Xu Le,\" this live-in son-in-law, was so disliked by his in-laws.\n\n\"Feeling unwell?\" Doctor Lin asked, putting down his chopsticks.\n\n\"No, no.\"\n\nZhou Ze picked up his chopsticks again and shoveled rice into his mouth.\n\nBut just as it reached his mouth and before he could swallow,\n\nHis stomach spasmed again, and a strong sense of nausea rose from deep within him, as if what he was about to swallow wasn't rice, but its son, *mitian'gong*.\n\n\"Pfft...\"\n\nThis time,\n\nZhou Ze spat out all the rice from his mouth,\n\nSpraying it onto his in-laws' faces, who were sitting opposite him.\n\nHis father-in-law's glasses and hair were speckled with rice,\n\nHis mother-in-law's coiled hair was also shiny with white flecks.\n\n\"Splat!\"\n\nHis father-in-law's chopsticks fell, and his face twitched a few times, seemingly still processing what emotion to display in the current situation.\n\nHis mother-in-law, however, took a deep breath, her eyes burning with fury!\n\nThis was,\n\nGiving face only to have it rejected!¹\n\n\"Snap!\"\n\nHis mother-in-law pushed her chair back and stood up.\n\n\"Xu Le!\"\n\nHis mother-in-law was a retired head nurse, so she knew that even if someone was sick, they couldn't spray rice so exaggeratedly. Moreover, Xu Le didn't look like he was \"on the verge of death.\"\n\nHe was doing this on purpose,\n\nHe must be doing this on purpose!\n\nHe was rebelling!\n\nRebelling!\n\nZhou Ze clutched his chest, left the dining table, and rushed into the bathroom, lifting the toilet lid and dry-heaving desperately.\n\nThis time, he even vomited bile, leaving a bitter taste in his mouth.\n\nThis meal was ruined.\n\nDoctor Lin looked at Xu Le, who was still vomiting in the bathroom, and directly told her younger sister:\n\n\"Xiao Yi, go cook some noodles.\"\n\n\"Oh, okay.\"\n\nHer sister-in-law stuck out her tongue. She also felt that her brother-in-law was taking things a bit too far today, so she immediately left the table to prepare some plain noodles in the kitchen.\n\n\"Outrageous, that scoundrel!\"\n\nHis father-in-law slapped the table and took off his glasses to shake them clean. Xu Le's father-in-law was a retired vice-dean and always paid great attention to his demeanor. Today, it had really crossed his line.\n\n\"I'm going to ask that fellow what we ever did to him! We didn't ask for a single penny of betrothal money for the wedding, and we even paid for him to open that money-losing bookstore. Where did we ever wrong him?!\"\n\nHis mother-in-law was about to go to the bathroom.\n\n\"Mom, clean this up. He's not feeling well.\"\n\nDoctor Lin began clearing the mostly untouched plates from the table.\n\n\"He's like this and you're still defending him?\" His mother-inlaw, seething, pointed at her daughter and scolded.\n\n\"What else? Who was it that forced me to marry by threatening to hang themselves?\" Doctor Lin looked directly at her mother, her beautiful face looking particularly resolute at this moment.\n\nHis mother-in-law was speechless for a moment. Indeed, it was they who had forced their daughter to marry. They were desperate for a grandson, so they went to great lengths to recruit Xu Le as a live-in son-in-law. Their reasoning was simple: she and her husband only had two daughters, so they had no choice but to take in a live-in son-in-law so that their grandson would carry their family name. Xu Le's parents were gone, and he was a college graduate, which met their criteria.\n\n\"I'm not eating.\"\n\nHis father-in-law avoided his daughter's gaze. He had been the one who had personally made the decision, and now, thinking back, he did feel he had wronged his daughter. He stood up and returned to his study.\n\n\"Oh, old man, you have stomach problems!\" His mother-in-law called out anxiously.\n\n\"Mom, later take a bowl of noodles to Dad.\"\n\nDoctor Lin cleared the table, then walked towards the bathroom.\n\nHis mother-in-law watched her daughter's back and said no more.\n\nPushing open the glass door of the bathroom, Doctor Lin saw Zhou Ze kneeling by the toilet, one hand gripping the rim, the other clutching his chest.\n\n\"Are you uncomfortable?\"\n\n\"I'm fine.\" Zhou Ze replied. He had been perfectly fine before dinner; who knew he'd become like this just as he was about to eat?\n\n\"I told Xiao Yi to cook some noodles. You can eat them later...\"\n\n\"Ugh...\"\n\nAt the thought of noodles, Zhou Ze felt a strong wave of nausea again from deep within him, and he started dry-heaving.\n\nLin Wanqiu frowned slightly,\n\n\"Should we go to the hospital?\"\n\n\"No need, it's fine. I won't eat.\"\n\nZhou Ze waved his hand, stood up with difficulty, and went to the sink to rinse his mouth and wash his face.\n\nTonight's dinner was destined to end unhappily.\n\nHis in-laws and sister-in-law lived on the first floor, while Zhou Ze and Lin Wanqiu's bedroom was on the second floor.\n\nAfter cleaning himself up, Zhou Ze took a quick shower. Since he didn't know where his change of clothes was, he decided not to change yet, still wearing his previous clothes with wet hair as he went upstairs. Just as he exited the stairwell, he found Lin Wanqiu showering in the second-floor bathroom.\n\nZhou Ze stood outside the bathroom door for a while, looking at the graceful figure reflected inside, and lightly licked his lips.\n\nPeople are always most impulsive at such times, and of course, also most grateful.\n\n\"Thank you.\"\n\nZhou Ze muttered to himself,\n\nThis was the first time in two days since his soul had possessed this body that Zhou Ze had praised that unlucky ghost Xu Le.\n\nAlthough you left behind an incredibly troublesome interpersonal relationship, your wife is truly beautiful.\n\nWith a touch of fantasy, a hint of excitement, a bit of impatience, and some anticipation,\n\nZhou Ze pushed open the bedroom door,\n\nThen,\n\nZhou Ze's expression changed, and he bit his lip,\n\nInternally, he once again dragged out the Xu Le he had just praised and lashed him furiously ten thousand times.\n\nThe bedroom was large,\n\nWith a large bed,\n\nAnd next to the large bed,\n\nThere was a floor bed!\n\nWhat did this mean? Even an idiot would know!\n\nWas that guy's brain sick?\n\nWas that guy an imbecile?\n\nWhat was the point of being a live-in son-in-law like that?\n\nZhou Ze took three deep breaths, then silently lay down on the floor bed.\n\nSleep,\n\nNo more fussing,\n\nNo more thinking.\n\nSee if he could make some money, become independent, and then whether it was divorce or something else, resolve this complicated relationship. He had many problems to face after coming back to life in someone else's body.\n\nLin Wanqiu finished her shower and walked out, wearing a loose blue nightgown that looked a bit baggy on her.\n\nZhou Ze, lying on the floor bed, subconsciously swallowed.\n\n\"Get up,\" Lin Wanqiu said.\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\n\"You've always slept on the bed, and I've slept on the floor,\" Lin Wanqiu said.\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze silently got up and went to the bed.\n\nLin Wanqiu turned off the light and lay down on the floor bed.\n\nPerhaps this was her compensation for not wanting to share a bed with Xu Le; she slept on the floor.\n\nZhou Ze sighed,\n\nAnd prepared to sleep.\n\nHalf an hour later, he wasn't asleep, so he turned over.\n\nAn hour later, he wasn't asleep, so he turned over.\n\nUntil three hours later, it was already past midnight, and he still wasn't asleep.\n\nHis eyelids were heavy, but he just couldn't fall asleep.\n\nLin Wanqiu, on the floor bed, was breathing steadily, probably asleep.\n\nZhou Ze swore it wasn't because a beautiful woman was sleeping next to him that he was restless and couldn't sleep;\n\nHe was very tired and exhausted, after all, so much had happened today.\n\nBut he just couldn't sleep.\n\nLying in bed, Zhou Ze simply opened his eyes and looked at his hands.\n\nToday, he had used these hands to save that little girl's life. Although she hadn't woken up yet, her vital signs were back; she could still be saved.\n\nWas this a special ability he gained after going through hell?\n\nOr,\n\nWas it something the old man left behind when he grabbed his wrist before he died?\n\nHowever,\n\nIt felt pretty good.\n\nAs a doctor, with such a pair of hands, how many lives could he save?\n\nThis was an ability that transcended medical technology and understanding, capable of even allowing him to surpass the likes of Hua Tuo and Bian Que. Practitioners in every field hoped to one day surpass their predecessors; perhaps it wasn't for money or fame, but a kind of... sentiment.\n\nBut it was at this moment that,\n\nZhou Ze suddenly felt a spasm in both his arms, and intense pain rapidly struck.\n\n\"Hiss...\"\n\nZhou Ze gasped, curling up on the bed.\n\nBut the pain continued, and it was escalating!\n\nZhou Ze was in so much pain that cold sweat poured out of him. Unable to bear it, he got out of bed and walked out of the bedroom.\n\nHe went into the bathroom. Without turning on the light, he sat on the toilet. At this moment, Zhou Ze saw veins on both his arms, all the way to his fingernails, that looked like they were about to burst.\n\nThe pain originated from them, as if something was pounding on his bone marrow.\n\nDamn it,\n\nWhat in the world was going on?!\n\nZhou Ze's face began to contort.\n\nThis feeling made him wish he were dead, even making him feel the urge to grab a cleaver and chop off his arms.\n\nIn a trance, he seemed to recall the scene of himself lying in a frozen coffin, about to be pushed into the incinerator,\n\nAnd he also recalled fragments of stumbling aimlessly through hell towards the end.\n\nWas this a curse?\n\nWas this a punishment?\n\nWhy was I being punished?\n\nWhat did I do wrong?\n\nBecause I smuggled myself back?\n\nBecause I'm not alive, so God is punishing me?\n\nOr... was it because I used it to save someone today?\n\nYes, that must be the reason.\n\nZhou Ze took a deep breath. Because he used that ability to save someone, he broke some rule and suffered a backlash?\n\nThen,\n\nIf he were to go kill that girl now, would the pain stop?\n\nIn Zhou Ze's eyes, a hint of black mist began to gather, though he was completely unaware.\n\n\"Uncle, you can't smoke in the hospital.\"\n\nThe little girl's voice reappeared in Zhou Ze's mind.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head violently,\n\nNo,\n\nI saved her, I saved her!\n\nI don't regret it,\n\nNo regrets!\n\n...\n\n\"Mom, are you still not done?\"\n\n\"I just started. You can go to the second-floor bathroom.\"\n\n\"Alright.\"\n\nHis sister-in-law went up to the second floor. She really couldn't hold it anymore. The second-floor bathroom light wasn't on, so she pushed the door open and walked in.\n\nThen,\n\nAt that moment,\n\nZhou Ze looked up at her,\n\nAnd she looked at Zhou Ze,\n\nIn Zhou Ze's eyes, black mist swirled, carrying an immense deterrent force—a gaze like that of a malevolent spirit crawled from hell, resentful and deranged.\n\n\"Ah ah ah ah ah ah!!!!!!\"\n\nHis sister-in-law screamed,\n\nThen she fell to the floor,\n\nShe looked at Zhou Ze,\n\nZhou Ze was also looking at her,\n\nThen, Zhou Ze saw that under his sister-in-law's pajamas—it was wet, and there was an unharmonious liquid on the tiles...\n\nShe had been,\n\nScared so badly she wet herself?\n\n---\n¹ Literally, \"giving face but not wanting it,\" an idiom meaning to reject someone's kindness or goodwill despite having been given an opportunity to accept it gracefully.",

    "content": "A scream woke the family;\n\nIt was understandable.\n\nWalking into a dark bathroom late at night, needing to pee, and suddenly opening the door to see someone inside—that’s startling enough. Most people have probably experienced something similar.\n\nWhat’s more, what the sister-in-law encountered was a ghost.\n\nLin Wanqiu came out of the bedroom and pulled her younger sister up.\n\n\"What's wrong, what's wrong!\"\n\nHer father-in-law and mother-in-law also came up from the first floor. They saw their younger daughter crying in her sister’s arms, then looked at Zhou Ze, who was still sitting on the toilet.\n\n\"You scoundrel, Xu Le, you’ve lost your mind! You’re putting ideas into my younger daughter’s head!\"\n\nThe mother-in-law picked up the broom from the bathroom doorway, ready to hit Xu Le.\n\nThe father-in-law was the same, fuming and ready to come in and teach his scoundrel son-in-law a lesson.\n\nIt was understandable,\n\nSeeing this scene,\n\nEveryone would naturally jump to that conclusion.\n\nThe brother-in-law had gone mad,\n\nAnd was acting improperly towards his sister-in-law.\n\nAfter all, as the saying goes, half of the sister-in-law is the brother-in-law’s*.\n\n\"Dad, Mom, Xiaoyi was scared when she went into the bathroom,\" Dr. Lin said.\n\nThe mother-in-law froze, the broom in her hand raised but unsure where to put it.\n\nThe father-in-law also paused, then awkwardly backed away a few steps.\n\nDistracted by the commotion, Zhou Ze suddenly realized that the blue veins on his arms had receded at some point, and the intense pain had also disappeared.\n\nHe felt so tired, so sleepy, and wanted to sleep.\n\nHe stood up, ready to leave the bathroom. As for his in-laws, Zhou Ze was too lazy to fuss about it; he had no interest in cleaning up the mess left by that coward Xu Le.\n\nHowever, when Zhou Ze stood up, his sister-in-law immediately shivered several times in fright, hiding deeper into her sister’s arms.\n\n\"Ah! Don't come near me! Don't come near me!\"\n\nZhou Ze frowned slightly. What did she see just now?\n\n\"What exactly is going on!\" The mother-in-law put her hands on her hips, asking her younger daughter. This didn’t look like just being scared. \"Xiaoyi, my dear, tell Mom, what exactly happened? Did he… did he do something to you?\"\n\nThe sister-in-law was still very honest, and she knew that she couldn't lie about this, otherwise the situation would become very serious.\n\n\"No, I came to use the toilet, opened the door, and saw him sitting there. It was too scary!\"\n\nAfter gathering her courage to say this, the sister-in-law buried her head in her sister's arms again.\n\nAlright,\n\nIt was ultimately a misunderstanding.\n\n\"You blockhead, going to the bathroom at night and not turning on the light?\n\nDo you think my house is your house? So stingy,\n\nCan't bear to spend a little on electricity!\n\nIf you scare my daughter into something serious, what will you use to compensate...\"\n\nThe mother-in-law began to scold Zhou Ze, her finger almost poking his face.\n\nZhou Ze was very tired at this moment. When a person is severely sleep-deprived, their temper tends to be very irritable. Moreover, Zhou Ze was already fed up with the terrible relationships Xu Le had left him.\n\nIf they hadn't been sleeping in separate beds,\n\nZhou Ze might not have erupted,\n\nBut now that they were even sleeping in separate beds,\n\nZhou Ze was too lazy to endure this snobbish mother-in-law’s anger any longer.\n\n\"Slap!\"\n\nZhou Ze waved his hand, directly swatting away the mother-in-law’s finger pointing at him,\n\n\"Don't bother me.\"\n\nThe mother-in-law's eyes widened. She clearly couldn't believe that her son-in-law, who was always so timid, dared to speak to her like that.\n\n\"How dare you speak to your mother like that? Have you no manners!\" At this moment, the father-in-law spoke up, scolding him.\n\n\"If you want your daughter to be a second-time bride, then keep talking to me about manners!\"\n\nZhou Ze retorted directly, then elbowed his father-in-law aside and walked back to the bedroom.\n\nWith a \"bang!\", he slammed the door shut forcefully.\n\n\"Outrageous, outrageous!\" The father-in-law's chest heaved with anger.\n\nThe mother-in-law quickly came to her husband's side to soothe his chest.\n\nBut neither of them dared to continue the argument,\n\nAfter all,\n\nZhou Ze’s words just now held great deterrence for them.\n\nAlthough they didn't know what was wrong with their timid son-in-law, who usually couldn't even fart with eight sticks, he was right. If their eldest daughter divorced, her next marriage would be a second one, which would harm her reputation and their family's.\n\nMoreover, in their eyes, a woman who remarries is worth less and won't find a good family.\n\nIn truth, a person's character and whether their thinking is feudal have little to do with their education or family background; it really depends on the individual's own moral standards.\n\nFor instance, at this moment, Xu Le's parents-in-law, no matter how angry they were, dared not provoke their scoundrel son-in-law anymore, fearing he might really jump up and demand a divorce.\n\nZhou Ze lay on the bed, breathing deeply, eyes closed, intending to sleep. He was truly exhausted.\n\nAbout fifteen minutes later,\n\nZhou Ze heard a knock on the bedroom door:\n\n\"Xiaoyi is scared, I’m going to sleep with her tonight.\"\n\nIt was Lin Wanqiu's voice, and then she left.\n\nAs if you actually slept with me;\n\n…………\n\nThe next day at noon,\n\nHis in-laws were having lunch.\n\n\"Did he go to the bookstore?\" The father-in-law asked the mother-in-law.\n\n\"He hasn't gotten up yet,\" the mother-in-law said resentfully.\n\n\"Unbecoming,\" the father-in-law commented.\n\n\"Exactly...\"\n\nAt this moment, the mother-in-law suddenly stopped speaking, because she saw Zhou Ze coming down from upstairs. Zhou Ze's eyes were red, and he had severe bags under them.\n\nThe atmosphere was a bit stagnant.\n\nPerhaps because of what happened last night, Zhou Ze's status as the live-in son-in-law in this household had somewhat risen. At least, at this moment, his in-laws didn't say anything more to provoke him.\n\nOf course, it was also because Zhou Ze’s current appearance looked exactly like someone who might pull out a knife and start cutting at any moment.\n\nHis gaze swept over the dinner table.\n\nZhou Ze covered his chest with his hand.\n\nThe aroma of rice,\n\nThe aroma of meat,\n\nSo disgusting,\n\nHe felt like throwing up again.\n\nZhou Ze walked out of the house, breathing in the slightly cool, fresh air outside, and felt a bit better.\n\nHis head felt a little muddled. Zhou Ze began wandering and strolling alone on the street. He needed to quietly think about some things, but his current state of extreme sleepiness yet inability to sleep made it difficult for him to truly calm down.\n\nIt was complicated,\n\nAnd uncomfortable,\n\nLike walking out of an internet café after two consecutive all-nighters, or like a middle school student who had stayed up all night reading novels under the covers and then had to get up early for school the next day.\n\nWalking and walking, Zhou Ze suddenly stopped. The surroundings felt somewhat familiar.\n\nThen he saw the sign ahead,\n\nTongcheng First Affiliated Hospital.\n\nHe had actually walked to his old workplace. Ha, perhaps it was because Tongcheng was too small.\n\nZhou Ze walked into the hospital, not for a stroll down memory lane, but to try to get some sleeping pills;\n\nNot eating, he could still manage for a while, at most drinking enough water to feel full for now, but not sleeping was prolonged torture.\n\nThe familiar hospital, the familiar work environment. Zhou Ze saw his own photo on the photo album of the emergency department on the ground floor of the building had turned grayscale.\n\nThen he subconsciously walked to his original office. His desk had been taken over by someone else. A middle-aged doctor with a lot of pockmarks sat in his spot. He glanced at the nameplate on the desk; the last name was Kang.\n\nHe let out a long sigh, feeling a little nostalgic.\n\nZhou Ze temporarily forgot about getting sleeping pills. Perhaps this feeling of \"things are not what they used to be\" temporarily suppressed the torment of sleepiness. Zhou Ze began to stroll around the hospital.\n\nHe was savoring every bit of his life here,\n\nHis work,\n\nHis life,\n\nAnd,\n\nHis past,\n\nOr rather, his previous life.\n\nHe couldn’t go back, he really couldn’t go back, Zhou Ze murmured to himself.\n\nThen, unknowingly, he found himself walking down the stairs and arriving at the basement.\n\nHe stood still. As a doctor who had worked here for many years, he knew the layout of this floor.\n\nSome equipment storage rooms, and then, the morgue.\n\nHe remembered lying in the hospital morgue once, and then being made up by a mortician there.\n\nHe started walking again, heading towards the morgue.\n\nZhou Ze wanted to see the place where he once lay. This was his self-explanation for walking there, but in reality, a special, mysterious feeling was guiding him forward.\n\nAs he walked, Zhou Ze saw the morgue door. It had an electronic password lock. Coincidentally, Zhou Ze remembered the password. Other doctors might not have much interaction with this place, but Zhou Ze used to be in the emergency department. People sent to the emergency room were usually severely injured or ill patients, and some inevitably wouldn't survive, needing to be placed here.\n\nIn fact, this hospital also served as a police morgue. Some unidentified bodies or those requiring further \"processing\" would be temporarily placed here. This was common practice in many places; if local police departments lacked sufficient facilities or forensic personnel, bodies were often kept in local funeral homes or hospitals.\n\nHe entered the password.\n\nThe lock clicked open.\n\nZhou Ze walked in.\n\nA chill permeated the air,\n\nNot a kind that pricked the skin,\n\nBut a profound coldness that seemed to mask the warmth of one's very core.\n\nInside the morgue, of course, lay corpses. This was a temporary resting place for the deceased.\n\nLogically, there should have been an attendant outside, but for some reason, Zhou Ze didn't see anyone when he walked in. Perhaps the person had gone off somewhere.\n\nZhou Ze walked among them. Several bodies were laid out on cold gurneys, covered with white sheets. One body was wrapped in a flowery household quilt, and judging by the silver hair on the exposed head, the deceased was likely an old grandmother.\n\nDue to his profession, Zhou Ze was not particularly afraid of corpses, and moreover, he was now a ghost himself.\n\nZhou Ze walked to the morgue freezer, which consisted of layers of pull-out drawers.\n\nThe freezers containing bodies had labels on the outside, recording the deceased's name, gender, and other information.\n\nZhou Ze pulled open an empty freezer, reached inside, closed his eyes, and slowly felt, gradually entering a state of trance, as if only here could he find peace.\n\nAfter a moment of hesitation, Zhou Ze lay down.\n\n\"Creak...\"\n\nThe freezer slowly slid inward, until it finally closed.\n\nQuiet,\n\nCold,\n\nSilent,\n\nZhou Ze slowly closed his eyelids.\n\nSleepiness washed over him.\n\nHe finally found the feeling of sleep,\n\nBut he couldn't sleep just yet,\n\nBecause he didn't know,\n\nWho had just stood outside and helped him push the freezer in...\n\n---\n* The original idiom \"小姨子有半片那啥是姐夫的\" literally translates to \"a sister-in-law has half a 'that' for her brother-in-law.\" It's a vulgar folk saying implying an intimate or even sexual relationship between a brother-in-law and his sister-in-law, often hinting at impropriety or temptation. It's used here to convey the in-laws' immediate, crude assumption.",

    "content": "Zhou Ze began to kick outwards with both feet, trying to get out, but a \"click-clack\" sound came from outside, meaning the lock on the ice coffin had been fastened.\n\nLocked in, unable to get out.\n\nFor a moment, Zhou Ze felt as if he was back in the narrow coffin he'd been placed in.\n\nOnly this time, Zhou Ze wasn't frantic or enraged. He just reached up and tapped the metal plate near his head:\n\n\"Something wrong?\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't believe someone had come here to push his ice coffin in and then lock it, unless that person was a mentally deranged lunatic, and Zhou Ze didn't think his luck could be that bad.\n\nBesides,\n\nAfter entering the morgue, he had closed the door. A lunatic who knew the morgue door's password?\n\nDo you believe it?\n\nSo, Zhou Ze could only assume that some \"thing\" had \"helped\" him, and helped very thoroughly.\n\nHowever, after that query, the outside remained silent.\n\nZhou Ze simply gave up, closed his eyes again, and prepared to get some good sleep.\n\nHe fell asleep very quickly.\n\nAfter all, he hadn't closed his eyes for two days, and a lot had happened in those two days, accumulating an incredibly frightening amount of fatigue.\n\nEven if I die and the world floods,\nNo one can stop me from sleeping now.\n\n…………\n\nHe didn't know how long he had slept, but when Zhou Ze opened his eyes, he felt refreshed and invigorated, a long-lost surge of energy, though his body was also frozen stiff.\n\nThe stiffness of his body was somewhat terrifying. Zhou Ze tried to wiggle his body a few times in the narrow space, and a series of \"crisp sounds\" came, so comfortable that he unconsciously made a noise.\n\nAt this moment, Zhou Ze's fingernails naturally grew long and black, shimmering with an unusual luster. The stiffness in his body and the cold that would be unbearable for an ordinary person were slowly gathering at his fingertips.\n\nThe entire process didn't last long, but it made Zhou Ze no longer feel cold or uncomfortable.\n\nHe instinctively kicked again, and the ice coffin slid out naturally.\n\nThe lock,\nIt was unlocked?\n\nZhou Ze was a bit surprised. He sat up from the steel plate, got out, and then pushed it back in.\n\nHis clothes were stiff, hanging on him like cardboard, giving him a very uncomfortable feeling, and Zhou Ze's gaze swept around.\n\nThe affiliated hospital's morgue wasn't very large; compared to those in big city hospitals, it even seemed a bit shy, but there were still quite a few bodies stored inside.\n\nZhou Ze didn't know who had helped him push it in earlier, and trying to find them now was indeed a bit difficult.\n\nFortunately, since the other party had unlocked the latch while he was asleep, Zhou Ze didn't plan to cause any more trouble here.\n\nHe walked towards the morgue door, intending to leave, but as he passed by the beds covered with white sheets, Zhou Ze stopped.\n\nThose bodies covered with white sheets showed no abnormalities,\nIncluding the old woman wrapped in her family's floral quilt, she also seemed unchanged.\n\nBut Zhou Ze still stopped,\nBecause he remembered that this old woman's head and feet were reversed from how they were when she lay down.\n\nIt was impossible that the morgue attendant came in while he was sleeping and did nothing else but flip the old woman around.\n\nZhou Ze stood beside the old woman and said:\n\"If it's you, and you don't come out now, I'm leaving.\"\n\nThe old woman pushing him in and then locking him up might have been malicious, but her silently unlocking the door for him again meant she wasn't trying to harm him.\n\nPerhaps someone was about to come, and seeing an unlocked dark cabinet might have led to his discovery.\n\nAfter all, it was very obvious from the outside whether these dark cabinets were locked or not.\n\nHe waited for half a minute, with no abnormalities, Zhou Ze decided not to wait anymore.\n\nJust as he was about to turn and leave, a sigh came from behind him.\n\nZhou Ze found this feeling annoying.\nWavering,\nPlaying hard to get,\nShe was an old woman when she died, yet she insisted on acting like a young girl.\n\nAlright, age discrimination is indeed wrong, but normal people's tolerance for beautiful female ghosts is always a bit higher, which is only human nature.\n\nIf Nie Xiaoqian had a face full of wrinkles and yellow teeth, do you think Ning Caichen would still have an interspecies romance with her?\n\nZhou Ze turned around and looked behind him.\nAn old woman with a head full of silver hair was crouching there, holding a faded handkerchief and wiping away tears.\n\nBut ghosts don't have tears, so from Zhou Ze's perspective, the old woman seemed to be wailing dryly.\n\n\"Keep crying, I won't disturb you.\"\n\nZhou Ze prepared to leave.\nHe realized he was ultimately a common man, even when looking at ghosts, he was a bit of an aesthetician.\n\n\"Help me, I have money,\" the old woman suddenly spoke.\n\n\"Mhm,\" Zhou Ze responded. He needed money.\n\nThat damn Xu Le had less than two hundred yuan combined in his Alipay and WeChat accounts, plus the eleven hundred returned by the \"murderer,\" meaning Zhou Ze's total assets were currently less than thirteen hundred.\n\nAnd Zhou Ze's previous life's house, savings, and assets should have all been donated to the orphanage, so he was essentially alone.\n\n\"My money is in the hidden compartment of my cabinet, an old yellow-lacquered wardrobe, there's thirty thousand yuan, and also my dowry from when I got married, jade hairpins, jade bracelets. I don't know how much they're worth.\nI died suddenly, and I hadn't had time to tell my sons, I'm afraid they won't know.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded, \"I'll take a portion.\"\n\nThe old woman looked conflicted but still nodded, \"That's fair.\"\n\nThe old woman knew that without Zhou Ze, this \"anomaly,\" to relay the message, her sons might never find the wealth she left behind.\n\n………………\n\nAfter leaving the hospital, Zhou Ze took a taxi directly to a place called \"Xingdong Town\" in Tongzhou District. It wasn't very far, and Tongcheng's airport was in this town.\n\nEarlier, at the hospital, Zhou Ze had inquired at the registration desk. The old woman had been sent to the hospital and died after resuscitation failed. Her family then simply left her body at the hospital and still owed a sum in medical expenses.\n\nAbout half an hour later, Zhou Ze arrived in the town and, following the old woman's description, found the village.\n\nIt was a self-built two-story house, with a small brick outhouse similar to a rural privy attached to it.\n\nWhen Zhou Ze arrived, he found several workers dismantling the house, specifically the brick outhouse.\n\nZhou Ze walked over, offered a worker a cigarette, and asked, \"Still busy so close to New Year's?\"\n\n\"Gotta make more money before New Year's, anyway, we're all from the same village,\" the bricklayer master said quite openly.\n\n\"What's going on with this house?\" Zhou Ze asked while looking inside. Two workers were already lifting the roof, and the brick walls of the small house were being dismantled to be reused later. Inside, let alone the yellow-lacquered cabinet the old woman mentioned, there wasn't even a small stool to be seen; it was empty.\n\n\"Their old lady died. This house used to be where their old lady lived alone. Now they plan to knock it down and build a new kitchen,\" the master leaned his head in, let Zhou Ze light his cigarette, and smiled somewhat cautiously, saying, \"See, that one who just walked past in front of the house is their eldest son.\"\n\nZhou Ze looked over and saw that the man, whose hair was also turning white, still had some bruises on his face.\n\n\"There are five brothers, and they got into a fight over the few coins their old lady left behind. When these bricks are taken down later, the other four will also come to divide them.\n\nYou say, times have changed, huh? Their old lady's body is still in the hospital and hasn't been claimed yet, and none of the brothers are willing to pay back the owed medical fees.\"\n\n\"What about the old woman's belongings in the house?\" Zhou Ze was focused on this. From the old woman's description, the thirty thousand yuan in the cabinet was her life's savings, but those jade bracelets and jade hairpins were the truly valuable items; selling them would likely fetch a few hundred thousand yuan without much trouble.\n\n\"Sold to the scrap collector, cleared out long ago. It was sold when the old woman first got hospitalized,\" the master took another deep drag on his cigarette. \"I'm going back to work.\"\n\nZhou Ze licked his lips with a wry smile. This trip of his was for nothing.\n\nNot only did he not get a share of what the old woman left behind, but her sons also wouldn't benefit from it, only cheapening it for some old furniture dealer.\n\nZhou Ze was a bit vexed now. No money was indeed a big problem. He wasn't willing to use his abilities to swindle money, although it seemed easy and satisfying, but saving a girl last night almost killed him from pain. Heaven knows what problems would arise if he continued to mess around.\n\nWhether there were gods three feet above his head, Zhou Ze didn't know.\nBut digging three feet down continuously, there certainly was hell, because he had been there.\n\nHe knew he wasn't human, and this was the human world. Moreover, he vividly remembered how the patient who died in front of him had screamed in terror, \"I've been found,\" before his death.\n\nHowever,\nMoney,\nZhou Ze wanted to grind the mill,\nBut who would give him money?\n\nZhou Ze needed money now, not to mention getting rid of his \"live-in son-in-law\" status.\nHe at least needed to buy himself a freezer or a large refrigerator, right?\nOtherwise, he'd have to go to the hospital morgue every day to freeload on the cold air?\n\nFeeling a bit depressed, he lit a cigarette and took a deep drag, feeling very vexed.\n\nJust then, his phone rang in his pocket. Zhou Ze picked it up; it was an unknown number. He answered:\n\n\"Hello,\" Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Brother, the goods have been safely delivered. When are you coming to inspect them? The police have been checking very strictly lately. It wasn't easy to get this batch of goods in,\" the person on the other end of the line said in a low, cautious voice.\n\nZhou Ze slowly opened his mouth,\nMaking no sound,\nAt the same time,\nXu Le's image suddenly began to rise continuously in his mind.",

    "content": "Anxiety, unease, and a touch of secret delight and bewilderment—these were perhaps Zhou Ze's feelings on his taxi ride to the outskirts of Tongcheng.\n\nHe was short on money, very short, but he didn't need a huge sum. A large amount wouldn't be very useful to him, at least not for the time being.\n\nBecause of his resurrection, the entanglements of his past life, and the troubles of his current one, he needed money to resolve things, and then, he would plan for the long term, not squander it or indulge in a life of excess.\n\nFor instance, leaving the Lin family. Although Lin Wanqiu was beautiful and elegant, he was simply too lazy to return to that house. They hadn't had any intimacy, and he hadn't truly enjoyed himself. It seemed Xu Le hadn't truly enjoyed himself either, so there was no sense of obligation.\n\nTherefore, saying \"goodbye\" came with no psychological burden.\n\nBut leaving that house meant making some preparations. He needed a place to stay and a good quality freezer. Zhou Ze didn't dare to buy a used, discarded freezer from a second-hand market. What if something went wrong and he ended up dying while sleeping in it? Wouldn't that be a huge loss?\n\nMoney!\n\nEven as a ghost, he needed money.\n\nBut listening to the person who called Xu Le just now made Zhou Ze feel somewhat uneasy. Xu Le, in his identity as a modern urban live-in son-in-law, so spineless at home, letting his in-laws walk all over him, and sleeping in a separate bed from his wife, turned out to be a hidden gang boss?\n\nWell, this kind of conflicting image was really stimulating and quite fitting for an American drama: extraordinary characters always have very ordinary real-life identities.\n\nLike Spider-Man being a middle school student, or Superman being a reporter for a newspaper.\n\nSo, how should he handle this situation?\n\nHow to deal with those people?\n\nZhou Ze didn't want his current identity to be \"tainted,\" because that would mean endless trouble. In the real world, the police's investigation of him was already something Xu Le couldn't easily handle, not to mention the \"they will find and catch you\" mentioned by the old man and the faceless woman.\n\nFeeling a bit of a headache and some discomfort, Zhou Ze still arrived at the abandoned small chemical fertilizer factory.\n\nTwo people were squatting at the entrance of the fertilizer factory: one wearing a somewhat worn military overcoat, the other a cheap, poor-quality suit.\n\nBoth of them were squatting there, a cigarette in their mouths, puffing away.\n\nZhou Ze paid the fare, got out of the car, and the two immediately stood up and walked towards him.\n\n\"Our boss is waiting for you,\" the man in the military overcoat said gravely.\n\nZhou Ze nodded and followed the military overcoat inside. The man in the suit continued to squat there, smoking, as if keeping watch.\n\nUpon entering, Zhou Ze saw a bald, stout man wearing a gold chain, sitting on a plastic chair, pouring and drinking for himself. Seeing Zhou Ze approach, the stout man immediately stood up,\n\n\"Brother Xu, you've finally arrived.\"\n\nThe stout man was tall, about 1.85 meters. His gold chain was very thick, looking very flashy, and the gold powder rubbed off on his neck by the chain was even more ostentatious.\n\n\"Where's the goods?\"\n\nZhou Ze clasped his hands behind his back, fingers slightly intertwined. There were only three people here. Taking them down wouldn't be a big problem, but what then? Handing them over to the police would surely expose him too, wouldn't it?\n\nShould he deal with them himself, like a vigilante? \"In the name of the Moon, I will punish you!\"? That didn't seem right either. With his sensitive identity, if he casually killed people, it might have the same backlash as casually saving people. He was unwilling to try it lightly.\n\n\"Brother Xu is as straightforward as ever!\"\n\nThe stout man wiped his mouth and then clapped Zhou Ze on the shoulder.\n\nZhou Ze's mouth twitched. He took a deep breath, forcing himself not to slap away the stout man's greasy, fat hand.\n\n\"Come, over here!\"\n\nThe stout man made an inviting gesture, leading Zhou Ze to a small storage room in the back yard.\n\nUpon entering,\n\nZhou Ze's pupils suddenly contracted,\n\nA small mountain of goods, covered with black tarpaulins.\n\nZhou Ze had never done anything illegal before, but he knew that so much *goods*, if judged by law, would be enough for him to be shot hundreds of times over. He could eat so many peanuts* he'd get a stomachache.\n\n\"It's not just Tongcheng, is it?\" Zhou Ze actually wanted to ask, 'Did you just rob a warlord from the Golden Triangle?'\n\n\"Brother Xu, of course. Tongcheng is too small. This batch of goods will eventually use Tongcheng as a springboard to flow into Shanghai.\" The stout man stretched lazily. \"This time, let's hurry and get these goods moving. We can make a fortune.\"\n\nZhou Ze reached up and rubbed his forehead, saying with difficulty, \"It'll be hard to get rid of them in a short time, won't it?\"\n\nAfter all, it wasn't like selling cabbage, where you ride a tricycle with a loudspeaker and shout.\n\n\"Don't worry, Brother Xu. We just need to distribute this batch of goods to the people below. While the profit isn't as high as selling them ourselves, it's fast and guaranteed to move. After this batch is done, we'll get another one,\" the stout man said dismissively.\n\nXu Le, oh Xu Le, you've even built a drug trafficking network. You're truly amazing...\n\nSuch a big boss, yet he was beaten to death by that idiot for three hundred yuan!\n\n\"Brother Xu, come take a look at the quality of this batch of goods.\"\n\nThe stout man said, lifting the tarpaulin,\n\nAnd then Zhou Ze's face showed surprise,\n\nBecause what he saw wasn't a mountain of drugs, but stacks of books and CDs.\n\nCould they be hidden in the books?\n\n\"Brother Xu, thanks to your classmate, getting this batch of goods was easy. These CDs are popular movies still showing in theaters. I even deliberately copied in some ************ for good measure. These pirated books and romance novels are also bestsellers on the market.\n\nAnd Brother Xu, you specially wrote the extended twenty-part, two-million-word sequel to Bai Jie. Many of our sub-distributors pre-ordered this one, so there's no problem selling them.\"\n\n\"The 'goods' you're talking about are these?\" Zhou Ze asked the stout man.\n\n\"Yeah?\" The stout man paused. \"Just these.\"\n\nDisappointment,\n\nGreat disappointment,\n\nExtreme disappointment,\n\nAnd at the same time, a sense of shame,\n\nXu Le was still Xu Le after all. To boost the sales of these pirated items, he actually continued the story of Bai Jie himself.\n\nAnd he wrote a two-million-word sequel.\n\nHow much free time did he have...?\n\n\"How much can I pull out?\" Zhou Ze asked. \"I'm thinking of quitting.\"\n\nIn a business partnership, there should be capital investment.\n\n\"What? Brother Xu, you're thinking of quitting?\" The stout man seemed surprised. \"We're just about to make money, and you want to quit now?\"\n\n\"Yes, this matter doesn't align with my core values. I don't want to do it anymore.\"\n\nZhou Ze said very seriously. He didn't want to take any risks, especially before sorting out his current life. He didn't want to get involved in any potential vortex.\n\n\"...\" the stout man.\n\n\"...\" the military overcoat.\n\n\"Brother Xu, your awareness is high, I admire that. In the early stages, Brother Xu, you invested...\"\n\nThe stout man held up four fingers, saying, \"Twenty thousand yuan.\"\n\n\"Twenty thousand it is then. Give me the money, and the rest has nothing to do with me.\" Zhou Ze couldn't be bothered to quibble over it anymore. Twenty thousand yuan would solve his immediate urgent needs.\n\n\"Alright, I have twenty thousand yuan here.\" The stout man nodded and went to get the money.\n\nAbout fifteen minutes later, Zhou Ze, with twenty thousand yuan in his pocket, hailed a ride-sharing car and started heading back to the city.\n\nHe didn't rush back to the bookstore first but went to an appliance market. He spent over ten thousand yuan on a freezer. This type of freezer was usually used by businesses to store food and meat products, and it was one of the higher-end models. Zhou Ze didn't hesitate to spend the money, after all, he would be relying on it to sleep in the future, and he was afraid of problems with cheaper ones.\n\nThe seller was very enthusiastic and sent a small truck to deliver the freezer directly to... the bookstore entrance.\n\nThe driver and Zhou Ze carried the freezer into the bookstore, and the driver looked a bit surprised.\n\n\"Boss, you run a bookstore, do you really need a freezer?\" the driver asked.\n\nZhou Ze offered him a cigarette. \"Business is tough, so I'm planning to sell some seafood on the side.\"\n\nThe driver took the cigarette and left. His job was done, and he didn't need to worry about anything else.\n\nThe bookstore had a small second floor, which Xu Le originally used to store books. After Zhou Ze cleared it out, he placed the freezer up there. Looking at his \"new bed,\" Zhou Ze finally felt much more at ease.\n\nComing down from the second floor, Zhou Ze noticed someone in his bookstore. It wasn't a customer; it was his \"wife.\"\n\nDoctor Lin was flipping through a magazine. Seeing Zhou Ze come down, she asked, somewhat puzzled, \"What were you busy with up there?\"\n\n\"Organizing goods,\" Zhou Ze answered perfunctorily.\n\n\"I'm off work,\" Doctor Lin said.\n\n\"Hmm.\" *You're off work, but you're not sleeping with me...*\n\n\"That girl woke up.\" Doctor Lin looked pointedly at Zhou Ze. \"Her father wants to treat our department to dinner at the Tongcheng Grand Hotel. You should come too.\"\n\n\"What would I do there?\"\n\n\"The girl kept calling for 'Uncle' after she woke up.\" Doctor Lin asked Zhou Ze, a little curious, \"Did you know her before?\"\n\n\"Even when people are in a coma, they still have some perception, right?\" Zhou Ze continued to make things up. \"When I saved her, she might have actually been able to feel it.\"\n\n\"Are you coming?\" Doctor Lin asked.\n\n\"No, I'm not going,\" Zhou Ze shook his head. \"I'm not hungry, I have no appetite at all.\"\n\nDoctor Lin nodded, not pressing the issue further. She seemed ready to leave, but at the bookstore entrance, she stopped again. \"Are you coming home tonight?\"\n\nThe familiar old question returned,\n\n*If I come home, you still won't sleep with me...*\n\nSo, Zhou Ze answered very decisively:\n\n\"No, I won't be back. I'm a bit busy lately.\"\n\n*Hmm, even though the store's business has already turned as cold as an iced latte.*\n\nDoctor Lin hesitated for a moment, then didn't press, taking her car keys out of her pocket, ready to leave.\n\nJust then,\n\nWith a \"clatter,\"\n\nDoctor Lin turned around and saw her \"husband\" collapsed onto a bookshelf, with books scattered all over the floor.\n\n\"What's wrong with you?\" Doctor Lin immediately rushed over to check on Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze felt his vision blurring, his sight unable to focus. His chest heaved, and his legs suddenly felt weak, as if he had stepped on cotton, completely losing his balance:\n\n\"Fainted from hunger...\"\n\nZhou Ze replied.\n\nHe,\n\nHadn't eaten for several days.\n\n---\n\nFive days after the book was released, it's ranked second on the overall new book list for the same period!\n\nIn the Supernatural category, excluding the monthly pass list (since we're not yet on the shelves for monthly passes), we're number one on all other lists!\n\nYesterday, we were #2 in daily sales on Qidian! Today, #11 in daily sales on Qidian!\n\nAs a new book with thirty thousand words not yet on shelves, Long just wants to say,\n\nBrothers,\n\nAwesome!\n\n---\n* *Peanuts*: In Chinese slang, \"eating peanuts\" (吃花生米) is a euphemism for being executed by firing squad, as the bullets are small like peanuts.",

    "content": "Next to the bookstore was a noodle shop. Its business was quite average, almost as deserted as Zhou Ze’s bookstore.\n\nThis pedestrian street was originally built around a plaza, but the plaza itself was now \"abandoned.\" Besides a cinema, all other businesses inside had moved out or closed, making the entire plaza a \"deserted\" and \"uninhabited\" area.\n\nAt least in Tongcheng, the symptoms of urban overdevelopment were evident. In previous years, commercial centers were heavily planned and built, but Tongcheng was not Shanghai and couldn't attract such a large population.\n\nFortunately, the noodle shop could still do delivery business, and it seemed to be doing well. However, no one would suddenly feel \"hungry\" for knowledge and order books for delivery.\n\nZhou Ze leaned back in his chair, still feeling a bit dizzy. Doctor Lin sat opposite him, meticulously wiping his chopsticks with her own tissue before placing them in front of him.\n\nShe was very careful and considerate, just as she let Xu Le sleep on the bed while she slept on the floor. Yet, she was also very cold.\n\nZhou Ze didn't ask her if she genuinely opposed feudal arranged marriages or if she was a lesbian, because the question was pointless. Zhou Ze himself wasn't interested in the inexplicable social network Xu Le left behind, nor did he feel any attachment to it.\n\n\"Is your body really okay?\" Doctor Lin asked again.\n\n\"Small problem, small problem.\" Zhou Ze was a doctor himself; he knew his eating and sleeping issues were difficult to explain with modern medical theories, let alone treat.\n\nFortunately, the sleeping problem was resolved, but this eating… it was a headache.\n\nNot eating had caused him to faint earlier, but the thought of eating… made him nauseous.\n\n\"You don't have a good appetite. How about a bowl of sour plum juice first?\" The noodle shop owner was around thirty, but his face already showed some wrinkles. The burdens of life seemed quite heavy.\n\n\"Sour plum juice, will it help?\" Zhou Ze asked helplessly.\n\n\"It stimulates the appetite,\" the noodle shop owner smiled, then shouted towards the back room, \"Wife, is the pickled vegetable noodle ready?\"\n\nThe owner went into the back room, and the voices of the couple talking could be heard from there.\n\nZhou Ze looked at the sour plum juice in front of him, took a spoon, scooped a mouthful, and put it in his mouth. As soon as he swallowed, Zhou Ze's face changed.\n\n\"What's wrong?\" Doctor Lin pulled out a tissue and held it near Zhou Ze's chin.\n\nZhou Ze, his face contorted, clutched his stomach, then took a deep breath and said:\n\n\"So sour.\"\n\nYes, so sour that his whole body felt like it was cramping, even overshadowing the nausea.\n\n\"Coming, the noodles are ready!\" The proprietress brought the noodles over, placed them in front of Zhou Ze, and said, \"You can't drink my family's sour plum juice so fast.\"\n\nDoctor Lin looked at the noodles and frowned slightly, \"These noodles are too overcooked.\"\n\nShe meant they were cooked for too long, losing their chewiness and greatly affecting the taste.\n\n\"This… our noodles are just like this,\" the proprietress said, looking a bit apologetic.\n\n\"It's fine, it's fine.\"\n\nZhou Ze waved his hand. Chewy or not, it didn't matter to him right now. As long as he could eat it, that was enough. He needed energy. If he couldn't eat anymore, Zhou Ze would have no choice but to go to the hospital for a glucose IV.\n\nHe solemnly raised his head, feeling as dignified and solemn as a sworn warrior, then abruptly lowered his head and poured the inconceivably sour plum juice into his mouth in one gulp.\n\nHiss…\n\nThat sour sensation,\n\nwas like pouring sulfuric acid into his stomach.\n\nBut then, Zhou Ze directly picked up his chopsticks, grabbed a mouthful of noodles, and shoved them into his mouth, devouring them as quickly as possible. In five or six bites, a bowl of noodles was gone. He then picked up the bowl and drank all the soup.\n\nPhew…\n\n\"Clunk!\"\n\nZhou Ze set down the empty noodle bowl,\n\nlet out a long breath. He ate it!\n\nThe next moment, Zhou Ze reached out and clutched his chest. The nausea, suppressed by the sour plum soup, surged back. But the food was already in his stomach. Zhou Ze almost choked himself with both hands to keep from throwing up again.\n\nNot throwing up meant success.\n\nThe food,\n\nwas finally eaten.\n\nSweat beads had already soaked Zhou Ze's forehead. He picked up a tissue from the table and wiped himself directly.\n\nAt this moment,\n\nDoctor Lin and the proprietress were both a bit stunned. Zhou Ze's eating manner just now was simply too terrifying.\n\n\"Heh heh, looks like you were really hungry. Want another bowl?\" the proprietress asked.\n\n\"No, no need,\" Zhou Ze refused.\n\n\"Alrighty.\" The proprietress cleared the bowls and chopsticks in front of Zhou Ze, then shouted towards the back room, \"His dad, knead the dough for the afternoon. Delivery orders should be coming soon.\"\n\nThe proprietress walked inside. Her figure wasn't graceful, just ordinary in appearance, but the ample chest and well-defined lower body added a special charm that was quite attractive.\n\n\"Do you like… this type?\" Doctor Lin asked.\n\nBecause Zhou Ze had been watching the proprietress until she entered the back room.\n\n\"No.\" Zhou Ze shook his head. *I actually like your type, but you won't let me sleep with you.*\n\nZhou Ze's heart jolted slightly. The thought of \"not letting me sleep with you\" had been in his mind for a long time, almost becoming an obsession. He had to admit, Doctor Lin was indeed very beautiful and still young.\n\nEven if she was Xu Le's wife,\n\neven if Zhou Ze hadn't married in his previous life,\n\nif he were to ask himself honestly,\n\nhe still wanted to sleep with her.\n\nIt was precisely because he couldn't that he felt conflicted, and it often stayed on his mind.\n\n\"Not going home?\" Doctor Lin asked again.\n\n\"No,\" Zhou Ze confirmed.\n\n\"Then I'm leaving,\" Doctor Lin stood up. \"Call me if anything happens.\"\n\nAfter all, he was her nominal husband, even if there was no marital intimacy.\n\n\"Okay,\" Zhou Ze nodded. *If I had known you were so reasonable and considerate, I should have borrowed some money from you when I was broke.*\n\nDoctor Lin left, driving away in her Porsche Cayenne.\n\nZhou Ze, however, remained sitting in the noodle shop. His bookstore was right next door. Even after finishing his meal, it was fine to sit and chat here, as they were neighbors.\n\nThe owner came out from the back room and offered Zhou Ze a cigarette.\n\n\"How much?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"No need for politeness, brother, I can afford to treat you to a bowl of noodles.\" The owner waved his hand generously. They were neighbors; they'd see each other all the time. No need to be strangers over a bowl of noodles.\n\n\"Won't your wife scold you?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"No, she won't. What does a woman know? She has no say in this,\" the noodle shop owner's chauvinistic aura was palpable.\n\nA man, no matter his status at home, always had to put on a show outside. No one wanted to admit they were afraid of their wife in public, just as no one wanted to admit they were impotent.\n\n\"Heh heh, your wife is quite pretty,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nTeasing someone about their wife was a taboo. If two men were facing outwards, teasing a woman walking by on the street, that would be a playful topic between men.\n\nThe owner paused, said nothing, just smiled. The owner had a good temper; small business owners generally understood the principle of harmony bringing wealth.\n\n\"Her figure is very good,\" Zhou Ze continued. \"Solid, flavorful, just like the noodles I just ate.\"\n\nThe owner took a deep drag from his cigarette.\n\n\"How is she in bed?\" Zhou Ze asked again. This time, he was even more presumptuous.\n\nThe owner clenched his fists slightly, but then spoke casually, \"Her legs, they can really clamp a man to death! Strong!\"\n\nZhou Ze smiled,\n\nthe owner also smiled.\n\n\"Can you handle it?\" Zhou Ze asked again. \"She's at the age where she probably wants it most, right?\"\n\nThe owner massaged his lower back, \"Can't handle it anymore, not a young man anymore.\"\n\n\"Then, how about I give it a try?\" Zhou Ze asked again.\n\nThe owner's face completely darkened.\n\nHis knuckles cracked audibly.\n\n\"If you can't, I can. I'm still young,\" Zhou Ze muttered to himself. Although, this was a bit disingenuous. Xu Le's physique, even if young, felt more like a \"silver spear and wax head.\" It certainly wasn't as well-maintained as Zhou Ze's own body in his previous life.\n\n\"Isn't this joke going too far?\" The owner was still trying to control his anger.\n\n\"What if your wife agrees?\" Zhou Ze continued.\n\n\"Was that your wife just now?\" The owner changed the subject.\n\n\"Mhm,\" Zhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"Would you be willing to let her go?\" The owner asked again.\n\nZhou Ze hesitated, then shook his head. Although she was Xu Le's wife, she was nominally his now, and Zhou Ze was unwilling.\n\n\"Then why do you think I would be willing?\" The owner retorted.\n\n\"Maybe you have some special preferences or unusual kinks? These things aren't rare now, are they?\"\n\n\"Brother, I haven't laid hands on anyone in a long time,\" the owner stood up.\n\n\"Call your wife out. Ask her. I want to hear her say whether she's willing or not,\" Zhou Ze leaned back slightly, smiling.\n\n\"Heh heh.\" The owner took a few steps closer to Zhou Ze.\n\n\"You stand here and call her out,\" Zhou Ze insisted.\n\n\"You're looking for death!\" The owner lunged forward.\n\n\"Can she come out?\" Zhou Ze suddenly asked.\n\nThe owner froze,\n\nthen his face showed horror, and he staggered back several steps.\n\nZhou Ze stood up and walked into the back room, pulling back the curtain. The room was empty.\n\nOnly a woman's human skin,\n\nhung on a hanger.\n\nBecause the curtain was pulled back and wind came in,\n\nit swayed gently,\n\nfloating slowly.\n\n\"How… how did you see that?\" The owner walked slowly towards him. From his voice, no emotion could be discerned.\n\n\"There's a saying… 'Are you trying to fool a ghost?'\" Zhou Ze turned to face the owner. \"This layer of skin on you should be torn off now.\n\nI'm very curious,\n\nhow bored you must be,\n\nto be here,\n\nputting on this double act.\"",

    "content": "老闆笑了笑，沒有絲毫被激怒的感覺，他只是覺得有些好玩。\n\n\n\n  一個人的氣質以及一個的氣場，往往比他的話語更有可信度。\n\n\n\n  「嘶啦…………」\n\n\n\n  清脆的聲響，帶著些許的綿長，像是蛇蛻皮一樣，他開始撕去自己身上的皮。\n\n\n\n  與此同時，老闆的身形骨架正在慢慢地縮減，體格也在緩緩地瘦削下來，像是一個氣球破了一個小洞，正在慢慢地放氣。\n\n\n\n  周澤現在終於明白那碗面為什麼會煮得這麼爛了，\n\n\n\n  對方這種「變身」，確實需要耗費一些時間。\n\n\n\n  穿著還是老闆的衣服，繫著圍裙，但對方的那張臉，則變成了一個略顯青澀的青年。\n\n\n\n  青年嘴角含笑，媚態天成，尤其是眼角延展出來的弧度，像是能夠撓到身邊男女心痒痒之處，恰如其分，恰到好處。\n\n\n\n  一個男人，用「媚」來形容，是有些違和的，但有些男人，確實是媚骨天生，諸如古代帝王之流，喜好男風者不計其數，原因也的確是在於，有些男人，比女人更像是女人。\n\n\n\n  「我好看麼？」\n\n\n\n  青年問周澤。\n\n\n\n  周澤感到自己剛剛吃麵後壓制下去的噁心感再度襲來，略有歉然地擺擺手，然後捂著自己胸口，做出一副我不能吐的姿態。 \n\n\n\n  誰知盤中餐，粒粒皆辛苦！\n\n\n\n  周澤很懂得珍惜糧食，尤其是被自己好不容易吞下去即將消化成自己體內能量的糧食。\n\n\n\n  青年在旁邊一張椅子上坐了下來，他手裡拿著一隻打火機，隨意地打著轉兒。\n\n\n\n  他在打量著周澤，因為周澤發現了他，他自認為自己的模仿渾然天成，又是在這小食飯館的場所，應該不會出什麼問題。\n\n\n\n  最重要的是，\n\n\n\n  他模仿的是他自己的爹媽。\n\n\n\n  自自己年幼開始，他就在觀察自己的爹媽，爹媽的一舉一動，一縷縷神情，早就銘刻在心。\n\n\n\n  「你是怎麼發現我的？」青年忍不住了。\n\n\n\n  「你不是鬼？」\n\n\n\n  周澤也是同時發問。\n\n\n\n  青年微微皺眉，他以為周澤在諷刺他，說他裝神弄鬼。\n\n\n\n  但實際上，周澤是從一開始就把他當成鬼的。\n\n\n\n  周澤不想管閒事兒，一個前不久還在為一個冰櫃的錢範疇的人，周澤不認為自己有那個資格去管閒事兒。\n\n\n\n  但這個閒事兒不管又不行，\n\n\n\n  閒事兒就發生在自己的隔壁。\n\n\n\n  所以周澤覺得，不管怎麼樣，還是先把事情戳破就好，好解決的，自己就解決了，不好解決的，大不了自己再搬家。 \n\n\n\n  「你的指甲。」周澤說道，「我這個人，對指甲有些敏感。」\n\n\n\n  老闆娘將麵條端送到自己面前，\n\n\n\n  老闆親自給自己遞煙，\n\n\n\n  指甲，都呈現在自己面前。\n\n\n\n  雖然手指粗細白皙老繭程度各不相同，但指甲蓋上的紋路，是一樣的。\n\n\n\n  而這陣子，周澤對指甲更加注意，不光是對自己的指甲，也包括別人的指甲。\n\n\n\n  青年目光微微一眯，悵然若失，細節，做得不到位。\n\n\n\n  雖然自己有著懈怠的意思，但只要被發現了，則確實是自己的紕漏。\n\n\n\n  「你真的不是鬼？」周澤又問道。\n\n\n\n  如果是人的話，那就真的有些誇張了。\n\n\n\n  其實周澤見到的鬼並不多，撇開在地獄裡的那段旅程不算的話，在陽世間，他所見到的鬼真的是屈指可數。\n\n\n\n  「畫皮，是我家祖傳的技藝。」青年站起身，伸手抓住了周澤的手，將其放在了自己胸口位置，「只不過，已經斷代了好多輩了，也就到我這一代時，才能重新撿起來。」\n\n\n\n  這個動作有點曖昧，也有點破格，但周澤還是下意識地用手捏了捏。\n\n\n\n  周澤絕不會認為是因為林醫生一直不讓自己睡導致自己現在對男人產生了興趣， \n\n\n\n  當然，眼前這個男人，的確比女人更媚，這的確是事實。\n\n\n\n  「沒骨頭？」周澤臉上露出了意外之色，「不對，是軟骨病。」\n\n\n\n  軟骨病又稱佝僂病，因鈣缺乏使骨骼鈣化發生障礙，骨質變軟而易變形，周澤以前是個醫生，自然知道一些，但正如哪怕一種感冒也分很多種情況很多不同的病理一樣，軟骨病也有著很多細分的類別，而眼前這位青年，他則應該是一種極端。\n\n\n\n  相傳，春秋野史上有記載，魯國的一位王子就身患這種病，人若無骨，身體嬌柔，能夠像人一樣行走，也能夠類似蛇一樣爬行。\n\n\n\n  「你可以理解成這是一種遺傳病，需要一定的概率才能表現出來，之前我家裡往上很多代都練不成畫皮，是因為他們沒得這種病，而我……」\n\n\n\n  青年笑了笑，沒繼續說下去。\n\n\n\n  「所以，你真的不是鬼？」周澤還是不死心。\n\n\n\n  「我叫許清朗。」青年很嚴肅地回答。\n\n\n\n  「你模仿的又是誰？」周澤問道。\n\n\n\n  「爹，娘。」\n\n\n\n  周澤愣了一下，面露苦笑。\n\n\n\n  得嘞，\n\n\n\n  這誤會大了。\n\n\n\n  之前吃完面後，林姐姐離開，周澤想著捅破窗戶紙，故意拿話激他，結果沒成想，居然是人家沒事做在這裡玩角色扮演，追思自己的亡親。 \n\n\n\n  但在周澤之前的視角，他只是想當然地認為，這是一隻鬼，類似「畫皮」故事裡的鬼，殺了人，扒了皮，還在「沐猴而冠」。\n\n\n\n  「那……不好意思了。」\n\n\n\n  拿你媽打趣，還真是有些不好意思。\n\n\n\n  「我沒生氣。」許清朗說道，「但我很好奇，你一直把我當鬼，是個什麼意思？」\n\n\n\n  「沒什麼意思。」\n\n\n\n  「你見過鬼？」許清朗問道。\n\n\n\n  「我就是一個鬼。」周澤看著許清朗，很認真地說道。\n\n\n\n  表情嚴肅，神色莊嚴，\n\n\n\n  掏心窩子啊。\n\n\n\n  許清朗面色一滯，\n\n\n\n  然後抑制不住地發出了「噗」的笑聲，\n\n\n\n  看向周澤的目光，\n\n\n\n  宛若看一個智障。\n\n\n\n  周澤點點頭，有時候，就是這樣，你告訴他真相，你以為你在逗他，他反而不信。\n\n\n\n  「不管怎麼樣，不好意思了，對了，我還想問，那人皮，是真的人皮？」周澤好奇道。\n\n\n\n  「魚皮。」許清朗回答道，「加工，繪畫，製作而成。」\n\n\n\n  「那你賣什麼面啊。」周澤有些不能理解，「我聽說赫哲族的蛇皮衣服一件能賣不少錢，當藝術品賣的，你這個，應該更值錢吧？」 \n\n\n\n  「祖傳的東西，拿來牟利，我做不到。」\n\n\n\n  「那你應該很有錢。」周澤說道。\n\n\n\n  「家裡，剛拆遷。」許清朗沒直接回答，「分了二十幾套房。」\n\n\n\n  「…………」周澤深吸一口氣。\n\n\n\n  所以，世界就是這樣不公平，他上輩子在醫院工作，辛辛苦苦也沒掙幾個錢，而人家隨隨便便，就是二十幾套房。\n\n\n\n  通城不比上海，但房價也接近萬多一平了。\n\n\n\n  拆二代，羨慕啊。\n\n\n\n  周澤搖搖頭，「你以後還要繼續下麵條？」\n\n\n\n  「你以後還會繼續賣書？」\n\n\n\n  二人又同時問了對方問題。\n\n\n\n  「暫時看著吧。」周澤回答。\n\n\n\n  「我也一樣。」\n\n\n\n  「那，回見，對了，你家酸梅汁還有其他口味麼？」周澤對這一點很好奇，「比如苦瓜味的？葡萄味的？」\n\n\n\n  「有秘方，可以做。」許清朗很實誠。\n\n\n\n  「很好。」周澤伸手在許清朗肩膀上拍了拍，\n\n\n\n  娘的，\n\n\n\n  跟棉花一樣，\n\n\n\n  軟綿綿的，是真的柔弱真沒骨啊，這要是抱在懷裡躺床上………… \n\n\n\n  周澤馬上在心底搬出林醫生剛洗完澡穿著睡衣出來的畫面，強行鎮壓自己那段不和諧的思想。\n\n\n\n  周澤走出了麵館，\n\n\n\n  許清朗走到了裡屋，掀開了帘子，對裡面掛著的那張女人人皮道：\n\n\n\n  「媽，你說他真信了還是假信了？」\n\n\n\n  女人皮輕輕搖曳，\n\n\n\n  微微輕擺，\n\n\n\n  像是在說，他沒信，\n\n\n\n  也像是在說，她也不知道。\n\n\n\n  ………………\n\n\n\n  周澤回到自己店裡，冰櫃已經安頓好了，下面其實就得把徐樂留下來的破書店給整改整改了，一直讓它這麼虧下去，也不是辦法。\n\n\n\n  書店門口的牌子上掛著「徐樂書屋」，要多土氣就有多土氣。\n\n\n\n  總之，這家書店在那傢伙的手上，從上到下，由里到外，都流露出「鐵定虧本」的氣息。\n\n\n\n  周澤坐到電腦前，嘗試了幾次登錄自己原本的QQ，結果都無法登錄，身份驗證根本過不了，申訴也基本沒辦法了。\n\n\n\n  隨後，周澤只能出門打車出去，他打算換一個牌子，或者搞一副門牌對聯放這裡。\n\n\n\n  他認識一個開牌匾店的，專門做木雕牌匾生意，店主是個老人，老人經常給那家孤兒院捐款，當年周澤自己也是孤兒院一員時，老人就在捐款了，等周澤工作之後，老人和周澤一起捐款。 \n\n\n\n  那家牌匾店並不遠，就在狼山腳下，前後左右都是賣香燭的，就這家賣的是牌匾。\n\n\n\n  只是，當周澤走進去時，卻發現店鋪里正在做大掃除，甚至連牌匾都被拆了下來。\n\n\n\n  一個中年男子在那裡指揮著工人忙活。\n\n\n\n  「你是？」對方看見走過來的周澤問道。\n\n\n\n  「我找趙老先生。」周澤說道，他對那位老者，很是尊重。\n\n\n\n  「不好意思，我爹上個月剛走。」中年人回答道。\n\n\n\n  「走了？」周澤有些意外，也有些傷感，他和趙老其實不熟，只是彼此知道對方這麼一個人而已，也因此，人家葬禮沒通知到他也很正常。\n\n\n\n  況且，可能對於趙老家裡人來說，趙老一直將打牌匾的收入捐出給孤兒院，他們自然對孤兒院沒什麼好感，甚至不會去通知孤兒院葬禮，生怕孤兒院再上來找他們要錢。\n\n\n\n  「你是來訂做匾額的？」中年男子問道。\n\n\n\n  「嗯。」周澤點點頭。\n\n\n\n  「我們家，不做了。」中年男子歉然道：「以後，賣香燭了。」\n\n\n\n  狼山是佛教十小山之一，哪怕吸引不到外來遊客，但本地人逢年過節地去燒香拜佛，也足夠讓坐落在山腳下的店鋪商家們大賺一筆了。\n\n\n\n  這也是一種靠山吃山，靠水吃水。 \n\n\n\n  「那可惜了。」周澤有些遺憾。\n\n\n\n  他打算去老先生墓碑前看看。\n\n\n\n  「不過家裡還有幾塊我爹以前打的匾額，賣不出去的，也不知道我爹刻那幾個匾額做什麼，也不是人訂做的，你要是喜歡，便宜點出給你。」中年男子本著賣廢品的心思打算處理掉了。\n\n\n\n  「好，我看看。」周澤同意了。\n\n\n\n  跟著中年男子走到了後面小院子裡，中年男子打開了一間庫房，開了燈。\n\n\n\n  裡面放著一些雜物，包括趙老先生做工時的器具，雜亂無章地堆放，意味著子孫後代是不打算繼承這門手藝了。\n\n\n\n  現在大家都做能發光的牌面，誰還願意用這個？辛辛苦苦的，還賺不來什麼錢。\n\n\n\n  「呼…………」中年男子對著地上的幾塊牌匾吹了一口氣，道：「你看看吧，兩百塊一副，看上就可以拿走，沒看上就算了。」\n\n\n\n  顯然，中年男子對能否把這幾塊牌匾給出掉，不抱什麼信心。\n\n\n\n  周澤走過去看了看，\n\n\n\n  第一副牌匾上寫著：\n\n\n\n  「生死有命，富貴在天。」\n\n\n\n  周澤搖搖頭，中年男子嘆了口氣，知道這塊匾額沒戲了。\n\n\n\n  下一副寫著： \n\n\n\n  「人知鬼恐怖，鬼曉人心毒。」\n\n\n\n  周澤微微一愣，他對這個，有點敏感。\n\n\n\n  中年男子這次沒嘆氣，因為他知道直接沒戲，誰家開店吃飽了撐的在門口掛這個？\n\n\n\n  第三副：\n\n\n\n  「姑妄聽之，如是我聞。」\n\n\n\n  周澤笑了，\n\n\n\n  中年男子看著周澤笑了他也笑了，\n\n\n\n  總歸有一個滿意了。",

    "content": "The plaque was brought back, and Zhou Ze planned to nail it on both sides. Zhou Ze didn't care which one went on the left or the right.\n\nXu Qinglang, the kind elder brother next door, was very enthusiastic.\n\nHe was originally squatting at his doorway peeling garlic, but when he saw Zhou Ze about to hang the plaque, he directly went into his house and brought out a hammer and nails.\n\nZhou Ze said thank you and took his hammer. He felt a bit greasy and heavy in his hand. Enduring a slight discomfort, Zhou Ze still nailed both plaques up.\n\nThen,\n\nThe two of them stepped back a few paces, looking at the plaques, at the door, and at the bookstore.\n\nZhou Ze offered Xu Qinglang a cigarette as thanks, and Xu Qinglang lit Zhou Ze's cigarette for him.\n\nThey both exhaled smoke rings,\n\nIn perfect synchronicity.\n\n\"It has 'artistic conception,' doesn't it?\" Zhou Ze said, which was standard self-praise.\n\nXu Qinglang shook his head. \"If I'm not mistaken, these two lines should be from the chapter titles of Ji Xiaolan's *Jottings of the Yuewei Hermitage*.\"\n\n*Jottings of the Yuewei Hermitage* is a collection of stories by Ji Xiaolan, similar to *Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio*, using tales of fox spirits and ghosts to express the author's own thoughts.\n\nIn short, this couplet means: These are all stories I've heard; everyone present, just listen.\n\n\"Mm.\" Zhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"Still too literary. Your store will still lose money,\" Xu Qinglang's assessment was quite blunt.\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"In this world, there are too many stories, all sorts of strange and bizarre things happen every day, but truly interesting things aren't that many.\n\nSome things are pointless to say.\n\nSome things are strictly forbidden to say.\n\nSome things won't be heard unless they're changed.\n\nSome things dare not be heard unless they're changed.\"\n\nZhou Ze looked at Xu Qinglang for a long time.\n\nXu Qinglang lowered his head slightly, his face flushing with embarrassment.\n\nHe was already naturally alluring in his masculine frame, and at this moment, he was even more dazzlingly beautiful beyond compare.\n\nSeeing Zhou Ze remain silent, Xu Qinglang continued:\n\n\"For example, these stories of mountain spirits, fox immortals, and ghosts, do they really exist in the real world?\" Xu Qinglang yawned. \"How can the道理 (principles) conveyed through false stories ever be truly real?\"\n\nZhou Ze continued to look at Xu Qinglang, not speaking.\n\nXu Qinglang felt a little prickle on his scalp from being stared at,\n\nBut Zhou Ze kept looking at him.\n\nFinally, Xu Qinglang waved his hand, saying he needed to go back to make soup base. Walking back to his noodle shop, he felt as if he had \"prickles on his back,\" because just now, he felt as though Zhou Ze wasn't looking at him,\n\nBut looking at a joke.\n\nZhou Ze paid no mind to Xu Qinglang. Since they were neighbors, they would just \"keep to their own business.\" Anyway, they weren't in competition, and most importantly, Zhou Ze didn't have money to change shops.\n\nIn the afternoon, Zhou Ze organized most of the textbooks and study guides in the bookstore and had them taken away by a scrap collector at the price of waste paper.\n\nHe then went to the supermarket and bought ten small plastic chairs. The only two remaining bookshelves held books that Zhou Ze himself found interesting.\n\nAt present, rather than a bookstore, it was more like a senior citizens' entertainment center.\n\nZhou Ze stretched. He wasn't very good at business. For now, he was just messing around. Anyway, when Xu Le was around, he was constantly losing money, so Zhou Ze felt no pressure.\n\nComing up to the second floor, Zhou Ze turned on the freezer, set a temperature, smoked a cigarette outside while waiting, then reached in to feel the temperature in the freezer.\n\nThe temperature was about right. Zhou Ze lay inside.\n\nThe freezer, bought for over ten thousand yuan, certainly had many functions, such as a timer, which acted as an alarm for Zhou Ze.\n\nClosing the freezer,\n\nZhou Ze placed his hands on his lower abdomen, lying perfectly straight,\n\nLooking as if,\n\nHe had passed away peacefully.\n\n…………\n\nLate at night,\n\nA red car parked on the road outside the bookstore. The entire street was somewhat deserted, with only the adjacent noodle shop and bookstore still lit up.\n\nInside the car sat a well-dressed girl in a black down jacket with shoulder-length hair, looking somewhat cute and delicate.\n\n\"Xiao Bai, you bastard! I prepared for three days, and today you tell me you've gone on a business trip! Go to hell, get lost!\"\n\nThe girl hung up the phone, sulking in the driver's seat.\n\nThe Corgi in the passenger seat jumped onto the girl's lap. Its fur was flowing and shiny, clearly a good breed and well-cared for.\n\n\"Good boy, at least I still have you with me.\"\n\nThe girl lit a cigarette, extended her hand to flick the ash, and looked outside. She saw the bookstore. Crucially, through the glass window, she could see that the interior setup was unusual; there weren't many bookshelves, but rather rows of plastic stools.\n\nShe got out of the car, carrying the Corgi, and walked towards the bookstore. She didn't want to drive around aimlessly alone on this Valentine's night; she wanted to find a quiet place to sit.\n\nThe bookstore door was open, and upon entering, she could feel the warm air from the air conditioning.\n\nThe girl, leading her dog, first picked up a random magazine from a bookshelf, then sat down on a plastic chair.\n\nThe Corgi was unleashed and began its \"exploration\" of the store.\n\nAfter finishing a magazine, the girl let out a small stretch and felt a bit thirsty. She called out:\n\n\"Boss, are you here? Do you have milk tea or coffee?\"\n\nThe girl stood up, put the magazine she was holding back, and picked another illustrated version of *Dream of the Red Chamber*. When she sat down again, she couldn't help but call out once more:\n\n\"Boss, are you dead in the middle of the night? Is this how you run a shop?\"\n\nThe bookstore's glass door had a small sign that read \"Open, Welcome,\" the door was open, and the heating was on, so it was definitely still in business.\n\nIf the girl had been less polite or more curious at this point and had gone upstairs to take a look, she might have admired her own \"self-fulfilling prophecy.\"\n\nIn the low-ceilinged space on the second floor, there was indeed an ice coffin,\n\nAnd the boss was lying inside, truly looking like a dead person.\n\nNo,\n\nThe boss was already a dead person.\n\nOf course, the girl might not have had time to admire herself before being scared out of her wits.\n\nIsn't it terrifying for a normal person to enter a shop late at night and discover the owner lying in a frozen ice coffin?\n\nThe girl lit another cigarette, growing a little impatient, and pulled out her phone to play games.\n\nJust then, footsteps came from the staircase. Zhou Ze didn't wake up because of the girl's shouts; he woke up naturally.\n\nAs soon as he came downstairs, Zhou Ze saw a small yellow figure darting to his leg, asking to be held.\n\nZhou Ze smiled and bent down, scooping the Corgi into his arms. The little fellow wasn't shy and seemed friendly with everyone.\n\nThen, Zhou Ze noticed the woman sitting in the store.\n\nOh,\n\nHis first customer.\n\nBut he wasn't as excited as one might imagine, because today Zhou Ze had merely changed the bookstore's sign and tidied up the interior furnishings.\n\nHe hadn't yet figured out,\n\nHow to make money next.\n\n\"Do you have coffee here, boss?\"\n\nThe girl asked.\n\nZhou Ze pointed to a water dispenser in the corner of the wall. There were disposable paper cups by the dispenser.\n\nThe girl was a little helpless, but still got up, poured herself a glass of water, and then sat back down on her plastic stool.\n\nOne host, one guest,\n\nSilence between them.\n\nAfter about half an hour of silence, the girl started browsing Weibo and watching videos. One video was very noisy and boisterous:\n\n\"Those passing by, don't miss out!\n\nUnder the old Taoist's blessing, hell money is in limited supply!\n\nYou can burn it and retrieve it for use when you go down there, and even earn some interest, higher than Yu'ebao's interest!\n\nYou can also burn it and send it to your deceased relatives below, quick and convenient, fair to all, no harassment from ghost officials, no layers of exploitation!\"\n\nThe girl laughed when she saw the video. People usually like to share funny things. She looked up at the boss behind the counter and said:\n\n\"Boss, have you seen this video? This old Taoist's live stream is quite famous. He's almost a celebrity.\"\n\n\"Oh, live stream?\" Zhou Ze was a bit puzzled. He took out his phone. Xu Le's phone indeed had many live streaming apps. It seemed this guy was truly bored in his daily life, either watching live streams or writing sequels to *Bai Jie*.\n\n\"Yes, search for his ID, it's hilarious. He supposedly opened a冥店 (underworld goods store) in Rongcheng, but he hasn't live streamed for a long time.\"\n\nZhou Ze opened the app and started searching for the old Taoist's ID as the girl suggested. He found a live streaming room – \"Anchor Not Home.\"\n\nFortunately, he could watch past videos. Zhou Ze randomly clicked on a video from a month ago.\n\nIn the video, the old Taoist had his phone fixed in one spot and was practicing martial arts alone. His punches were good; he clearly was a trained practitioner. In the video frame, a young man sat there, a smile on his lips, eyes squinting, as if watching a monkey show.\n\nZhou Ze perfunctorily fast-forwarded the video. Another man appeared in the frame, sitting behind the counter, spoon in hand, seemingly drinking porridge.\n\nThe old Taoist was eloquently talking in the main video frame, continuously promoting himself and the hell money he sold on Taobao, but Zhou Ze's gaze instinctively focused on the man in the corner of the video.\n\nHe was frowning, he was struggling, he was in pain, he was resisting,\n\nA mouthful of porridge,\n\nHe ate it with great difficulty,\n\nThen continued with the second mouthful,\n\nAs if being tortured.\n\nZhou Ze watched, taking a deep breath, seemingly affected by the man in the corner of the video himself.\n\nEating,\n\nIt really isn't an easy thing.\n\nHe didn't know the identity of the man in the video, but he instinctively felt a slight interest. Was the other party an anorexia patient? Or did he have some stomach illness?\n\nAfter the video ended, Zhou Ze opened the page, and on a whim, he directly used Xu Le's logged-in account to send the old Taoist a private message:\n\n\"Who is the man in the video sitting in the back drinking porridge?\"\n\n\"Hey, I'm leaving. How much?\" The girl stood up, stretched, \"People will definitely think I'm crazy for saying this today, that I spent Valentine's night sitting in a bookstore reading *Dream of the Red Chamber* for so long.\"\n\n\"Just pay what you think is fair,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nThe other person had only read for a while and poured herself a glass of pure water.\n\nThe girl glanced at Zhou Ze. \"Boss, your method is really good, like those masters who interpret fortunes in temples.\n\nThere's a sign by the kneeling cushion that says 'Free Fortune Reading,' and after tourists draw a fortune and have him interpret it, he then pulls out a red donation book for you, with a long list of names and incense money, the lowest being a hundred.\"\n\nZhou Ze smiled, noncommittal.\n\nThe girl took out a hundred-yuan bill, placed it on the chair where she had been sitting, then carried her Corgi and pushed open the bookstore door, leaving.\n\nZhou Ze stood up, picked up the hundred-yuan bill, and flicked it in his hand,\n\nA crisp sound,\n\nThis was one of the most wonderful sounds in the world.\n\nWhen he walked back to the counter, Zhou Ze saw his phone screen light up. He opened the phone and found that there was indeed a reply, a private message from that old Taoist. The content of the reply was very simple:\n\n\"Gone!\"",

    "content": "Tonight, this was the only customer, and all the income was one hundred yuan, but the cost was just a cup of water.\n\nOf course, you could say there are other costs like electricity and rent...\n\nBut you can't calculate it that way. When Xu Le was here, these were also costs, but his income was almost negligible. One always needs to find suitable points of comparison to gain a sense of satisfaction and confidence in life.\n\nAlso, it was because of that girl with the Corgi that Zhou Ze realized it was Valentine's Day today.\n\nFlipping through WeChat, he found Dr. Lin's WeChat ID. Clicking on it, Zhou Ze wanted to send a red packet. He tried to send 1314 but found he didn't have enough money. He had enough for 131.4, but sending that felt a bit stingy.\n\nAnyway, she's not sleeping with me,\n\nForget it,\n\nNot sending it.\n\nPutting down his phone, Zhou Ze grabbed a random book and flipped through it, staying in that posture until morning.\n\nHe went next door for wontons. Whether the wrappers were thin or the filling was thick, Zhou Ze wasn't sure. He ate them the same way as before: a large bowl of plum juice went down first, then he devoured the wontons, followed by clutching his throat and taking deep breaths, suppressing the urge to vomit.\n\nThinking that every meal in the future would have to follow this routine, Zhou Ze felt like a shadow had been cast over his future days.\n\nZhou Ze also recalled the man in the video who similarly struggled to eat porridge, feeling a touch of sorrow. Eating was originally one of the greatest joys of being alive, but now, it was a stranger to them.\n\nHe wondered if there was an \"Anorexics' Club\" in the world, where everyone would gather around a table, and whoever could eat one bite of rice first would be given a thumbs-up by everyone:\n\n\"You're amazing!\n\nMy XXX is so impressive!\"\n\nTaking a deep breath, the image sent shivers down his spine.\n\nRegardless, yesterday's video, including the old Daoist and the porridge-eating man in it, seemed too distant for Zhou Ze for now.\n\nAfter Valentine's Day came Chinese New Year's Eve, or the thirtieth day of the twelfth lunar month. In normal times, this commercial center would be brightly lit with lanterns and decorations, very festive and \"full of New Year's spirit.\" But in reality, it remained as it was, cold and desolate.\n\nThis is like life,\n\nSince there has been glory, there will naturally be decline.\n\nZhou Ze remembered when this commercial center first opened, it was all the rage, but now, no one cares about it.\n\nXu Qinglang had good business today, probably because many other shops were closed. He, who insisted on doing takeout on Chinese New Year's Eve, naturally received more orders, as customers had fewer choices.\n\nFrom time to time, takeout delivery riders in blue, yellow, or red uniforms went in and out of his noodle shop. Zhou Ze squatted at the entrance of his bookstore, smoking a cigarette and sighing with emotion.\n\nDamn Xu Le, how great it would have been if he had opened a braised chicken shop back then.\n\nImmortals in myths and legends are fond of saying: \"One day in heaven equals one year on Earth.\"\n\nIn fact, Zhou Ze felt this should be true, and it also applied to Hell.\n\nHe remembered when he died in a car accident... no, he remembered when he was sent to the crematorium for incineration, it was just after Children's Day on June 1st, and now, in the blink of an eye, it was Chinese New Year's Eve.\n\nMore than half a year had passed so quickly. A fleeting dream, nothing more than wandering aimlessly for half a journey on the Yellow Springs road.\n\nAfter smoking quite a few cigarettes and contemplating many thoughts, Zhou Ze felt a bit tired. He took out his phone, wanting to see if there were any movies playing recently. The cinema was right next door, so he could go there to pass the time.\n\n\"Hey, do you have any newspapers there?\" Xu Qinglang, who had just finished sending off the last batch of delivery drivers, walked out.\n\n\"What for?\"\n\n\"To paste on the wall,\" Xu Qinglang replied.\n\n\"So economical?\"\n\n\"Newspapers on the wall create an atmosphere and a sense of history. You didn't sell them all yesterday, did you?\"\n\n\"Still some left. Wait, I'll go find them for you.\"\n\nZhou Ze returned to the store and moved a stack of newspapers, about half a person tall, from a box near his freezer on the second floor. He brought them downstairs and handed them to Xu Qinglang, who was waiting.\n\n\"You're not going home for New Year's either?\" Xu Qinglang asked.\n\n\"Spending New Year's with books.\"\n\nToo bad Zhou Ze didn't have a goatee, nor wine in his hand,\n\nOtherwise, he could have raised a cup to that boastful remark.\n\n\"Aren't you also not going home?\" Zhou Ze asked after a moment of self-indulgence.\n\n\"With over twenty apartments, which home should I go back to?\" Xu Qinglang sighed.\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze.\n\nThe two fell silent for a moment, then Zhou Ze spoke, \"Let me tell you a story.\"\n\n\"Alright,\" Xu Qinglang nodded, a hint of shyness in his expression. His hair was a little long, with a few strands hanging down, nearly touching his lips. He reached up and gently brushed the strands away, his posture soft, truly charming and endearing.\n\nSuch charm was not for outsiders to know.\n\n\"Once, also on New Year's Day, late at night on the road, someone encountered the richest man in the area.\n\nThe rich man was dead drunk.\n\nThat person asked the rich man, why aren't you going home?\n\nThe rich man replied: Home, where is my home? My family and relatives are not with me. The home you speak of, is it my largest estate in the whole city?\"\n\nXu Qinglang listened to the story and nodded slightly, seemingly deeply empathetic.\n\n\"Then that person pressed the rich man to the ground and beat him up, shouting:\n\n\"Who told you to come out here and show off on New Year's!\"\n\nZhou Ze continued to finish the story.\n\n\"...\" Xu Qinglang.\n\nTheir conversation ended.\n\nZhou Ze returned to his bookstore. The heating was on inside, making it warm and cozy. He turned his phone in his hand, with no one to contact.\n\nHe had thought about visiting the orphanage, but then decided against it, as he didn't have much money left.\n\nBut just then, a customer came in. It was a young man in a blue work uniform and a hard hat. He pushed open the bookstore door and walked in, asking somewhat shyly:\n\n\"Can I read books here? How much?\" The man pursed his lips.\n\n\"Read whatever you like. Pay what you think it's worth,\" Zhou Ze waved his hand, indicating for him to make himself at home.\n\n\"That's great. Do you have any novels?\" the young man said somewhat reservedly, \"I like reading novels, like online novels.\"\n\nZhou Ze pointed to a box behind the bookshelf, \"They're all in there.\"\n\nThe man walked over to the box and rummaged through it a few times, looking pleased. Some of the books still had their plastic wrappers on.\n\n\"Open them and read. No charge,\" Zhou Ze said generously.\n\n\"Alright.\"\n\nThe young man unwrapped an online novel and then sat down on a plastic stool, beginning to read.\n\nZhou Ze, as the owner, sat behind the counter trimming his nails, while the young man read. About half an hour later, the young man stood up from the chair, took out his cigarette, and offered one to Zhou Ze:\n\n\"It's not a good brand, don't mind it.\"\n\n\"Hey, cigarettes aren't good things to begin with, so what's the difference between good and bad?\"\n\nZhou Ze took the cigarette, and the other person took one too, then actively walked outside the shop, lighting and smoking it while enduring the cold wind.\n\nThis surprised Zhou Ze, who had intended to smoke inside. He thought about it and decided against it, putting the cigarette aside and continuing to trim his nails.\n\nAfter the young man finished his cigarette outside, he walked back in. This time he didn't sit on the plastic stool but leaned against the wall and sat on the floor.\n\nAlthough the air conditioning was on inside, the floor tiles were still cold. The young man, however, didn't seem to mind, suggesting he was accustomed to it from his daily life.\n\nAbout fifteen minutes later, four more men walked into the store from outside. They were dressed in neatly laundered blue work uniforms. The oldest was no more than thirty, and the youngest was probably around seventeen.\n\nAll four of them entered together. The young man leaning against the wall waved to them, apparently having called them over.\n\nThe newcomers greeted Zhou Ze, who responded perfunctorily and continued to trim his nails;\n\nZhou Ze decided to buy a professional nail care kit to do justice to his nails.\n\nHowever, express delivery services were currently suspended, and most physical stores were closed, so he could only put it off for now.\n\nWhen he looked up again, Zhou Ze found that all five workers were sitting on the floor, each holding a novel.\n\nFrom the covers, it was clear they were all online novels, mostly fantasy. One held a horror novel, biting his nails as he read, clearly engrossed.\n\nHowever, the other person's habit of biting his nails was something Zhou Ze couldn't agree with.\n\nOnly by cherishing one's nails can one truly cherish life.\n\nFrom time to time, someone would laugh while reading a novel, a genuine laugh from deep within as they followed the story.\n\nThe bookstore had quite a few people, but it was very quiet. There were occasional small sounds, but nothing too disturbing.\n\nTowards evening, Xu Qinglang walked in with a bowl of dumplings. As he entered, he immediately said:\n\n\"Well, well, the shop's quite lively.\"\n\nZhou Ze smiled and nodded.\n\n\"Hey, guys, want something to eat?\" Xu Qinglang asked the workers sitting in the shop.\n\nEveryone looked at each other,\n\nFeeling a bit at a loss.\n\n\"Never mind, my treat,\" Xu Qinglang, after all, was a man with twenty-something properties. \"It's New Year's, and it's not easy for you guys to not be home. We're all out here working hard for money, and brothers from all corners of the earth are brothers.\"\n\n\"Well, thank you, boss. May you get rich,\" the oldest worker stood up and thanked Xu Qinglang.\n\n\"You're welcome, you're welcome.\"\n\nXu Qinglang put down Zhou Ze's dumplings and went back to his own shop.\n\nZhou Ze drank a bit of the soup, then forced down two dumplings. That annoying Xu Qinglang forgot to bring him plum juice, and he couldn't eat them without it.\n\nTaking out the cigarettes on the table, Zhou Ze walked out from behind the counter.\n\n\"If you finish one, change it yourself. I should have the complete set here anyway. This shop of mine is a losing business, so don't be polite with me, everyone.\"\n\nZhou Ze offered cigarettes one by one,\n\nThe workers were flattered as they took them.\n\nThen, everyone stood up, walked out of the store, and squatted in a row to smoke.\n\nThey didn't want to dirty the shop's environment.\n\nZhou Ze thought about it, then also walked out of the shop. Outside, the wind was a bit cold. He squatted down beside them, smoking along.\n\nThe workers chatted,\n\nThose who were married talked about their wives and children;\n\nThose who weren't married talked about their sweethearts they knew in Tongcheng or their hometowns,\n\nTeasing each other,\n\nJoking with each other,\n\nEven though they all knew each other well,\n\nThey still had things to talk about.\n\nOne could tell from their accents that this group of workers came from all over the country, not from the same village.\n\nTongcheng is close to Shanghai, part of the Yangtze River Delta region. Although it cannot compare to Shanghai in scale, the demand for labor here is very high every year. As long as one is willing to endure hardship, there is no worry about finding work or earning money.\n\nAfter two more rounds of cigarette sharing,\n\nZhou Ze spoke, \"Guys, are you really not going home for the New Year?\"\n\n\"No, our families are all well.\"\n\n\"It's a hassle to go back and forth. There's still work in the first month of the New Year, and the boss will even give red envelopes! Might as well take them, and we can send more money back home.\"\n\n\"Haha, today's pretty good. We have novels to read, and cigarettes to smoke. This New Year, it's quite enjoyable.\"\n\n\"Boss, when are you closing?\" one of the workers asked.\n\n\"Not closing,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\n\"Boss not going home?\"\n\n\"My old lady back home isn't listening, so I'm not going back.\"\n\nZhou Ze suddenly felt a surge of heroic pride!\n\nAll the workers gave Zhou Ze a thumbs-up, cheering for him.\n\nOf course, no one chimed in too much. You could tell from his accent, and since Zhou Ze ran a bookstore, not a fruit stall, the workers guessed he was a local.\n\nThere were reasons for a local not going home to guard a shop during the New Year, so no one continued to tease or joke about it.\n\nMoreover, they were all the pillars of their respective families, working away from home to earn money. Their elderly parents and children were cared for by their wives. They worked hard and were tired, but their wives were the same.\n\nLife, it's just one generation after another enduring hardships and persevering. Whose life is truly easy?\n\nJust as Zhou Ze was about to offer another round of cigarettes, a shout came from a distance:\n\n\"Xu Le!\"\n\nZhou Ze looked up and stood up, only then noticing a Porsche Cayenne parked on the opposite side of the road, a familiar car,\n\nHmm, his wife's car.\n\nThe one shouting was his sister-in-law. She had indeed been frightened by Zhou Ze in the bathroom a while ago, but she had since recovered. She couldn't believe her brother-in-law was a ghost, so she simply attributed it to her own blurry vision from being scared at the time.\n\nOf course, she couldn't have a good temper with Zhou Ze, after all, he actually made this young lady wet herself! How embarrassing!\n\n\"Xu Le, come home for dinner!\"\n\nHis sister-in-law shouted.\n\n\"Not going back, the shop's busy and quite lively,\" Zhou Ze waved his hand.\n\nJoke,\n\nGo back and see those awful in-laws on New Year's?\n\nEndure the temper of this immature sister-in-law?\n\nMost importantly,\n\nGo all the way home on New Year's just to sleep in separate beds?\n\nLooking for a beating?\n\n\"Sis, is this guy crazy?! He's unreasonable, inexplicable, and a stubborn mule!\"\n\nThe sister-in-law pouted in the back seat.\n\nDr. Lin smiled, \"Let's go home and eat with Mom and Dad first.\"\n\n\"Oh, judging by that, sister, are you planning to come out tonight?\"\n\n\"I am, after all, his lawful wife.\" Dr. Lin said no more, started the car, and drove away.\n\nWatching the car drive off,\n\nZhou Ze turned to the workers beside him and asked, \"Guys, is my wife pretty?\"\n\n\"Beautiful!\"\n\n\"Lucky man!\"\n\n\"Absolutely gorgeous!\"\n\n\"Hahahahaha.\"\n\nXu Qinglang walked out of his shop with a large tray,\n\n\"Here, braised pork over rice! Guys, dig in!\"\n\nThe workers were a bit reserved, and some seemed awkward. The oldest worker said somewhat sheepishly, \"We came out without...\"\n\n\"I said before, I'm treating you guys to a meal! Bringing up money again means you don't see me as a brother. Who knows where we'll meet again, someday I might need your help.\"\n\n\"Okay!\"\n\n\"You got it!\"\n\n\"When you come to my hometown...\"\n\n\"Deal!\"\n\nThe workers all carried large bowls of rice into the bookstore. They squatted on the floor, placing their bowls on the plastic stools and eagerly began to eat.\n\nOne worker was eating and reading his novel at the same time, until another worker next to him tapped him on the head with his chopsticks.\n\n\"You're so greedy! If you accidentally stain the book, how will the boss sell it?\"\n\n\"You're right, let's eat first.\"\n\nThe atmosphere was lively. Zhou Ze returned to his counter. He ate three more of the already somewhat cold dumplings. For some reason, perhaps because of the atmosphere, his nausea was much less than before.\n\nAfter dinner,\n\nEveryone continued reading.\n\nInside the room, with the heating on and novels to read, it was very harmonious.\n\nUnknowingly, it was ten o'clock at night.\n\nThe oldest worker stood up, stretched, and said, \"Guys, it's time. Let's head back, and we'll help him clean up the place.\"\n\n\"Alright!\"\n\nThe five workers helped Zhou Ze clean the entire shop, top to bottom.\n\n\"Boss, we're leaving. Thank you for today.\"\n\n\"Don't mention it,\" Zhou Ze waved his hand.\n\nThey left,\n\nUnlike the girl with the Corgi from last night, who left a hundred yuan after reading for a while, they read for a whole day and half a night, and didn't leave a single yuan.\n\nBut Zhou Ze didn't mind at all, nor was there the slightest hint of dissatisfaction.\n\nStretching, Zhou Ze intended to call Xu Qinglang to collect the bowls and chopsticks from the shop. When he reached the noodle shop, Zhou Ze saw Xu Qinglang sitting behind a table, reading a newspaper.\n\nHmm, the newspaper was the one Zhou Ze had given him earlier in the day.\n\nXu Qinglang wore a pair of gold-rimmed glasses, which indeed gave him a scholarly air. Truly worthy of a man with over twenty properties,\n\nHe looked refined no matter how you saw him!\n\n\"Those bowls and chopsticks, you clean them up,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Okay, I'll go now.\"\n\nXu Qinglang took off his glasses, rubbed his eyes, and got up to clean the bowls and chopsticks next door.\n\nOn top of the large stack of newspapers was a copy of the Yangtse Evening Post, dated seven days ago;\n\nThe front page headline in bold read:\n\n\"Residential Building Fire, Heroic Act Touches Hearts\"\n\nLast week, a densely populated residential community in Tongcheng suffered a sudden and severe fire.\n\nFive young construction workers from a nearby construction site, disregarding danger, rushed in to rescue people. They saved more than twenty elderly people, women, and children in total, but after their final rush into the burning building to save others,\n\nThey never came out again.\n\nThe front page of the Yangtse Evening Post featured a large photo,\n\nIt was a group photo of these five men,\n\nThey stood shoulder to shoulder, making old-fashioned V-signs, seemingly taken when they first arrived at the construction site and lived in the same temporary shelter,\n\nFaces that were both youthful and showed a hint of weathered wrinkles,\n\nIn the photo,\n\nThey smiled somewhat awkwardly, yet brightly.\n\nXu Qinglang walked into the bookstore,\n\nLooking at the five bowls of braised pork over rice on the plastic stools in front of him,\n\nUntouched, the food long since cold,\n\nIn each bowl, a pair of chopsticks stood upright, stuck straight into the rice.\n\n\"Brothers,\n\nEat well,\n\nDrink well.\"\n\nXu Qinglang murmured.\n\nOutside,\n\nFirecrackers started to go off,\n\nTongcheng hadn't banned fireworks, and for a moment, the sky was filled with colorful displays, very lively and festive.\n\nZhou Ze looked up, gazing outside,\n\nAnd softly said:\n\n\"It's New Year's.\"",

    "content": "Firecrackers popped, bidding farewell to the old year. After midnight, fireworks and firecrackers erupted from all directions, creating a lively and dense symphony of sounds. What had been sporadic noises now became an overwhelming barrage.\n\nZhou Ze blew on his fingernails. The outdoor clamor had little to do with him. He had no home, and while he technically now had a \"home,\" he didn't want to go back.\n\nMany people, while alive, had the thought: *If I could be reborn, I would do this and that.*\n\nTo wield a pen with passion, to point fingers at the powerful, to scorn the feudal lords of old.*\n\nBut upon truly returning from Hell, you suddenly realize that your past pursuits, ideas, and aspirations are like when a kindergarten teacher asks, \"Children, what do you want to be when you grow up?\"\n\nAnd the children all reply: \"Scientists, doctors, astronauts, soldiers...\"\n\nDreams are always plump.\n\nReality isn't exactly gaunt, but a person's enthusiasm is finite.\n\nSometimes, just being able to breathe, hear sounds, and sit here idly, wasting time—\n\nPerhaps this is true peacefulness.\n\nXu Qinglang was still sleeping in the shop tonight. Zhou Ze heard him close the shop door.\n\nHe said he had over twenty apartments, but Zhou Ze knew his parents were still in the shop.\n\nA family should always be together.\n\nAnd this New Year, of course, was even more important.\n\nOutside, it started to rain. A damp chill began to seep in, making one feel somewhat oppressed.\n\nZhou Ze's phone rang. It was his wife calling.\n\n\"Hello,\" Zhou Ze answered.\n\n\"Are you asleep?\" Dr. Lin asked.\n\nZhou Ze thought the question was idiotic.\n\n*If I were asleep, who would answer your call?*\n\n*Could it be a dead person... oh no, a dead ghost?*\n\n*No, something seems off.*\n\nZhou Ze leaned back slightly in his chair, a scene flashing in his mind: Dr. Lin lightly poking his chest with a finger, calling him: \"You dead ghost...\"\n\nFor the first time, he felt that speaking the truth could be so dazzling.\n\nPerhaps he was too bored, or perhaps just idle,\n\nZhou Ze found his thoughts wandering,\n\nThinking a bit too much.\n\n\"Not yet,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\n\"Creak...\"\n\nDr. Lin pushed open the shop door and entered. She held a red umbrella, wearing leather pants and a white sweater, her hair falling over her shoulders.\n\nZhou Ze momentarily forgot to lower the phone.\n\nThis woman,\n\nWas indeed very beautiful.\n\nEspecially her demeanor, which always gave you a feeling of \"life is only like a first meeting,\" instantaneously piercing a man's heart.\n\n\"Afraid I'd be lonely?\" Zhou Ze stood up and poured Dr. Lin a glass of water.\n\nShe was the mistress of this place.\n\nWell,\n\nTo be precise, the money Xu Le used to open this bookstore came from her family.\n\nDr. Lin took the water, shook her head, and said nothing.\n\nThey were husband and wife, but in reality, they were like the most familiar strangers, in a more awkward position than that of platonic male and female friends.\n\nTo move forward, difficult;\n\nTo retreat, even harder.\n\n\"Let's go for a walk,\" Zhou Ze felt the room was a bit stuffy, and he couldn't invite Dr. Lin to sleep in his room upstairs.\n\nEven if Dr. Lin had taken the wrong medicine today and intended to \"feed herself to the tiger,\" seeing his freezer upstairs would probably make her immediately dial the number of a familiar psychiatric hospital to have him sent away for re-education.\n\n\"It's raining,\" Dr. Lin said.\n\n\"It's just a drizzle, it's fine.\" Zhou Ze waved his hand, feeling relaxed and at ease.\n\n***\n\n\"Pouring, pouring, pouring...\"\n\nThe rain grew heavy, very heavy.\n\nZhou Ze, who hadn't even brought an umbrella, intending to experience the preciousness of spring rain, was practically drenched to the bone. Dr. Lin still held her umbrella, standing beside him. Zhou Ze refused her suggestion to share the umbrella.\n\nThe pretense he made, he had to see through, even with tears in his eyes.\n\nPatting his dripping hair, Zhou Ze shivered. He wasn't particularly afraid of the cold; he was quite resistant to it, but the woman beside him, though barely wet from the umbrella, was still trembling slightly.\n\nThe bus stop shelter could block most of the rain,\n\nBut the cold night wind could still run rampant.\n\nPetty bourgeois sentiment,\n\nA man and a woman together,\n\nSoaked in the rainy night,\n\nThe beauty's pity,\n\nThis should have been a good opportunity, a good moment, for them to cultivate their relationship. Perhaps even a passionate encounter that resulted in an unexpected pregnancy was possible. But the two remained silent.\n\nZhou Ze lit a cigarette. Dr. Lin stood beside him.\n\nOne wanted to escape, the other was inherently resistant, so naturally, they wouldn't connect.\n\nA forced melon, both the melon and the vine, would be twisted.\n\nZhou Ze secretly blamed Xu Le. If that timid fellow had just gone ahead and taken her by force after they got married, there wouldn't be this mess now. Even if Dr. Lin was a married woman or had children, she would probably still be breathtakingly beautiful, perhaps even more so.\n\nAnd he could have just gone with the flow; he wouldn't be in this difficult position now.\n\nOf course, this blame was unfair to Xu Le. If Zhou Ze himself had taken her by force that night, would Dr. Lin have resisted desperately, screaming \"rape\"? And then called the police to have Zhou Ze arrested? Accused him of sexual assault?\n\nThe rain was still falling.\n\nZhou Ze tossed the cigarette butt to the ground.\n\n\"Did you drive here?\"\n\n\"Took a taxi,\" Dr. Lin replied.\n\n\"I'll take you back.\"\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\nNo need to dwell on how this seemingly foolish and naive New Year's Eve rainy night stroll began,\n\nAt least, the two of them felt that ending it now was most appropriate.\n\nThey hailed a ride-sharing car, and Zhou Ze and Dr. Lin got in together.\n\nFifteen minutes later, they arrived. Zhou Ze accompanied Dr. Lin out of the car. The driver completed the order and drove off.\n\nTheir home was just upstairs, but Zhou Ze and Dr. Lin didn't choose to go up immediately.\n\nThis scene was a bit like middle school sweethearts walking home together to the girl's apartment building, where they were about to part, lingering and affectionate.\n\nBut the atmosphere at this moment was not even as intense as that of shy middle schoolers, like meat broth without salt or MSG—tasteless but a shame to discard.\n\n\"Aren't you coming up?\" Dr. Lin asked.\n\n\"Not going up. Let's talk about it in a while, and we'll handle our business then.\"\n\nDr. Lin understood the unspoken meaning in Zhou Ze's words and said, \"I'm sorry.\"\n\nZhou Ze smiled, then reached out, intending to pat Dr. Lin's shoulder, but after his hand made contact, he suddenly felt an impulse and pulled her into a hug.\n\nDr. Lin's body stiffened for a moment but she didn't resist.\n\nThe two drew slightly closer, but it wasn't a particularly intimate gesture. Compared to their marital connection, it could already be said to be quite distant.\n\nShe smelled good; he didn't know what kind of shower gel she used, but it was very pleasant.\n\n\"I've always been curious about one thing: Do you have someone else in your heart?\" Zhou Ze added, \"That 'someone else' could be a man or a woman.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Dr. Lin answered honestly, even without hesitation.\n\nBefore, her husband had always been timid, which made her feel sorry for him.\n\nNow, her husband seemed like a different person, which also made her shed some burdens.\n\n\"Oh,\" Zhou Ze acknowledged, glancing slightly upwards, wondering if a certain protective color was appearing above his head.\n\nHe still felt a little disappointed.\n\nIt wasn't love.\n\nIt wasn't deep affection.\n\nHe barely even knew her,\n\nBut no matter what, she was nominally his wife, and yet he was still cuckolded.\n\nHmm, any man,\n\nNo,\n\nAny male,\n\nWould probably not be too happy about such a thing.\n\n\"I'm sorry.\" This was the second apology.\n\nZhou Ze released her hand, and they slowly separated.\n\n\"Saying sorry is too formal,\" Zhou Ze leaned against a nearby stone block and sat down. The rain had lessened, and there was a small eaves above him.\n\n\"I'll give you another sum of money. You can open another bookstore,\" Dr. Lin said, then added, \"I'm sorry.\"\n\nZhou Ze originally wanted to wave his hand magnanimously and say, *I don't care about the money.*\n\nBut then he thought of his freezer, and his future life.\n\nZhou Ze suddenly found himself unable to say it.\n\n*What if,*\n\n*What if,*\n\n*What if this woman took it seriously, thought giving money was insulting him, and really didn't offer any compensation?*\n\n\"Let's talk in a few days,\" Zhou Ze shrugged. \"How's that guy?\"\n\n\"He's very handsome, in my opinion,\" Dr. Lin replied.\n\nIt's a man.\n\nStab.\n\nAnother stab.\n\nIf it were a woman, it would be easier to accept...\n\nZhou Ze felt as if the photosynthesis above his head had intensified.\n\n\"No chance, right?\" Zhou Ze asked a very silly question, and regretted it immediately, but still consoled himself, *I'm asking this for poor Xu Le.*\n\n*You took over his body; now his wife cheated on him. You have to ask why, right?*\n\n*Hmm, that's exactly it.*\n\n\"No chance,\" Dr. Lin replied just as quickly and definitively.\n\nThis woman was also a surgeon. Her way of speaking was truly decisive, like using a scalpel, cutting directly to the crucial points without any unnecessary fuss.\n\nOtherwise, the patient would suffer more. In matters of the heart, it seemed the same principle applied.\n\n\"Alright, alright, can't compare, can't compare. Never mind, everyone lives their own lives. You go back and deal with your parents,\" Zhou Ze was a little annoyed.\n\nDr. Lin nodded, turned, and walked into the stairwell.\n\nZhou Ze stood up, ready to hail a taxi to leave, but at that moment, an unfamiliar number called him:\n\n\"Hello.\"\n\n\"Sir, I've brought my car back.\"\n\n\"That smart?\" Zhou Ze was a little surprised. He recognized the voice as that of the previous driver.\n\n\"You left a bag in the back seat. I've brought it back for you.\"\n\n\"Oh, thank you.\"\n\nThe car pulled up again downstairs at the apartment complex. Through the car window, the driver handed out a woman's bag.\n\n\"Please check it.\"\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't hesitate. He opened Dr. Lin's bag. Inside were just a phone, a wallet, a charging cable, and a few packets of tissues.\n\nHe took out the wallet. As soon as Zhou Ze opened it, he froze.\n\nHis gaze fixed on the photo slot in the wallet.\n\nThere was a photo there.\n\nThe woman in the photo looked very young, even... naive, wearing an ill-fitting white coat.\n\nAnd the man to the right of the girl, Zhou Ze felt a strangely familiar sensation.\n\nHe was stunned for a long while.\n\nOnly then did Zhou Ze recognize him.\n\n*Isn't this me?*\n\nThis was a cropped photo, likely a group photo, but it had been specifically cut to feature only the two of them.\n\n\"Is anything missing?\" the driver prompted.\n\n\"No, it's fine. Thank you, master. You can go.\"\n\nThe driver drove off.\n\nZhou Ze continued to hold the wallet and look at it. He didn't even think to call Dr. Lin at that moment and tell her to come down for her bag.\n\nSome memories, not quite forgotten, but certainly not often thought of, began to surface.\n\nHe vaguely remembered,\n\nFive or six years ago, he seemed to have supervised a group of students on internship, assigned directly from their school. There was a girl, surnamed Lin, and she looked like the girl in the photo.\n\nGirls blossom when they grow up.\n\nA smile appeared on Zhou Ze's lips.\n\nDr. Lin was once this cute and innocent. Who would have known that five or six years later, she would have grown into such a graceful beauty? He really hadn't noticed this girl's potential to develop.\n\nMoreover, at the time, he was very perfunctory about the hospital assigning him interns. These students were purely used as \"medical dogs\" under him.\n\nZhou Ze shook the wallet in his hand.\n\n\"Damn it, no wonder you were still single close to thirty.\"\n\nThis time, unexpectedly, he wasn't cursing Xu Le.\n\nBut cursing himself,\n\n\"My eyes,\n\nAre truly blind...\"\n\nZhou Ze stretched out his arms and yawned.\n\nThe one who cuckolded him,\n\nWas actually himself.\n\nEarly morning after the rain, New Year's Day.\n\nHeh heh,\n\nHe looked up at the sky.\n\nHe solemnly reached out and patted his chest.\n\nZhou Ze paused,\n\nThen said very seriously:\n\n\"Xu Le, you truly are my good brother!\n\nI shall raise your wife; you need not worry.\"",

    "content": "The lingering scent of firecrackers still hung in the air, a bit choking, but perhaps this was the smell of the New Year, commonly known as \"nian wei'er.\"*\n\nEspecially for Zhou Ze at this moment, life seemed to have gained a touch of beauty.\n\nIt wasn't a romance of eternal vows, nor was it as exaggerated as \"mountains crumble, heavens merge.\"*\n\nIt was simply like a child, who usually had no pocket money, finding a ten-yuan bill on the road with no police officers in sight and a small shop conveniently nearby.\n\nAfter a journey through hell and a change of body, there were still many troubles, both discovered and undiscovered, that needed solving, and his own personality had subtly undergone significant changes.\n\nRecalling his previous life, he emerged from the orphanage, his mind set on climbing step by step with his own hands and abilities. In hindsight, perhaps the reason he overlooked Doctor Lin back then wasn't because she was so dull or ugly five years ago. At that age, a girl should have been blooming, otherwise, she wouldn't have cropped that photo and kept it in her wallet.\n\nUnfortunately, at that time, he had neither the energy nor the inclination to glance at the scenery along the way. His obsession was too strong, a look of bitter resentment, yet he pretended to be so cool, so aloof.\n\nUnlike now, having died once and returned, he felt a sense of \"freedom from official burdens,\"* a mix of carefree liberation and melancholy.\n\nBut no matter what,\n\nThe feeling of being secretly loved, even of \"loving until death,\"\n\nWas indeed wonderful.\n\nHe made a call, and Doctor Lin came down again. She descended somewhat hastily, took her women's bag from Zhou Ze's hand, smiled, and didn't say thank you. Given their current relationship, saying \"thank you\" was even more inappropriate than saying \"I'm sorry.\"\n\nWaving goodbye,\n\nZhou Ze left a receding figure,\n\nTo go back to sleep,\n\nAnd await tomorrow, which would be even better.\n\nDoctor Lin felt that her husband's mood seemed to have shifted slightly, like a sense of relief.\n\nPerhaps, if both could see things clearly, it was indeed a good thing.\n\nRather than awkwardly continue to be entangled, it was better to part gracefully and each face life anew.\n\nOne could only call it the unpredictability of life. Doctor Lin could never have imagined that inside her husband's body currently resided another soul.\n\nThe man she, then an intern, had vaguely adored.\n\nZhou Ze hailed another car, then squatted by the residential complex gate, smoking. His phone screen kept showing ongoing searches, and Zhou Ze regretted letting the previous driver go. He should have asked him to wait so he could take his car back to the bookstore.\n\nNow, it was quite difficult to hail a car on New Year's Eve.\n\nAfter waiting for about ten minutes and smoking three cigarettes, Zhou Ze became agitated. He stood up straight and stretched.\n\nAlthough he wasn't particularly afraid of the cold, walking back would be quite tiring.\n\nJust then, a black sedan drove towards Zhou Ze from the road ahead. It slowed down as it passed him.\n\n\"Going somewhere?\" The driver poked his head out the window. He had a round face, was middle-aged, stubbly, and wore a black cotton coat.\n\n\"Yes,\" Zhou Ze had no other choice.\n\n\"Get in, I won't charge you extra,\" the driver smiled.\n\nZhou Ze got in, told him the bookstore's location, and settled on a price. The driver started the car again.\n\nThe car seemed new; the seat covers still gave off a plastic and leather smell, and the interior was very clean.\n\nGenerally, few people were willing to use a new car for ride-sharing.\n\n\"That place is remote,\" the driver proactively offered Zhou Ze a cigarette, which Zhou Ze accepted.\n\n\"Mhm.\"\n\n\"Do you live there?\"\n\n\"My shop is there.\"\n\n\"Oh, business must not be good, then?\" Everyone knew that commercial center had long since died out and lacked any foot traffic.\n\n\"Are you not from around here?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nTongcheng's local dialect was different from other regional dialects and almost a completely different language style from Mandarin, making it easy to distinguish.\n\n\"My family's from Rongcheng. I work here,\" the driver lit his cigarette. \"Smoke, don't be shy.\"\n\nZhou Ze also lit a cigarette, took a puff, and frowned slightly. The smoke tasted unusually mild.\n\n\"Not going back for New Year's?\"\n\n\"Wife and kids are home, no problem. I'm not going back; I'm hoping to earn a bit more money,\" the driver extended his hand out the window to flick ash. \"I have four kids.\"\n\n\"Impressive,\" Zhou Ze praised.\n\n\"It's tough,\" the driver smacked his lips. \"My wife's first born was a boy, and the second was also a boy. I wanted a daughter, and then the third was another boy. Thankfully, the fourth was finally a girl. I'm satisfied now.\"\n\n\"That's good,\" Zhou Ze echoed, took another drag from his cigarette, then tossed it out the window. The smoke was so mild, it was like smoking rolled paper.\n\n\"I don't have old-fashioned ideas, nor do I prefer boys over girls. I just like kids and wanted to have more, haha.\" The driver's words flowed more freely when talking about his children.\n\n\"The fine for the youngest hasn't been paid yet. When it's time for school, I'll go pay the money and get the household registration done. Oh, by the way, what kind of shop do you run?\"\n\n\"A bookstore.\"\n\n\"How's business?\" The driver touched a sore spot.\n\n\"Not great.\"\n\n\"Yeah, people can buy books online now, and there are coupons.\"\n\nAhead on the road, there was a car accident. Traffic police had set up roadblocks, reducing the four-lane road to a single lane. Thankfully, there weren't many cars on the road late on New Year's Eve, so it shouldn't cause too much delay.\n\n\"It's bad luck to get into a car accident on New Year's,\" the driver exhaled a smoke ring, his tone somewhat like a leader, tinged with criticism.\n\nZhou Ze leaned back in his seat, adopting a more comfortable posture, and asked:\n\n\"Is this car new?\"\n\n\"Yeah, my son gave it to me.\"\n\nZhou Ze smiled. \"How old are you? How old is your son?\"\n\n\"Hehe,\" the driver narrowed his eyes. \"My son is capable. These days, ambition isn't limited by age. If you have hands, feet, and a brain, and aren't constantly cursed by bad luck, how can you remain poor?\"\n\n\"That's true,\" Zhou Ze agreed, nodding.\n\n\"Beep beep... Beep beep...\"\n\nA car behind them seemed to be in a hurry to get home, honking frequently, urging the cars ahead to move faster.\n\n\"Keep honking, you'll honk yourselves to hell.\"\n\nThe driver's temper flared a bit. He leaned out the window again and swore at the car behind him.\n\nBut the cars behind him honked even more frequently, as if deliberately demonstrating.\n\n\"Hey!\"\n\nThe driver made to push open his door, ready to get out and have a proper discussion.\n\nJust then, the traffic police directing traffic ahead gestured for the cars to pass quickly. The driver sheepishly sat back, started the car, and drove on.\n\n\"Business isn't good today, oh,\" the driver began to lament again. \"I should have just gone home to see my wife and kids.\"\n\n\"It's not bad,\" Zhou Ze said noncommittally. He saw that the noodle shop next door was doing quite well. Most competitors were closed for the New Year, so even if demand was slightly lower during the holiday, business was still better than before.\n\nEspecially considering how long Zhou Ze had just waited for a ride without anyone accepting.\n\n\"Heh, it's not good, no.\" The driver still shook his head. \"I don't dare rest. My kids' tuition, I have to send money home every month. I work during the day, and then drive for half the night. This life, it's pretty dull. Even this cigarette, I can't afford a better one.\"\n\nThis cigarette of yours... seems fake.\n\nZhou Ze took out his own cigarette, pulled one out, and fiddled with it in his hand.\n\n\"But it's good, too. The internet is convenient now. I video call my wife and kids before sleeping when I get home. It's really nice to see them.\" A relaxed expression appeared on the driver's face.\n\nZhou Ze closed his eyes slightly. He couldn't sleep, but at this moment, he didn't feel like talking or chatting.\n\nBut even without Zhou Ze's feedback or reaction, the driver continued to talk. It was New Year's, and he was alone in a foreign land, naturally lonely.\n\nFrom naming his children, to their schools, to his parents, to the customs of his village, the driver rambled on.\n\nZhou Ze eventually just rested his forehead against the car window and urged, \"Driver, please drive faster.\"\n\nThis driver was driving too slowly, perhaps only thirty miles per hour.\n\nThis was a highway, after all.\n\nZhou Ze even wondered if the other person was too lonely and intentionally driving slowly to find someone to chat with, but Zhou Ze had no interest in being a confidante.\n\n\"Hehe, it's a new car, and I'm not too familiar with it yet. I don't dare drive too fast, oh.\" The driver caressed the steering wheel dearly. \"This car isn't worth much, it's even very cheap, but it's my eldest son's heartfelt gift. I have to cherish and treasure it.\n\nI'll try to use this car to do business for a few years, and after my eldest son finds a partner, I'll get him a house. I'll take care of them one by one. I don't want the older ones to have to carry the younger ones; that's not fair to the older ones. After all, I'm the father who decided to have them. As long as I can still work and have a job, I have to grit my teeth and bear it. I'm not an irresponsible person, and I won't do something like just bringing them into the world and not raising them.\"\n\nZhou Ze frowned slightly,\n\nHe felt a bit annoyed,\n\nThen he lit one of his own cigarettes and took a puff,\n\n\"Driver, seriously, please go faster.\" Zhou Ze was starting to miss his freezer, and he also regretted not asking Doctor Lin to drive him back.\n\n\"Don't rush, young man. It's New Year's, and we're fated to meet, aren't we? No need to rush. I understand, I understand. I'm an old driver...\"\n\nZhou Ze flicked his cigarette ash,\n\nAccidentally missing the window,\n\nA clump of ash landed on the inside of the car door.\n\nImmediately after,\n\nThe inside of the car door was burned by the ash, creating a hole,\n\nA thumb-sized hole,\n\nAnd the cold wind kept whistling in through the small hole.\n\n---\n* **年味兒 (nian wei'er):** The atmosphere or feeling of the New Year.\n* **山無棱天地合 (shān wú léng tiān dì hé):** An idiom from an ancient Chinese folk song, meaning \"mountains crumble, heavens merge.\" It is used to describe an eternal, unchanging love, usually implying an oath of undying love.\n* **無官一身輕 (wú guān yī shēn qīng):** An idiom meaning \"without official burdens, one feels light.\" It describes a feeling of relaxation and freedom after resigning from an official position or being freed from heavy responsibilities.",

    "content": "For someone who doesn’t understand cars, buying one can be a real headache. You inevitably ask friends or relatives who are knowledgeable, as some cars do have their drawbacks and potential issues, such as quality or performance problems.\n\nBut ultimately,\n\nA car door that can be directly poked through with a cigarette butt,\n\nCan you still vaguely describe that as a car with quality issues?\n\nAll of this only indicates one thing:\n\nThis is a…\n\nPaper car!\n\nThe driver was middle-aged, but his eldest son was probably only elementary school age. Because of this, the driver said the car was “sent” to him by his son.\n\nActually, the word “sent” (捎, shāo) here,\n\nCould also be written as “burned” (燒, shāo).\n\nHis father died,\n\nAnd his son burned him a paper car.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. To be honest, he really hadn’t noticed it beforehand. It was only after he got into the car that he belatedly felt something was off, but he still wanted to pretend to be clueless.\n\nHe himself was a stowaway. He didn't harbor the lofty ambition of becoming a Celestial Master.\n\nAfter all, he was also a ghost.\n\nIf he were to raise the banner of exorcising demons and defending the righteous path, it would truly be no different from a traitor, only a “ghost traitor.”\n\nHe placed his palm over the small hole, covering it, and Zhou Ze feigned drowsiness, half-closing his eyes, as if nothing had happened.\n\nZhou Ze remembered that when he was in the orphanage, there was a teacher who usually led physical education classes and also had a part-time job – gatekeeping.\n\nAnd because his surname was Qin, the children at the time called him – Gatekeeper Old Man Qin.\n\nOld Man Qin was very good at telling stories, often ghost stories. He seemed quite satisfied when the children looked frightened after hearing his stories. For this, the dean had spoken to him a few times, but he didn't curb his habit.\n\nIt was only before Zhou Ze left the orphanage to study outside that Old Man Qin passed away from a myocardial infarction.\n\nZhou Ze remembered a ghost story Old Man Qin told, called “Ghosts Carrying a Sedan Chair.”\n\nLegend has it that in ancient times, there were many kinds of ghosts. Most people, after dying, went directly to the Underworld, entered the Yellow Springs, drank Meng Po Soup, and re-entered the cycle of reincarnation. Very few ghosts remained in the Human Realm.\n\nBut some ghosts did remain. They might have known they were dead, or they might not have, but regardless, they might still have been doing what they did in life.\n\nFor example, sedan chair bearers.\n\nThey would appear on roads in desolate areas or late at night, asking people if they wanted to ride in a sedan chair. The price was extremely cheap. After the person rode the sedan chair to their destination, money and goods were exchanged.\n\nBut for living people to do business with ghosts and enjoy services provided by ghosts, it would never be that simple and ordinary. What ghosts carrying a sedan chair wanted was not mere money, that filthy lucre, but your lifespan, or your vital energy.\n\nUnderground, ghosts carried sedan chairs for figures like Yama. What status did a living person have? Were they worthy?\n\nIt was like an eighty-year-old man kneeling before you; it would shorten your life.\n\nZhou Ze remembered this story, and very clearly. In fact, Zhou Ze still remembered many of the stories Old Man Qin told, even after he became an adult and started working.\n\nBecause Zhou Ze knew that the day before Old Man Qin suddenly fell ill and died, Old Man Qin, who usually only guarded the gate and never entered the back courtyard, exceptionally walked into the children’s dormitory, looking at room after room, child after child. Zhou Ze happened to be awake at the time and witnessed this scene.\n\nIt seemed as if Old Man Qin knew his end was near and came to say goodbye in advance.\n\nJust as a fart from Warren Buffett can make people feel it contains profound financial secrets,\n\nA person who knows they might kick the bucket tomorrow, his ghost stories can no longer be dismissed as mere absurd tales.\n\nThe driver was still rambling on, continuing to brag, and Zhou Ze remained calm in the back.\n\nShorten lifespan?\n\nLose vital energy?\n\nZhou Ze wasn't too afraid; he wasn't a living person, he was also a ghost.\n\nTo put it indelicately, although Zhou Ze didn't understand the stratification and hierarchy of ghosts, being able to walk in the sunlight, meet living people, and open a business, he must be far superior to the lonely wandering ghosts outside, right?\n\nMoreover, even the faceless woman in the hellish pond could be injured by his fingernails. When facing other ghostly entities, Zhou Ze actually felt quite confident.\n\n\"These days, more people are buying cars and driving, and more people are breaking rules,\" the driver continued to chat. Even though Zhou Ze didn't respond or join in, he could still keep talking.\n\n\"When the forest gets big, all kinds of birds appear. In short, if you really get angry at every single one, you'll truly live many years less.\n\nAlthough I know I shouldn't get angry, some people go out with a 'Hit me! You damned jerk, hit me!' sign taped to their foreheads. It's truly infuriating.\"\n\nZhou Ze narrowed his eyes. He felt a bit sleepy, even wanted to sleep.\n\nBut he knew he couldn't sleep. Therefore, this clear sensation he was feeling must be false.\n\nZhou Ze suddenly let out a silent chuckle.\n\nHe understood why this driver had been chattering endlessly the whole way. It wasn't that he didn't know his constant talking was annoying.\n\nIt was because Zhou Ze hadn't fallen asleep, so the driver had to keep talking to pretend everything was normal.\n\nHe wanted Zhou Ze to fall asleep,\n\nAnd Zhou Ze’s reaction to sleep had always been quite slow.\n\nZhou Ze's lips curved into a smile. He rested his hand on the car seat and closed his eyes.\n\nSleep.\n\nThe car began to slow down.\n\nThe driver's voice also grew softer as Zhou Ze drifted off to sleep.\n\nAt the same time, the driver specifically turned to look behind him.\n\nHowever, at that moment, a struggling expression suddenly appeared on the driver's face. Finally, he shook his head forcefully, sighed, and continued driving forward.\n\nIt seemed they were almost at the bookstore.\n\nZhou Ze wasn’t sure how a ghost driving a paper car could transport him, a person with a physical body.\n\nThis was hard to explain, as physics had no \"ghost-mechanics\" branch.\n\nFurthermore, ancient Chinese legends mentioned \"Yellow Turban warriors\" and \"Qimen Dunjia\" (Mystical Doors and Hidden Jia). He guessed it was probably similar in principle to those.\n\nZhou Ze slowly awoke, because he sensed that the driver in front of him was gradually emanating light.\n\nInteresting.\n\nHe seemed to have been encountering good ghosts lately.\n\nThis driver should have \"collected his payment\" from him, but he couldn't bring himself to do it. It was probably his first time doing something like this, and he couldn't go through with it. In this struggle, he achieved self-liberation and redemption.\n\nHe began to dissipate.\n\nAfter dissipating, he would enter the Underworld and the cycle of reincarnation.\n\nFrom this, it was evident that not all the \"nonsense\" the driver had spoken earlier was false. He had four children, he enjoyed being a father, and he worked hard to earn money to support his family and provide a good upbringing for his children.\n\nHe was a good father, and his character was quite decent. After becoming a ghost, when he tried the \"ghost carrying a sedan chair\" business, he ultimately couldn't bring himself to be ruthless.\n\nZhou Ze slowly raised his head and opened his eyes. The driver didn't notice, still driving along.\n\nGradually, Zhou Ze saw light shining in from outside. Through the window, he could see the bustling traffic on the road.\n\nThe driver was about to dissipate.\n\nThis must be a memory from the driver's life.\n\nIt's similar to the principle that lightning combined with a special environment can record a segment of an image.\n\nZhou Ze subconsciously lit another cigarette. Since the driver had already found self-liberation, it wouldn't matter even if he burned this car now.\n\nMusic was playing in the car, a currently popular song called “Coolness”;\n\nThe driver was humming along as he drove. He must have just finished a big fare and was in a good mood, planning to go back, buy some peanuts, and video chat with his children for a while. Though life was tough, it was quite pleasant.\n\nJust then, Zhou Ze saw a minibus appear on the road in front of the car.\n\nIt must have been a school bus, with a school emblem and the words \"XXX Elementary School\" printed on it.\n\nZhou Ze didn't pay it much mind at first, but then a girl in the back seat of the car suddenly stood up. She was facing the back of the car, and even from inside the car behind, she could be clearly seen through the car window.\n\nThe girl was wearing a blue pleated skirt and was very cute.\n\nZhou Ze frowned slightly.\n\nHe knew this girl. He had saved her, and she was said to have woken up. Lin, the doctor, had recently told him that the girl’s father wanted to host a thank-you dinner and had planned to invite him.\n\nZhou Ze's gaze darkened. So, this driver was the culprit behind that car accident?\n\nSo many children injured,\n\nAnd if he hadn't intervened, some children would have died.\n\n\"What a beautiful girl, just like my youngest.\"\n\nThe driver muttered to himself. This was the last memory from his life, so he didn't realize there was someone sitting in the back seat at that moment.\n\nZhou Ze looked around. He didn't think the driver was drunk, nor did he seem to have any other issues. So, what caused the driver to crash into the school bus? What led to that car accident?\n\nWas it a chain collision caused by nearby vehicles?\n\nJust then,\n\nThe girl, who had been standing at the very back of the school bus wearing a pleated skirt, suddenly opened her mouth. Her tongue shot out.\n\nYes,\n\nIt shot out,\n\nLike a red carpet for a new bride, it directly extended, very long… very long… long enough to make one's scalp tingle.\n\nAt the same time,\n\nThe girl stared mockingly at the driver who was driving in front of her.\n\n\"Mommy, a ghost!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\"\n\nIn a panic, the driver stomped on the accelerator, and the car slammed directly into the school bus in front.\n\n\"Boom!\"\n\nSparks flew,\n\nZhou Ze stood at the entrance of the bookstore,\n\nOn the ground around him were the unburnt ashes of the paper car, drifting with the wind, swirling and falling, turning into the last scattering of specks.\n\nZhou Ze had no injuries, not a single one.\n\nAnd the driver had kept his promise, delivering him to his destination.\n\nBut Zhou Ze wasn't in a hurry to go back into the bookstore.\n\nHe still held the cigarette between his fingers, slowly burning.\n\nTaking a deep breath,\n\nZhou Ze licked his lips.\n\n\"Uncle, you can't smoke in the hospital,\" the girl's voice still echoed in his ears.\n\nWhat,\n\nExactly,\n\nHad he saved?",

    "content": "The next morning, Zhou Ze, after his usual wash-up, went to the noodle shop next door. This had gradually become a habit for him. When eating was no longer an enjoyable process, it simply became a task. For tasks, simple and efficient was best, and nowhere was more convenient and quick than Xu Qinglang's place.\n\n\"Bitter gourd juice.\" Xu Qinglang placed a large glass cup in front of Zhou Ze, then served him a plate of egg fried rice.\n\nZhou Ze cautiously took a sip. The moment the liquid entered his throat, he felt an unbearable bitterness coating his lips and tongue. Immediately after swallowing, even his intestines and stomach began to knot up.\n\nAfter about ten seconds, Zhou Ze recovered, letting out a long sigh.\n\nIt was truly bitter.\n\n\"Haha, powerful enough, right?\" Xu Qinglang wore an expression that begged for praise, then sat down in front of Zhou Ze. \"Speaking of which, you have quite the heavy taste. You can't eat without drinking this stuff?\"\n\nZhou Ze composed himself, then picked up the full glass of bitter gourd juice and chugged it down. Immediately after, he quickly grabbed his chopsticks and began to wolf down the egg fried rice in front of him.\n\nOne minute later, Zhou Ze finished his meal, set down the plate, and closed his eyes.\n\n\"That eating style, it's exactly like a demon crawling out of hell,\" Xu Qinglang teased.\n\nWhether it was just teasing or had another meaning was unknown.\n\nZhou Ze opened his eyes and glanced at the other man. On the seventh day when the five migrant worker brothers returned, it was normal for his sister-in-law and wife not to see them. However, this noodle shop owner could see them, otherwise he wouldn't have made those five portions of braised pork with rice.\n\nBut between the two of them, there was an unspoken understanding to acknowledge without explicitly stating it. Perhaps that was the way to get along.\n\n\"Why aren't you taking orders today?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nIn the previous days, even on Lunar New Year's Eve, Xu Qinglang's phone was constantly receiving delivery orders. Today, however, seemed much quieter, with no delivery drivers coming to pick up food.\n\n\"Taking a break.\" Xu Qinglang took out a cigarette, put one in his mouth, and offered one to Zhou Ze.\n\nAlthough it was strange to take a break after Lunar New Year's Eve when he didn't rest then,\n\nAs a man with over twenty apartments,\n\nHe certainly had the capital to be capricious.\n\n\"Do you know about 'ghost sedan'?\" Zhou Ze asked. He remembered last night's events vividly, but he didn't rush to do anything; he simply went home and slept in his freezer.\n\nZhou Ze himself was the one who had saved the person. If there were any problems, Zhou Ze didn't want to get involved.\n\nHe was cautiously and lively living his own small life. If he encountered anything normally, he would help if it was convenient, but he wouldn't force anything.\n\nEven if that little girl in the lily dress had some issues, it was no longer Zhou Ze's business to handle.\n\n\"Ghost sedan?\" Xu Qinglang was startled for a moment, then chuckled, \"Heh heh, there were many on Lunar New Year's Eve, right? They say that during the New Year, people burn scriptures and paper money, so ghosts also have spare cash and can afford to take a taxi.\"\n\nXu Qinglang continued to spout nonsense, then yawned. \"By the way, why is your bookstore still not open?\"\n\n\"I'll open it in the evening.\"\n\n\"Alright, being willful.\" Xu Qinglang took out his phone and glanced at it. \"How about we go see a movie this afternoon?\"\n\nThe scene,\n\nInstantly fell into an awkward silence.\n\n\"No,\" Zhou Ze refused.\n\n\"See? You're not giving me face at all. After all my hard work concocting new juices for you, you're not even willing to go see a movie with me.\n\nMen, they're all no good.\"\n\n\"............\" Zhou Ze.\n\n\"My apologies, I forgot I was a man myself.\" Xu Qinglang shook his head with a touch of melancholy, looking as if he regretted not being born a woman.\n\n\"Did you experience some psychological trauma when you were little?\" Zhou Ze asked. \"I know some psychologists who might be able to help you.\"\n\nXu Qinglang scoffed,\n\n\"Heterosexuality is just a deviation created for reproduction; true love can only be between the same sex.\"\n\n\"I beg to differ.\"\n\n\"Those whose paths diverge cannot plan together.\"*\n\nTheir post-meal conversation ended on a sour note.\n\nZhou Ze returned to his bookstore, opened the door, thought for a moment, and decided not to lock it. He simply sat behind the counter, opened his computer, and sent a WeChat message to Dr. Lin:\n\n\"Go see a movie this afternoon?\"\n\nAfter about ten minutes, Dr. Lin replied:\n\n\"Working.\"\n\nJust because it was New Year's didn't mean people wouldn't get sick or have accidents. Zhou Ze, who used to be a doctor himself, knew how much \"flexibility\" hospital holidays had.\n\nHe could understand it, but it was still somewhat unsatisfying.\n\nZhou Ze really wanted to tell her that he was Zhou Ze, not some random Xu Le.\n\nBut he was worried that the outcome would be Dr. Lin being scared out of her wits, even collapsing the vague, unrequited crush she might have had. Of course, most importantly, the fewer people who knew certain things, the better.\n\nSomeone would come to catch him,\n\nZhou Ze knew this very well,\n\nHe was waiting, and while waiting, he didn't choose to cower in a dark corner like a rat in a sewer. He still needed to live, and to live very normally. Otherwise, it would have been better not to have come out of hell, and just followed the main group down the Road to the Yellow Springs.\n\nAs for his neighbor next door, whether he had figured it out, Zhou Ze didn't know, and didn't care to know.\n\n\"In the evening, then.\"\n\nDr. Lin sent another message.\n\nZhou Ze smiled. He felt his smile was idiotic, exactly like going back to middle school when he saw the class study monitor glance at him shyly.\n\nIn the past, he had lived too laboriously.\n\nThis lifetime, he had to live a bit more freely and loosely.\n\nMany truths in life can only truly be understood and seen clearly just before death or when old, but by the time you understand them, you've already lost the chance to start over.\n\nZhou Ze cherished his current life and opportunities very much.\n\nA red sedan stopped on the road in front of the bookstore, and two women got out.\n\nOne was under thirty, the other looked to be only five or six.\n\nThe woman wore a red dress, her hair flowing. Though a mother, she still exuded a captivating allure, able to stir one's heart even more.\n\nThe girl wore overalls, and was likely bundled in several layers of warm clothing, like a small zongzi, adorably naive.\n\nBut upon seeing the girl, Zhou Ze's eyes instinctively narrowed.\n\nThose who come are not good,\n\nThose who are good do not come.\n\nHe hadn't gone looking for her,\n\nYet she had come to him.\n\nHe had heard Dr. Lin say that at the appreciation dinner, the girl had called him \"uncle,\" and Zhou Ze had been secretly pleased. Now, upon reflection, she had never intended to let him go.\n\nUltimately,\n\nThe father of four children, his death, was because of this girl.\n\nThe bookstore door was pushed open. The woman curiously surveyed her surroundings, while the girl timidly walked up to Zhou Ze's counter, looked at him, and in a soft, sweet voice, said:\n\n\"Hello, Uncle.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded, somewhat reservedly,\n\nWhile actually wondering if he should just use his fingernails to strangle the girl to death.\n\n\"Hello, I'm Rui Rui's mother.\"\n\nThe woman walked up to Zhou Ze and placed a gift box on the counter.\n\n\"Thank you.\"\n\nThe woman bowed to Zhou Ze,\n\nWith deep sincerity.\n\n\"You're welcome,\" Zhou Ze remained seated.\n\nHe really wanted to pretend everything was normal, so that the girl wouldn't notice anything.\n\nBut it was too difficult,\n\nEven an Oscar-winning actor,\n\nAfter seeing the driver's memories from last night,\n\nWould probably find it hard to remain normal in front of this girl, right?\n\nSince he couldn't pretend convincingly, he simply wouldn't pretend.\n\n\"Mommy, I want to read a book here,\" Rui Rui said to the woman.\n\n\"Alright, Mommy is going to get her hair done first. You stay here with Uncle and read.\" The woman smiled at Zhou Ze. \"Thank you for your trouble.\"\n\n\"It's no trouble.\"\n\n\"Only through Dr. Lin did I know you run a shop here.\"\n\nBusybody.\n\n\"You and Dr. Lin are truly a perfect match.\"\n\nThat was a disingenuous compliment. Xu Le himself wouldn't believe it.\n\nThe woman drove off, leaving her daughter behind. This was a bookstore, and Zhou Ze was half her daughter's savior, and Dr. Lin's husband, so she felt completely at ease leaving her daughter there, with no worries about anything happening.\n\nNext, Rui Rui picked out a picture book herself and sat on a plastic stool, reading.\n\nShe wasn't noisy, nor did she fuss.\n\nShe didn't ask for a drink, nor did she clamor for snacks.\n\nZhou Ze sat behind the counter, watching her.\n\nJust then, Xu Qinglang walked in, saw the little girl who looked like a porcelain doll, and immediately went over and picked her up.\n\n\"Oh, what a cute little girl!\"\n\n\"Thank you, big sister,\" Rui Rui replied.\n\nXu Qinglang's smile bloomed like a chrysanthemum, becoming even brighter.\n\nThe little girl's flattery had hit Xu Qinglang's soft spot.\n\nZhou Ze, however, remained poker-faced, still sitting there.\n\n\"Come out, I have something to tell you,\" Xu Qinglang put the child down and pointed at Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze and Xu Qinglang walked outside.\n\n\"People from the plaza came and asked if we wanted to terminate the contract. They can refund our prepaid rent.\"\n\n\"No refund for now,\" Zhou Ze didn't want to make more trouble for the time being. Besides, he didn't have enough capital; even with the prepaid rent, it wouldn't be enough to open another shop.\n\n\"I thought so too.\" Xu Qinglang nodded, indicating he understood. \"So, I'll represent you in the negotiations?\"\n\n\"Alright.\"\n\n\"Good, it's settled then.\"\n\nThe two stood outside the door and smoked a cigarette before parting ways.\n\nWhen Zhou Ze turned around and pushed open the bookstore door to go inside,\n\nHe found that the little girl was no longer on the row of plastic stools. The picture book was placed on one of them.\n\nZhou Ze frowned,\n\nLooked up,\n\nAt the staircase, he heard the sound of small leather boots,\n\nThe little girl emerged from there, half her body visible, half hidden by the wall.\n\nShe had just,\n\nBeen on his second floor.\n\n---\n* An idiom meaning \"people with different principles cannot work together or share a common goal.\"",

    "content": "\"Did you go up to look?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nThe little loli shook her head, \"It's dark up there, I can't see anything clearly.\"\n\nNo sooner had she spoken than the little loli slowly walked down, then stood in front of Zhou Ze.\n\nShe was very short, dressed in many layers, and her delicate face was like a masterpiece of art.\n\nBut Zhou Ze knew that her tongue could be very, very long, so long it made one's scalp tingle.\n\n\"Uncle, I'm going back to reading.\"\n\nThe little loli smiled innocently, sat back down on the small plastic stool, picked up the illustrated children's book, and continued to read it with relish.\n\nZhou Ze stood behind her, his hands clasped behind his back.\n\nChoke her to death,\nChoke her to death,\nNo matter what her intentions are,\nThere's no need to keep up this charade!\n\nThis voice echoed in Zhou Ze's mind; it wasn't anyone else's voice, but Zhou Ze's own thoughts.\n\nCompared to Xu Qinglang, the owner of the noodle shop next door, this little loli in front of him stirred up a great deal of irritation and dislike in Zhou Ze.\n\nHe was the one who saved her,\nShe was very cute,\nVery sensible,\nVery well-behaved,\nVery refined and polite,\nPossessing a rare sense of propriety and decorum for a child her age.\n\nPerhaps,\nPrecisely because her initial impression on him was so, so good, when Zhou Ze witnessed her true nature, the twisted human relationship and the shocking contrast made Zhou Ze's dislike and repulsion even stronger.\n\nThe little loli continued reading her book, seemingly oblivious and unconcerned with Zhou Ze behind her.\n\nZhou Ze stared at her, seeing even the fine downy hairs on the back of her neck clearly.\n\nTo choke,\nOr not to choke,\nUltimately,\nTo choke or not to choke?\n\n…………\n\n\"Mom and Dad, your son is resting today.\"\n\nInside the back room, Xu Qinglang arranged several cold dishes and hot dishes on a small table, along with two cups of wine.\n\nOne cup was Maotai, his late father's favorite kind.\nThe other cup was homemade rice wine; his late mother didn't drink alcohol and strongly disliked her father drinking, but occasionally at banquets, if the host was too enthusiastic, his mother would only drink a little rice wine.\nHis mother often said that rice wine was nourishing.\n\nAt the east and west corners of the small table, there were also two candlesticks, their flames flickering.\n\nTwo human skins hung behind the chairs, swaying without a breeze.\n\nXu Qinglang first toasted his father, then had a small sip with his mother.\n\nPicking up his chopsticks, he said to his parents:\n\"Eat, eat, Dad, you're trying to snatch my meat again!\"\n\nHe picked up several pieces of meat for himself and devoured them.\n\nHe remembered from his childhood that his father always pretended to snatch meat from him, but each time he would urge him to gobble it down, leaving his mouth full and unable to swallow.\nAnd his mother would then scold his father while gently patting his back.\n\nToday was the first day of the Chinese New Year.\nMost people would offer sacrifices to their ancestors before the New Year,\nBut Xu Qinglang was different; he did it on this day because his parents had died together on this day in an accident.\n\nNew Year,\nWhile in the eyes of ordinary people, it might have lost some of its \"flavor of the year\" compared to the past, for Xu Qinglang, it meant the return of a heartbreaking moment.\n\nTaking a deep breath,\nXu Qinglang smiled,\nAnd said:\n\"Dad, Mom.\"\n\nHe pursed his lips,\nXu Qinglang poured himself another glass of baijiu, then drank it all in one gulp.\nThe spicy alcohol made his already delicate and charming face even redder and more tender.\n\nHe was a man,\nYet he possessed a beauty that could ruin men.\nIf he had lived in ancient times, he would surely have been a plaything for emperors and nobles. Of course, even in modern times, if he wished, he could still thrive effortlessly.\nHow terrifying a man who could turn straight men gay was, went without saying.\n\nAfter much hesitation,\nAnd much contemplation,\nXu Qinglang finally couldn't hold back,\nAnd said:\n\"The person next door... the person next door, I'll find a chance to ask him, ask him... ask him how exactly he came back!\"\n\nXu Qinglang wasn't drunk, but his speech was a bit slurred.\nClearly,\nHe knew in his heart that the person next door wouldn't simply sit down and tell him the answer as if they were just chatting.\nThis process,\nWould ultimately be somewhat unpleasant, and would require him to use some methods.\n\nThe two human skins stopped swaying,\nAs if displeased.\n\n\"Dad, Mom, it's okay, your son will definitely bring you back to life!\"\n\n\"Clatter!\"\n\"Clatter!\"\n\nTwo pairs of chopsticks fell to the ground.\nXu Qinglang, holding his own chopsticks, was stunned for a moment,\nBut still shook his head,\n\"No, I can't listen to you this time. Even if you disagree, I'll still pry it out of him!\"\n\n…………\n\nChoke,\nOr not to choke?\n\nZhou Ze was still pondering this question.\nHe didn't know why he was so hesitant, nor did he understand what exactly he was struggling with.\n\nHe was a ghost,\nNo longer the doctor from his previous life.\nHe was dangerous, and his situation was very precarious. Therefore, he knew he should nip all dangers in the bud.\n\nThis little loli was a threat to him.\nShe had come to find him,\nShe had come on her own accord,\nJust like her soul spoke to him that day,\nShe,\nMust have been eyeing him for a long time.\n\nEven children understood the story of the farmer and the snake. Zhou Ze didn't believe that everything would be fine just because he had saved her once.\nIn fact, most animosity in this world evolves from kindness.\n\nZhou Ze's fingernails had slowly grown long, and at the same time, wisps of black mist were swirling around his fingertips.\nAt the same time,\nA black glow was also swirling in the depths of Zhou Ze's eyes.\n\nMust choke her to death,\nChoke her to death!\n\nZhou Ze repeated to himself in his heart. He had managed to be reborn with great difficulty; he still had a life, and things he wanted to do.\n\nHe still wanted to be lazy, still wanted to reminisce, still wanted to think,\nHe didn't want to be like the old and young on the Road to the Underworld, numb and hollow, knowing only to walk forward step by step.\n\nZhou Ze raised his hands,\nSlowly moving them towards the little loli.\n\nThe little loli was reading, very earnestly, with a smile on her lips, very cute and endearing.\n\nSuddenly, she felt two fingers placed on her temples.\n\nShe asked somewhat puzzled, \"Uncle?\"\n\n\"Let me massage you, it protects your eyes.\"\n\n\"Mm.\" The little loli responded, continuing to read her book.\n\nA well-applied pressure came from her temples, and the little loli felt very comfortable.\n\nAfterward,\nThe little loli watched her uncle quietly walk to the chair behind the counter and sit down.\n\n\"Uncle, what's wrong?\"\n\n\"Nothing.\" Zhou Ze waved his hand.\n\nThe little loli continued to lower her head and read.\nThen,\n\"Smack!\" a crisp sound.\nThe little loli looked up, again towards the counter, and saw that one side of Zhou Ze's face was red.\n\n\"Uncle?\"\n\n\"Swatting a mosquito.\" Zhou Ze let out a complete sigh of relief, then leaned back in the chair, a sigh escaping his heart: Damn it, I still couldn't do it, why am I so useless?\n\nThe little loli apparently didn't realize there would be mosquitoes in the middle of winter, but she still stood up and looked around, as if helping Zhou Ze look for the mosquito.\n\nDamn it,\nKeep faking it,\nYou're a drama queen!\nStill acting!\nAnd so convincingly!\nHurry up and stick out your tongue,\nLet's have a fight!\nIt'd be great if you killed me or I killed you,\nStill hiding behind a loli face, banking on me being unable to strike?\nI... really can't.\nShit!\n\nZhou Ze felt a bit helpless. He turned and went to the restroom, turned on the faucet, and splashed cold water hard on his face.\n\n\"I used to be a doctor, healing people was instinct, it was my profession.\nYou're already a ghost,\nHow can you still be such a goodie-two-shoes!\nUseless thing!\"\n\nZhou Ze started cursing himself in the mirror.\n\nThen, Zhou Ze also noticed that the frequency of him cursing himself seemed to have surpassed the frequency of him cursing Xu Le lately.\n\nMeanwhile, the little loli, who was originally sitting and reading in the bookstore, put down her book at this moment.\nShe looked meaningfully at the direction of the restroom door, but didn't walk towards it. Instead, she walked out of the bookstore,\nAnd went next door.\n\n…………\n\n\"Dad, Mom, no matter how much you try to dissuade me, it's no use. I want you to sit down and eat with me properly. He can do it, and I can turn you into this too!\nOur family can continue to live together, just like before.\"\n\nXu Qinglang was still rambling.\n\nSuddenly,\nThe two human skins that were originally hanging by the small table began to sway wildly as if possessed.\nXu Qinglang's face showed a look of shock. He looked up at the yellow talismans pasted above his inner room, only to find that those talismans had somehow turned gray.\n\nHe violently lifted the curtain and rushed out,\nHe saw a little girl standing in his noodle shop.\n\nThe girl opened her mouth,\nA long tongue stretched out,\nVery long,\nVery long,\nTerrifyingly long!\n\n\"The Underworld has order, the deceased shall pass.\"\n\nA somber child's voice came from the girl's mouth.\n\nThe next moment, the two human skins in the back room began to wilt and decay, losing their luster and flexibility. Two white streams of air dripped out, landing beside the little girl, transforming into the images of a man and a woman in their middle age.\n\nThey swayed unsteadily,\nSeemingly having forgotten everything,\nKnowing only to walk aimlessly, step by step, along the long tongue the girl had extended from her mouth, as if the girl's tongue was their destination, leading to some unknown place.\n\nGradually, their figures became fainter and blurrier.\n\n\"You... you actually... you actually are...\"\n\nXu Qinglang pointed at the sweet-talking little loli he had recently held, his face filled with shock. But when he saw his parents slowly disappearing,\nHe immediately tried to rush over hysterically. However, his feet seemed to be shackled, unable to run, and he fell heavily to the ground instead.\n\nHe stretched out his hand, pointing at his parents, and began to plead:\n\"Don't take them away, don't take them away,\nI haven't harmed anyone,\nI have never harmed anyone,\nI just want our family to be together,\nThey haven't harmed anyone either!\nNo, no, please, I beg you, I beg you…………\"\n\nHowever, faced with Xu Qinglang's tearful pleas,\nThe little loli remained unmoved. Only after the two souls had completely vanished did she retract her long tongue, and then, she reverted back to her adorable loli image.\n\nXu Qinglang felt as if two pieces had been forcibly gouged out of his chest.\nHis parents,\nHad completely left him.\n\nXu Qinglang's eyes were bloodshot. He pounded the tiled floor with all his might, hitting it hard.\nSuddenly,\nHe seemed to remember something,\nAnd immediately pointed at the next door, shouting:\n\"He's not human either, he's not human either,\nWhy don't you take him, why don't you take him!\nThis isn't fair, what you're doing isn't fair!\nHe's not human either,\nWhy do you only take my parents,\nHe's not human either,\nIt's not fair,\nIt's not fair!!!!!\"",

    "content": "The bathroom wasn't really well-renovated by Xu Le; it only had a simple washbasin and a squat toilet, not even a showerhead. As for the second floor, never mind a bed, there wasn't even a straw mat; it was purely used as a small storage room because Xu Le used to go home every day.\n\nEven with a pair of in-laws who looked down on him,\n\nEven with a bossy sister-in-law,\n\nEven with a wife who didn't sleep with him,\n\nXu Le would still leisurely go home every evening after finishing the few tasks at the bookstore and locking up.\n\nThis was life.\n\nIt wasn't about dignity,\n\nNor was it about freedom,\n\nBut he found it sweet.\n\nHe was a wimp, he was a coward, he lacked ambition.\n\nBecause he was Xu Le, not some historical figure who left a name behind, so everyone thought he didn't matter.\n\nIf he were overlaid with the identity of an ancient person, then Xu Le's life would be seen as great wisdom veiled by foolishness, adding far too much flavor for no reason.\n\nZhou Ze couldn't appreciate Xu Le's flavor. He grew up in an orphanage, and though his feelings of inferiority didn't show, they were indeed always present. Thus, he was sensitive and he worked hard, whether in his studies, his work, or his own life; it was always like this, always striving to be the best and most outstanding.\n\nHowever, at this moment, looking at his wet face in the mirror, a hint of pity emerged in Zhou Ze's heart.\n\nPity for Xu Le, and also pity for himself.\n\nEveryone has their own cage; it's just that the style and size of the cage differ, but there's always a cage.\n\nZhou Ze didn't want to be some Ghost King, nor did he hope to wield power in the human world by relying on his special abilities. On one hand, he knew that if he were too high-profile, something bad would probably happen immediately. On the other hand, his previous life was already very tiring, and this life he wanted to live differently.\n\nNo matter what, he wanted to survive, to continue living in this physical body.\n\nHe spread his palms before him; his nails had long receded, showing no abnormality.\n\nZhou Ze smiled.\n\nForget it.\n\nPerhaps it was just what he deserved.\n\nWiping his face with a towel, then his hands, Zhou Ze exited the bathroom. But when he re-emerged, the struggle that had been on his face was gone, replaced by a certain nonchalance.\n\nThe little loli was still sitting on the plastic stool, intently reading her illustrated book.\n\n\"Uncle, Rui Rui's thirsty.\"\n\nThe little loli called out to Zhou Ze.\n\nLike a pet charming its owner.\n\nZhou Ze nodded, poured a cup of water into a paper cup, lukewarm, and brought it to the little loli.\n\nThe little loli took the cup, took a sip, and her lips curved into a crescent moon smile.\n\nZhou Ze simply sat down on the tiled floor, reached out and ruffled the little loli's head, openly, without any pretense of caution.\n\nTime slowly passed.\n\nThe little loli continued to read,\n\nZhou Ze continued to lie beside her.\n\nOne big, one small,\n\nCoexisting peacefully.\n\nThe little loli would bring the interesting stories she read to Zhou Ze and share them with him, and Zhou Ze would respond, telling her some profound fables or other small stories.\n\nHe didn't know how much time had passed when the red car drove by again.\n\nThe girl's mother pushed open the door and thanked Zhou Ze. Her hair looked the same as when she arrived. Zhou Ze curved his lips; he really wanted to suggest that the woman go talk to that hair salon and demand an explanation, saying they shouldn't fool people like that.\n\nOf course, if he really said that, the woman might blame him for being nosy.\n\nThe little loli bowed to Zhou Ze and said thank you, then left with her mother.\n\nFrom beginning to end, the little loli didn't look back at him.\n\nGone was gone.\n\nZhou Ze walked to the counter and picked up the gift box the woman had given him earlier. Only then did he discover there was a stack of cash inside, three thousand yuan.\n\nNot bad.\n\nZhou Ze didn't think of returning it.\n\nHe was short on money; he'd take it for now.\n\nZhou Ze felt that he had come to terms with things, like an immortal cultivator suddenly achieving clarity of thought.\n\nBut he also felt like he was just letting things go to hell, come what may, he'd be carefree.\n\nHowever, at least he felt much more relaxed now.\n\nZhou Ze casually picked up a book with a very large cover from the bookshelf. It was \"Master Calligraphy Appreciation,\" a completely unsellable item. He wondered if Xu Le's head had been repeatedly crushed by a large iron gate back then to even stock such a book.\n\nHe flipped it open at random.\n\nThe page happened to have the four characters \"Rare is it to be confused.\"*\n\n\"Tsk, tsk.\"\n\nZhou Ze clicked his tongue.\n\nInteresting.\n\nHe checked the time and found it was almost evening. Remembering he had an appointment with Dr. Lin to see a movie tonight, Zhou Ze decided to go grab some food first.\n\nWalking next door, Zhou Ze paused, seeing Xu Qinglang kneeling on the ground.\n\nXu Qinglang's eyes were bloodshot, surrounded by many empty bottles. At this moment, he held a bottle and continued to drink.\n\n\"Unfair... so unfair...\"\n\nXu Qinglang mumbled, as if he hadn't noticed Zhou Ze entering the shop at all.\n\n\"Hey?\" Zhou Ze reached out and patted Xu Qinglang's shoulder, \"Are you alright?\"\n\nHe really wanted to remind Xu Qinglang that for other men, getting drunk might just mean having their money stolen, but if Xu Qinglang got drunk and went out, it wouldn't be as simple as just losing money.\n\nIn fact, if he were to lie on a late-night street with a woman, Xu Qinglang might be violated more times than the woman.\n\nXu Qinglang's body trembled, and he slowly raised his head, looking pitiable with tears streaming down his face. He formed an orchid gesture with his hand, pointed at Zhou Ze, and said mournfully:\n\n\"Today is my parents' death anniversary.\"\n\nZhou Ze was silent for a moment, then said, \"My condolences.\"\n\nHe waited for a moment.\n\nXu Qinglang continued to drink.\n\nZhou Ze could only remind him, \"Not cooking tonight?\"\n\n\"Cook! Cook!\"\n\nXu Qinglang staggered to his feet, his slender waist swaying gracefully and provocatively. That teetering posture made one want to go and support him directly, to inhale his fragrance.\n\n\"You don't have to force yourself, you know?\"\n\nZhou Ze said this, but still sat down in a chair, ready to eat.\n\nIt wasn't easy for him to get a meal, so he didn't want to look for another place.\n\nXu Qinglang waved his hand and walked into the inner room.\n\nSoon,\n\nThe sound of the stove lighting up came from inside; Xu Qinglang was stir-frying.\n\nZhou Ze took out his phone and saw that Dr. Lin had just sent him a message, saying she would pick him up soon.\n\nZhou Ze replied with an \"Okay.\"\n\nThen he thought it wasn't formal enough.\n\nHe replied with a \"hahaha paopaobing emoji.\"*\n\nImmediately, he felt it was too frivolous.\n\nHe recalled the emoji.\n\nThen he thought recalling it was too obvious.\n\nSo he replied with \"Hehe.\"\n\nImmediately after, he felt \"Hehe\" wasn't friendly enough.\n\nBut then he thought recalling it a second time would seem too pretentious.\n\nSuch a struggle...\n\nZhou Ze was struggling by the dining table.\n\nThe other chef, who was stir-frying, was also struggling.\n\nIn the wok was twice-cooked pork, which, once stir-fried and served over rice, would be a simple yet appetizing bowl of twice-cooked pork over rice.\n\n\"Why didn't she arrest you, but she arrested my parents?\"\n\nXu Qinglang muttered to himself while stir-frying.\n\nAn ancient saying goes, \"Worry not about scarcity, but about uneven distribution.\" This sentence encapsulates too many truths and reveals the darkest side of human nature.\n\n\"This isn't fair, it's really not fair,\" Xu Qinglang continued to murmur.\n\n\"How can you play favorites? How can you play favorites?\"\n\nXu Qinglang's eyes were vacant, but his stir-frying rhythm remained unchanged. He was a good chef; cooking was almost an instinct for him.\n\nSilently, Xu Qinglang took out a yellow jar from the cabinet under the stove and poured some powder into the twice-cooked pork.\n\n\"My parents were taken away, why weren't you? Did you save her life?\"\n\n\"Heh, what a joke.\"\n\n\"You want to eat?\"\n\n\"Alright, I'll give you food.\"\n\nXu Qinglang kept taking deep breaths.\n\n\"Is it ready?\" Zhou Ze urged from outside.\n\n\"Almost.\"\n\nXu Qinglang paused, a hint of panic and hesitation flashing in his eyes, but he still put the lid on the wok. He realized he hadn't microwaved his own rice yet, so he had to re-heat it.\n\nAfter the rice was done, Xu Qinglang placed the twice-cooked pork on top and then carried the plate out.\n\nZhou Ze was still struggling with his phone screen. Seeing Xu Qinglang walk out somewhat disoriented and dejected, putting down the food, he asked with some concern:\n\n\"Looking like that, you didn't forget to put salt in, did you?\"\n\nXu Qinglang shook his head.\n\nZhou Ze picked up his chopsticks, ready to eat.\n\nXu Qinglang's hand trembled, his lips slightly parted, just about to speak when Zhou Ze put down his chopsticks.\n\n\"Where's the plum juice or bitter gourd juice?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Oh, right.\"\n\nXu Qinglang went back, got a cup of plum juice, and returned.\n\nZhou Ze first picked up the plum juice, sniffed it, then took a deep breath, preparing to drink it when his phone vibrated.\n\n\"I'm here, come out.\"\n\nZhou Ze hesitated, then put the plum juice down.\n\nHe knew that after drinking this with his meal, his whole face would probably be sour for a long time, as if everyone around him owed him a huge sum of money.\n\nThinking about it, forget it.\n\nCounting both his past and present lives, this was his first time asking a girl out to see a movie, so he'd better be a bit more serious.\n\nNo choice. Originally, the difficulty of Dr. Lin's 'dungeon' was an 'entry-level novice quest'.\n\nNow that he was in Xu Le's skin, the novice quest instantly became a 'Great Boss-level quest'.\n\nHe didn't know whether to be secretly pleased or miserable.\n\nWhat he needed to strive for now was,\n\nTo defeat himself? Only then could he win the beauty.\n\n\"The money, put it on account. We'll settle it at the end of the month. I'm leaving now.\"\n\nZhou Ze got up, pushed the door open and went out.\n\nDr. Lin's car was parked by the road, the window down, waiting for him.\n\nAnd in the noodle shop, Xu Qinglang's expression alternated between cloudy and clear, then he suddenly spilled the entire plate of twice-cooked pork rice on the floor.\n\nClutching his head, he began to cry on the ground.\n\nHe cried louder and louder,\n\nUntil, finally,\n\nIt turned into dry wailing...\n\n---\n**Footnotes:**\n* \"Rare is it to be confused\" (難得糊塗 - nándé hútú): A famous Chinese idiom by Zheng Banqiao, meaning it's sometimes wise to feign ignorance or to be less discerning in certain situations, for the sake of peace or practicality.

    "content": "Doctor Lin got out of the car, and just then, Zhou Ze walked over. The two were quite in sync; neither spoke, silently heading towards another entrance of the shopping mall.\n\nThis mall was \"dead.\" Aside from Zhou Ze and Xu Qinglang's small shop, only a cinema and a buffet restaurant remained.\n\nOf course, due to the overall situation, the cinema was probably operating at a loss. Few people went there to watch movies on weekdays; buying a ticket would easily get you a private screening.\n\nHowever, during the New Year period, most people were on holiday, and families going to the cinema together became common, adding a rare touch of life to this already ice-cold cinema.\n\nBut to Zhou Ze, this lively atmosphere felt more like a last gasp.\n\nA collapsing building; this was a case of no egg being left unbroken when the nest overturned.\n\nZhou Ze bought tickets and a couple's meal, checked the time, and then walked into the cinema with Doctor Lin.\n\nBecause they arrived a bit late, and Zhou Ze bought tickets for the nearest showing, all the good seats were gone. Zhou Ze and Doctor Lin could only sit in the first row.\n\nThey could have waited, but there was nothing else to do in this mall, and *Detective Chinatown 2* was a 2D movie, so sitting in the first row wouldn't affect the viewing experience much.\n\nDoctor Lin hadn't said much on the way there, and now she sat quietly beside Zhou Ze, gracefully crossing her long legs and looking up at the screen.\n\nZhou Ze offered her popcorn, but Doctor Lin waved her hand, indicating she didn't want any.\n\nZhou Ze sighed. For someone who was a confirmed bachelor in his previous life, how to pursue a girl was truly an unfamiliar subject.\n\nThe movie had good humor, and Zhou Ze occasionally chuckled. Doctor Lin also often smiled, but her laughter was usually soundless, very subtle, and very beautiful.\n\nHowever, for Zhou Ze, the atmosphere of this movie outing was somewhat different from what he had expected.\n\nA bit bland, like food without salt.\n\nThe movie ended, and Zhou Ze and Doctor Lin walked out side by side. It was only seven in the evening, not late, but once they left the cinema area, other parts of the mall were already pitch black.\n\nDoctor Lin remained silent, simply following along.\n\nZhou Ze wanted to say something, but he didn't know what.\n\nIt was he who said he wanted to end things and say goodbye yesterday. If he acted too enthusiastically today, would she think he was crazy?\n\n\"To my bookstore...\"\n\n\"Go to your bookstore to sit for a bit...\"\n\nBoth seemed to be trying to break the awkward silence and had the same idea.\n\nBack at the bookstore, Zhou Ze found that the noodle shop was closed, and the rolling shutter was uncharacteristically pulled down. He didn't know if Xu Qinglang was still inside.\n\nDoctor Lin picked out a magazine and sat on a chair behind the counter. Zhou Ze also took a book and sat beside her, casually flipping through it.\n\nTwo cups of hot tea sat on the counter, steam rising gently.\n\nZhou Ze suddenly felt he had no right to mock Xu Le anymore, because he realized he had made his first date so artistic and so respectfully distant—it was incredibly rare!\n\nSo rare he wanted to slap himself as a reward!\n\n\"Now, you're not closing?\" Doctor Lin asked. In fact, her unspoken meaning was that she wanted to leave; after all, it was evening, and if Zhou Ze closed, she could conveniently say goodbye.\n\n\"Oh, I usually open for business at night,\" Zhou Ze replied, not catching the hidden meaning. He was stating a fact.\n\nDoctor Lin was momentarily speechless, only able to smile and gently smooth a strand of hair behind her ear, then continued reading her book.\n\n\"Creak...\"\n\nThe bookstore door opened, and two men and a woman walked in.\n\nNone of the three were very old, only in their early twenties. The two men had clearly been drinking, and one of them was quite tipsy, his entire face flushed.\n\n\"Boss, do you have water?\" the woman asked.\n\nZhou Ze pointed to the water dispenser on the wall.\n\nThe woman poured a few cups of hot water for her friends, then walked to the counter and asked:\n\n\"How much?\"\n\nAs she spoke, the woman took out her phone, apparently ready to pay by scanning a QR code.\n\n\"Thirty,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\n\"Boss, you can't fleece customers like this even during the New Year. Thirty for three cups of purified water,\" the woman playfully scolded, but still scanned and paid. Then she turned to her two male companions and said, \"Let's rest here and read some books.\"\n\nThey were treating the bookstore as a temporary resting place. Zhou Ze charging 30 yuan felt to them like a minimum charge for entering a teahouse, which they could understand.\n\n\"Read books? What kind of books?\"\n\nThe somewhat drunk man shouted loudly,\n\n\"I want to read ghost stories, horror novels, does this shop have any?\"\n\nThe man laughed to himself as he spoke.\n\nZhou Ze sighed, took two horror novel collections from under the counter, walked to the man, handed them to him, and inadvertently touched him with his finger.\n\nHmm, he was a human, not a ghost.\n\nTonight's date was already a failure.\n\nIf Doctor Lin had to experience another \"Night of a Hundred Ghosts\" like the five migrant workers last time, that would be the absolute worst. Zhou Ze didn't want that.\n\nIf he was human, that was good. He looked cute, even if he was drunk.\n\nZhou Ze didn't touch the other two; it wasn't convenient.\n\nThe drunk man sat down, and his two friends, one man and one woman, also sat on plastic stools. The three of them played on their phones and casually flipped through books.\n\nThey probably felt that the 30 yuan minimum charge should at least seem worth it.\n\n\"What kind of garbage is this ghost story?\"\n\nThe man threw the book, and it landed right next to the water dispenser.\n\nThe woman went to pick up the book and found that some water had spilled out because she had just poured water, and the book's cover and inside pages were wet.\n\n\"Boss, how much?\"\n\n\"Eight percent off the marked price.\" Zhou Ze was amused; these three young people were quite polite.\n\nOf course, Zhou Ze hoped the drunk man would quickly throw all the books on his shelf, and get them all dirty, which would help him clear his inventory.\n\nThe woman reluctantly scanned and paid, then walked over to the drunk man.\n\n\"Let's go, stop acting crazy.\"\n\n\"This isn't a ghost story at all. The person who wrote it must have never seen a ghost,\" the drunk man insisted.\n\nZhou Ze softly \"hmm\"-ed, thinking, *Yes, you probably have seen a ghost, right in front of you.*\n\nDoctor Lin also put down her book at this point and looked at the drunk man. Clearly, she found this matter quite interesting.\n\n\"Oh, Brother Liu, you have ghosts at home?\" the man who came in with the drunk man joked.\n\nThe woman glanced at him, signaling him not to talk nonsense.\n\n\"Get lost! You have ghosts at home!\"\n\nThe drunk man stood up,\n\n\"Damn it, that ghost only picks on me every New Year to torment me. It leaves everyone else alone! My three brothers, plus my sister, plus my parents and my grandparents, none of them are touched, only me!\"\n\n\"A female ghost?\" his companion asked again.\n\n\"If only it were a female ghost! It's a female...dog!\"\n\n\"Pfft!\"\n\nThe drunk man's two companions instinctively burst out laughing.\n\nEven Zhou Ze and Doctor Lin lowered their heads and coughed a few times, but it was truly funny.\n\nEspecially the drunk man's look of complete grievance when he said it wasn't a female ghost but a female...dog.\n\n*My heart aches,*\n\n*I'm drunk and I want to confide!*\n\n\"Every New Year, those few days before and after, it comes for me! As soon as I fall asleep, it comes! Damn it!\"\n\nAlthough the drunk man was acting crazy, he was still in control, not appearing frightening, but rather amusing.\n\n\"It started seven years ago, and every New Year since, it comes on time, more punctually than my parents give me New Year's money!\" The man hugged his head, squatted directly on the ground, and started crying. \"Damn it, I can't live like this anymore!\"\n\n\"What exactly happened? That dog, did you know it?\" his companion asked.\n\n\"It was a dog my family used to keep. It tore up the money my dad kept under the bed, so my brothers and I killed it and ate its meat.\"\n\n\"It must be that dog holding a grudge, coming back for revenge,\" the companion analyzed.\n\n\"I just don't understand why it only comes after me! When we killed the dog, it was me, my brothers, my dad, and my grandpa!\n\nWhen we ate the dog meat, it was the whole family, just an extra dish for New Year!\n\nThat dog ruined five thousand yuan, it deserved to be eaten!\n\nBut why does it only hate me?\"\n\nThe drunk man almost cried, \"I asked, my brothers, including my dad and grandpa, they're all fine! Why does it only target me?\"\n\n\"You're drunk, let's go. I'll take you home.\" The woman helped the man up, motioning for the other companion to help.\n\nThe group walked out of the bookstore,\n\nThe earlier liveliness suddenly became quiet.\n\n\"Tell me, why?\" Doctor Lin looked at Zhou Ze, not caring about truth or falsehood, purely chatting after hearing a story. \"Why did that dog only torment him? Is there something special about him?\"\n\n\"You're very interested in this?\" Zhou Ze asked, somewhat surprised.\n\n\"Hmm,\" Doctor Lin nodded.\n\nZhou Ze smiled. \"Actually, it's very simple. To understand a dog's mind, you first have to put yourself in the dog's shoes.\"\n\n\"How so?\" Doctor Lin pursed her lips in a smile. \"It's hard to put yourself in a dog's shoes.\"\n\nIndeed, how can a human put themselves in a dog's mind?\n\n\"The dog's ghost came back for revenge, to torment him, because it held a grudge,\" Zhou Ze explained. \"This should be the same as with humans.\"\n\n\"Then why didn't it get revenge on the other family members?\"\n\n\"Perhaps it's because of that money. The dog was mischievous and tore up part of it, but another part might have been secretly taken by this guy when he was young.\n\nSo the dog felt it was unfair. It tore up the money, was punished, killed, and eaten—it felt that was fair and deserved.\n\nBut why was it that,\n\nthat person also stole money and made some of it disappear, but nothing happened to him?\n\nSo it was unconvinced; it didn't seek revenge on the other family members, only on him.\"\n\nDoctor Lin shook her head and said somewhat unexpectedly, \"It was just a drunk story told by a drunk man, but after your analysis, it feels like a real event.\"\n\nZhou Ze walked to where the group had been sitting and found a wallet on the floor. He picked it up and walked to the shop entrance.\n\nJust then, the female companion came running back.\n\n\"Excuse me, there's a...\"\n\nZhou Ze handed her the wallet.\n\n\"Thank you!\" The woman bowed to Zhou Ze to express her gratitude. \"If this guy had lost his wallet and ID tonight, his family would have scolded him again.\"\n\n\"No problem,\" Zhou Ze waved his hand.\n\nThe other person also waved back at Zhou Ze, then turned and ran to catch up with her companions.\n\nUnder the moonlight,\n\nAs the woman ran,\n\nbeneath her coat,\n\nthere seemed to be a fluffy yellow tail gently wagging...",

    "content": "Zhou Ze felt he must have been seeing things. Having just heard a drunkard’s ghost story about a dog, coupled with the dim streetlights, it was perfectly normal to have an optical illusion.\n\nYes, that must be it.\n\nZhou Ze wasn’t Zhang Tianshi of Longhu Mountain; he knew he was still a bit of a “goody-two-shoes.” He couldn’t change himself, otherwise, he would have already extended his fingernails to pinch that little loli during the day.\n\nAs for whether he would end up being pinched to death by the little loli or still be pinched to death by the little loli,\n\nThat remained to be seen.\n\nSince he couldn’t change himself, he might as well try to let fewer annoying things affect him. If he saw something, he would avoid it if he could, or cover his eyes if he could.\n\nAnyway, that dog had been tormenting that man for seven years. Counting the years,\n\nIt was time for the seven-year itch;\n\nIf that dog really wanted to harm someone, it would have done so long ago. Zhou Ze didn’t care what it would do next.\n\nThe woman came to his shop, bought water, and paid for the book. She paid very straightforwardly, which was a good karmic connection. That was enough.\n\nHowever, Zhou Ze realized for the first time that there were indeed many incredible things in this world. Perhaps it was because he used to be human and was now a ghost; different circles naturally led to different perspectives on the world.\n\n“What’s wrong?” Doctor Lin also walked to the shop entrance at this moment.\n\nZhou Ze smiled. “I’m very lucky that I’m not like Spider-Man, without some inexplicable elder or relative suddenly popping out to tell me:\n\nWith great power comes great responsibility.”\n\nDoctor Lin didn’t understand what this meant, but she still said, “I should go back.”\n\nIt was late, and she really should go back.\n\n“Won’t you stay a little longer?”\n\n“I might have to be on duty tomorrow,” Doctor Lin said, tying her scarf.\n\n“You can adjust it,” Zhou Ze said.\n\n“It’s not convenient.”\n\n“You don’t want to?”\n\nDoctor Lin frowned slightly. This was the first time she felt an aggressive aura from Zhou Ze, and she was a little flustered.\n\n“You are my wife,” Zhou Ze said, looking into Doctor Lin’s eyes, very seriously.\n\nDoctor Lin subtly retreated half a step. “Yesterday, you said…”\n\nJust yesterday, Zhou Ze had said they should end it, and both would be free.\n\n“Yesterday was yesterday.” Zhou Ze took half a step forward. “Before I sign the divorce agreement, I am your husband, and you are my wife. So, I want you to stay and accompany me now!”\n\nZhou Ze’s voice grew louder and louder.\n\nDoctor Lin didn’t speak, standing still.\n\nA sudden surge of inexplicable anger rose in Zhou Ze’s heart.\n\nHe extended a finger, pinching Doctor Lin’s chin and making a very flippant gesture to lift her head.\n\nDoctor Lin looked at him, her gaze clear and calm, especially her vivid red lips, which were dazzling. She was very beautiful, truly beautiful. It was that kind of exquisite face combined with a highly harmonious temperament, giving a very comfortable feeling.\n\nZhou Ze directly lowered his head and kissed her lips.\n\nHe kissed fiercely and roughly, like a wild beast, fully unleashing its ferocity from within himself! And the woman before him was the object of his desire.\n\nDoctor Lin raised her hand, seemingly preparing to slap the man in front of her, but her hand stopped midway and slowly lowered again.\n\nFrom the corner of her eye, glistening tears flowed.\n\n“Why are you crying?”\n\nLips parted,\n\nZhou Ze looked up at Lin Wanqiu.\n\n“Do you think your tears can make me feel guilty? Do you think your tears can make me stop?\n\nI’m telling you,\n\nYour crying won’t help today. You are my wife, I am your husband!\n\nLook at your parents, what kind of people are they? Look at your sister, how does she usually look at me!\n\nAnd look at you,\n\nYou are noble,\n\nYou are cold and elegant,\n\nYou are a goddess,\n\nYou are ethereal!\n\nIn the bedroom, you even sleep in a separate bed from me!\n\nYou’re married, you’re already a married woman, yet you’re still hypocritically concerned about your chastity. Don’t you even see if you’re worthy anymore!\n\nI know, I’m just a moron. In your whole family’s eyes, I’m a good-for-nothing moron!”\n\nZhou Ze grabbed Doctor Lin by the neck with one hand, pushed her against the counter, and then directly stripped off Doctor Lin’s coat.\n\n“Today I’m going to teach you, to tell you how a wife should act!”\n\n“Xu Le…” Doctor Lin didn’t resist. She just looked at Zhou Ze coldly. “You… scoundrel…”\n\n“Heh heh.” Zhou Ze smiled, unconcerned, then took off his own coat and directly pressed Doctor Lin onto the counter.\n\nHe was rough, he was brutal,\n\nAt this moment,\n\nThe tinder was already laid, needing only a tiny spark to ignite into a raging blaze!\n\nZhou Ze was that kindling!\n\nShe smelled so good, her skin was so tender, her body so voluptuous. Everything, absolutely everything, was so beautiful, so captivating.\n\nBut at this moment, Zhou Ze suddenly stopped, staggering back a few steps.\n\nIn front of him, Doctor Lin lay on the counter, her top disheveled, while Zhou Ze himself was panting heavily.\n\nNo,\n\nHow did it turn out like this?\n\nDoctor Lin was still lying on the counter, still with her eyes open, still not resisting.\n\nShe felt guilty towards Xu Le. She was a very independent and strong woman, but her social environment and the family education she received since childhood always left her conflicted.\n\nHer parents coerced her with threats of death, hoping for grandchildren soon, which forced her to agree to marry Xu Le. Yet, she held onto her own bottom line, harboring feelings for another man, even if that man had died in a car accident half a year ago, even if that man might have long forgotten her, or even never knew that such a woman had been secretly following him for several years after her internship ended.\n\nTo describe it using the critical style common in middle school textbooks: Doctor Lin succumbed to feudal etiquette in life, yet was unwilling to continue living this way, still holding onto her own perseverance and resistance in her heart.\n\nThis was also why, despite being a million times unwilling, Lin Wanqiu still didn’t resist, allowing Zhou Ze to do as he pleased just now;\n\nShe felt she had no reason to resist. Zhou Ze was her husband, and she knew that her actions since marriage had been unfair to her husband and to this marriage.\n\nShe didn’t accept it, didn’t agree to it,\n\nBut she wouldn’t resist.\n\n“Put on your clothes! Put your clothes on properly!”\n\nZhou Ze roared at Lin Wanqiu, who was still lying on the counter.\n\nLin Wanqiu froze for a moment, then stood upright, looking at Zhou Ze in disbelief. Just moments ago, she had already resigned herself.\n\n“I haven’t even gotten to do anything to you yet, don’t look like you’ve just been r-a-p-e-d. Put your clothes on,\n\nNow,\n\nImmediately,\n\nRight away,\n\nThen get out!”\n\nDoctor Lin silently put on her clothes, then adjusted her collar in the mirror. She was expressionless. Once everything was tidied, she poured Zhou Ze a fresh cup of hot water and placed it on the counter, then walked out of the bookstore without even looking at Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze slumped to the ground, feeling somewhat lost and confused.\n\nOn his lips and in his palms, her lingering warmth seemed to remain. He didn’t know why he had stopped, nor why he hadn’t continued.\n\nIt was clearly very comfortable,\n\nClearly very desirable,\n\nClearly very intoxicating,\n\nBut for some reason, he felt something was off. It seemed this wasn’t the feeling he wanted.\n\nHe had just been about to sleep with her,\n\nShe had agreed,\n\nBut that moment just now was completely different from what he had wanted.\n\nZhou Ze stumbled to his feet. He picked up the teacup, took a sip, then spat out the hot water. The water was scalding, with not a drop of cold water added to neutralize it.\n\nHe dropped the cup, letting the water wet the floor, and Zhou Ze looked around, recalling his recent actions, remembering the words he had just spoken.\n\nHis fist clenched then loosened, only to clench again quickly.\n\nHe went to the bathroom, turned on the faucet in the sink, and directly put his head under the running water, splashing himself.\n\nHe needed to calm down, to become peaceful,\n\nNot just to quench the fire in his body, but also the one in his heart.\n\nThe cold water in winter was not something an ordinary person could endure. Zhou Ze lifted his head, feeling a dizzy spell in his mind.\n\nHe looked at the mirror in front of him,\n\nThe mirror reflected his own image.\n\nZhou Ze gripped the edge of the sink tiles tightly, panting continuously. Then, he slowly raised his head, as if talking to himself, and said,\n\n“It’s you!\n\n“It’s you, you damn bastard, you good-for-nothing!\n\nYou’re influencing me, you’re trying to control me,\n\nYou trash, you scum, you bastard!”\n\nZhou Ze cursed at his reflection in the mirror,\n\nYes,\n\nThis wasn’t him. His behavior just now was too abnormal. That sudden, inexplicable rage, that baseless confusion, that inexplicable impulse,\n\nIt was definitely more than just youthful vigor.\n\nJust now, at that moment,\n\nSomeone he thought had long gone to hell, long ceased to exist in this world,\n\nHe had influenced him.\n\nHe hadn’t left,\n\nHe was still hiding by his side,\n\nPerhaps,\n\nHe was hiding inside his own body!\n\nHe was spineless, he was weak. He had endured all contempt in life, dared not resist, and lacked the courage to hold his head high. But after death, he was curled up in a corner, yet thinking of using someone else’s hand to retaliate against his wife in the simplest, most brutal way!\n\nUsing another person’s strength to retaliate against his wife.\n\n“I used to pity you, and felt a little bit sorry for you,” Zhou Ze muttered. “Now I understand, pitiful people must have hateful aspects. That you lived your life the way you did, can only mean you deserved it!”\n\n“*Slap!*”\n\nZhou Ze raised his fist and directly punched the mirror.\n\nThe mirror shattered,\n\nZhou Ze’s hand was also gushing blood, which began to drip into the sink.\n\nOn the fragmented pieces of the mirror,\n\nZhou Ze’s face was still reflected,\n\nNo,\n\nIt was Xu Le’s face.\n\nZhou Ze stood there without moving,\n\nThe person in the mirror also didn’t move,\n\nBut in the next moment,\n\nA sinister glint appeared in the eyes of the person in the mirror, who then opened his mouth and said,\n\n“Oh, you found me.”",

    "content": "\"You... are courting death.\"\n\nBlack light emerged from the depths of Zhou Ze's eyes; at this moment, he was enraged.\n\nYes, he was usurping the nest,\n\nBut,\n\nSo what?\n\nI'm going to continue living in your body; can you stop me?\n\nYour revenge,\n\nIs it just suddenly provoking me to force myself upon your wife?\n\nIs that all you've got?\n\nZhou Ze spread his right hand, black fingernails slowly growing, wreathed in tendrils of black mist.\n\nMany times, the true solution to a problem depends on your position, your standpoint.\n\nFrom Zhou Ze's perspective, there's no right or wrong to distinguish. He wants to live; everything done under this premise is correct. Otherwise, everything loses meaning.\n\nIf it loses meaning, is there any need for right or wrong to exist?\n\n\"No matter where you hide, I will drag you out, even if... you're hidden within this body!\"\n\nZhou Ze's face began to contort. His fingernails started digging into his chest.\n\n\"Hiss...\"\n\nIntense pain, accompanied by an uncontrollable tremor, made Zhou Ze shiver and directly fall to his knees.\n\nHe opened his mouth,\n\nLooking somewhat dazed,\n\nNot there,\n\nHe's not there at all!\n\nWhy?\n\nHe had just verified it at the risk of his soul nearly being torn apart: within this body, there was only his, Zhou Ze's, sole soul. Xu Le was simply not there!\n\nZhou Ze crawled back to his feet, looking at his own face in the broken mirror. This time, he waited a long time, but the person in the mirror showed no change.\n\nXu Le had ceased to exist a long time ago,\n\nSo, everything I did to Doctor Lin earlier was driven by my own nature?\n\nNo,\n\nThat's impossible,\n\nImpossible!\n\nIt can't be like this.\n\nFor the first time, Zhou Ze felt that the person in the mirror was so unfamiliar. It wasn't because he had changed bodies and appearances, but because his own inner self, his soul, seemed to be entirely different from his original self-perception.\n\nBody and soul, which is the real self?\n\nFrom ancient times to the present, many great poets and philosophers, both Chinese and foreign, have offered a similar answer: the physical body changes and decays, but the soul can be eternal.\n\nIt can be noble, it can be remembered, it can shine brilliantly throughout the river of history.\n\nZhou Ze also believed that he was still Zhou Ze, still his original self. Now, it was merely his body that had changed, but he still considered himself Zhou Ze.\n\nNow,\n\nHe began to fear,\n\nBecause if Xu Le's soul no longer existed,\n\nThat meant,\n\nThe one who changed... was himself?\n\n………………\n\n\"Go to sleep, dear.\"\n\n\"Okay, I'll take our daughter to rest first. You should also finish up and rest early.\"\n\n\"Alright, once I've revised this treatment plan.\"\n\nWang Ke gently massaged his neck and yawned. He was indeed very sleepy, but the work at hand had to be finished. At just over thirty, he already had many gray hairs.\n\nMen at this age are most awkward. If they don't strive, it's too early to retire. If they do strive, their bodies are already starting to decline.\n\n\"Ding ding ding... Ding ding ding...\"\n\nWang Ke frowned slightly. So late, and someone is still visiting?\n\nHe walked to the entrance and looked at the black-jacketed man standing outside on the video screen. He asked, \"Excuse me, who are you?\"\n\n\"I'm looking for Wang Ke. A friend introduced me.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, if you have business, you can make an appointment with my assistant. I generally...\"\n\n\"Zhou Ze introduced me,\" the man outside said.\n\nHearing that name, Wang Ke paused, then opened the door.\n\nThe person looked rather young, perhaps only twenty-five.\n\n\"Come in,\" Wang Ke gestured for him to enter and personally poured him a cup of tea, placing it on the coffee table.\n\nZhou Ze sat on the sofa, looking at his former friend.\n\nHe hadn't changed; he was still striving in his field. As children who grew up together in the orphanage, they had been close since childhood, and in the old dean's eyes, these two were among the most successful children to emerge from the orphanage in recent years.\n\nZhou Ze was a hospital deputy director at a young age, and Wang Ke already had his own psychological clinic, not a small, cramped storefront, but one located beside South Main Street, in the heart of Tongcheng.\n\nThis villa, too, was definitely not something an ordinary person could afford.\n\n\"You know Zhou Ze?\" Wang Ke asked first.\n\n\"Yes, he died half a year ago,\" Zhou Ze replied, then picked up the teacup and took a sip. He still liked Maofeng tea; his taste hadn't changed.\n\n\"What can I do for you?\"\n\n\"To see a doctor.\"\n\n\"See a doctor?\" Wang Ke coughed. \"You can make an appointment.\"\n\n\"It's urgent,\" Zhou Ze looked into Wang Ke's eyes, \"Very urgent.\"\n\nWang Ke fell silent, then smiled and nodded, standing up and saying, \"Please come to my study with me.\"\n\nRegardless of the sudden and impolite visit, and the abrupt request, since the other party said he was Zhou Ze's friend, Wang Ke had no reason or way to refuse.\n\nZhou Ze sat properly in Wang Ke's study for a while. Wang Ke entered wearing white clothes, indicating his seriousness.\n\n\"Tell me about your situation,\" Wang Ke twirled the golden-dark fountain pen in his hand, which was quite striking under the study lamp.\n\nZhou Ze slowly shook his head, \"Don't hypnotize me, not even shallow hypnosis.\"\n\nWang Ke nodded and put down the pen.\n\n\"I might have some... multiple personality disorder,\" Zhou Ze carefully chose his words.\n\n\"More specifically,\" Wang Ke asked.\n\n\"I feel that within my body, there exists another person's personality. Specifically, at certain moments, that person's disposition will suddenly influence my actions, and I can clearly perceive that those are definitely not things I would do.\n\nI have always been... a very disciplined person.\"\n\n\"Symptoms of multiple personality disorder?\" Wang Ke narrowed his eyes. \"How long has this been happening?\"\n\n\"Recently, I suppose.\"\n\n\"Alright, on this paper, draw your second personality. Just based on your feelings, draw what he looks like, even if you've never seen his true appearance.\"\n\nWang Ke handed a blank sheet of paper and the fountain pen to Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Second personality?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" Wang Ke nodded.\n\n\"But... strictly speaking, I am the second personality,\" Zhou Ze pointed to himself. \"The one causing trouble now should be the original personality of this body.\"\n\nWang Ke's gaze sharpened, and he began to re-examine Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Are you saying your current state is the second personality?\"\n\n\"According to your theory, yes, it should be,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\nThe original owner of this body was Xu Le, and Zhou Ze was the outsider, so Zhou Ze was the second personality.\n\n\"You've already killed him?\" Wang Ke asked with interest. He seemed... somewhat excited.\n\n\"More or less, and I'm sure he's gone,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\n\"Then this is essentially an act of murder,\" Wang Ke reminded him. \"Although legally, your action cannot be judged or classified, I must sit here and condemn you for it.\"\n\n\"After the condemnation?\"\n\n\"You came to me because you want to find a way to completely get rid of the first personality's influence on you?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nWang Ke started twirling his pen again, not for hypnosis this time, but because he was thinking.\n\n\"I don't know if I should help you, because from my perspective, you killed a 'person' who originally existed, and if I help you, I would be helping you destroy evidence, making me an accomplice.\"\n\n\"Help me,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"I need to consider it,\" Wang Ke pondered.\n\n\"No need to consider, help me,\" Zhou Ze urged, then added, \"Er Dan Ge.\"*\n\nWhen that \"Er Dan Ge\" was uttered, Wang Ke's expression suddenly changed. He said somewhat surprised, \"Zhou Ze even told you that?\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\nWang Ke looked up, somewhat conflicted, but then gritted his teeth and picked up his pen to write a prescription:\n\n\"I'll prescribe some medicine for you. These drugs are actually just auxiliary; they can help stabilize your emotions and aid your sleep.\"\n\n\"Then there's no need for them,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"The most important step is that you need to change your environment,\" Wang Ke ignored Zhou Ze's previous words, finished writing the prescription, and continued, \"Sever ties with the social connections of your first personality's original life and reconstruct your own social connections.\n\nMany people believe that human thought is solely anchored in the soul, although whether souls, or ghosts, truly exist in this world is still unknown.\n\nBut this statement itself is inaccurate. In fact, our bodies, our muscles, our eyes, and many, many other organs can actually store a person's 'soul'. This 'soul' is different from the soul in the broad sense.\n\nIt refers to something akin to 'muscle memory' created by athletes through countless repetitions of training, as well as 'psychological suggestion', and so on. You can understand it as a kind of inertia.\n\nYou are the second personality, having killed the first personality,\n\nBut this body has, after all, been operating under the first personality for too long. It has its own inertia, its own memories. Sometimes, the reason you suddenly make inexplicable choices, leaving yourself shocked and surprised afterward, giving you the illusion that the first personality still exists and is causing trouble,\n\nIs due to this reason.\n\nFirst, sever all your current interpersonal relationships and build your own social circle. Let this body begin to re-adapt to you, cancel out the previous inertia, and the problem will be solved.\n\nActually, your current situation isn't serious. Your logical thinking is very clear. Overcoming it is just a matter of time.\" Wang Ke smiled.\n\nAt this moment, someone knocked on the study door,\n\n\"Dear, do we have guests?\"\n\n\"Yes, please bring two more cups of coffee.\"\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\nZhou Ze thought of Doctor Lin, of his in-laws, and of his sister-in-law,\n\nIndeed,\n\nInitially, he had rejected that person's social connections and even wanted to break them off long ago.\n\nBut he didn't know when,\n\n*She doesn't sleep with me anyway,*\n\nIt had instead become his obsession?\n\n\"How long will it take to sever ties?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Not long at all,\" Wang Ke shrugged, looking very relaxed. \"I've been observing you since you walked in. The feeling you give me, how should I put it...\n\nYou are the second personality, but I think you're the most thorough case I've ever seen of a second personality completely eliminating the first.\n\nIt's like... borrowing a corpse to revive a soul in ancient ghost stories; very clean, very swift, even 'perfect' could describe it.\n\nRight now, you can think of it as a slight side effect from a medicine you took. Your own immune system can completely overcome it, maybe just two or three months.\n\nAfter that, you can pick up your old social connections again, and there won't be any problems.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded, \"Thanks.\"\n\n\"You're welcome.\"\n\n\"Coffee's here.\"\n\nThe study door was pushed open, and a woman entered with two cups of coffee, placing them on the desk.\n\nZhou Ze looked at the woman, and the woman also looked at Zhou Ze.\n\nThe next moment,\n\nZhou Ze's mind suddenly stirred, and the woman's face also abruptly changed.\n\n\"What, you two know each other?\" Wang Ke asked.\n\n\"Yes, he's Doctor Lin's husband, Xu Le,\" the woman replied.\n\n\"Ah?\" Wang Ke stood up in surprise,\n\nHe took the initiative to shake Zhou Ze's hand and express his gratitude.\n\nBefore, the man in front of him was a patient introduced by his deceased childhood friend. Now, he was also his daughter's savior, naturally making their relationship even closer.\n\nZhou Ze perfunctorily responded, his mind actually wondering whether he should remind his childhood friend, who was entirely devoted to his career, that his wife had recently become very engrossed in the indescribable activity of \"getting her hair permed.\"\n\nAfter thinking about it, he decided to remind him anonymously after leaving. Although the two of them, having known each other's personalities since they started working, had both focused entirely on their careers and thus didn't disturb each other,\n\nTheir friendship and childhood memories hadn't changed, but they never had the habit of casually meeting for drinks or tea. In fact, if not for this tricky problem, Zhou Ze wouldn't have sought out Wang Ke.\n\nWang Ke was married, Zhou Ze didn't know that. He had a child, Zhou Ze also didn't know that. But if he needed help and mentioned his name, Wang Ke would certainly agree.\n\nWang Ke and his wife saw Zhou Ze out of the house. Zhou Ze refused Wang Ke's kind offer to drive him back.\n\n\"Dear, what did he come to see you about?\"\n\n\"A consultation,\" Wang Ke replied. \"You said he runs a bookstore?\"\n\n\"Yes, a bookstore like a tea party.\"\n\n\"Alright, I'll go check it out sometime.\"\n\n…………\n\nZhou Ze had just walked out of the villa's perimeter,\n\nWhen he suddenly felt something, stopped, turned around, and looked back at the villa.\n\nOn the villa's balcony,\n\nStood a small loli,\n\nShe was holding her white teddy bear, wearing red pajamas, standing outside in the breeze.\n\nHer hair fluttered, her skirt billowed, yet she remained perfectly still, seemingly oblivious,\n\nOnly her eyes,\n\nWere fixed on him.\n\nZhou Ze's expression was initially solemn, and his body was somewhat tense,\n\nBut slowly, the tension began to fade. The pressure of Xu Le's matter on his mind was relieved by the recent conversation, and Zhou Ze felt very relaxed.\n\nHowever, what made Zhou Ze a bit troubled was,\n\nIt seemed he not only had to warn his old friend about his wife's issue,\n\nHis daughter,\n\nAlso seemed to have a problem.\n\nSilently, Zhou Ze felt a pang of sympathy for his old friend in his heart.\n\nWhat sin did he commit in his past life to have such a \"happy and harmonious\" family?\n\nAt this thought, Zhou Ze's mouth curved into a bitter smile.\n\nThe next moment, facing the gaze of the small loli on the distant balcony,\n\nZhou Ze raised his hand,\n\nAnd waved in that direction:\n\nSaying:\n\n\"Hi.\"\n\nTranslator's Note:\n* \"Er Dan Ge\" (二蛋哥): A casual, affectionate, and somewhat playful way of addressing an older male friend, often used among childhood friends. \"Er Dan\" (二蛋) is a common, slightly rustic nickname, implying a close, unpretentious relationship. \"Ge\" (哥) means older brother.",

    "content": "After leaving the villa district, Zhou Ze wasn't in a hurry to hail a taxi; he decided to walk alone on the night streets.\n\nWang Ke said that his situation wasn't too bad and he only needed to sever Xu Le's old social connections, which, in fact, had already been done.\n\nGiven how he treated Doctor Lin, he figured she wouldn't bother with him for a while. As for his in-laws' home, he hadn't been back in days.\n\nThe only real difficulty might be his bookstore, as the money to open it came from his in-laws.\n\nHe'd just leave things as they were for now; he needed to calm down during this period.\n\nAhead, there was a pedestrian overpass. Zhou Ze walked onto it, sat down on a step, took out his phone, and idly scrolled through it.\n\nCoincidentally, Zhou Ze clicked on that live streaming app. Xu Le had followed many gaming and beauty streamers, but Zhou Ze wasn't particularly interested in those. Scrolling down, Zhou Ze saw that the old Taoist priest streamer he watched last time still hadn't started a broadcast.\n\nHe hadn't broadcast in so long, he probably really stopped.\n\nThe streaming industry might seem easy, making money from home, but the pressure is also immense. Not to mention not broadcasting for a month or two, even a few days could make you a fleeting sensation.\n\nHowever, just then, Zhou Ze discovered an unread message in his account. Opening it, he found it was a private message from the old Taoist priest, sent two days ago.\n\n\"The humble Taoist has arrived in Tongcheng, dear, want to meet up?\"\n\nBelow it was the old Taoist priest's phone number.\n\nZhou Ze frowned slightly. The old Taoist priest's message included many heart emojis. Zhou Ze then checked the information on Xu Le's account.\n\nIt was a female account,\nand the address was indeed Tongcheng.\n\nXu Le must have tried streaming before, as she had her own live streaming room, but the viewership was dismal.\n\nZhou Ze finally understood where this strange feeling came from. The old Taoist priest's message clearly hinted at trying to hook up with fans. He came to Tongcheng for some business, then searched for his fans in Tongcheng, casting a wide net to reel some in.\n\nZhou Ze wasn't interested in the old Taoist priest. He was interested in the young man who appeared in the old Taoist priest's videos, the one who had difficulty eating porridge.\n\nStill, Zhou Ze replied with a message: his own number.\n\nStanding up, he stretched, Zhou Ze was ready to leave. He missed his freezer a bit.\n\nHowever, his phone rang at that moment.\n\nPicking up the phone, the caller ID showed a Rongcheng number.\n\nZhou Ze answered.\n\n\"Hello, benefactor, where are you?!\"\n\nThe old Taoist priest's voice was loud, as if he was shouting into the phone's speaker, and there seemed to be the sound of a train nearby.\n\n\"Where are you?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nWas that old Taoist priest so idle? Didn't he have many fans? Why did he always reply to his messages so quickly?\n\nCould it be that female fans' names were indeed very appealing?\n\n\"Huh...\" The old Taoist priest was startled and silent for a moment. He hadn't expected the fan he planned to meet to be a man!\n\nA \"big-dick cute girl\"!\n\nSadness,\ndisappointment,\ngloom!\n\nBut the old Taoist priest immediately changed his tone, crying out hoarsely:\n\n\"Big brother, I'm hungry! Please, three to five bottles, give me some food!\"\n\n...\n\nTaking a taxi, Zhou Ze found the old Taoist priest in a nooks and crannies under a railway bridge. The old Taoist priest was wearing a dirty Taoist robe, with disheveled hair and some bruises on his face, looking like a true refugee. He had been lying on a plastic sheet below.\n\nNearby on the street, there was a restaurant called \"Longtan Home Cooking.\" Zhou Ze ordered him two bowls of noodles, a plate of Kung Pao Chicken, and a plate of small mixed fish. The old Taoist priest ate with gusto.\n\n\"Brother, you're really something!\" The old Taoist priest finished one bowl of noodles and finally started to slow down. Then he told the owner to warm a pot of yellow wine, and immediately gave Zhou Ze an apologetic smile. He didn't have much money left in his pocket, so Zhou Ze would definitely be paying for this meal.\n\n\"How did you end up like this, old man?\" Zhou Ze had a glass of water in front of him; he hadn't touched any of the dishes on the table.\n\n\"Sigh, don't mention it.\" The old Taoist priest took a sip of noodle soup, smacking his lips. \"I've been out of luck lately. I originally came to Tongcheng with a film crew for location scouting.\"\n\n\"Changed professions?\"\n\n\"Something like that, I don't feel like streaming these days.\" The old Taoist priest sighed, \"People always need to have some dreams, don't they?\"\n\n\"Indeed.\" Zhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"The humble Taoist's dream for the future is to star in a 'Mr. Vampire' movie, whether it's part three, four, five, or six, seven, eight.\" When talking about his dream, the old Taoist priest's whole demeanor seemed to change slightly.\n\n\"How did you end up like this in a film crew?\" Zhou Ze asked, curious.\n\n\"Hehe, I was originally a minor supporting role in the crew, but who knew fate would play such a trick.\"\n\nThe wine arrived.\n\nThe old Taoist priest first poured a glass for Zhou Ze, then filled his own. He took a small sip, squinting his eyes:\n\n\"Tsk tsk tsk, beautiful, beautiful.\"\n\nZhou Ze picked up his plain water and took another sip.\n\n\"The assistant director was a scoundrel, trying to take advantage of a young actress. That girl probably wasn't even eighteen yet. Sigh, the girl cried and refused.\n\nI happened to stumble upon it and went up and beat that assistant director.\"\n\nThe old Taoist priest reached out and patted his chest, saying:\n\n\"Making money is making money, getting famous is getting famous, but no matter what we do, we can't go against our conscience, right?\n\nBrother, don't you agree?\"\n\n\"Mm.\" Zhou Ze responded, \"So you got fired?\"\n\n\"Not yet, he didn't dare bring that up.\" The old Taoist priest grinned, \"Many people knew that I beat him up, so he wouldn't dare deal with me that way, otherwise his own reputation would be completely ruined.\"\n\n\"And then?\"\n\n\"And then, that little actress I rescued that night voluntarily walked into the assistant director's room the next night and didn't come out all night.\"\n\nThe old Taoist priest sighed as he said this, \"They're all pitiable people, all struggling people.\"\n\n\"And then after that?\"\n\n\"And then that little actress accused me of groping her, sexually harassing her. The assistant director didn't show up, and the main director fired me from the crew.\" The old Taoist priest continued to smile, but his smile held some bitterness.\n\n\"Drink,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Come on, let's have a drink!\" The old Taoist priest raised his glass. Seeing that Zhou Ze was holding plain water, he immediately said, \"Are you looking down on me, brother? Let's have a drink. Today, brother is in trouble, and I'm grateful for your care. We'll meet again someday, and when I have money, I'll return the favor.\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head, \"I'm allergic to alcohol.\"\n\n\"Alright then, tea instead of wine!\"\n\nThe two clinked glasses, and the old Taoist priest drained his.\n\nThe grievances, the struggles, the indignation, the inequalities of life,\nall contained within a single cup of wine.\n\n\"You're out of money?\" Zhou Ze asked. This question didn't really need to be asked.\n\n\"Mm.\" The old Taoist priest finished speaking, then looked expectant, hoping Zhou Ze would lend him some money. He had some money left before, but he had given it all away as donations at the beginning of the month, and now he was fired from his job, which suddenly left him strapped for cash.\n\n\"Oh.\" Zhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"...\" The old Taoist priest suddenly felt a sense of familiarity with this person's way of talking.\n\n\"Holy cow,\"\nyou just say \"oh,\"\nand why did you even ask if I had money?\n\nZhou Ze stood up, paid the bill, and prepared to leave. Treating the old Taoist priest to a meal was purely because Zhou Ze was also a bit bored tonight and wanted to talk to someone.\n\nHe could have gone back to Xu Qinglang's, but Xu Qinglang had closed early tonight, and the roller shutter was down, so he couldn't find him.\n\nNow, he was tired and wanted to go back to rest.\n\n\"Brother, you run a bookstore?\" the old Taoist priest asked.\n\n\"Mm.\"\n\n\"Running a bookstore doesn't make much money, does it?\" The old Taoist priest spread his palm, his fingertips pinching back and forth as if calculating.\n\n\"Mm.\"\n\n\"The humble Taoist believes that running a冥店 (mingdian)* is actually more profitable.\" The old Taoist priest saw that Zhou Ze seemed uninterested in his \"calculations.\" Fine, this person in front of him was someone who grew up under the red flag and didn't care for feudal superstitions, so the old Taoist priest put away his thoughts.\n\n\"A mingdian?\" Zhou Ze shook his head. \"Don't want to open one.\"\n\nHe himself was a ghost, why would he open a mingdian?\n\n\"To be honest, I used to run a mingdian in Rongcheng.\" The old Taoist priest pulled out a stack of money from his pocket—it was spirit money. \"Brother, thank you for this meal today. I don't have much to give you, but take this stack of spirit money. Don't be quick to scold me; this money certainly can't be spent, but it carries yin virtue. Just keep it on you. Don't be afraid of bad luck; it can bring you some good fortune.\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't reach for the money.\nWho in their right mind would take a stack of spirit money and keep it on them?\n\n\"Brother, don't disbelieve.\" The old Taoist priest, seeing Zhou Ze's refusal, grew anxious. He immediately pulled open his Taoist robe and pointed to a wound on his right chest, saying, \"It was a stack of spirit money that saved my life back then.\"\n\n\"Alright, alright, I'll take it.\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't want to see a grown man baring his chest in front of him, so he had no choice but to take the spirit money.\n\n\"I remember watching your video, there was another person in your mingdian, that person had difficulty eating porridge,\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Oh, him? He's an employee I hired. So lazy, all he does is sunbathe all day, doesn't do anything. I constantly scold him, saying you can't be so lazy, being so young.\"\n\n\"Oh, does he have anorexia?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Something like that.\" When talking about that person, the old Taoist priest seemed a bit downcast. \"Why, is he very handsome?\"\n\n\"No, I just felt a bit of kinship.\"\n\n\"Kinship my foot.\" The old Taoist priest laughed as if he'd heard a funny joke.\n\nYou feel kinship with a ghost, are you also a ghost?\n\nHahahahahahaha,\nyou're killing me!\n\nThe two walked out of the restaurant together. Zhou Ze offered the old Taoist priest a cigarette. There was a supermarket still open next door, with a small fruit stall outside its entrance.\n\n\"You stand here and don't move, I'll go buy you some tangerines,\" the old Taoist priest said playfully.\n\n\"I'll only eat two, you can have the rest,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\n\"What?\" The old Taoist priest thought Zhou Ze was a bit out of touch and didn't understand his reference. Feeling a bit bored, he thought this bookstore owner must be a bookworm.\n\nZhou Ze didn't bother to explain.\n\nActually, \"You stand here and don't move, I'll go buy you some tangerines\" is from Zhu Ziqing's \"The Retrospect,\" spoken by a father to his son.\nAnd what Zhou Ze said was from \"Rickshaw Boy,\" spoken by a grandfather to his grandson.\n\nFinally, Zhou Ze reached out and patted the old Taoist priest's shoulder. \"I'm leaving. Take care.\"\n\nJust as the old Taoist priest was about to say something,\nhe suddenly clutched his crotch.\n\nThen, a smell of burnt hair wafted out.\n\n\"Oh my god, it's burning me!\"\n\n---\n*冥店 (míngdiàn): A shop that sells items for the deceased to use in the afterlife, usually paper effigies of money, cars, houses, etc., that are burned as offerings during funerals or ancestral worship. Often translated as \"hell bank\" or \"spirit money shop.\" Here, \"mingdian\" is retained for clarity and cultural context.",

    "content": "\"What's wrong with you?\" Zhou Ze frowned; clearly, he, too, had smelled it.\n\n\"Nothing, just gotta pee, you go ahead!\"\n\nThe old Taoist said, then immediately turned and ran outside.\n\nZhou Ze looked at his hand, didn't follow up to ask anything, but simply took a taxi back to the bookstore.\n\nThe old Taoist came to the roadside, reached into his pants, and pulled out a talisman. The talisman had already turned red and disintegrated into ash in the wind, scattering away.\n\nThis was the old Taoist's ancestral talisman. As for why it was hidden in that particular spot, it's best left unsaid to outsiders.\n\nBut the scene from moments ago was seared into the old Taoist's memory.\n\nOf course, looking down at his \"walnuts\"* tightly clenched from the burn,\n\nthey were also seared into his flesh.\n\n\"Damn it, Boss, I never expected to meet someone from your hometown more than two thousand kilometers away in Tongcheng.\"\n\nIn the unseen world,\n\nperhaps there's a kind of connection.\n\nFor example, when Zhou Ze watched the old Taoist's live stream video and saw the young man sitting behind the counter of a冥店** struggling to drink porridge, he felt an inexplicable empathy.\n\nIt wasn't just anorexia;\n\nin fact,\n\nthey were of the same kind.\n\nIn this world, he wasn't absolutely unique or singularly abnormal.\n\nJust as the Faceless Woman roared in Hell, unwilling to accept it:\n\n\"How can you also leave?\"\n\nThis implied that\n\nnot only Zhou Ze, but others had also left in front of the Faceless Woman before.\n\nAdding in the old man with black fingernails whom Zhou Ze rescued after the car accident,\n\nthis world,\n\nwas truly not as peaceful as imagined.\n\n..................\n\nIt was already one in the morning when he took a taxi back to the bookstore. Zhou Ze cleaned up the glass shards on the bathroom floor, then boiled several kettles of water to wipe himself down with a towel.\n\nHe decided to have someone install a shower tomorrow, as for someone with a slight潔癖***, not being able to bathe was absolute torture.\n\nBack on the second floor, he adjusted the temperature and lay down, closing his eyes, ready to bid farewell to the day's fatigue and all its troubles.\n\nHe slept soundly and peacefully.\n\nThe night passed without incident.\n\nWhen Zhou Ze woke up the next morning, he emerged from the freezer, first went to wash up, then opened the store door and glanced next door.\n\nNext door was closed again today.\n\nDoctor Lin couldn't be contacted for now.\n\nHis \"wife\" was gone,\n\nand now even he was gone.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head sharply. Damn it, why would he have such a thought?\n\nXu Le's \"lingering poison\" was harming him,\n\nyes,\n\nit must be so.\n\nHaving not eaten since last night, Zhou Ze had no choice but to order takeout on his phone, adding a note to the vendor to send extra vinegar.\n\nAfter about twenty minutes, a delivery rider in a yellow uniform arrived on an electric scooter. He pushed open the door and walked in, handing the takeout to Zhou Ze, who was sitting behind the counter reading a book.\n\n\"Thank you, it's not easy, delivering food during the New Year,\" Zhou Ze said politely.\n\n\"It's not easy for you either, eating takeout during the New Year,\" the delivery rider retorted directly.\n\n\"..................\" Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze felt like he'd been shot in the knee. He looked up specifically at the delivery rider in front of him. The guy was young, probably just twenty-something.\n\n\"Is this a bookstore?\" The delivery rider looked around the shop. \"The kind where you can sit and read? How much?\"\n\n\"Pay what you think it's worth,\" Zhou Ze opened the takeout bag.\n\n\"Alright then.\"\n\nThe delivery rider sat down on a plastic stool, picked up a copy of \"Battle Through the Heavens,\" and started reading, thoroughly engrossed.\n\nZhou Ze, meanwhile, chugged down the vinegar provided by the vendor. Perhaps because he had been \"trained\" by Xu Qinglang's abnormally sour plum juice recently, Zhou Ze felt nothing from the ordinary vinegar.\n\nImmediately after, he devoured his meal in a frenzy. Halfway through, nausea and a feeling of sickness began to creep in.\n\nZhou Ze clutched his neck, forcing himself not to throw up. Finally, after a terrible struggle, the nausea slowly receded, and Zhou Ze wiped his mouth, then began to cough heavily.\n\n\"Brother, eat slower. My grandma would say you're eating like a hungry ghost reincarnated.\"\n\nThe delivery rider said, still reading his book.\n\nZhou Ze glared at him, then simply sat in his chair, gasping for breath. He needed to recover.\n\nDamn Xu Qinglang,\n\nwhy isn't he open yet!\n\nZhou Ze decided that if the other shop wasn't open by the afternoon, he would have no choice but to break in and look for any leftover plum or bitter gourd juice. Otherwise, he really couldn't eat.\n\nThe delivery rider seemed to have stopped taking orders and sat there reading his novel for an hour.\n\n\"Huh, why do I smell burnt coal?\" The delivery rider suddenly sniffed, then walked out of the bookstore.\n\nZhou Ze didn't pay it any mind. The guy probably just wanted to read a bit and didn't want to pay; it didn't matter.\n\nThis bookstore truly earned money \"as fate would have it.\"\n\nBut then, the delivery rider, who had just stepped outside, immediately opened his mouth and shouted:\n\n\"Wow, it's on fire!\"\n\nZhou Ze was jolted awake and quickly walked out of the shop. He looked up, and his gaze instantly narrowed: on the fourth floor of the building above, thick smoke was billowing out.\n\nThis was...\n\nthe location of the movie theater!\n\nThe former commercial center, which still had some human traffic, was that movie theater. And recently, because it was the New Year's holiday season, many people came here to watch movies.\n\n\"Let's go, save people.\" The delivery rider immediately ran towards it.\n\nZhou Ze stood there for ten seconds, hesitating. The fire was definitely big, but it would absolutely not reach his bookstore. He was trying to suppress his deep-seated instinct to save people.\n\nIn the past, he couldn't remember how many times he had rushed to the front lines of disaster sites to participate in rescues, but recently, he decided to break this bad habit.\n\nHowever, after intense internal struggle, Zhou Ze still ran along.\n\nHe was,\n\nstill a masochist!\n\nOn the stairs from the first to the third floor, many people were running down, while Zhou Ze was running up.\n\nAlthough this commercial center was \"abandoned,\" it was located in the city, so fire trucks should arrive quickly.\n\nFewer people watched movies in the morning than in the afternoon, but the number was still considerable. When Zhou Ze ran up the stairs to the fourth floor, he saw even more dense smoke inside, and the flames were burning eerily. Even if it was an accidental fire, it couldn't burn this exaggeratedly!\n\nBut this was not the time to analyze the cause. Through the thick smoke, Zhou Ze saw the delivery rider, whose face was blackened with soot, carrying an old woman out on his back.\n\nThe rider looked at Zhou Ze, smiled, revealing a mouthful of white teeth, then turned his head and ran back into the viewing area to continue rescuing people.\n\nThe fire hadn't spread completely, but in the viewing area, the flames were extremely intense.\n\nZhou Ze no longer hesitated. Since he had already come, he had to do something. He immediately ran into the thick smoke.\n\n\"Cough, cough... cough, cough...\"\n\nGoing in hastily without any protective measures was a very foolish act. It was easy to fail to save anyone and end up dying inside oneself.\n\nSo Zhou Ze knew his time was limited. If he saw anyone who needed help, he would just get them out. He couldn't do much else; he could only wait for professional firefighters to handle it.\n\n\"Phew...\"\n\nZhou Ze had just opened the door to Cinema 2 when flames suddenly shot out. Zhou Ze could only retreat to avoid the brunt of it.\n\nAnd inside, there were still cries.\n\nZhou Ze gritted his teeth and rushed in. Inside the cinema, flames were everywhere—on the floor, the ceiling, the walls—all on fire. And because of the confined space, the smoke generated from the burning was trapped inside.\n\nIn general, in fire accidents, more people die from smoke inhalation than from being burned.\n\nIt was only at times like this that everyone realized how important those annoying fire safety announcement videos before every movie were.\n\nAs soon as Zhou Ze rushed in, he saw two people lying in the narrow aisle.\n\nOne was an adult man in a black suit, lying on the floor, coughing, clearly unable to get up.\n\nThe other was a boy, about ten years old, collapsed on the ground unconscious, either passed out or already dead from suffocation.\n\n\"Save me... save me... sa...\" The man in the suit barely managed to lift his head, looking at Zhou Ze standing in front of him.\n\nZhou Ze jumped over him, picked up the little boy on his back, and prepared to rush out first.\n\nHe was already feeling dizzy. Clearly, without a gas mask or other professional equipment, he couldn't last much longer either.\n\nHowever, just as he was carrying the boy and about to run out, Zhou Ze felt someone grab his foot, and he fell to the ground, the boy on his back also tumbling off.\n\n\"Save... save... first... save me... I'll... give you... money... first... save me...\"\n\nThe man in the suit used his last bit of strength to tightly grasp Zhou Ze's ankle. He knew he couldn't last much longer. He couldn't breathe at all; his lungs felt like they were on fire.\n\nZhou Ze, who had fallen, felt his head spin, almost blacking out. Instantly, he bit his tongue, forcing himself to stay conscious.\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nZhou Ze used his other foot to kick the hand and head of the man who was grabbing him.\n\nAfter several kicks, the man finally let go.\n\nZhou Ze shakily got back on his feet, hoisted the boy onto his back, and rushed out of Cinema 2.\n\nAfter rushing out of the thick smoke and into a safe area, Zhou Ze's knees buckled, and he collapsed to the ground. The boy on his back also fell, but because of Zhou Ze's subconscious cushioning, he didn't fall badly.\n\nFirefighters had already arrived and were busy extinguishing the fire, and some firefighters, wearing equipment, were rushing into the blaze.\n\n\"There are still people in Cinema 2.\"\n\nZhou Ze grabbed the uniform of a firefighter running past him and said.\n\n\"Okay, I understand,\" the firefighter nodded and rushed into the fire.\n\n\"Hoo hoo... hoo hoo...\"\n\nZhou Ze lay sprawled on the tiled floor, panting heavily. Opposite him, the delivery rider, whose yellow uniform was now blackened with soot, was also leaning against the wall, gasping for breath. The two exchanged glances and smiled weakly at each other.\n\nParamedics had also arrived, a group of \"white angels\" and doctors. Zhou Ze was too exhausted to check if Doctor Lin was also part of this rescue operation.\n\nGritting his teeth, he got back up. Zhou Ze looked at the boy being given emergency treatment by the doctors; the boy's chest was still rising and falling, so he should be fine.\n\nAt the same time, Zhou Ze saw several other people later carried out by firefighters: some couldn't be saved, while others were. The man in the black suit lay motionless on a stretcher; he must have been dead.\n\nZhou Ze felt no guilt. There was no reason for him to feel guilty.\n\nHe was doing good, saving people, but who to save first was up to him. No one had the right to morally bind him.\n\nMoreover, at that moment, he simply couldn't carry a child and an adult man out simultaneously. If he had tried, the end result would have been his own death inside.\n\nHe was a \"scholar\" who had been reincarnated into Xu Le's body, a man without the power to truss a chicken, not Arnold Schwarzenegger.\n\nBesides, that guy almost caused him to die in the cinema too.\n\nStruggling to get up, he refused the nurse's offer to check his condition. Zhou Ze walked towards the bathroom at the other end of the building, turned on the tap, and vigorously splashed cold water on his face.\n\nFinally,\n\nhe caught his breath.\n\nHe looked up,\n\nZhou Ze stared at himself in the mirror,\n\nand suddenly noticed,\n\nin the mirror, behind him, a faint figure slowly appeared.\n\nThis person,\n\nwearing a black suit,\n\nwas staring at him with a look of intense resentment.\n\nHis mouth was open, yelling incessantly, as if questioning him about something, hysterical, frantically agitated.\n\nAfter death, if one encounters a specific catalyst, there's a certain probability of turning into a vengeful ghost.\n\nAnd right now, this man had just died, his soul still in the process of becoming a ghost; it would likely fully form around the \"first seven\" days.\n\nHe wasn't a ghost yet, just a nascent form.\n\nBut because of Zhou Ze's unique nature, he could perceive the other's presence in advance.\n\nHe hated Zhou Ze,\n\nfor not saving him,\n\nand this hatred,\n\nwas strong enough to make him become a vengeful ghost!\n\n\"Heh, interesting.\"\n\nZhou Ze smiled,\n\nand put his head back into the sink, continuing to rinse himself with water.\n\nAt the same time, he sighed inwardly:\n\n\"Heh, humans, huh...\"\n\n---\n* 尿急 (niào jí) \"Urinary urgency\" - In this context, the old Taoist claims to have \"pee urgency,\" but later it's revealed he was checking a talisman. The \"walnuts\" (核桃 - hétáo) are a euphemism for testicles, which were scalded by the \"hot\" talisman.\n** 冥店 (míng diàn) - Literally \"underworld store,\" a shop that sells funerary items, paper offerings for the dead, etc.\n*** 潔癖 (jiépǐ) - Obsessive cleanliness, mild germophobia.",

    "content": "According to *Jianghai Evening News* (Tongcheng’s local newspaper), seven people died and over thirty were injured to varying degrees in the recent movie theater fire.\n\nA week has passed, and the movie theater has been shut down. Reopening it anytime soon is impossible, and it's even likely the theater will be abandoned altogether. It was already operating at a loss, so there's no reason to invest heavily in reopening it.\n\nThis effectively spells the complete demise of the commercial center.\n\nZhou Ze hasn't contacted Dr. Lin lately; both have maintained an unspoken understanding of non-interference, living their own lives. However, his in-laws called a few times, demanding to know why he wasn’t home and accusing him of being too bold.\n\nZhou Ze eventually blocked their numbers.\n\nThe current headache is that the money for this bookstore came from his in-laws. He’s beholden to them, and he still hasn’t figured out how to earn some money to open his own store and achieve true independence.\n\nOne could only say that Xu Le left him with a very poor foundation.\n\nSeveral media outlets had contacted him, hoping to interview Zhou Ze about his act of heroism and promote positive energy in the new era, but Zhou Ze refused them all.\n\nHe wasn't interested in fame. As the saying goes, \"a tall tree catches the wind,\" and with his identity and role, truly becoming a celebrity would bring more uncontrollable dangers.\n\nBusiness has been mediocre this week, with daily sales under a hundred, not even covering rent and utilities. Zhou Ze didn't pay much attention to these figures.\n\nWhat he did care about was that Xu Qinglang next door hadn't opened his shop for a week.\n\nZhou Ze hired an unscrupulous locksmith to pick the lock and went inside. He didn't find any sour plum juice or similar items. The kitchen in the back room was meticulously clean and tidy.\n\nIt was quite helpless,\nA man with over twenty apartments who is also very handsome,\nIf he suddenly one day decides to renounce the world and chase after the winds,\nYou'd truly have a hard time finding him.\n\nAnd so, Zhou Ze had a rather miserable week.\n\nChili oil,\nAged vinegar,\nDark soy sauce,\nHigh-concentration orange juice, etc., he tried them all. While they allowed him to eat some food, they left him utterly miserable, far less effective than Xu Qinglang's family's ancestral sour plum juice.\n\nAs night fell, Zhou Ze squatted alone outside the bookstore, a cigarette in his mouth, occasionally glancing next door, feeling a sense of desolation about life.\n\nBy the roadside in front of the shop, four or five pagoda incense sticks were burning. They were lit by people from the mall. According to custom, today was the day to welcome the God of Wealth. Even though they knew the God of Wealth could hardly save the mall, they still had to go through the motions.\n\nWhat if a miracle happened?\n\nOccasionally, Zhou Ze would also look behind him or at the glass in front of him.\n\nThe black-suited man's malevolent ghost was continuously perfecting itself. Tonight was his *touqi* (first seven days after death), so he should be almost complete.\n\nA malevolent ghost taking physical form is an exceedingly rare probability. Furthermore, ordinary malevolent ghosts at most make you trip and fall or bite your tongue while eating. A malevolent ghost that can make you mildly ill and need an IV for two days is already considered formidable.\n\nThings like malevolent ghosts running rampant and killing people everywhere, as seen in movies, are impossible in reality; otherwise, the Yang Realm would have descended into chaos long ago.\n\nEven Zhou Ze, who had already undergone *jieshi huanhun* (borrowing a corpse to return a soul), was so low-key.\nHow dare those mere scraps without physical bodies come out to show off?\n\nThis week, when he had nothing to do, Zhou Ze would read books, daydream, trim his nails, and incidentally check if the malevolent ghost behind him had become clearer.\n\nIt was quite like... a nurturing experience, feeling the weight of paternal love.\nDaddy loves you,\nDaddy waits for you to grow up.\n\nZhou Ze could clearly perceive the emotions of the one behind him. His greatest hatred wasn't directed at the cause of the fire, but at Zhou Ze himself. He was resentful, angry, anticipating, waiting.\n\nPerhaps,\nIn his view, tonight, his *touqi*, was the time for his revenge.\n\nInteresting.\nZhou Ze flicked his cigarette ash. Once he fully formed, Zhou Ze would show him how red the flowers were.\n\nZhou Ze didn't feel he did anything wrong by saving people, nor did he feel the man in the suit was wrong to hate him.\n\nPreviously, Zhou Ze had encountered a similar situation: someone was drowning, and another person went down to rescue them. The drowning person clung tightly to the rescuer, and they both drowned.\n\nGenerally, when rescuing someone in water, you should approach them from behind and embrace them for the rescue. If you approach from the front, the drowning person can easily grab you tightly as their last straw.\n\nOf course, understanding is one thing,\nBut understanding will not be Zhou Ze's reason for allowing the man in the suit to run wild in his bookstore tonight at midnight.\n\nDuring the day, Zhou Ze ordered takeout and chatted with the new delivery driver, learning that the previous driver who saved people had recently become famous. Not only did he attend various award ceremonies, but he was also praised and rewarded internally by his company, now nicknamed \"the most handsome delivery guy.\" He's still delivering food, but he does it while live-streaming, and his popularity is incredibly high.\n\nWhile drinking aged vinegar and eating his meal, Zhou Ze casually scrolled through Weibo and found the delivery driver on the hot search list.\n\nA week has passed since the incident. From the initial handling and summing up to the current development and promotion of positive energy, it's currently at its peak in terms of topic popularity and buzz. The incident's influence has spread not only in Tongcheng but across the entire country.\n\nAt 11 PM, Zhou Ze watched the man in the suit slowly solidify further while watching a movie. The movie was called *Cop Toxin*, a few years old work by the recently famous director Dante Lam, starring Daniel Wu and Nick Cheung.\n\nThe bookstore door was pushed open, and a delivery driver in a uniform walked in, holding a selfie stick.\n\n\"This is a bookstore I frequent. After I finish my busy delivery shifts every day, I come here to read. It's not for any scholarly pursuits, but simply because I enjoy reading.\"\n\nWith that, the delivery driver took down a copy of Wen Tiejun's *Eight Crises* from the bookshelf.\n\nThis book discusses China's economic crises throughout its modern history. The delivery driver opened the book, sat on a plastic stool, and read with great relish.\n\nZhou Ze remembered that last time he came, he read two volumes of *Battle Through the Heavens*.\n\n\"Alright, that's it for the live stream today. I want to quietly read for a bit. Everyone, please get some rest too. Thank you all for your company today.\" The delivery driver bowed to his phone screen.\n\nThe phone screen was flooded with card purchases, planes, and rockets, indicating truly terrifying popularity.\n\nTurning off his phone, the delivery driver closed *Eight Crises*, stretched, looked at Zhou Ze, and said:\n\n\"Boss, let's go get some late-night supper. My treat.\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head, pointing to the computer screen in front of him.\n\n\"What are you watching?\" The delivery driver came closer, looked at the screen, and smiled, \"I've seen this movie, *Cop Toxin*, right?\"\n\n\"Mhm.\" Zhou Ze nodded, simultaneously checking the time in the bottom right corner of the screen. It was almost midnight.\n\nThe \"baby\" behind him was already quite impatient.\n\n\"No reporters interviewed you?\" the delivery driver asked.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head.\n\n\"You really should have accepted interviews. It would have been much better for your bookstore's business.\"\n\n\"I like quiet,\" Zhou Ze said, feigning a cool demeanor, though not entirely truthfully.\n\nMoney is important, but life is more important.\n\n\"We can watch this movie later,\" the delivery driver seemed to feel a kinship with Zhou Ze, being a companion who had rushed into the fire to save people.\n\nThere was a certain...\nMutual appreciation.\n\n\"Do you know?\" Zhou Ze began, \"Cop Toxin is based on a real case. The real-life protagonist's name was apparently Tsui Po-ko.\"\n\n\"Hey, I really didn't know that.\" The delivery driver smiled somewhat shyly, \"It's just watching a movie, who pays attention to that?\"\n\n\"Mhm, you're right.\" Zhou Ze closed the computer, stretched, \"It's so late, what do you want to eat?\"\n\n\"Whatever.\"\n\n\"Then I'll order takeout.\"\n\n\"No, let's go out to eat. My treat. What good stuff is there in takeout? Let me tell you, some restaurant kitchens are simply unwatchable, and some businesses don't even have a physical store, they just rent a dilapidated house and do it themselves. Tsk tsk, anyway, I wouldn't dare eat it.\"\n\n\"I see.\" Zhou Ze nodded, \"By the way, do you know what happened with Tsui Po-ko?\"\n\n\"You tell me, then I'll know, won't I?\"\n\n\"He killed his colleagues, took the money, and then went about his life freely, even appearing on TV shows. He liked to show off, to be famous.\" Zhou Ze rubbed the tip of his nose, \"A very complex person, he really enjoyed being on camera.\"\n\nThe delivery driver was silent for a moment, not continuing the topic. Instead, he said, \"Boss, are you going to get late-night supper or not?\"\n\n\"I don't really want to. Look at how many pagoda incense sticks are in front of my shop. They've been smoking me out all day; I've lost all appetite.\"\n\nPagoda incense sticks are large incense candles, taller than an average person, stacked in layers like a pagoda, very thick, and they burn for a long time.\n\n\"Heh heh, there's absolutely no smell in your shop at all,\" the delivery driver said, pointing to the central air conditioning above Zhou Ze's bookstore. \"This here, that must be an air purifier, right?\"\n\n\"Mhm, installed with the air conditioning. And I always spray some air freshener in the bookstore; after all, you need to create a reading atmosphere, right? We don't offer coffee or pastries, so we can only offer a pleasant scent.\"\n\n\"So, Boss, you're still not giving me face,\" the delivery driver said, feigning anger, \"We did go through life and death together, you know.\"\n\nZhou Ze raised his hand and asked curiously, \"So, I've always been curious about something.\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"That day, I didn't smell anything at all. In my shop, it's very difficult, almost impossible, to smell other scents from outside. That day, how did you smell the fire?\"\n\nThe delivery driver paused, his expression a bit unnatural, but he didn't make a big deal of it. He said, \"My nose has been good since I was little. My grandma used to say I had a dog's nose. When I was a kid, I was great at finding hidden snacks at home.\"\n\n\"Do you know what day today is?\" Zhou Ze asked again.\n\n\"What day?\"\n\n\"*Touqi*.\"\n\n\"*Touqi*?\"\n\n\"Yes, the *touqi* of those seven people who died in the fire!\"",

    "content": "The delivery driver stood still, looking at Zhou Ze who was seated behind the counter.\n\n\"Don't be afraid, there are no cameras in the shop, and I don't have a voice recorder either,\" Zhou Ze stretched, \"Of course, you won't believe me when I say that. Tsk, whatever.\"\n\n\"I don't know what you mean by that,\" the delivery driver was calm.\n\nAnyone who could do such a thing must be very calm.\n\nThe police haven't precisely identified the arsonist yet, which speaks to his skill—though here, it's a derogatory term.\n\n\"I am absolutely certain that you set that fire,\" Zhou Ze spread his hands. He was merely stating a fact, a fact that needed no rebuttal.\n\n\"You're drunk,\" the delivery driver said.\n\n\"Not drunk.\"\n\nZhou Ze smiled.\n\n\"Based on that, you're saying I set the fire? You're better than the police?\" The delivery driver's composure was beginning to fray, but he still restrained himself.\n\n\"Hiss... Of course I'm not better than the police, but I'm not blind. As for me saying I determined you were the arsonist based on that, I'm sorry, it wasn't.\n\nI just confirmed you were the arsonist first, then reverse-engineered a piece of evidence, just to get a taste of being Conan.\"\n\nZhou Ze pointed behind the delivery driver.\n\nThe delivery driver immediately turned his head, thinking there were police standing there, but there was no one, nor any siren sounds.\n\nIn this mall, which was practically deserted, and late at night, there wasn't even a single passerby.\n\n\"They all came in with you,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Who?\" The delivery driver frowned.\n\n\"The six people who died in the cinema. They followed you in, and then I just went 'oh,' you're the killer. It's obvious.\n\nUnless that idiotic clown standing behind me is singularly focused on hating me,\n\nYou can't possibly say the other six victims all mistook their killer, can you?\"\n\nZhou Ze slowly stood up, looking at the delivery driver in front of him.\n\n\"Playing tricks!\" The delivery driver almost roared. For some reason, he felt the pressure increasing, and cold sweat began to bead on his face.\n\n\"Don't be nervous, they can't harm you.\"\n\nZhou Ze walked out from behind the counter, holding a plastic bag.\n\nInside the plastic bag were small boxes of rice and some pickles.\n\nIn Zhou Ze's vision, six people, both men and women, including two elderly individuals, were sitting on plastic stools.\n\nThey were all quietly reading, very still, not making any noise.\n\nIn front of each person, Zhou Ze placed a bowl of rice, topped with pickles, with disposable chopsticks standing upright in the rice.\n\nThen, Zhou Ze took out a bottle of baijiu costing less than 10 yuan, poured it into plastic cups from the water dispenser, and placed a cup in front of each person.\n\n\"Brothers, it's not easy for me either. This bookstore has been losing money, so I can only treat you with these. Don't mind me being cheap, alright? You guys are dead, but I still have to live.\n\nAnyway, your families will also make offerings to you, so it's not like you're missing out on a little from me, right?\"\n\nZhou Ze bent down, speaking as if he were greeting regular customers.\n\nHe wasn't so kind as to leave a portion for the brain-damaged idiot behind him.\n\n\"You're out of your damn mind!\" The delivery driver couldn't hold back. \"Ha, I should really record this and upload it online, let the netizens see what you're like!\"\n\n\"Do you dare?\" Zhou Ze turned sideways. \"You talk as if you really dare. How many days have you been livestreaming? Even 55 has fallen.\"\n\nIndeed, there were many reasons why the police hadn't found the arsonist yet, but if the police had a key suspect to investigate, the arsonist would find it very difficult to remain hidden.\n\n\"I'm leaving, you're crazy.\"\n\nThe delivery driver's earlier amiable demeanor vanished. He managed to successfully convert his popularity into livestreaming income, also earning a huge revenue, not just because he was a \"hero,\" but also due to his marketing strategy.\n\nHe was down-to-earth, and his original persona was well-established. On this foundation, livestreaming food delivery, which could have been boring, became captivating to watch.\n\nHe knew he was panicked, he was flustered, so he wanted to leave, to escape this bookstore.\n\nHe regretted coming here today, deeply regretted it.\n\nZhou Ze didn't stop him. However, as the delivery driver reached out to push open the bookstore door,\n\nZhou Ze took out his phone and checked the time, saying,\n\n\"It's midnight.\"\n\n\"Dong!\"\n\nThere was no clock in the bookstore, but at that moment, the delivery driver seemed to hear a bell tolling.\n\nHe pushed the door hard, but it didn't budge. He became angry, looked at the lock, it wasn't locked, and there was nothing blocking it, but the door just wouldn't open.\n\nThe delivery driver began to frantically kick the door, but it still didn't move an inch.\n\nWhat he couldn't see was,\n\nThe six people who were sitting there reading,\n\nAll slowly stood up.\n\nOn the seventh day after death, the soul returns home.\n\nEvery injustice has its perpetrator, every debt its master.\n\nThey came here, following their enemy.\n\nAnd now,\n\nThey all stared fixedly at their enemy,\n\nA person who had set fire and killed them, yet became a hero.\n\n\"I told you not to save me!\"\n\nA low growl came from behind Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze happened to blow on his fingernails at this moment, then sharply turned around. The nails on his right hand instantly lengthened, their translucent black radiating an unusual glow, wisps of black aura swirling around his fingertips, bringing an unnerving presence.\n\nAt the same time, black mist churned in Zhou Ze's eyes.\n\n\"Hsssss... AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!\"\n\nThe black-suited man, who had just managed to transform into a malevolent spirit, was directly grabbed by the shoulder by Zhou Ze's hand. He then began to tremble. The black aura from Zhou Ze's fingertips was like sharp little knives constantly piercing his body, and wisps of green smoke rose upwards from the top of the black-suited man's head.\n\n\"I understand you, but you disgust me.\"\n\nZhou Ze said in a deep voice,\n\n\"So, goodbye.\"\n\nZhou Ze applied more force with his fingers.\n\nThe black-suited man wailed and showed a pleading expression. He hoped Zhou Ze would spare him. He had already become a vengeful spirit; once he \"died\" again, his soul would be scattered, with no chance of even entering hell.\n\nBut Zhou Ze didn't let go,\n\nHis gaze remained icy.\n\nOnly when the black-suited man's body had completely melted and evaporated did he retract his hand, subtly seeing some ashes in his palm.\n\n\"Whew...\"\n\nZhou Ze blew on his palm, then clapped his hands.\n\nTurning around, Zhou Ze sighed.\n\nHe wondered if it was because of his presence that the bookstore's layout had changed,\n\nOr,\n\nPerhaps it was just a coincidence.\n\nThe six customers who had entered earlier and quietly read books were now emanating black mist, showing signs of transforming into malevolent spirits seeking revenge.\n\nMeanwhile, the delivery driver continued to frantically punch and kick the wall.\n\nLooking up, \"Heaven spares no one\" might just describe the scene before him.\n\nThese six victims, too, were once panicked and disoriented amidst thick smoke and raging fire, unable to escape, tragically dying within.\n\n\"Everyone, please give me some face. Don't be in such a hurry to become malevolent spirits.\"\n\nZhou Ze walked into the group, raising his hand in a gesture towards the six people.\n\n\"Come on, relax, give big brother a smile?\"\n\nZhou Ze wanted to lighten the mood. Once they became malevolent spirits, they wouldn't enter reincarnation. After seeking revenge and completely losing their obsession, they could only dissipate into the wind.\n\nThis was the most tragic outcome.\n\nZhou Ze felt that it wasn't worth it, truly not worth it.\n\nThe arsonist had already caused their deaths, separating them from their loved ones. Their children lost a father or mother, their parents lost a child.\n\nThere was no need to push themselves into an even more terrifying abyss because of this killer.\n\nHowever, Zhou Ze's words had no effect.\n\nThe six people's faces remained icy, and the black mist around them grew thicker. Black patterns began to appear around their eyes and lips.\n\nThey were quickly starting to resemble the idiotic black-suited man just before he charged at him.\n\n\"Since you won't smile for big brother, how about big brother smiles for you?\"\n\nZhou Ze forced a very ugly smile.\n\nIt was over,\n\nWhat a mess,\n\nBeyond saving.\n\nZhou Ze knew it would be easy for him to disperse these malevolent spirits, just like the idiot who had been following him for a week, who, just when his cooldown was over and he was about to unleash a big move, was slapped to death by him.\n\nBut making himself exorcise these ghosts, he truly didn't know how to do it. Moreover, Zhou Ze himself was a ghost, so it wasn't convenient for him to do this, like asking Zhang Fei to embroider.\n\n\"There is a path in the netherworld, and the Underworld River can be crossed!\"\n\nA sharp cry came from outside, followed by the bookstore door being pushed open. Xu Qinglang entered, holding a small porcelain bowl with rice grains and three lit incense sticks.\n\n\"Rise!\"\n\nThe three incense sticks burned rapidly.\n\nAt the same time, the rice grains in the bowl turned from crystal white to black, and the black mist on the six people began to thin. Finally, their expressions shifted from cold and stern to peaceful and serene.\n\nThe six people slowly sat down, each in front of their bowl and chopsticks.\n\n\"Xu Qinglang!\" Zhou Ze shouted, pointing at Xu Qinglang.\n\nSo excited,\n\nTruly excited,\n\nMore excited than seeing Dr. Lin stepping out of a bath.\n\nJust thinking about how difficult it had been for him to eat this past week,\n\nHow could he not be excited!\n\nAs for Xu Qinglang's recent display, Zhou Ze wasn't surprised. In fact, everyone had simply seen through it but chosen not to say anything before.\n\nXu Qinglang gave Zhou Ze a sidelong glance, an instant transformation of charm, like azaleas blooming on the mountain.\n\nBut at the same time, he said exasperatedly,\n\n\"Are you having a New Year's Eve midnight party in here?\"\n\n\"I didn't want to,\" Zhou Ze briefly explained the situation to Xu Qinglang.\n\nXu Qinglang nodded, indicating he understood, and bowed to the six people, saying,\n\n\"Everyone, on the seventh day after death, it's best to return and see your loved ones. They should be waiting for you at home. I will give you an explanation for what happened here.\"\n\nUpon hearing this, the six people silently passed through the glass and left.\n\nZhou Ze's gaze then fell upon the bowl containing the \"black rice.\"\n\n\"Why doesn't this stuff affect me?\"\n\nXu Qinglang's mouth twitched. He forcefully suppressed the urge to flare up and fight Zhou Ze for three hundred rounds,\n\nAnd snorted,\n\n\"You're different.\"\n\nHe was still angry, still held a grudge against Zhou Ze, and was still unbalanced, but because of his appearance, demeanor, and voice, that phrase \"You're different\" carried a strong sense of a maiden's resentment.\n\nNext,\n\nXu Qinglang looked at the delivery driver, who was curled up in a corner, having fainted from fear. \"How should we deal with him?\"\n\nSaying this, Xu Qinglang made a gesture of cutting something in half.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head,\n\nAnd said,\n\n\"Let's hand him over to the state.\"",

    "content": "周澤最後報了警，警察很快來了，按照周澤的說法，是說這位外賣小哥來到自己店裡後忽然發了瘋，說有很多被他燒死的人亡魂來找他復仇，然後不停地對著牆壁狂踹狂砸最後暈厥了過去。\n\n\n\n  從警局做完筆錄出來時，天都已經亮了，影院縱火案，一波三折，但現在至少打開了局面，之前警方很可能只是因為燈下黑的緣故，沒有懷疑到見義勇為的外賣小哥身上，現在哪怕還沒有確切的證據，但只要真的將目光落在對方身上進行查找，應該很快就能發現真相。\n\n\n\n  至於之後輿論的轉向，網上吃瓜群眾的顛覆以及那些曾給這位外賣小哥刷禮物的目瞪口呆，就不是周澤需要擔心和思考的問題了，他能做的，也就只有這麼多，願意做的，也就只有這麼多。\n\n\n\n  鬼的事兒，還是交給鬼來解決，人的事兒，還是交給警察來解決為好。\n\n\n\n  站在警局門口，呼吸著清晨新鮮的空氣，頭腦頓覺清醒。\n\n\n\n  打車回到店裡時，周澤看見隔壁許清朗的店已經重新開門營業了，許清朗本人換了一身平常點的衣服坐在店鋪門口一邊擇菜一邊曬著太陽，嘴裡還哼著「童子戲」（地方曲種）小調，悠哉悠哉，自有一股子風流韻味流淌出來。\n\n\n\n  一切，\n\n\n\n  仿佛依舊。\n\n\n\n  周澤走到店裡，許清朗拍了拍手，問道：「吃啥？」 \n\n\n\n  「隨便吧，我要酸梅汁。」\n\n\n\n  許清朗點點頭。\n\n\n\n  周澤在店裡坐了下來，手指輕輕地敲擊著桌面。\n\n\n\n  不一會兒，許清朗端上來一碗雞蛋面，麵湯清澈，麵條筋道，當然，這些都不重要，最重要的是，熟悉的酸梅汁，又出現在了周澤面前。\n\n\n\n  「給我做一桶吧，多少錢？」周澤指了指店裡的飲水機水桶，「先做一桶。」\n\n\n\n  「等過陣子吧。」許清朗在周澤面前坐下來，嘴裡叼著一根煙，他似乎很想做出一副小痞子抽菸吊啊吊的姿態，但偏偏給人一種「女人抽菸也能這般美麗」的違和感。\n\n\n\n  他不娘，也不gay，只能怪老天給錯了皮囊。\n\n\n\n  就著酸梅汁吃完了面，破天荒地，這次吃碗麵後周澤的噁心感不再那麼強烈了，但依舊多喝了好幾杯水緩了緩。\n\n\n\n  「記得林黛玉初進賈府吃飯後遇到什麼事兒麼？」許清朗吐出一口煙圈問道。\n\n\n\n  周澤想了想，明白了過來。\n\n\n\n  林黛玉初入賈府，第一頓家宴，飯畢後，下人送上茶湯，林黛玉在家裡被父親教導過飯後不宜飲茶容易消化不良，但見賈母和諸多姐妹都喝了，她也只能跟著一起喝。\n\n\n\n  「我能吃飽了就行。」周澤搖搖頭，以他現在這個情況，很可能這輩子是做不成一個老饕或者美食家了，至於消化問題，再說吧。 \n\n\n\n  「我心裡有些不平衡。」許清朗開門見山地說道，「我父母，走了。」\n\n\n\n  許清朗父母早就走了，但周澤清楚許清朗這次說「走了」是什麼意思，應該是下去了。\n\n\n\n  「怎麼忽然就走了？」周澤問道，本想回應一個「節哀」，想想，不合適。\n\n\n\n  「被發現了。」\n\n\n\n  周澤拿煙的手微微一抖，\n\n\n\n  被發現了？\n\n\n\n  周澤記得那個老者在臨死前，也曾喊過「他們發現我了！」\n\n\n\n  許清朗看著周澤，「我很不甘心，也很不平衡，為什麼她帶走了我父母，卻不帶走你。」\n\n\n\n  「他？她？」周澤腦海中浮現出了那個小蘿莉的形象，再結合許清朗那日的狀態和晚上的離開，就猜出了七七八八。\n\n\n\n  「她，不可能吧。」\n\n\n\n  「陰司有序，亡者上路！」許清朗壓低了聲音，盯著周澤的眼睛，「長舌化路引，深喉許幽冥，熟悉麼？」\n\n\n\n  「黑白無常？」\n\n\n\n  「那只是一個統稱。」許清朗嘆了口氣，「但他們確實是執法者，遊歷陽間，肅清秩序，將人和鬼，區分開來。人有人間道，鬼有奈何橋。」\n\n\n\n  「哦。」\n\n\n\n  周澤還是有些不太相信，如果小蘿莉真的是白無常那種的身份，那她之前在校車上顯露出真身吐出長舌頭導致車禍和那位司機的死亡該怎麼算？ \n\n\n\n  「她沒帶走我，反而帶走你父母，所以，你恨我？」周澤伸手指了指自己。\n\n\n\n  「對。」許清朗點頭道。\n\n\n\n  「那這面里沒下毒吧？」\n\n\n\n  「…………」許清朗。\n\n\n\n  「沒下毒吧？」周澤又問道。\n\n\n\n  「沒。」許清朗回答。\n\n\n\n  「那就好。」周澤並不知道，在那天的回鍋肉蓋澆飯里，飯菜里是下了毒的，若不是那天林醫生來得早了一些，可能自己真得吃下那頓飯。\n\n\n\n  「你是真傻還是假傻？」許清朗有些沒好氣地看著周澤，「她為什麼不抓你？」\n\n\n\n  「對啊，她為什麼不抓我？」周澤也問道。\n\n\n\n  「我問你呢！」許清朗提高了聲音。\n\n\n\n  「我也不知道。」周澤攤攤手，「可能，是因為我救了她一次吧。」\n\n\n\n  「…………」許清朗。\n\n\n\n  兩個人的談話，最後以菸頭燒滅了作為終止符。\n\n\n\n  雙方這次算是開門見山了，打破了原本的那種默不作聲地默契。\n\n\n\n  周澤走回自己的店裡，收拾地上的塑料板凳時，卻發現有六張塑料板凳下面都貼著厚度不均的冥鈔。\n\n\n\n  這是看書錢還是吃飯錢？ \n\n\n\n  周澤記得前陣子那個開直播的老道也曾給自己一沓冥鈔，說是能積攢陰德，那麼，他的那些冥鈔就是以這種方式弄來的麼？\n\n\n\n  他是怎麼弄過來的？\n\n\n\n  周澤將冥鈔都收集起來，整整一沓，手感不錯，沒有平日裡見到的那些冥鈔的粗糙，摸在手裡，有絲綢的觸感。\n\n\n\n  這讓周澤想到了老道所說的冥店，和鬼做生意，最好的店鋪當然是冥店，因為那裡賣的東西，也都是給死人的。\n\n\n\n  也因此，如果自己手中現在拿的冥鈔是死人的「鈔票」，那麼開冥店，肯定能比自己賺得更多。\n\n\n\n  腦海中，再次浮現出視頻畫面里坐在櫃檯後面艱難喝粥的男子，\n\n\n\n  周澤忽然覺得，\n\n\n\n  自己好像發現了一件可能會很有趣的事情。\n\n\n\n  當然，再有趣的事兒，現在也沒精力去管了，昨晚一宿沒睡，現在既然回來了，就得好好地補一個覺。\n\n\n\n  周澤將書店捲簾門給拉了下來，上了鎖，不知道為什麼，他的書店正在變得晚上開門的時間比白天多，或許，自己以後有機會可以再訂做一個牌子，\n\n\n\n  叫\n\n\n\n  「深夜書屋。」\n\n\n\n  反正白天也沒什麼生意，書店也一直在虧損著，自己可以隨意地玩一些噱頭，搞一些事情，最爛最壞的結果也不就是現在這個樣子唄。 \n\n\n\n  外賣小哥的事兒是罪大惡極的錯誤，但也給周澤一些啟發。\n\n\n\n  衛生間的洗澡設備已經被裝了起來，周澤買的是電熱水器，脫去衣服，周澤洗了一個澡，換上了一套干整的衣服上了樓。\n\n\n\n  當周澤彎下腰準備調置冰櫃溫度時，整個人卻愣在了那裡，\n\n\n\n  因為在他面前的冰櫃裡，\n\n\n\n  躺著一個人。\n\n\n\n  對方閉著眼，像是陷入了沉睡，呼吸平穩，雙手交叉放在胸前，有著一種小大人似地安逸。\n\n\n\n  很平靜，也很可愛，\n\n\n\n  前提是，\n\n\n\n  她的舌頭如果不會變得那麼長的話。\n\n\n\n  小蘿莉，\n\n\n\n  把自己的巢穴給鵲巢鳩占了。\n\n\n\n  周澤很想大喊一聲，讓隔壁的許清朗同學過來復仇。\n\n\n\n  但想想還是算了，不是他覺得把許清朗喊來復仇是害了他，而是他認為許清朗也沒那個膽子過來復仇，說不定人家來了他還會親切地問候一聲：\n\n\n\n  「您醒了啊？\n\n\n\n  您想吃點什麼？\n\n\n\n  我給您去做。」\n\n\n\n  小蘿莉睜開了眼，她的眸子很深邃，不再是以往見面的清澈和單純。 \n\n\n\n  對方伸出手，周澤幫忙把冰櫃蓋子打開。\n\n\n\n  小蘿莉從裡面坐起來，周澤注意到了，她其實沒有設置溫度，只是選擇了一個通風換氣。\n\n\n\n  「你躺在這裡，不冷麼？」坐在冰櫃裡的小蘿莉開口問道，沒等周澤回答，小蘿莉又開口道：「哦，我忘了，你不一樣。」\n\n\n\n  說完，坐在冰櫃裡的小蘿莉伸手輕輕拍了拍自己身邊的空位置，一臉天真無邪地看向周澤：\n\n\n\n  「一起睡不？」\n\n\n\n  周澤伸手想要揉一揉這個女孩兒的頭，但手在旁邊，卻停了下來。\n\n\n\n  她是黑白無常一類的存在，是陰司在人間的執法者。\n\n\n\n  小蘿莉伸手，她的小手抓住了周澤的大手，把周澤的手按在她的頭上，然後按著周澤的手在自己頭上來回揉了揉。\n\n\n\n  「…………」周澤。\n\n\n\n  「你，很好。」小蘿莉終於從冰櫃裡站起來，但似乎因為腿短的原因，爬出來有些困難。\n\n\n\n  周澤將她從冰櫃裡抱出來，\n\n\n\n  也不知道她之前是怎麼躺進去的。\n\n\n\n  「你，很好。」小蘿莉伸手指著周澤，「重複道。」\n\n\n\n  「額……謝謝。」周澤不知道該如何回復了。 \n\n\n\n  「我要走了。」小蘿莉轉過身，背對著周澤，雙手交叉負於身後，周澤知道她是想表現出一種高山仰止的氣質。\n\n\n\n  但她的問題和許清朗一樣，\n\n\n\n  老天給錯了皮囊。\n\n\n\n  她這個樣子，怎麼都覺得好可愛。\n\n\n\n  憋住，\n\n\n\n  不准笑。\n\n\n\n  周澤在不停地提醒自己，\n\n\n\n  這是黑白無常老爺，\n\n\n\n  不准笑！\n\n\n\n  哈哈哈哈哈！\n\n\n\n  但還是忍不住啊！\n\n\n\n  作死了哈哈哈！\n\n\n\n  完蛋了哈哈哈！\n\n\n\n  憋得越狠笑起來就越誇張，連眼淚都滴出來了。\n\n\n\n  小蘿莉沒理會周澤的笑聲，也沒治周澤一個大不敬之罪，\n\n\n\n  只是問道：\n\n\n\n  「你想，接替我麼？」",

    "content": "\"Do you want to take my place?\"\n\nThis question caught Zhou Ze off guard.\n\nWhat did that mean?\n\nWas he going from an unregistered resident, hiding from city to city, to a local civil servant all of a sudden?\n\nThe surprise came too suddenly.\n\nZhou Ze was hesitant to accept.\n\nPies might fall from the sky, but most people who encountered such things ended up being killed by the pie itself.\n\nMost importantly, Zhou Ze didn't believe that saving her life was worth her treating him like this.\n\nOne should know that the matter with the driver still hadn't been cleared up. This little loli was very cute, but that was just her skin.\n\nXu Qinglang had said that she once appeared in his shop, expressionlessly stuck out her tongue, and took away the souls of his parents.\n\nNo matter how Xu Qinglang cried and pleaded, she remained unmoved.\n\nOne couldn't expect such a person to repay kindness. It would be a blessing if she didn't bite you back.\n\nAs a ghost messenger from the Underworld,\n\nHow many joys and sorrows had she witnessed?\n\nHow much human evil had she seen?\n\nHow much ghost malevolence had she encountered?\n\nShe wasn't a simple little girl, nor could she be.\n\n\"What's wrong, speechless?\" The little loli asked again.\n\n\"I don't know what to say. Are you just asking casually?\" Zhou Ze asked cautiously.\n\n\"You can answer that you don't want to,\" the little loli said.\n\nThen, silence.\n\nThe little loli continued, \"And then, I'll drag you down.\"\n\n\"............\" Zhou Ze.\n\nAlright.\n\nWouldn't that be more comfortable?\n\nWhy bother with multiple-choice questions?\n\nJust fill in the blank.\n\nThe question was: if you don't write \"Y,\" you'll be shot.\n\n\"I agree,\" Zhou Ze replied. This time, he didn't hesitate or struggle.\n\nThe little loli turned around, smiled, somewhat innocently, and then slowly walked to Zhou Ze. She pretended to be a grown-up and tried to straighten Zhou Ze's collar.\n\nThis seemed to be a way for a superior to show regard for a subordinate, much like ancient emperors granting their officials the opportunity to dine with them.\n\nHowever, the little loli was too short. When she stood in front of Zhou Ze, she couldn't reach his collar, so she could only help him adjust his belt.\n\n\"Pick me up,\" the little loli pouted and commanded.\n\nZhou Ze bent down and picked up the little loli.\n\nThe little loli reached out to help Zhou Ze straighten his collar, then frowned, seemingly feeling that being held by Zhou Ze like a daughter was somewhat inappropriate.\n\n\"Do I look silly like this?\"\n\n\"Very cute.\"\n\nThe little loli extended her small hand, intending to slap Zhou Ze's cheek directly.\n\nAt that instant, Zhou Ze's nails, as he held the little loli, rapidly lengthened and darkened, and a black vortex swirled in the depths of his eyes.\n\nThe little loli stopped, a meaningful smile appearing at the corner of her mouth.\n\nZhou Ze didn't make any further moves either.\n\n\"Do you know that showing anger and resistance in front of me is a very silly act?\" the little loli asked.\n\n\"Doesn't matter, I'm already someone who's died once anyway.\"\n\n\"That's because you were lucky. You only walked a short distance on the Yellow Springs Road before leaving. You never experienced the pain and torment of a trip to hell!\" The little loli said loudly. \"That kind of torment makes all who commit suicide and go to hell regret it immensely! It's better to live a bad life than to die a good one—that's no empty comfort.\"\n\n\"Is that so?\"\n\n\"Put me down.\"\n\nZhou Ze put the little loli down.\n\nThe little loli leaned back slightly, looking at Zhou Ze. \"Do you know why I chose you?\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head.\n\n\"Because you're very smart, or rather, you're very calm and know your limits,\" the little loli said, counting on her fingers. \"The Underworld has order, and the mortal world has laws. Many people sneak out for various reasons, but you're the calmest one I've ever seen.\"\n\n\"I don't believe that's the real reason,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"I don't want to tell you the real reason,\" the little loli stretched. \"I'm tired and want to go down, so I happened to meet you, and you won't cause too much trouble, so I chose you.\n\nHeh heh, a while ago in Rongcheng, there was a guy who made a lot of noise. He was clearly a pathetic stowaway, yet he styled himself a judge. As a ghost, he dared to exercise his judgment in the mortal world. Don't you think he was stupid?\"\n\n\"Stupid,\" Zhou Ze replied. Then, Zhou Ze suddenly remembered that the old Daoist seemed to be from Rongcheng. \"What happened to him afterward?\"\n\n\"He was banned.\"\n\nThe little loli tilted her head, a look of innocent playfulness on her face. \"Rules are flexible, but those who cross the line too much have no hope at all.\"\n\n\"He died?\" Zhou Ze asked. \"I mean, was he dragged back to hell or his soul scattered?\"\n\nUpon hearing this, a hint of anger appeared on the little loli's face, as if her sensitive spot had been touched.\n\n\"That, you don't need to know.\"\n\nThe little loli grasped Zhou Ze's palm, her small hand meeting his.\n\nImmediately afterward, Zhou Ze felt a burning sensation in his palm. When the little loli removed her hand, Zhou Ze saw a black rune appear in the center of his palm.\n\nThe rune wasn't complex; it looked like an eye.\n\n\"The Underworld has order, and the Yellow Springs can be crossed,\" the little loli said very seriously. \"Those who should go down, you send them down. Those who should be scattered, you can scatter directly.\n\nOf course, if you want to shout when you see injustice on the road,\nThat's fine,\nBut you bear the cost of that yourself.\nIf you mess up, you bear the consequences.\"\n\nThe little loli yawned, as if she were tired.\n\n\"You said you're tired, so how long will you rest? Am I, like, a substitute?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"We'll talk when I get back,\" the little loli prepared to go downstairs.\n\nZhou Ze continued to ask, \"So what do I do? Patrol every night,\nLook for ghosts,\nAnd then,\nMess with ghosts?\"\n\n\"The door is in your hands, you decide. You can continue running your bookstore. You're a ghost, a ghost possessing a corpse. Those dirty things and miscellaneous creatures will naturally gather around you.\n\nTo them, you're a candle in the dark, and they are moths.\n\nMoreover, after I left that mark on you, it's like upgrading you from a candle to an incandescent lightbulb, enough to blind their dog eyes.\"\n\n\"............\" Zhou Ze.\n\nThe little loli went downstairs, and Zhou Ze followed.\n\n\"I'll read a bit, then I'll leave. This body's mother will come to pick her up soon.\"\n\nThe little loli sat down on a plastic chair and casually picked up an illustrated book to read.\n\nZhou Ze stood beside her, not serving her, but needing to ask some questions.\n\n\"Speak,\" the little loli said.\n\n\"Is there... a salary?\" Zhou Ze asked. \"You know, what I do here is a losing business.\"\n\n\"The economy is sluggish; living people's money is getting harder and harder to earn now,\" the little loli sighed.\n\n\"Yeah,\" Zhou Ze echoed.\n\n\"Then earn money from the dead.\"\n\n\"Money from the dead can't be spent,\" Zhou Ze shrugged.\n\n\"That's because you're doing it wrong,\" the little loli spread her hands. \"Get some ghost money, the kind that dead people give.\"\n\nZhou Ze took out a stack of ghost money and split half of it into the little loli's hand.\n\n\"You've earned quite a bit, haven't you?\" The little loli glanced at him and smiled.\n\nZhou Ze didn't mention that half of it was given to him by the old Daoist from Rongcheng last time. In a mystical way, Zhou Ze felt that if this little loli knew about it, it would bring him trouble.\n\nThe little loli, holding the money, pushed open the bookstore door and squatted on the roadside.\n\n\"Lighter.\"\n\nZhou Ze handed her the lighter.\n\nThe little loli burned the ghost money, and the ashes were quickly blown away.\n\nThen, the little loli stood up and clapped her hands. \"Done.\"\n\nZhou Ze stood in the wind, feeling a bit disheveled.\n\n\"Is this money prepaid into my underground bank account?\"\n\n\"Let's wait and see. This place of yours still doesn't have enough popularity.\" The little loli and Zhou Ze, one big and one small, stood at the storefront waiting, for about half an hour.\n\nThe little loli's delicate face was somewhat red from the wind, while Zhou Ze wasn't afraid of the cold, but standing there like a simpleton, looking around, felt very strange.\n\nFinally,\n\nA pot-bellied man walked past them, and then, a wallet dropped from the man. The man didn't even notice and continued walking forward.\n\nZhou Ze went up to pick up the wallet and found that it actually contained several thousand yuan, along with an ID card, bank cards, and other items.\n\n\"Should I return it to him?\" Zhou Ze asked tentatively.\n\nThe little loli burst out laughing,\n\n\"This person did something bad, so this time it's a financial loss to avoid disaster. This money is what you deserve.\"\n\nThe little loli pushed open the door and entered the bookstore, then rubbed her hands. Clearly, the past half hour had been quite cold, and the bookstore was warm.\n\nZhou Ze walked in with the wallet, somewhat disbelieving. \"He won't call the police?\"\n\n\"Take this money; it's not hot at all,\" the little loli said, a bit impatient.\n\n\"Alright, so from now on, if I'm short on money, I'll just stand at the door burning ghost money, and someone will just deliver money to me, right?\"\n\nZhou Ze was a bit exasperated but also found it amusing.\n\nXu Qinglang came over at that moment, carrying a large bottle of plum juice.\n\n\"Hey, we only had this much material in the shop, so I could only make this much. The rest, wait...\"\n\nAs soon as Xu Qinglang pushed open the door and entered, he saw the little loli sitting there, stumbled, and the bottle in his hand fell to the ground, shattering into pieces.\n\nPlum juice splashed all over the bookstore floor.\n\nZhou Ze looked at Xu Qinglang, signaling him to control himself.\n\nThe little loli seemed to completely disregard Xu Qinglang,\n\nIndeed, a person with good luck and a bit of occult knowledge wasn't worth her second glance.\n\n\"Whose daughter is this? So cute, hahahaha, come on, little friend, Uncle has a tank of little goldfish at home, do you want to come with Uncle to see them?\"\n\nXu Qinglang's smile was very awkward, forced out.\n\nThe little loli simply spat out one word: \"Scram.\"\n\nXu Qinglang smiled again, turned around, and returned to his own shop.\n\n\"Do you think I'm too much?\" The little loli looked up at Zhou Ze.\n\n\"A little,\" Zhou Ze said honestly.\n\n\"Then let me tell you again, the driver's death was just because I was bored while sitting on the school bus and revealed my true form to play a prank.\n\nWould you think,\nEven more excessive?\"\n\nThe little loli tilted her head, looking at Zhou Ze, with a blank, innocent expression.",

    "content": "\"Is that excessive?\"\n\nZhou Ze had no way to answer that question. Whether what the little loli said was true or false, he had no right to question it deeply.\n\nIt was helpless, but it was the truth.\n\nAlthough he heard the little loli from Rongcheng say that her \"kind\" from Rongcheng had tried to be the judge of this mortal world in the guise of a ghost,\n\nZhou Ze admired and respected him greatly, but his end was also lamentable.\n\nWhen you don't have the capital and the strength to stand on the same line as the other party, you don't even have the right to an equal conversation, so where does the right to question come from?\n\n\"Boring.\" The little loli shook her head, but then smiled, \"But that's precisely what I admire about you.\"\n\nThe little loli continued to hold her book in both hands, as if she were about to fall asleep, and murmured:\n\n\"You are the most self-aware person I've ever met.\"\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze.\n\nWas that a compliment or an insult?\n\n\"I'm leaving.\" The little loli was getting more and more sleepy, exhausted.\n\n\"I have one more question. Is there no other way to solve or improve the eating and sleeping problems?\" This was the question Zhou Ze most wanted to ask and most urgently wanted to resolve.\n\nSince his return through 'borrowed corpse, returned soul', apart from these two issues, he could perfectly integrate into social life at all other times.\n\n\"Assembled computers are not as stable as original ones.\" The little loli shook her head weakly. \"As for sleeping, unless you have a Yin creature that crawled out of Hell beside you to provide you with a Hell-like environmental magnetic field, you simply can't rest.\n\nYou are originally a person from Hell, staying in the human world means you're unacclimated, and it's the most severe kind of unacclimation. Because you have some special qualities, you can still solve it with special methods. Others simply can't sleep; after half a year of no sleep, they are almost driven mad, driven to death!\n\nSo, you are already considered lucky.\"\n\nThe little loli gave two more weak \"hehe\" sounds. \"If I don't go back, you could actually hug me to sleep.\"\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze.\n\n\"As for eating, I still can't get used to human food.\"\n\nAfter saying all this,\n\nThe little loli's head tilted to the side, and she directly fell into a deep sleep. Zhou Ze reached out to support her. Seeing that the little loli was still breathing and her body was normal, he immediately breathed a sigh of relief.\n\nZhou Ze used to be a doctor, so he could naturally tell that the girl was fine.\n\nThis little one was Wang Ke's daughter, so he couldn't just watch her have an accident.\n\nHowever, what disappointed Zhou Ze a little was that the little loli's departure was a bit too ordinary.\n\n\"Shouldn't it be a 'biu' sound as she disappears into the ground? Just falling asleep means she's gone back?\" Zhou Ze muttered to himself.\n\nIt wasn't grand, and there was nothing to see, like drawing a talisman on his palm;\n\nThere was no sense of ceremony, no flair.\n\nThe little loli in his arms suddenly opened her eyes and said, \"Alright.\"\n\nZhou Ze was stunned. She was faking sleep!\n\nThe next moment,\n\nA mass of dense Yin energy, so thick it seemed to condense into droplets, surged from the little loli. Even with the central air conditioning on in Zhou Ze's bookstore, the temperature instantly dropped;\n\nThe door was closed, but gusts of cold wind swept through inside, along with the rustling sound of turning pages.\n\nA vast shadow covered the area, like the awakening of a ferocious beast, bringing a pressure that only ghosts could perceive.\n\nZhou Ze's fingernails grew back under this stimulation, and a feeling of surging blood rushed through his body, as if his own power was responding to the other party.\n\nThen,\n\nIt really was,\n\nA \"biu\" sound,\n\nAll the Yin energy instantly surged into a point underground,\n\nIn an instant,\n\nThe clouds dispersed, the fog vanished,\n\nThe temperature rose,\n\nThe sun shone,\n\nIn a daze, it truly seemed to echo the line:\n\nIt's as if all the birds have flown back to the forest after eating their fill, leaving only a vast, clean expanse!\n\n...\n\nIn the evening, Xu Qinglang brought dinner. The sour plum juice was gone, replaced by bitter gourd juice.\n\n\"The sour plum juice is gone,\n\nlet's just make do with bitter gourd juice for now.\"\n\nXu Qinglang said with a bit of embarrassment. During the day, he had been scared out of his wits when he saw the little loli.\n\nActually, he knew himself that he was quite cowardly and useless.\n\nWhen his parents were taken away by the little loli, he didn't dare to seek revenge on her, nor did he dare to resist. He could only kneel there and beg like a weakling.\n\nMoreover, he had even taken his anger out on Zhou Ze for this, attempting to poison Zhou Ze's food.\n\nNow, Xu Qinglang had come to terms with it. Cowardly is cowardly, he was just a minor Xuan master with Yin-Yang eyes due to his physical constitution. To make him face the Hell Reapers, he truly didn't have the courage.\n\nIn fact, the little loli could have punished him for privately keeping his parents' souls, by deducting his lifespan or even directly taking his soul back to Hell.\n\nShe had treated him like a fart and let him go,\n\nSo there was no need for him to jump around anymore.\n\nThe dead cannot be brought back to life, and his previous actions had indeed violated the laws of heaven.\n\nZhou Ze finished his meal and placed a thousand yuan in front of Xu Qinglang.\n\n\"Money for previous meals, plus future ones. Let me know when it runs out.\"\n\n\"Oh, got money now?\" Xu Qinglang finally showed a hint of a smile, then pushed the money back to Zhou Ze, saying softly, \"Life is tough, don't be extravagant. You need to be mindful of your family.\"\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze.\n\n\"I'm a man with over twenty apartments; I don't care about your small change.\"\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze really wanted to say that he would soon have money too, as long as he earned more 'dead people's money,' then burned paper money at the entrance, some idiot would come to his shop and throw their wallet, like a scattering money child.\n\nBut Zhou Ze thought about it again,\n\nEven if he burned a carload of ghost money, he wouldn't be able to burn enough for twenty-something apartments, would he?\n\nUnless an armored truck had an accident in front of his shop...\n\n\"I'm thinking of changing storefronts, what about you?\" Xu Qinglang suddenly asked.\n\n\"Change to where?\"\n\n\"Anywhere is better than here,\" Xu Qinglang smiled. \"I'm planning to move the noodle shop to the county town below. It's a smaller scale, but at least the foot traffic is higher.\"\n\n\"I'll think about it.\" Zhou Ze replied dismissively.\n\n\"Alright, I'm off.\"\n\nXu Qinglang collected the dishes and left the冥店.\n\nZhou Ze, meanwhile, was trimming his nails while looking at the symbol on his palm. It was evening, and no customers had come yet. Zhou Ze was a little anxious. Before, he hadn't seen hope and just drifted along, but now that he saw a glimmer of earning money, his motivation naturally surged.\n\nWhat, still no customers?\n\nDidn't they say I was a white-hot lamp,\n\nable to blind their ghostly eyes?\n\nCome on,\n\nWere they all blinded and got lost?\n\n\"Squeak...\"\n\nThe bookstore door was pushed open, and two women walked in.\n\nOne was very young, about the same age as Zhou Ze (Xu Le), and the other was probably close to fifty, appearing to be mother and daughter.\n\nZhou Ze recognized the younger woman.\n\nShe was his first customer since he opened for business. He remembered she had a Corgi with her then, sat for a while reading a book, and even left him a hundred yuan, which was his first income.\n\nThis time, however, the woman wasn't with her Corgi, but with her mother.\n\n\"Oh, sit here, be careful, see if there's anything dirty on top,\" the older woman said to the girl.\n\nThe girl bent down, took out a tissue, wiped the plastic stool, and then sat down dejectedly.\n\n\"Grab a book and read, daughter. There's no problem that can't be solved in life, and no obstacle that can't be overcome. Just look on the bright side,\" the older woman advised from the side.\n\n\"Sigh.\" The girl sighed, her face still dejected, clearly not listening.\n\n\"Daughter, grab a book and read, read a book and you'll forget about time.\" The older woman squatted beside the girl, continuing to persuade her, a picture of a loving mother.\n\nZhou Ze was still trimming his nails, paying them no mind.\n\nAt this moment, the girl looked at Zhou Ze and said:\n\n\"Boss.\"\n\nThe girl called out softly, looking pitiful, as if she had just gone through a breakup and was at her most vulnerable.\n\nOf course, to an experienced person, this was the easiest time to \"insert\" themselves.\n\n\"You're the boss, right?\" The older woman looked at Zhou Ze, like a mother hen protecting her chick.\n\n\"What's wrong?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"What do you want?\" The older woman said warily, \"Daughter, don't mind him.\"\n\nThe girl was silent for a moment, but finally spoke:\n\n\"Beibei is lost.\"\n\nBeibei was probably the name of the Corgi.\n\n\"Lost?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Yes, lost.\" The girl's eyes were red, as if she was thinking of her beloved dog, and tears welled up again. \"When I was cleaning the house, it secretly ran out, and I didn't notice.\"\n\n\"If it's lost, it's lost. Just buy another one, why cry?\" the older woman advised.\n\nZhou Ze stood up and walked over.\n\n\"What are you doing?\" The older woman pointed at Zhou Ze.\n\n\"You'll find it.\" Zhou Ze ignored the older woman and comforted the girl.\n\n\"Mm.\"\n\nThe girl cried, then reached out and hugged Zhou Ze's shoulder.\n\n\"You rascal, she lost her dog, not her man, what are you getting involved for!\" The older woman made as if to rush over and hit Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Is this your place to speak?\"\n\nA trace of black light appeared in Zhou Ze's eyes,\n\nThe older woman immediately let out a scream and curled up on the ground, not daring to utter another word.\n\n\"What's wrong?\" The girl looked up blankly; she didn't know who Zhou Ze had just been speaking to.\n\nZhou Ze let go of the girl. When a person's emotions are at their lowest, their three spiritual lamps are at their weakest, making it easy for something dirty to cling to them.\n\nFortunately, this older woman, perhaps lonely for too long, enjoyed chattering, but she wasn't a bad person.\n\n\"I posted a lost dog notice online, I want to find it.\" The girl took out her phone and showed Zhou Ze a picture of the dog.\n\n\"Boss, have you seen it?\"\n\nZhou Ze gave a bitter laugh. His business was so slow here, even people didn't come, let alone dogs.\n\nBut the older woman, who had been scared paralyzed on the ground by Zhou Ze, now cried out:\n\n\"I've seen this dog, I've seen this dog, right in my neighborhood;\n\nWhen my husband and that little vixen were doing their thing, I couldn't stand being at home anymore,\n\nSo I went to the neighborhood for a walk and saw someone walking this dog!\"",

    "content": "\"Where?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Xingfa Residential Area, led by a man and his daughter, I remember.\" The woman said with certainty, \"I knew that man when I was alive, and I even argued with him! He tried to take advantage of me, tried to flirt with me!\"\n\nZhou Ze frowned slightly and warned, \"If you're lying to me or playing some kind of dirty trick, I'll make sure you can't even be a ghost.\"\n\n\"How could I, big brother? Even though I'm dead, I'm still a good person. Go ask around my neighborhood; who doesn't say Sister Hong is a kind-hearted person?\"\n\nZhou Ze waved his hand, signaling her to be quiet.\n\nThe girl didn't know who Zhou Ze was talking to; of course, Zhou Ze's voice was also very low, like he was murmuring to himself.\n\n\"It seems a friend told me that there's a family in Xingfa Residential Area that has a dog like this or similar. You can go there and ask.\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Really? Okay, I'll go right now.\"\n\nThe girl finished speaking and took out her wallet to pay.\n\n\"Forget it, it's on the house.\"\n\n\"It should be. Thank you, boss, for the information.\" The girl took out five hundred yuan and insisted on giving it to Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Let's talk about it after you find it.\" Zhou Ze still refused to accept the money.\n\n\"Then, thank you, boss.\"\n\nThe girl wiped her tears and left the bookstore.\n\n\"What a good girl,\" the woman was still sitting on the bookstore's tiled floor.\n\n\"You can get lost too.\"\n\n\"Big brother, I finally found someone who can hear me. Can't you chat with me a bit longer?\"\n\nThe woman looked like she was really憋得很辛苦 (holding it in, enduring) and忍得很辛苦 (suppressing herself).\n\n\"No time.\"\n\nZhou Ze sat back behind the counter, picked up his nail clippers, and continued trimming his nails.\n\n\"Big brother, you opened this bookstore here; I'm afraid business isn't good, right?\" The woman was still trying to make conversation.\n\nZhou Ze seemed to suddenly remember something and asked, \"Want to go down?\"\n\n\"Down?\" The woman froze, seemingly not understanding.\n\n\"To where you should be now.\" Zhou Ze just remembered that he seemed to still be a part-time ghost messenger.\n\n\"Can I not go down?\" The woman said with some difficulty, \"My son is taking his college entrance exam this year; I want to stay with him until he finishes.\"\n\nWhat a parent's heart.\n\n\"If your son knew his dead mother was still studying with him at night, he'd surely be moved to tears.\" Zhou Ze quipped.\n\nMoved to tears might not be certain, but being scared sick and failing the college entrance exam is very likely.\n\n\"I'm just staying to watch.\" The woman said somewhat aggrieved.\n\n\"Suit yourself.\" Zhou Ze waved his hand, too lazy to say more. The little loli had told him when assigning the job that unless he deliberately overstepped his bounds to act as some kind of judge, he could do as he pleased at other times.\n\nAnyway, the little loli hadn't given him any performance reports requiring him to collect how many ghosts a month or a quarter.\n\n\"Big brother, how did you become a human?\" The woman asked curiously.\n\nZhou Ze frowned slightly.\n\nThe woman's body shivered a few times, and she immediately dared not speak again.\n\nAbout fifteen minutes later, the woman muttered to herself that her son should be back from evening study hall and left the bookstore.\n\nAfter she left, Zhou Ze deliberately walked over and flipped over the stool she had just sat on, but he didn't see any ghost money.\n\n\"Truly a woman who knows how to manage a household.\"\n\nZhou Ze sighed, feeling if his temper was too good?\n\nHe was, after all, a temporary ghost messenger, a person within the system. How dare she come empty-handed and leave empty-handed?\n\nDoes she really think temporary workers aren't cadres?\n\nPushing open the door and stepping out of the bookstore, Zhou Ze pulled out a cigarette and lit it. Xu Qinglang next door seemed to have just finished cleaning, walking out in an apron. He looked at Zhou Ze, then squatted beside Zhou Ze and asked for a cigarette.\n\nTwo men squatted in a row.\n\nBehind them,\n\nwas a commercial center that was almost completely defunct; ahead of them was an empty road.\n\n\"That little girl was picked up by her mother?\" Xu Qinglang asked.\n\n\"She went down.\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\n\"Oh, she went down.\" Xu Qinglang exhaled, \"Once you go down, it'll be hard to come back, right?\"\n\n\"I don't know either.\" Zhou Ze shook his head.\n\nJust as the little loli said, when he went to hell, he only walked a short distance on the Yellow Springs Road and came out; he had never experienced the true horrors of hell.\n\n\"What's hell like?\" Xu Qinglang asked, blowing out a smoke ring.\n\n\"I don't know much about it.\"\n\nThere was nothing much to talk about, but going back into their respective shops felt even more boring. After they finished their first cigarette, they naturally lit a second one.\n\n\"Where's your wife?\" Xu Qinglang brought up a sensitive topic.\n\n\"Separated.\" Zhou Ze pouted.\n\n\"Hehe.\"\n\nThen, silence again.\n\nNext,\n\nwas the third cigarette.\n\n\"I'm going back to my hometown in a while. I'll make some plum juice for you tomorrow and leave some.\"\n\n\"Thanks. You're not from here?\"\n\n\"I'm from Menhai.\"\n\nMenhai is a county-level district under Tongcheng.\n\n\"A relative of mine is getting married. To be honest, I don't want to go, but I can't not go. After all, it's a friendship from when we played in the mud together as kids and shamelessly followed wedding processions to ask for red envelopes and lucky money.\"\n\n\"Does he want you to be a bridesmaid?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Yes, bridesmaid...\" Xu Qinglang understood and immediately glared at Zhou Ze, \"It's best man.\"\n\n\"Were you married in your previous life?\" Xu Qinglang suddenly asked.\n\n\"No.\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\n\"That's great. This life, you're practically getting a wife for free.\"\n\n\"She's not getting...\"\n\nZhou Ze paused, not continuing.\n\nObsession,\n\nXu Le's obsession,\n\nis still there!\n\nHmm, it must be like that.\n\n\"If you're alive, live well. My parents are gone, completely gone. I've also come to terms with it. I have to grow up, I have to find my own life.\n\nMaybe, in a while, I can also find a girlfriend.\"\n\n\"A boyfriend is more likely.\" Zhou Ze blew out a smoke ring, adding a cutting remark.\n\n\"Hehe, I've been designing my future wedding in my head since I was very young: what style, what kind, what grandeur...\"\n\n\"Isn't that what girls think about?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Can't men dream a little? Shut up, or you won't have any juice to drink tomorrow!\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded. Alright, I'll shut up.\n\n\"I plan to have a traditional Chinese wedding, the very retro kind.\n\nI don't want any luxury cars; I want an eight-bearer sedan chair, just like in the movies.\n\nI'll rent a horse then, wear a mandarin jacket or Hanfu.\n\nThat atmosphere,\n\ndo you understand?\"\n\nZhou Ze reached out and pointed forward.\n\n\"Is it like that?\"\n\nXu Qinglang froze for a moment, squinting his eyes forward, and said, \"What is it?\"\n\n\"You can't see it?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nXu Qinglang's expression hardened. He quickly returned to the shop. Soon, he was rubbing something shiny on his eyes, and then he let out a gasp.\n\nIndeed,\n\non the empty street ahead, a red eight-bearer sedan chair was moving toward them.\n\nThe sedan bearers had red ropes tied around their waists and red ceremonial hats on their heads. Eight bearers, their movements perfectly synchronized;\n\nAs they moved, they performed a \"nine shallow, one deep\" step,\n\nand because of this, every now and then, the sedan would jolt, and the bearers and the two suona players in front would all bounce together.\n\nIt looked very festive.\n\nBut in this desolate area, such a sudden sight would be enough to scare passersby to death.\n\nEven Xu Qinglang, facing such a scene, opened his mouth for a moment, somewhat at a loss.\n\n\"Your wife?\" Zhou Ze pointed at the wedding procession ahead and asked.\n\n\"Nonsense.\" Xu Qinglang retreated a few steps, almost going back into the shop. Seeing Zhou Ze still squatting there, he shouted, \"Aren't you going back? This is a ghost wedding procession!\"\n\n\"Will they throw a绣球 (embroidered ball)?\" Zhou Ze patted his pant legs and slowly stood up.\n\n\"If you're caught, you'll become a 'bandit chief's husband'.\" Xu Qinglang snorted, \"Do you want to be a bookstore owner or be caught and become a ghost woman's husband?\"\n\n\"That serious?\"\n\nZhou Ze was a bit surprised. The ghosts he had seen before didn't have such great abilities, or more precisely, such great influence.\n\nIf the person in the sedan could truly seize a person's soul and take them back to \"get married,\" should he intervene or not?\n\nHe could turn a blind eye to the previous woman; after her son's college entrance exam, she would probably lose her obsession and dissipate to report to hell. But this one,\n\nsuch a grand procession, was definitely not a simple character.\n\nZhou Ze still didn't move. Xu Qinglang stood inside the shop, looked up at the talismans pasted above him, and still felt uneasy. But seeing Zhou Ze still unmoved, he angrily cursed:\n\n\"You're just a rookie ghost. They're all experienced ones. If you retreat, she might not bother you.\"\n\nZhou Ze still didn't move. Vaguely, he felt the mark on his palm heating up, as if reminding him that the one in front of him needed to be sent down, otherwise it would affect the human world.\n\nThe previous woman, Zhou Ze let her go, and the mark had no reaction, which meant it was tacitly allowed. But this time, the mark reminded him.\n\nTemporary worker,\n\nit's not easy to be one.\n\nUsually, when something goes wrong, or there are work omissions, temporary workers are usually the ones who take the fall.\n\nZhou Ze was now in this very awkward position.\n\nThe wedding procession stopped about ten meters from Zhou Ze.\n\nTwo sedan bearers reached out and lifted the sedan curtain.\n\nIt was empty inside.\n\nThe suona player walked towards Zhou Ze, bowed and stooped about a meter away from Zhou Ze:\n\n\"My mistress heard that the esteemed superior has been promoted and ordered us to invite the esteemed superior to her mansion for congratulations.\"\n\nThe suona player had a handsome, refined face, but his skin was very pale, and his blush and lipstick were a bit excessive, like a paper figure sold in a paper funeral effigy shop.\n\n\"You became a ghost messenger?\" Xu Qinglang walked out of the shop, looking as if his poor neighbor, Wang Xiaodan, had suddenly become the mayor, an unreal feeling.\n\n\"If you get rich, don't forget me! You actually kept it from me!\" Xu Qinglang walked over, complaining to Zhou Ze. That particular charm, crisp to the bone, was enough to make poplars bend.\n\n\"I have something I'd like to ask the esteemed superior,\" the suona player asked respectfully, bowing.\n\n\"Say it, what is it? No problem, he'll take care of it! From now on, this area will be under his management!\" Xu Qinglang assumed a delightful, overbearing posture, completely seductive.\n\n\"My mistress ordered us to pick up the esteemed superior and also to capture a man to join in matrimony;\n\nIt is said that this man has more than twenty properties in the human world, which perfectly matches my mistress's status.\n\nMay I ask the esteemed superior, do you know where this person is?\"\n\n\"...\" Xu Qinglang.",

    "content": "\"The world's morals are declining, and people's hearts are no longer what they once were!\"\n\nMany lament that in this era, the entire society is scourged by the tide of money worship, to the point where even marriage is placed on a scale for equivalent exchange.\n\nHowever, these days, even ghosts getting married are starting to care about such things!\n\nYou have over twenty private houses.\nWhat a coincidence,\nMy lady has over twenty ancestral tombs.\nA perfect match!\nJoy, joy,\nEveryone is joyful!\n\nAfter the suona player asked this question, Zhou Ze's mouth twitched instinctively.\n\nHe was suppressing a laugh, and at the same time, his heart felt truly content.\n\nZhou Ze had long wanted to punch his neighbor, who constantly said, \"I have over twenty apartments.\" This ghost lady had truly arrived at the perfect time.\n\nHeaven's way has its cycles!\n\nXu Qinglang was so scared he was sweating. He was a玄士 (Xuan Shi), but he could only open his yin-yang eyes, play with puppets, and incorporate some Sichuan Opera face-changing tricks. He wasn't truly a Celestial Master like Zhang Tianshi; otherwise, he wouldn't have been so cowardly when facing the little loli.\n\nXu Qinglang, quickly regaining his composure, began to look up,\ngazing at the sky.\nWhat did you say?\nI don't understand.\nThat person,\nI don't know him.\n\nThen, Xu Qinglang's eyelids suddenly twitched because he saw Zhou Ze's right hand, which had been at his side, raise an index finger and point directly at him.\n\n\"@#￥%……*&amp;*!!!!!!\"\n\nTen thousand bottles of sour plum juice surged through Xu Qinglang's heart!\n\nThe two suona players walked directly to either side of Xu Qinglang and said respectfully:\n\"Please, young groom, enter the sedan chair.\"\n\nAh, so this sedan chair wasn't for picking up the ghost messenger; it was the ghost lady's special arrangement to welcome her new groom.\n\nZhou Ze inwardly re-evaluated his status as a \"temporary worker.\"\n\n\"Don't pull me, don't drag me, don't force me!\nBe careful, or I'll turn hostile!\"\n\nXu Qinglang was pushed towards the sedan chair by the suona players, but he kept struggling.\n\nHe had just said he wanted to start a new life and find a partner, but he hadn't intended to get involved with ghosts!\n\n\"Zhou Ze, you're setting me up, you're harming me!\" Xu Qinglang cried out, much like an innocent woman being forced into prostitution.\n\nPrefer to die than surrender,\nChastity forever!\n\n\"Go take a look, maybe that ghost lady looks like Joey Wong; you wouldn't be at a disadvantage, would you?\" Zhou Ze laughed.\n\nXu Qinglang was pushed into the sedan chair. The suona player said to Zhou Ze, \"Officer, you may follow us. We will lead the way.\"\n\nAfter speaking, the suona player also pointed to the electric scooter parked at Xu Qinglang's door:\n\"Officer, you may ride it.\"\n\nZhou Ze remembered that last time he rode the ghost driver's paper car, he was still safely delivered to the bookstore. So, it was clear that some ghosts indeed possessed abilities similar to Qimen Dunjia, and some physical theories likely didn't apply to them.\n\nThe electric scooter belonged to Xu Qinglang. Zhou Ze didn't stand on ceremony. After locking the shop door, he rode the scooter and followed the sedan chair ahead.\n\nThe sedan bearers walked very quickly,\nTheir steps were still \"nine shallow and one deep,\"\nEach time they took a \"deep\" step, all eight sedan bearers and the two suona players would bounce, causing the wedding sedan to sway.\n\nImmediately after,\nXu Qinglang, seated in the wedding sedan, would let out an \"ah\" sound;\nLike a nightingale's soft cry, melodious and alluring, inviting imagination.\n\nWhen Zhou Ze rode his electric scooter alongside the sedan chair, Xu Qinglang lifted the curtain of the sedan. Looking out, Xu Qinglang's face was flushed, and his eyes seemed to be casting alluring gazes, as if moistened.\nHis pearly teeth bit his red lips, a truly charming and delicate sight.\n\nJust then, the sedan bearers took a \"deep\" step, and the sedan chair suddenly lifted.\n\"Ah!\"\nXu Qinglang instinctively cried out again, a look of anger on his face, glaring fiercely at Zhou Ze, truly embarrassed!\n\nZhou Ze held the electric scooter's handlebars with one hand and waved the other dismissively, saying,\n\"Shameful.\"\n\n\"This sedan chair affects the soul; it stimulates the soul!\" Xu Qinglang had to explain. He was genuinely worried that Zhou Ze would think he was enjoying himself and couldn't stop.\n\n\"Explanation is concealment,\" Zhou Ze said. \"Saying one thing and doing another.\"\n\n\"............\" Xu Qinglang.\n\nCasting a final resentful glance at Zhou Ze, Xu Qinglang lowered the curtain.\nThat glance was as if he were looking at a heartless man who had even willingly sacrificed himself for fame and fortune!\n\nZhou Ze could actually see that the sedan bearers and suona players were moving to a special rhythm. They were just puppets; their true forms were likely paper figures from a paper craft shop, somewhat similar to the wooden ox and flowing horse designed by Zhuge Liang in the Three Kingdoms period.\n\nThe sedan bearers continued their \"nine shallow and one deep\" steps,\nXu Qinglang would \"ah\" every now and then,\nZhou Ze followed along on his small electric scooter.\n\nUnbeknownst to them, the procession had already passed the city center and entered the Tongzhou district.\n\nA few years ago, Tongzhou District was still a county under Tongcheng, having only recently been upgraded from a county to a district. Zhou Ze had been to this place once before when he helped the old woman in the morgue find money.\n\nFinally, the sedan chair procession entered a desolate area diagonally below Jianghai Avenue. This area was surrounded by tall buildings, and it was likely a construction site put on hold for special reasons.\n\nThe road inside was not easy to drive on anymore, so Zhou Ze had to get off his scooter and push it forward.\n\nAfter another few dozen meters,\nSuddenly,\nIt became wide open!\nThe previously dark and desolate area was suddenly adorned with lanterns and streamers. Ahead, over twenty outdoor banquets were set up, with ten cold dishes neatly arranged on each table.\n\nPeople bustled about, women in elegant attire, laughter and joy filling the air.\n\nSomeone eager to please loudly announced, \"The groom has arrived!\"\n\nIn an instant, ladies in powder and hairpins swarmed over. Zhou Ze felt surrounded by a flurry of beautiful women, a lively scene. Some of them passed directly through him and his scooter, moving back and forth, tirelessly.\n\nZhou Ze's right hand remained tightly clenched, the mark still burning.\n\nActually, Zhou Ze didn't need the mark to remind him that this place was where the ghost messenger needed to take care of things.\nBecause the ghosts here, under the call of that ghost lady, had already become organized and structured, which was, of course, intolerable!\n\nBut Zhou Ze kept enduring. Firstly, he had just become a temporary worker, so he wasn't in a hurry to ignite three fires upon taking office; otherwise, he might burn himself. After all, in the human world, temporary workers usually ended up taking the fall when something went wrong in a department. Zhou Ze figured it was probably similar in the underworld, given that people from the human world went to the underworld after death.\n\nFurthermore, Zhou Ze also understood that if it were truly easy to handle, why didn't that little loli resolve it herself?\nThe other party even dared to invite him, a ghost messenger, to celebrate, which also showed their fearlessness.\n\n\"Set down the sedan!\"\n\nThe sedan bearers lowered the sedan chair together. Xu Qinglang was pushed out; he was very reserved and shy, yet also filled with shame and anger.\n\n\"Madam requests your presence.\"\n\nA woman in a black ancient-style dress walked up to Zhou Ze and Xu Qinglang, bowing deeply.\n\n\"Let's go.\"\n\nZhou Ze patted Xu Qinglang's shoulder.\n\nXu Qinglang disdainfully swatted Zhou Ze's hand away but still followed Zhou Ze forward.\n\nPassing through the banquet, seeing all sorts of ghosts pointing and whispering around him, Zhou Ze felt a bit unaccustomed. Fortunately, when they reached a small red two-story house, the various杂七杂八 (záqīzábā - hodgepodge) noises finally faded away.\n\nThis building was adorned with lanterns and streamers, large lanterns hung, and new Spring Festival couplets were displayed, creating a lively and festive atmosphere.\n\nThe house layout was very similar to modern houses. The main entrance opened into the living room, and the black-dressed maid gestured for Zhou Ze and Xu Qinglang to enter.\n\n\"Excited?\" Zhou Ze suddenly asked. \"What if she really has Joey Wong's aura? Don't get so carried away you forget to go home.\"\n\n\"I hope she likes 'one dragon playing with two phoenixes'.\"\n\nXu Qinglang said fiercely, clearly implying he wanted to drag Zhou Ze down with him if he was unlucky.\n\nIt was truly because Zhou Ze had been relentlessly gloating and adding insult to injury along the way, as if he had been determined to make fun of him!\n\nHe just usually liked to say \"I have over twenty apartments,\"\nWasn't that the truth!\nHad he intentionally flaunted or showed off?\n\nEntering the hall, they stepped onto a large red carpet, and the four walls were adorned with exquisite cross-stitch embroidery.\n\nA woman in a red wedding dress sat gracefully by a small table.\nOn the small table were exquisite dishes and wine.\n\n\"Officer, my lord, please be seated.\"\n\nThe woman stood up and gestured for them to sit.\n\nBecause the woman's face was covered by a veil, it was unclear.\nBut her voice was truly beautiful.\n\nZhou Ze took a seat, pulling Xu Qinglang, who reluctantly sat down.\n\nSince they were here, they might as well make the best of it. Let's see what tricks she had up her sleeve.\n\nThe dishes on the small table were exquisite and fragrant, and the wine was rich and alluring.\n\n\"Officer, my lord, please help yourselves.\" The ghost lady gestured for them to eat.\n\nZhou Ze didn't move, maintaining his composure.\n\nXu Qinglang, looking distraught, drank three cups and then exclaimed, \"Good wine!\"\nAfterward, he kept eating, completely turning his grief into appetite.\n\nZhou Ze watched from the side, his chest heaving, covering his mouth with his hand.\n\n\"What's wrong? Eat, it's delicious, better than what I make myself.\" Xu Qinglang, being a chef himself, could naturally discern the quality of the dishes.\n\nHave you never watched a ghost movie?\nZhou Ze thought to himself.\nBut he still said nothing, instead picking up his chopsticks and helping Xu Qinglang put food into his bowl, instructing him:\n\"Good boy, eat more. There's no sour plum juice here, and I can't eat anything, you know.\"\n\nXu Qinglang grunted twice, suspecting nothing, and continued eating, determined to die a well-fed ghost!\nAnd, it was truly delicious!\n\nXu Qinglang was even thinking about whether he should find an opportunity later to discuss and learn recipes with the ghost lady. These dishes, if put on the market, even the top chefs of five-star hotels couldn't make them this delicious.\n\nAfter Xu Qinglang had eaten his fill,\nZhou Ze nodded in satisfaction,\nAnd asked the ghost lady, \"Madam, may I ask how these dishes are prepared?\"\n\n\"You're too kind, officer. This wine was brewed by your humble servant using the urine of passersby;\nThese dishes were carefully prepared by your humble servant using the freshest snakes, insects, rats, and ants...\"\n\nXu Qinglang's face instantly changed.\nHe pointed at Zhou Ze, but before he could say anything,\nHe directly:\n\"Ugh............\"",

    "content": "Xu Qinglang vomited so hard his head spun, almost throwing up his gall.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head slightly. This kid was still too young. He probably hadn't watched enough ghost movies as a child. Encountering a ghost in the wilderness and eating with it was actually the most classic scene.\n\nThe delicacies originally served on the plates were actually maggots, earthworms, cockroaches, ants, and so on.\n\nThis trope had been overused.\n\nEven if he didn't have an eating disorder, Zhou Ze wouldn't touch it with a chopstick.\n\nDid they expect the ghosts here to go shopping for groceries every day? And then set up a stove to cook for him?\n\nZhou Ze remembered a case from before: a person visited a friend, and the friend said his wife was traveling, so he had to entertain him alone. He stayed at the friend's house for a week. The only regret was that the friend's house had too few vegetarian dishes, only meat, but the meat soup was really delicious.\n\nWhen he bid farewell to his friend and went out, he met a neighbor who said the friend hadn't left the house for almost a month, staying cooped up inside all day.\n\nThe person immediately vomited upon hearing this.\n\nZhou Ze subconsciously picked up the wine in front of him, then put it down.\n\nHe almost forgot.\n\nIt was passerby's urine.\n\n\"My husband isn't feeling well, so he should go rest first.\" The Ghost Lady looked at the black-dressed maid beside her.\n\nThe maid nodded and walked over to help Xu Qinglang.\n\nXu Qinglang pushed away the maid's hand directly, sat up straight, and said,\n\n\"Just say what you want to do quickly. I don't want to play any more roundabout games.\"\n\nYes, Xu Qinglang was angry.\n\nHe was thoroughly angry.\n\nThe Ghost Lady stood up and walked in front of Zhou Ze. Zhou Ze could clearly smell the faint fragrance emanating from her. Her graceful figure and voluptuous curves made one's imagination run wild.\n\nZhou Ze let out a long sigh of relief in his heart.\n\nHe had been with Xu Qinglang for a long time, but he was still normal.\n\nHowever, Zhou Ze didn't have the courage to lift the Ghost Lady's red veil.\n\nA beauty reduced to a skeleton was only natural.\n\nLooking at the layout and decorations here, it was clear that this Ghost Lady had been dead for a long time. If he lifted her veil and she was in a good mood, she might show him her face from when she was alive.\n\nIf his luck was bad, she'd just blind his dog eyes with a skull face corroded with maggots everywhere.\n\nZhou Ze remembered reading a report in his previous life that it was popular for husbands to accompany their wives into the delivery room back then.\n\nMany hipsters thought this would make husbands understand their wives' sacrifices and greatness. Later, a Japanese husband became depressed directly after accompanying the birth, developing a psychological shadow. He could no longer live a normal married life and eventually had to choose divorce.\n\nAnd now, Zhou Ze knew he had a neighbor who was prettier than a woman. If he were to be startled by this Ghost Lady's face again, his orientation might truly spiral into an unfathomable abyss.\n\nIn both his previous and current lives, he seemed to have never truly gotten what he desired from women. Zhou Ze didn't want to skip ahead and play advanced games in this life.\n\n\"Esteemed Emissary, this concubine invited you here instead of visiting you directly, not out of impoliteness or intentional disrespect, but truly because this concubine has no other way to leave this place.\"\n\nThe Ghost Lady tearfully told Zhou Ze.\n\n\"As for this gentleman, the reason he was invited was only because over a decade ago, when he was a mere child, he once passed by here and left a jest. He told his companion at the time that if a female ghost was truly like Joey Wong in the movies, he would be willing to marry her.\"\n\nXu Qinglang opened his mouth wide at these words.\n\nHe had forgotten this entirely?\n\nZhou Ze, on the other hand, glanced at Xu Qinglang, meaning: \"I didn't realize, you look so effeminate, but you were so precocious.\"\n\n\"Specifically, what is the matter?\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't directly say, \"You're very disobedient, I'm taking you back to Hell.\"\n\nLittle Loli had said he was the most self-aware person she had ever met.\n\nIndeed,\n\nZhou Ze truly had self-awareness now. Without benefits, performance metrics, or missions, he really didn't need to sacrifice himself for the prosperity of Hell.\n\n\"Esteemed Emissary, do not worry. This concubine will depart today, returning her soul to the netherworld.\" The Ghost Lady smiled and continued, \"This concubine's surname is Bai. I was a daughter of a scholarly family during the Daoguang era. Alas, my fate was ill-fated, and I died prematurely on the eve of my wedding, buried here. It has been nearly two hundred years since then.\n\nThough this concubine is a ghost, I have never done anything harmful. I once protected the local villagers, allowing them to live in peace and contentment. Mr. Secheng once inscribed a plaque for this concubine's shrine, and from that time on, this concubine gained a temple body and could receive incense.\n\nHowever, in recent sixty years, the shrine has fallen into disrepair and is no longer traceable. No one knows that such an *yin* shrine once existed here.\"\n\n\"Who is Mr. Secheng?\" Xu Qinglang blinked and asked.\n\n\"Zhang Jian,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\n\"Oh, him.\" Xu Qinglang understood now.\n\nZhang Jian was a prominent figure in Tongcheng during the late Qing Dynasty. He drafted the abdication edict for the Qing emperor, was a top scholar in the late Qing, and also a national entrepreneur.\n\nThe *yin* shrine the Ghost Lady mentioned didn't refer to a dubious place, but rather a shrine not recognized by the imperial court's rites, belonging to illegally worshipped deities.\n\n\"Then you're quite impressive.\" Xu Qinglang had recovered from his earlier vomiting. After the Ghost Lady said she invited him only because of a jest he made as a child, he relaxed. As long as she wasn't forcing him to be her husband, it was fine.\n\nCultivating for two hundred years and having a shrine built to receive incense offerings — this should already be beyond the level of a mere ghost, right?\n\n\"Now, this concubine's cultivation is complete, and I am about to descend into the netherworld. However, there is one matter this concubine cannot ignore.\"\n\nThe Ghost Lady bowed slightly to Zhou Ze, pleading:\n\n\"This concubine's former body, due to the circumstances of its burial, has remained uncorrupted for two hundred years, as if alive. This concubine's soul is now about to enter the netherworld, but this concubine's body cannot be taken along.\n\nMoreover, for these two hundred years, this concubine's body has been affected by this concubine's soul, showing signs of becoming a *sha* (corpse demon). This concubine does not wish for her body, once her soul has departed, to potentially reanimate and cause harm. Therefore, I earnestly request the esteemed emissary's help.\"\n\n\"How do I help you?\"\n\nZhou Ze rubbed his hands. Since this Ghost Lady intended to go to Hell herself, that was for the best; it was like surrendering.\n\nNo, not like surrendering. It was more like ancient rebels, after gaining enough strength, accepting an imperial amnesty, washing their identities clean, and gaining official positions.\n\nBut no matter what, it was good that she wasn't trying to fight him head-on.\n\n\"This concubine asks the esteemed emissary to help watch over this concubine's body and incinerate it with bamboo and wood on the next Cold Clothes Festival night,\" the Ghost Lady said.\n\n\"Help watch over?\" Zhou Ze thought for a moment, then nodded.\n\n\"Has the esteemed emissary agreed to this concubine's request?\" The Ghost Lady confirmed, \"This concubine thanks the esteemed emissary here.\"\n\n\"You're welcome.\"\n\nZhou Ze subconsciously picked up his wine glass again.\n\nHm,\n\nHe put it down again.\n\n\"Then this concubine will take her leave.\" The Ghost Lady's figure began to slowly disappear, leaving quite decisively.\n\nZhou Ze pursed his lips. The next moment, Zhou Ze found that all the surrounding scenery vanished. He and Xu Qinglang were sitting on two stone blocks.\n\nThe banquet tables all disappeared without a trace. All that was visible were jagged rocks and dense weeds.\n\nXu Qinglang lit a cigarette, feeling a bit melancholic.\n\n\"Disappointed you didn't see what your wife looked like?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Why don't you lift the veil and look yourself?\" Xu Qinglang snorted coldly.\n\nA long road tests a horse's strength, and time reveals a person's heart.* Zhou Ze had kicked him when he was down countless times tonight; Xu Qinglang had kept a mental note of it all.\n\n\"She's your wife, how could I overstep?\" Zhou Ze looked around, then tapped his shoe on the ground. \"Is Madam Bai's corpse buried under this ground?\"\n\n\"Probably,\" Xu Qinglang was also unsure, but soon, his eyes spotted two rusty shovels lying in the grass ahead. \"It must be, then. They even prepared shovels for us.\"\n\nZhou Ze walked over, and he and Xu Qinglang each took a shovel. There was nothing more to say; time to dig!\n\nThey both dug until dawn, drenched in sweat, finally hitting something hard below. Pushing aside the dirt, they could see it was a red wood coffin.\n\nAfter about another half hour, they completely cleared the coffin.\n\n\"Open the coffin,\" Zhou Ze said. \"It's almost dawn. Let's finish early, or if someone sees us and calls the police, they'll think we're grave robbers.\"\n\n\"You do it,\" Xu Qinglang wiped his sweat. \"I find it disgusting.\"\n\n\"Didn't she say her body wasn't corrupted?\"\n\n\"Who knows if that's true?\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. No choice; it was something he had promised. Xu Qinglang was just helping as a friend. If he wasn't willing to do it, Zhou Ze had to.\n\nPrying open the coffin nails, Zhou Ze stood to the side and pulled hard. The coffin lid was lifted. Then, Zhou Ze took out his phone, turned on the flashlight, and shined it down.\n\n\"Heh... she really is quite beautiful.\"\n\nXu Qinglang also leaned over. Indeed, the woman lying in the coffin was dressed in a white gown, with long hair draped over her shoulders and a dignified and beautiful face. There wasn't a single flaw on her body; she looked as if she were merely sleeping.\n\n\"She's your wife. Do you want to take advantage of the warmth... \"\n\nXu Qinglang suddenly pushed Zhou Ze, \"What nonsense are you talking about? Hurry and carry her out and take her back.\"\n\nThis time, Xu Qinglang was very proactive. He jumped down and picked up the female corpse.\n\nBut as soon as he lifted her off the ground, Xu Qinglang's face immediately changed. He quickly put the female corpse down and then rubbed his hands continuously on the side.\n\n\"Hiss... So cold, bone-chilling cold. This corpse has such heavy *sha* energy; it's clearly on its way to becoming a zombie. That Madam Bai definitely didn't tell the complete truth.\n\nShe must have been intentionally nourishing her body for these two hundred years out of a woman's natural vanity.\n\nNow that her cultivation is complete and she's ready to leave, she leaves behind such a huge problem.\"\n\nWhen Zhou Ze personally went down and picked up the female corpse, he immediately felt that chilling sensation that seemed to stimulate the soul.\n\nBut the next moment, Zhou Ze found his fingernails beginning to lengthen. The coldness, which Xu Qinglang had referred to as *sha* energy, began actively pouring into Zhou Ze's fingernails.\n\nFor a moment,\n\nThe sensation of exhilarating numbness made Zhou Ze's soul tremble completely; it seemed to be a form of nourishment.\n\n\"Hoo... uh... hiss... ooh...\"\n\nXu Qinglang, who was still checking his palms for frostbite on the side, heard Zhou Ze's sounds and immediately looked shocked, pointing at Zhou Ze:\n\n\"You beast,\n\nYou really took advantage of the warmth!\"\n\n---\n* The idiom \"路遙知馬力日久見人心\" (lù yáo zhī mǎlì rì jiǔ jiàn rénxīn) literally means \"A long road tests a horse's strength, and a long time reveals a person's heart.\" It implies that true character is revealed over time and through challenges.",

    "content": "Before dawn broke, Zhou Ze rode his electric scooter back to the bookstore with the female corpse, while Xu Qinglang waited there to hail a taxi.\n\nAfter all, he had arrived in a sedan chair; there was no sedan chair for him to ride back in.\n\nUpon returning to the bookstore, Zhou Ze placed the female corpse in the freezer on the second floor of the shop. Then he went downstairs to take a shower. By the time he finished showering and changed into a fresh set of clothes, Xu Qinglang, who had finally managed to hail a taxi, had just returned. He walked straight into the bookstore, looked at Zhou Ze's wet hair, and quipped:\n\n\"You need to control yourself.\"\n\n\"Heh heh.\" Zhou Ze only responded with those two words.\n\nXu Qinglang shook his head and left the bookstore without saying anything more. He was tired from the events of the night.\n\nZhou Ze locked the shop door and went up to the second floor, standing by the freezer and looking at the female corpse inside.\n\nThe female corpse's face was exquisite, and her demeanor was remarkable. People in ancient times married quite young; it was common for girls to become mothers at fifteen or sixteen. Therefore, the body of Madam Bai, who had died before marriage, looked about the same age as an average high school student, but she exuded a natural allure.\n\nXu Qinglang's beauty was enchanting, like a blooming peony, whereas Madam Bai's was a delicate, reserved daisy.\n\nOf course, Zhou Ze wouldn't harbor excessive fantasies about a corpse. What he was pondering was something else.\n\nAs he held the female corpse while riding the electric scooter back, his ten fingernails were constantly in contact with her, as if currents were flowing into his body, continuously stimulating his soul and fingernails.\n\nThankfully, Xu Qinglang wasn't around when they returned, otherwise Zhou Ze probably would have screamed just like Xu Qinglang did when he arrived in the sedan chair. Such matters are best kept private.\n\nWhen he carried her back to the bookstore, Zhou Ze noticed that most of the chill emanating from her body had dissipated.\n\nIt was like a rechargeable battery; he had just drained its power, but it shouldn't be a big problem. Lying there, she should be able to recharge herself naturally.\n\nHe held his palms in front of him, and his fingernails slowly grew out. The originally black and translucent nail beds now had a blood-red pattern. This must be a change from the nails absorbing the corpse's malevolent aura.\n\nIt looked quite good.\n\nZhou Ze smiled, reaching for the cup of warm water he had brought up earlier, only to find the water had grown cold.\n\nBecause of the female corpse, the temperature on this small second floor was even lower than outside, and Zhou Ze himself had a somewhat diminished perception of \"cold.\"\n\nIt was a pity it wasn't summer. If it were summer, having a female corpse here would save his shop air conditioning costs, and it would also repel mosquitoes.\n\nThat night, Zhou Ze made a makeshift bed by the freezer and slept very soundly.\n\nThe little蘿莉 (loli) had once said that if Zhou Ze held her, he could fall asleep without needing the freezer. It seemed the female corpse had a similar effect.\n\nWhen he woke up the next morning, Zhou Ze stretched. He placed his fingernails on the corpse's lower abdomen, and immediately, the icy sensation returned.\n\nIt was very comfortable,\n\nvery enjoyable,\n\nbut this feeling only lasted for about half a minute before dissipating. This meant that the female corpse had only recharged this much overnight.\n\nMadam Bai had mentioned concerns about her corpse moving, and Xu Qinglang had also said that the strong malevolent aura from the corpse, if stimulated externally, could turn her into a *jiangshi* (hopping zombie). However, it seemed unlikely now. Whatever malevolent aura she accumulated, he would absorb it daily.\n\nAlthough he didn't know what this thing was for him, the sheer comfort it provided was enough to keep Zhou Ze tirelessly engaged.\n\nAfter eating at Xu Qinglang's shop next door, Zhou Ze sat idly in his own shop, still pondering which book to read, when his phone rang.\n\nIt was his sister-in-law's call.\n\n\"Xu Le, come back for a moment.\"\n\n\"What's wrong?\" Zhou Ze didn't believe his sister-in-law would suddenly call him out of concern. The young girl was still in her rebellious teenage phase, a bit self-centered, or rather, somewhat selfish and overbearing.\n\n\"Your eldest uncle is at my house. Come pick him up,\" his sister-in-law said impatiently.\n\n\"Eldest uncle?\" Zhou Ze frowned slightly. He remembered Xu Le, like himself, was an orphan. Of course, Xu Le didn't grow up in an orphanage; his parents had passed away one after another after he was born.\n\n\"Okay, I'll be back.\"\n\nHe hung up the phone, told Xu Qinglang next door to watch the shop for him, and then called a taxi to go back to the Lin family's house.\n\nWang Ke's treatment suggestion for him was to temporarily sever ties with his existing social network. But circumstances had changed; before, Zhou Ze was a \"black household,\" like a rat crossing the street. Now he was a temporary civil servant, so he had far fewer things to worry about and less danger.\n\nMoreover, Zhou Ze had previously read Xu Le's private journal entries in his space, which mentioned his eldest uncle. All along, it was his eldest uncle who had supported him through school.\n\nSince he had taken over someone else's body, some necessary explanations still had to be given. What's more, Xu Le had already gone to hell and reported for reincarnation. The changes in his own temperament earlier had nothing to do with Xu Le; they were side effects of his soul possessing another's body.\n\nWhen Zhou Ze returned to the Lin family's house, before he even entered the door, he saw an old man with a wrinkled face, dressed in a cotton padded jacket, sitting on the steps in the stairwell, smoking a dry pipe.\n\nNext to the old man were several fertilizer bags; one bag likely contained chickens and ducks, and the other probably held sausages and the like.\n\n\"A-Le!\" The old man saw Xu Le approaching, immediately stood up, walked to Xu Le, and patted him hard on the shoulder: \"The child has grown taller again.\"\n\nZhou Ze grinned. He didn't ask why his eldest uncle was sitting in the stairwell smoking. In fact, there was no need to ask.\n\nEven if his eldest uncle had voluntarily gone out to smoke his dry pipe to avoid polluting their house, the local produce he brought wouldn't still be outside. This could only mean that the Lin family didn't welcome him, and perhaps hadn't even let him inside.\n\nRecalling his sister-in-law's tone and attitude when she called earlier, it was enough to infer the Lin family's attitude toward his eldest uncle.\n\nOf course, there was nothing to resent or hate. His relationship with the Lin family was already on the verge of collapse; it wasn't about who was right or wrong.\n\n\"Have you eaten?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Not yet,\" the old man was honest.\n\n\"I'll take you to eat.\"\n\n\"Alright.\"\n\nZhou Ze chose a restaurant, entered, ordered a few dishes, and also a bottle of baijiu.\n\nThe old man poured for himself and drank a few sips. It was clear his mood was heavy. Evidently, he felt the Lin family's coldness. They were in-laws, after all, and now they weren't even bothering with courtesies.\n\n\"Le-wa'er, if you're not happy, just come home and live here,\" the eldest uncle patted his chest. \"Now the national targeted poverty alleviation policy is very good, and our family doesn't have to worry about not being able to make ends meet. You've also been to college, so if you come back, we can also get into some characteristic farming or something. Our life won't be worse than others.\"\n\n\"Okay, let's talk about it later,\" Zhou Ze replied perfunctorily.\n\n\"Alas.\" The eldest uncle knew Xu Le didn't drink alcohol, so he didn't ask Zhou Ze to drink with him. He slowly finished a bottle by himself, then ate two bowls of rice. After Zhou Ze paid the bill, he carried his things and walked out of the restaurant with Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Take these things with you. They don't want them, so you eat them,\" the eldest uncle handed the several woven bags to Zhou Ze. \"I'm catching the afternoon bus back.\"\n\n\"Alright.\" Zhou Ze didn't try to make him stay.\n\nHis eldest uncle must have had a good tolerance for alcohol. Zhou Ze called a taxi for him, paid the driver in advance to take him to the bus station. Afterward, Zhou Ze carried the things back to the bookstore.\n\nXu Qinglang was sitting by the door, sunbathing. Zhou Ze placed a pile of local specialties in front of him.\n\n\"Oh, what's this?\"\n\n\"For you to use as ingredients,\" Zhou Ze found a chair nearby and sat down.\n\n\"Alright,\" Xu Qinglang didn't stand on ceremony either; he hadn't charged Zhou Ze for meals before. \"By the way, you told me your real name is Zhou Ze, but you never really talked about your past. What did you do before?\"\n\n\"Doctor,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\nThere was nothing to hide from Xu Qinglang about these matters.\n\nAnd now that his identity was cleared, he wasn't afraid of official scrutiny.\n\n\"A doctor? Then you and your wife truly are a pair.\" Xu Qinglang leisurely exhaled a puff of smoke. \"Haven't seen your wife come by in days.\"\n\n\"No chance,\" Zhou Ze said with a nonchalant air.\n\n\"Heh heh.\"\n\nThe two smoked another cigarette together, then Zhou Ze stood up, pushed open the bookstore door, and walked inside.\n\nHe had told Xu Qinglang to look after the shop when he left that morning, so he hadn't locked the door.\n\nSitting behind the counter, Zhou Ze opened his computer and clicked an icon. Then, video footage appeared on the desktop.\n\nZhou Ze had recently bought two pinhole cameras for the shop. One was placed at the staircase entrance, and the other in the upper left corner of the bookstore. They weren't expensive; usually, peeping Toms bought them.\n\nHe casually picked up the cup from the counter, took a few sips of water, and began to adjust the playback time on the video.\n\nWhen he left that morning, Zhou Ze had deliberately not locked the door and asked Xu Qinglang to look after the shop for a reason.\n\nYesterday, Madam Bai had invited him over and also sent a sedan chair for Xu Qinglang. Although she had explained it was due to a childhood jest by Xu Qinglang, Zhou Ze didn't fully believe her.\n\nHe had brought the corpse back and kept her with him. If Madam Bai and Xu Qinglang had any other connection, Xu Qinglang should have made some move this morning.\n\nIt's better to be safe than sorry. He wasn't even human anymore, so he naturally had to be more cautious.\n\nAt 11:30 AM, the footage showed Xu Qinglang entering his shop.\n\nZhou Ze took another sip of water, feeling that the water in the cup was a little sweet, exceptionally delicious.\n\nIt must be a psychological effect, because he was secretly pleased that he thought he was right?\n\nHowever, in the footage, Xu Qinglang merely entered the shop, picked up a few newspapers, sat there reading for half an hour, then returned the newspapers to their original place and left. He didn't go upstairs at all.\n\nHad he guessed wrong?\n\nWas he being petty towards a gentleman?\n\nZhou Ze pursed his lips and chuckled to himself, draining the water in his cup.\n\nJust as Zhou Ze was about to close the footage and go wash his face, he suddenly thought of the camera placed at the staircase entrance. This camera's position allowed it to observe the staircase and the counter area on the first floor.\n\nHowever, since Xu Qinglang hadn't gone inside, watching it probably wouldn't matter much.\n\nBut these types of cameras were cheap and had small memory, so Zhou Ze still had to delete the used memory to free up space.\n\nAt the same time, Zhou Ze also casually opened the video recorded by the second camera, dragging the timeline from beginning to end, just to go through the motions.\n\nHowever, at that instant, Zhou Ze seemed to see a white shadow fleetingly.\n\n\"Hmm?\"\n\nZhou Ze instinctively pulled back the mouse. With his other hand, he reached for the teacup, only to realize the water in it was already gone.\n\nHe immediately disregarded refilling the water,\n\nand instead, dragged the mouse little by little,\n\nFinally,\n\nThe footage captured that moment:\n\nA woman dressed in white slowly walked down from the second floor!\n\nThat corpse,\n\nShe could move!\n\nZhou Ze felt a rush of blood to his head, and a sense of crisis immediately overwhelmed him. His heart and breathing became rapid.\n\nJust as Zhou Ze was pondering this,\n\nThe footage continued to play.\n\nIn the video,\n\nMadam Bai's corpse walked to the counter, picked up the water cup placed on it,\n\nThen,\n\nLike a dog drinking water,\n\nShe stuck out her tongue and swirled it a few times in the cup,\n\nAfterward, she put down the cup and, like someone getting up at night thirsty for water,\n\nShe slowly walked back upstairs.\n\nZhou Ze took a deep breath, looking at the cup beside him that he had just emptied.\n\nNo wonder when he drank the water just now,\n\nit tasted a little sweet...",

    "content": "Second floor,\n\nNext to the freezer,\n\nZhou Ze stood for about half an hour.\n\nLady Bai still lay inside, exactly as she had been when Zhou Ze got up and went out that morning, with no change whatsoever. But the images recorded by the camera couldn’t be wrong.\n\nEspecially,\n\nThat cup of water,\n\nHe had felt it was a bit sweet when he first started drinking it.\n\nThis wasn’t a psychological effect, because he hadn’t watched that video before drinking the water.\n\nActually, Zhou Ze didn't feel too disgusted about drinking the other person's saliva, especially after seeing Xu Qinglang eat so many \"delicacies\" last night.\n\nCompared to Xu Qinglang, his experience this time was just a drop in the bucket.\n\nOf course, he didn't find it \"sensual\" either;\n\nThe woman before him, no matter how beautiful, was just a corpse, a two-hundred-year-old corpse lying underground.\n\nThe thought of her not having brushed her teeth for two hundred years made Zhou Ze, who had a slight obsession with cleanliness, a bit uncomfortable.\n\nShe could move, and she went downstairs to drink water, then came back up.\n\nLady Bai didn't tell him the truth?\n\nOr there was another possibility: because of his fingernail last night, this corpse had undergone some slight changes.\n\nCurrently, Lady Bai's soul had already reported to hell, so she shouldn't intentionally leave any bombs in the human world.\n\nThe little loli once said that ghosts in the Yang world had to \"behave themselves\" like a mouse. Anyone who wanted to cause trouble was simply tired of living, or living too comfortably.\n\nHowever, the feeling of having a corpse on his second floor was completely different from having a moving corpse on his second floor. No one wanted a dangerous and unstable element at their bedside.\n\n\"Hey, big sister, how about you wake up, and we have a chat?\"\n\nZhou Ze leaned against the edge of the freezer and said.\n\nHe hoped that the female corpse would open her eyes at this moment, either fight him or talk to him. They could agree to disagree, at least tear open the paper curtain, and stop playing mysterious.\n\nHowever, the female corpse remained unmoved, still lying there.\n\nZhou Ze took a deep breath, then reached in and began to roam his hand over the female corpse's body. He even desecrated some sensitive areas,\n\nHe only hoped that the female corpse would be unable to tolerate such \"impertinence\" and angrily open her eyes.\n\nUnfortunately,\n\nThe female corpse still lay there, cold and unmoving.\n\nZhou Ze estimated that even if he truly took off his pants and went up, the female corpse would still maintain this state.\n\nWithdrawing his hand, Zhou Ze pursed his lips, feeling somewhat at a loss.\n\nYou can't wake a person who is pretending to sleep.\n\nThe next moment, Zhou Ze's fingernails began to lengthen. Immediately after, Zhou Ze thrust his index fingernail into the female corpse's arm and slowly applied pressure.\n\n\"Pfft...\"\n\nThe fingernail, like a sharp blade, pierced the female corpse's arm. No blood flowed from the female corpse; instead, a cloud of black mist began to emerge. For a moment, the entire second-floor room became eerily ghostly.\n\n\"Zhou Ze, what are you doing!\"\n\nXu Qinglang's shout came from downstairs.\n\nImmediately after, Xu Qinglang rushed up to the second floor without a second thought. Zhou Ze withdrew his hand at this moment; his fingernails seemed to be coated with a layer of frost, feeling a bit stiff and a little painful.\n\n\"You're crazy!\" Xu Qinglang looked at the narrow wound on the female corpse's arm and roared, \"Do you know that when a *hanba* appears, it causes a thousand miles of drought!\n\nThis female corpse certainly can't compare to a *hanba*, but if the aura stored within her leaks out, it's enough to cause a plague in Tongcheng!\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't rush to deal with the exasperated Xu Qinglang. Instead, he continued to stare at the female corpse's arm. The wound he had just pierced was slowly healing.\n\nThis female corpse,\n\nAside from her body being cold and lacking breath, everything else was truly indistinguishable from a living person. In fact, her body had even more vitality than a living person's!\n\n\"Hey, this thing was dug up by both of us. If it causes any trouble, I'll also be in trouble, lose lifespan, and even bring misfortune to my descendants!\n\nThe same goes for you. If you make a big mess, even if you're a Ghost Messenger now, you won't get off easy.\"\n\nThe slight trace of black aura that had just leaked from the female corpse slowly dissipated. Because the amount was small, and only Zhou Ze and Xu Qinglang were present, their resistance was stronger, so it wouldn't cause any harm.\n\nBut what had just leaked out was merely the tip of the iceberg of what was inside the female corpse.\n\nZhou Ze sighed, \"Xu Qinglang.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Why don't you keep your wife at your place? Your parents just left, right? Let her keep you company. After all, she was married to you with a grand procession.\"\n\n\"What, what do you mean by that?\" Xu Qinglang was baffled.\n\n\"This thing, she can move on her own,\" Zhou Ze explained the reason. \"She went downstairs today, by herself, and even drank some water.\"\n\nXu Qinglang's face also showed a look of horror, and his mouth twitched as he retreated two steps.\n\nHe had said last night that once this corpse had an accident, it would turn into a zombie, and not the weak, \"oo-wah-oo-wah\" brainless types from Western movies that could be easily headshotted, but a true \"flesh-eating\" zombie that might even possess some supernatural powers.\n\n\"Thanks, I'm getting used to being alone.\"\n\nWhat a joke, how could Xu Qinglang take this hot potato, no, this hot atomic bomb?\n\n\"Don't you have some talismans? Why don't you stick some on her?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"The talismans on my two swords would only have a counterproductive effect if I put them on her, irritating her,\" Xu Qinglang said with a bitter smile.\n\n\"Then what do we do?\" Zhou Ze felt a headache. \"Transport her to the sea and throw her away? Even if she turns into a zombie, at most she'll go cause trouble for the Dragon King.\"\n\n\"She can't leave Tongcheng. She was a Tongcheng person in life, and after death, she's a Tongcheng ghost. If her body leaves the Tongcheng area, she'll still run into problems. Otherwise, why didn't Lady Bai deal with her before going to the underworld after achieving spiritual enlightenment?\"\n\n\"Slap!\"\n\nZhou Ze directly closed the lid of the freezer. Clearly, this problem had no solution.\n\nCan't burn her,\n\nCan't transport her,\n\nAfraid of an accident if she's thrown somewhere else,\n\nCan he only keep her in his room and watch her at his own risk?\n\nZhou Ze now seemed to somewhat understand why the little loli \"biu-ed\" her way to hell. Being a civil servant in the underworld wasn't that easy either.\n\nEven within the system, those working at the grassroots level are always the most miserable.\n\nJust like himself right now.\n\n\"Look on the bright side. I'll make you more plum juice tonight,\" Xu Qinglang comforted.\n\n\"And then?\"\n\n\"Then I'm moving. Didn't I say I was going to open a shop in the county below? I plan to accelerate my plan.\" Xu Qinglang had the attitude of sacrificing others for his own benefit.\n\nAfter locking the freezer, Zhou Ze and Xu Qinglang walked downstairs together.\n\nXu Qinglang again exhorted Zhou Ze not to mess around, then returned to the noodle shop. He was probably busy with his own affairs just now, but when he sensed the leakage of evil aura, he got a fright and rushed over.\n\nZhou Ze sat behind the counter,\n\nHe shook the water glass in front of him.\n\nHis phone rang. He took it out and saw it was an unknown number.\n\n\"Hello, may I speak to Mr. Xu Le? This is Chongchuan Traffic Police Department.\"\n\n\"Yes, that's me, what's wrong?\"\n\n\"Is Xu Dachuan your relative? He was just in a car accident and is currently being transported to People's Hospital.\"\n\n\"Okay, I'll be right there.\"\n\nZhou Ze closed his eyes and let out a dissatisfied hum. He was already annoyed enough, and now something else had happened. Xu Dachuan should be the uncle he treated to lunch today.\n\nBut he couldn't just not go. Although the person came to the city specifically to visit Xu Le, not him, Zhou Ze had given all the local produce he brought to Xu Qinglang for ingredients.\n\nZhou Ze looked at his fingernails,\n\nIf Xu Dachuan was really in life-threatening danger,\n\nShould he save him or not?\n\nThinking of the severe backlash he suffered last time after saving the little loli, a shiver ran down Zhou Ze's spine. Forget it, he hoped he wasn't seriously injured.\n\nHe walked out of the store, hailed a taxi, and in the car, Zhou Ze sent Xu Qinglang a WeChat message, indicating that he was going out and Xu Qinglang should watch the shop.\n\nBy the time he arrived at People's Hospital, it was already eight in the evening. Zhou Ze asked at the front desk and learned that Xu Dachuan was not in life-threatening danger and had already been transferred to a ward. He felt relieved.\n\nPushing open the ward door, Zhou Ze entered and was surprised to see Doctor Lin standing by Xu Dachuan's bed, chatting with him.\n\nOne of Xu Dachuan's legs was propped up; it was likely broken. He also had a few scrapes on his face, but his spirits were good. He was quite energetic while chatting with his nephew's wife.\n\nZhou Ze's gaze met Doctor Lin's as he approached.\n\n\"Thank you, I appreciate it,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"It's nothing,\" Doctor Lin stood up and explained, \"I wasn't home during the day, I'm sorry.\"\n\n\"It's fine,\" Zhou Ze waved his hand.\n\nDoctor Lin left the ward. Zhou Ze chatted with his uncle for a while longer. The long-distance bus had crashed before even leaving the city. Xu Dachuan was just unlucky, falling and breaking his left leg. The other passengers only had minor scrapes.\n\nXu Dachuan didn't seem to care much about his injuries. Instead, he kept repeating, \"My nephew's wife is still a good person.\"\n\nZhou Ze smiled, told Xu Dachuan to rest well, and then walked out of the ward.\n\nDoctor Lin was currently standing by the front desk, where a female nurse was sitting, seemingly unwell.\n\nZhou Ze was about to leave, but he had to say goodbye to Doctor Lin. The two hadn't contacted each other for a long time, but appearances still needed to be kept up.\n\nHowever, as soon as he got closer, Zhou Ze heard the faint cry of a baby, very weak, like a kitten.\n\nZhou Ze initially didn't think much of it, but as he got closer to Doctor Lin, he noticed the baby's cry was clearer.\n\nCould it be that Doctor Lin was being haunted by a little ghost?\n\nZhou Ze was still observing, deliberately standing to the side behind Doctor Lin and looking.\n\n\"It's alright, Sister Lin. My stomach has been bad, an old problem. I'll take some medicine later and I'll be fine.\" The little nurse thanked Doctor Lin for her concern.\n\n\"Take good care of yourself,\" Doctor Lin comforted.\n\nAt this moment, Doctor Lin noticed Zhou Ze standing behind her, somewhat... \"sneaky.\"\n\n\"You...\"\n\n\"Wait a moment.\" Zhou Ze raised his hand, listened carefully again, and finally looked at the little nurse's belly.\n\nThe sound wasn't coming from Doctor Lin; it was coming from inside the little nurse.\n\nZhou Ze, who used to be a doctor, immediately understood what was happening.\n\n\"You're pregnant,\" Zhou Ze said to the little nurse. At this moment, Zhou Ze couldn't afford to be subtle or worry about politeness.\n\n\"What?\" The little nurse looked bewildered.\n\n\"What nonsense are you talking about? Xiao Chen isn't even married and doesn't have a boyfriend,\" Doctor Lin glared at her \"husband.\"\n\n\"I don't know who you got pregnant with, but you'd better go get checked out now. Also, a word of caution, you're at risk of miscarriage,\" Zhou Ze said with certainty.\n\nThe fetus was very unstable, and the faint crying indicated the instinctive sadness of an unborn little one. This was also why Zhou Ze didn't consider the other person's feelings.\n\nA human life was at stake.\n\nNurse Xiao Chen immediately stood up, her face showing anxiety. Clearly, she hadn't known she was pregnant before, but she knew she had engaged in \"high-risk\" behavior, making conception very likely.\n\nDoctor Lin also understood and quickly rushed off with Xiao Chen.\n\nZhou Ze stretched, thinking it was a pity that Xu Le studied civil engineering. If Xu Le had studied medicine, then he would probably soon become the most famous doctor not only in Tongcheng but throughout the entire Su Province.\n\nHe went downstairs, bought a box of milk and some daily necessities for Xu Dachuan, delivered them to Xu Dachuan's ward, and then came out again. This time, he really intended to leave, as the person at home truly made him uneasy.\n\nCoincidentally, Doctor Lin emerged from the elevator, her expression somewhat solemn.\n\n\"What's wrong?\"\n\n\"How did you know Xiao Chen was pregnant?\" Doctor Lin asked.\n\n\"I studied some traditional Chinese medicine,\" Zhou Ze lied. \"How's the situation over there?\"\n\n\"Xiao Chen intends to keep the baby, but whether she can keep it is hard to say. She didn't pay attention at all before,\" Doctor Lin said, then turned to Zhou Ze. \"Are you going back? Wait for me to change my clothes, I'll drive you.\"\n\nAnd so, Zhou Ze left the hospital in Doctor Lin's Cayenne.\n\nThroughout the journey, neither of them spoke much. Their \"marital\" relationship had plummeted to freezing point due to the previous incident.\n\nAs they neared the bookstore, Zhou Ze felt he should find a topic to chat about, otherwise, it would be too stifling. He said, \"You posted quite a few *Hanfu* photos in your Moments. Do you like them a lot?\"\n\n\"Mm,\" Doctor Lin nodded.\n\n\"I like them quite a bit too,\" Zhou Ze touched the tip of his nose. \"Do you have any *Hanfu*? Would you wear one for me sometime?\"\n\nDoctor Lin didn't answer, seemingly disinclined to engage in the topic.\n\nThe car stopped at the bookstore entrance. Zhou Ze got out, and to his surprise, Doctor Lin also got out, seemingly intending to enter the bookstore with him.\n\nHeh, this woman is really strong, isn't she afraid of being \"that-ed\" by me again like last time?\n\n\"I'm going to get some magazines to read at work,\" Doctor Lin said.\n\n\"Mm,\" Zhou Ze nodded. He knew this was Doctor Lin's indirect way of expressing a desire for reconciliation. This woman truly wasn't easy.\n\nIn Lu Xun's style, it would be: This woman, once again, bowed to feudal rites, that is, to this nominal \"husband.\"\n\nIn ancient times, Doctor Lin would be a typical pitiable woman deeply poisoned and persecuted by feudal rites.\n\nPushing open the bookstore door, Zhou Ze was somewhat surprised to find Xu Qinglang sitting on a plastic stool, reading a book. But the book in his hands was clearly upside down. What in the world was he reading?\n\nXu Qinglang managed a smile at Zhou Ze, but it was uglier than a cry.\n\nDoctor Lin took a couple more glances at this man, who was more attractive than most women, then walked directly towards the bookshelf to pick out magazines.\n\nZhou Ze offered Xu Qinglang a cigarette and whispered, \"What's wrong with you? You're so distracted.\"\n\nJust then,\n\nFootsteps sounded from the stairwell. A woman dressed in an ancient white gown gracefully descended, her posture elegant and naturally tender.\n\nWhen she saw Zhou Ze,\n\nShe bowed slightly,\n\nAnd said respectfully:\n\n\"You're back.\"\n\nThe magazine Doctor Lin had just held,\n\nFell to the floor,\n\nAnd at the same time, she said coldly:\n\n\"It seems, I don't need to wear it for you to see.\"",

    "content": "\"It seems I won't need to model it for you.\"\n\nDoctor Lin was indeed a very traditional woman, but not the ancient kind who wouldn't dare utter a word even if her husband took concubines, fearing a reputation for jealousy.\n\nShe had her compromises, and she also had her principles.\n\nShe could force herself to accept Zhou Ze's previous transgression against her, and she could slowly force herself to accept \"Xu Le\" (Zhou Ze) becoming increasingly autonomous and assertive.\n\nBut she could not accept Zhou Ze having an affair; that was her bottom line.\n\nShe was angry.\n\nExtremely, furiously angry.\n\nShe even wanted to turn around and leave.\n\nAt that moment, Doctor Lin hadn't left because she was waiting for Zhou Ze's response. Regardless, Zhou Ze should give a clear stance, and then things between them could finally be resolved.\n\nEven if she had to face her mother's accusations and her father's rage over her marriage disgracing the family name, she would accept it.\n\nHowever, Zhou Ze did not respond.\n\nNo explanation.\n\nHe seemed to be tacitly admitting it.\n\nThe light in Doctor Lin's eyes immediately dimmed.\n\nDid he not even need to explain anymore?\n\nIn truth, Doctor Lin had misunderstood Zhou Ze. Zhou Ze hadn't reacted at all, nor had he even noticed Doctor Lin's feelings.\n\nFrom Zhou Ze's perspective, he felt a shiver of terror run down his spine.\n\nThis female corpse,\n\nhad actually come alive!\n\nAnd it wasn't as simple as just coming down for a drink during the day. She had actually walked brazenly in front of him, speaking to him, interacting with him!\n\nRecalling his \"finger exploration\" on her body earlier to \"wake\" her up,\n\nZhou Ze immediately felt an urge to rush out of the shop and flee as far as possible.\n\nNow he could understand why Xu Qinglang was sitting there like an idiot, holding his book upside down. He simply didn't dare to move!\n\nThe scene fell into an awkward silence.\n\n\"Hello.\" The female corpse smiled, and after greeting Zhou Ze, much like a Korean or Japanese wife greeting her husband at the entrance with \"Welcome home,\" she deliberately looked at Lin Wanqiu with a playful gaze.\n\n\"Hello.\" Doctor Lin responded coldly.\n\nZhou Ze took a deep breath at this moment. He reached out and pulled Xu Qinglang up, forcing him to stand.\n\n\"Wanqiu, let me introduce you. This is my good friend and neighbor, the owner of the noodle shop next door who has twenty-odd demolished houses—Xu Qinglang!\"\n\n\"Hello.\" Xu Qinglang said to Lin Wanqiu, but his gaze remained fixed on the female corpse beside him.\n\nHe was truly as delicate as could be, like a startled little quail.\n\n\"Hello.\" Lin Wanqiu.\n\n\"This one...\" Zhou Ze pointed at the female corpse, \"is Xu Qinglang's wife.\"\n\n\"Right... what?\" Xu Qinglang was stunned, but the next moment, Zhou Ze applied a little force, and Xu Qinglang stumbled, leaning directly against the female corpse.\n\n\"Yes, this is my wife. Her surname is Bai, and her name is Bai Su Z... Bai Susu.\" Xu Qinglang looked at Lin Wanqiu, while one hand casually and intimately rested on the female corpse's shoulder.\n\nIn an instant,\n\nthe same icy coldness as last night stimulated his very soul.\n\n\"Ah... oh oh oh oh... phew phew phew... uh...\"\n\nXu Qinglang shivered several times before releasing his hand, saying, \"Haha, wifey, you're so soft. I love touching you,\n\nhahahahahaha!\"\n\n\"You two continue. Wanqiu, come out for a moment. I have something to tell you.\"\n\nWith that, Zhou Ze directly took Lin Wanqiu's hand and, regardless of her willingness, pulled her out of the bookstore.\n\n\"Oh, Xu Le, I suddenly remembered something very important I need to tell you too, like how I have too many houses and want to give you one.\"\n\nXu Qinglang waved his hand, making a move to follow Zhou Ze out,\n\nThe female corpse stood still beside him, elegant and serene.\n\nHowever, Xu Qinglang only felt a terrifying chill wrap around his neck, as if stepping one more foot outside would instantly tear him apart.\n\nXu Qinglang wisely chose to stop, then chuckled,\n\n\"Don't be angry, wifey. How could I give away houses? We'll wait until the country allows twenty children and then we'll pass them all down to our kids. You'll even get a 'Heroic Mother' medal then.\"\n\nXu Qinglang's face twisted in bitterness as he sat back down on the plastic stool.\n\nZhou Ze pulled Doctor Lin's hand and walked out of the bookstore, all the way to where Doctor Lin's car was parked.\n\n\"What is it, speak.\" Doctor Lin asked.\n\n\"You seem to have gained some weight recently. Don't eat late-night snacks.\"\n\nAfter saying that, Zhou Ze pushed Doctor Lin towards the car,\n\n\"Hurry up and drive home. If you have nothing to do tonight, go for a run or skip rope.\"\n\n\"What exactly is going on?\" Doctor Lin grabbed Zhou Ze, who was about to turn back into the bookstore.\n\n\"Don't worry about it, just go.\" Zhou Ze urged.\n\nDoctor Lin said nothing more, got into her car, started the engine, took one last deep look at Zhou Ze, and drove away.\n\nZhou Ze let out a long sigh, then squatted by the roadside and lit a cigarette.\n\nHonestly, he didn't want to go back to the bookstore, and his理性 told him that leaving with Doctor Lin was the wisest choice. But there was no alternative; he had dug the female corpse out of that plot of land himself.\n\nZhou Ze had no saintly compassion; he was actually very afraid of trouble. But no matter what, even ignoring his current temporary identity as a ghost messenger, if the female corpse were to truly run rampant and cause trouble in Tongcheng, in his hometown, he would genuinely feel guilty.\n\nAs for Xu Qinglang, who was still in the bookstore,\n\nOh,\n\nXu Qinglang was still in the bookstore. He almost forgot.\n\nStill cheap*,\n\nEven dead,\n\nStill cheap.\n\nHe exhaled a puff of smoke, tossed the cigarette butt on the ground, stepped on it firmly, and then Zhou Ze walked straight into the bookstore.\n\nAs he pushed open the bookstore door, a black light began to swirl in Zhou Ze's eyes, and his fingernails elongated.\n\n\"You're back again.\"\n\nThe female corpse still stood there, graceful, but the mockery in her eyes was even clearer than when Doctor Lin was present.\n\n\"Get back upstairs and lie down properly.\"\n\nZhou Ze pointed at the female corpse and scolded her. Whether he could win or not, putting on a show of power was always a good idea.\n\n\"Do you prefer Durex or Jissbon? I have both. I'll go get them for you.\"\n\nXu Qinglang said, trying to stand up and leave again.\n\nHe regretted it greatly.\n\nHe should have moved out during the day. Why did he have to stay here?\n\nHowever, the female corpse directly reached out and grabbed Xu Qinglang.\n\nXu Qinglang let out a delicate cry from his throat: \"Heaven and Earth without end, Profound Heart Righteous Law!\"\n\nA bronze mirror appeared in Xu Qinglang's hand, pointed at the female corpse.\n\nBut at that very instant, the bronze mirror shattered, and Xu Qinglang was swept backward, crashing into the bookstore wall.\n\nThe might of the female corpse,\n\nwas terrifying!\n\nZhou Ze directly charged forward. This was his first real fight, and he was unsure of himself.\n\nHowever, the female corpse specifically stared at Zhou Ze's hands, then began to retreat, not daring to take a single step forward.\n\n\"Cough cough...\"\n\nXu Qinglang picked himself up from the ground, one hand on his waist. He had initially thought Zhou Ze would also be swept away like him, but then he saw Zhou Ze relentlessly pushing the female corpse back. His heart immediately felt unbalanced.\n\n\"Damn, no going easy!\"\n\nFinally, the female corpse was pushed back to the wall, but the next moment, she finally became enraged and lunged at Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze instinctively reached out and grabbed forward.\n\n\"Crash...\"\n\nWith a crisp sound,\n\nthe female corpse was slammed heavily against the wall, causing a slight indentation in the wall.\n\nThe white dress on the female corpse's chest was torn open as she rolled onto the ground. If she hadn't been wearing undergarments, she would have been completely exposed.\n\n\"Damn, so fierce!\" Xu Qinglang watched, dumbfounded.\n\nAt the same time, remembering how he had once planned to force Zhou Ze to reveal the secret of his ability to borrow a corpse to return to life, he felt a sudden wave of fear.\n\nThis neighbor of his really hadn't fought before. Xu Qinglang knew that Zhou Ze's previous fear and apprehension of the female corpse were absolutely not feigned.\n\nThe reason was simple:\n\nThis neighbor, he himself didn't know he was so good at fighting!\n\nIndeed, Zhou Ze wasn't a fighter.\n\nGrowing up in an orphanage, that orphanage was clean, and the children had good relationships, understanding and encouraging each other. Later, he became a doctor, a job that saved lives, and he had no interest in boxing or mixed martial arts in his spare time.\n\nTherefore,\n\nwhen Zhou Ze actually had to fight now, he himself felt a bit clumsy.\n\nBecause the female ghost was afraid of his fingernails, Zhou Ze's fighting style resembled a shrew scratching at faces with her nails, completely lacking any ghost messenger's bearing.\n\nIt was far, far less cool than the little loli opening her mouth and murmuring, \"The Underworld has order, the Yellow Springs can be crossed.\"\n\nBut now, none of that was an issue. Effectiveness was key.\n\nFor Zhou Ze, who had walked back earlier with the mindset of being torn apart by the female corpse, the current situation was truly wonderful.\n\n\"Ah!\"\n\nThe female corpse was flung away again. Every time she got close to Zhou Ze's fingernails, the black energy from the nails would instantly pierce her body, causing her immense damage.\n\n\"Heaven and Earth without end, Profound Heart Righteous Law!\"\n\nTwo talismans appeared in Xu Qinglang's hand, both stuck to the ground. For a moment, the chill in the bookstore seemed to lessen. And each time the female corpse landed, the talismans would tremble, and the ground beneath her would feel hot, as if a ball of fire was burning.\n\nThe female corpse's gaze sharpened. She dared not face Zhou Ze again and chose to phase through the side. Her speed was incredibly fast, attempting to shatter the bookstore door's glass and escape.\n\nHowever, Zhou Ze was now getting more and more into the zone.\n\nAs the saying goes, if you haven't eaten pork, haven't you at least heard a pig grunt?\n\nFrom Hong Kong movies in his childhood to later Wuxia and cultivation films, everyone had seen the general gist of things.\n\nZhou Ze crossed his arms, his dark eyes looking towards the door.\n\nWhen the female corpse attempted to shatter the glass door to escape, black light suddenly appeared on the glass door, as if scratches made by fingernails.\n\nThe female corpse let out a shrill scream, bounced back heavily, and landed on the ground.\n\nZhou Ze slowly walked forward, simultaneously regulating his breathing.\n\nHowever, the female corpse, having been \"captured\" back, immediately knelt on the ground, one finger pointing at Zhou Ze, and one hand covering her face,\n\n\"Ying ying ying ying ying...\"\n\n\"I'll beat you to death, you whiny monster!\"\n\nXu Qinglang pulled out another talisman from his hand.\n\nBut the female corpse began pointing at Zhou Ze, crying out in extreme grievance:\n\n\"You touched me, and you hit me. You're not human!\"\n\nZhou Ze's mouth twitched instinctively.\n\nThe female corpse, who had just brought immense pressure and deterrence to him and Xu Qinglang, suddenly acting like this truly felt like a breakdown in character.\n\nBut Zhou Ze still said, seriously and deeply:\n\n\"I am a ghost.\"\n\n——————\n\nPS: Please vote with recommendation tickets, throw them all at me. Long just found out our new book rank one was surpassed.\n\nThen, let's take it back.\n\n---\n* The word used is 贱 (jiàn), which can mean \"cheap\" but also \"inferior,\" \"lowly,\" \"worthless,\" or even \"shameless.\" In this context, it carries a sense of \"still annoying\" or \"still a pain in the ass\" despite being dead.",

    "content": "“I only meant to tease you, Officer. Why did you have to be so cruel?\n\nYou truly are a heartless, ungrateful man. You touched me, you made advances;\n\nYet you turn around and deny it, and then you take out your anger on me because of your original wife.”\n\nThe female corpse wept to herself, miserably. Coupled with her white dress, now nearly in tatters, she looked even more pitiful.\n\nPeople often say that those who live to be seventy or eighty are almost like foxes, but this female corpse had lived for two hundred years, enduring the vicissitudes of life.\n\nZhou Ze ignored the female corpse’s “lament” and turned his head to Xu Qinglang.\n\n“Can she be killed?” Zhou Ze asked.\n\n“…………” The female corpse.\n\nXu Qinglang shook his head, then nodded.\n\n“What does that mean?” Zhou Ze asked.\n\n“The malevolent energy within her is an issue. If she were to self-detonate that energy in her last moments and it leaked out, it would certainly affect innocent people nearby,” Xu Qinglang explained. “That would be very troublesome.”\n\n“Indeed.”\n\nThe female corpse echoed, having given up on trying to play on Zhou Ze’s emotions. The most heartless are the ungrateful, and clearly, Zhou Ze had now been blacklisted in her mind.\n\n“But she wouldn’t dare to pull that stunt. Otherwise, her soul would already be in Hell. If she causes any heinous trouble in the mortal realm, she would also be punished in Hell.\n\nSo, she can still be killed.”\n\nXu Qinglang held a cigarette in his mouth. Before, he had been flustered like a quail about to be forced, but now, with the ‘Cosmic Burst’ Zhou Ze beside him, he could enjoy the show and make sarcastic remarks.\n\n“Don’t kill me, don’t kill me! She is her, I am me. We are two different people!”\n\nThe female corpse hastily cried out. She could see that these two men genuinely intended to use a permanent solution on her.\n\nAll intelligent beings possess a survival instinct, and the female corpse was no exception.\n\nA thousand sails pass by a sunken boat, and countless trees sprout before a decaying one;\n\nThe female corpse was not, in fact, Madam Bai. To a certain extent, she was an independent life, a “spiritual intelligence” born from Madam Bai’s physical body after two hundred years. However, the female corpse and Madam Bai still had countless intricate connections.\n\nXu Qinglang was right. The female corpse dared not do anything excessive in the mortal realm. Even if she died, she would not choose to act recklessly and cause Madam Bai to suffer punishment in Hell.\n\nZhou Ze squatted down in front of the female corpse. “Then what did you mean earlier? Was it just for fun?”\n\nThe female corpse nodded.\n\n“Heh heh.” Zhou Ze chuckled twice. Thinking about it now, he had been a bit too “young” and inexperienced as a ghost messenger, which was why he had agreed to Madam Bai’s request.\n\n“Is there no way to subdue her?” Zhou Ze asked.\n\n“Extracting a wisp of her zombie soul blood would allow you to control her, but she has to willingly give it to you,” Xu Qinglang suggested from the side.\n\nThe female corpse suddenly lifted her head, her eyes flashing with intense hatred as she stared fixedly at Xu Qinglang, as if at this moment, Xu Qinglang was her greatest enemy.\n\n“Either die, or hand over your soul blood. You choose,” Xu Qinglang said with a smile.\n\n“You… choose for yourself,” Zhou Ze also looked at the female corpse. Clearly, he agreed with Xu Qinglang’s suggestion.\n\nZhou Ze had a clean freak, and he didn’t want the female corpse to inexplicably come down and clean his cup with her tongue again.\n\n“Alright, I’ll give it to you.” The female corpse took a deep breath, as if to bury her current reluctance and anger. Then, she closed her eyes. Immediately, a red, worm-like strand emerged from the center of her forehead.\n\nZhou Ze reached out and pinched the strand with his fingernails, then pulled it out and placed it in his palm. It was somewhat warm, a little damp, and slippery.\n\nAfter handing over her soul blood, the female corpse’s spirit suddenly became extremely listless. She almost fainted, barely managing to stay upright.\n\n“Go clean yourself up in the bathroom and then lie down upstairs. From today onwards, you are not allowed to step out of the bookstore without my permission,” Zhou Ze warned.\n\n“Yes, Officer.” The female corpse lowered her head, her posture very submissive. With her soul blood in his grasp, she had no choice but to bow.\n\n…………\n\n*Slap.*\n\nZhou Ze tossed the medicinal wine bottle onto the table. He was clearly applying medicinal wine to Xu Qinglang, but it sounded as if he were doing something quite disgusting.\n\n“You apply it yourself.”\n\n“Don’t be like that! You weren’t injured, but I was thrown against a wall. I have so many bruises, don’t you have any sympathy?” Xu Qinglang grew more agitated as he spoke. He continued, “Zhou Ze, ever since you came here, haven’t you noticed that I’ve been having bad luck?”\n\n“That’s fate,” Zhou Ze said, refusing to take the blame. “By the way, that incantation you chanted earlier, I found it very familiar.”\n\n*Heaven and Earth without limits, Profound Heart Orthodox Law.*\n\n“It’s from a TV show. I thought it sounded good, so I used it. It doesn’t actually help with casting spells at all,” Xu Qinglang admitted honestly.\n\n“Like adding a BGM for yourself?”\n\n“Heh…………” Xu Qinglang rolled his eyes, picking up the medicinal wine and applying it himself. “There’s some plum juice in the kitchen. Take it with you. I won’t open tomorrow morning; I need more rest.”\n\n“I’m going back to rest.” Zhou Ze stood up, took the plum juice, and bid farewell. After returning to the bookstore, he went straight up to the second floor.\n\nThe female corpse, obediently, had washed herself clean and was lying in the freezer, wearing Zhou Ze’s clothes.\n\nThe white shirt was a bit too big for her, hanging down and covering the curve of her backside. She wasn’t wearing trousers, and her legs were crossed as she lay there, her eyes alluring.\n\nZhou Ze tapped the side of the freezer. “I remember Madam Bai saying she died before she was married.”\n\nBecause of this, Madam Bai should, in theory, have been a virgin. However, the female corpse before him seemed a bit flirtatious.\n\n“That’s because she didn’t tell you she had an affair with a poor scholar before her marriage, and her father found out, feeling it disgraced the family, and forcibly drowned her.”\n\n“Oh, so, she’s an experienced old hand?”\n\n“Indeed. Do you know how much effort and care she put into making sure I didn’t look as terrifying as a drowned person?”\n\n“Women, after all, love beauty.” Zhou Ze shook his head. “Go to sleep.”\n\nWith that, Zhou Ze placed a pillow by the freezer and lay down.\n\nWith the female corpse beside him, the chill emanating from her made him feel very comfortable, even more so than lying inside the freezer.\n\nHe slept soundly that night. When he woke up the next morning, Zhou Ze opened his eyes and saw a pair of long legs slowly swaying in front of him, even the curve of her instep was just right.\n\nIf she were wearing stockings or high heels…\n\nAnd facing the female corpse, Zhou Ze could be more at ease.\n\nNeither of them was human, so there was no need for the hypocrisy of pretense. It was simpler this way.\n\n“If you can’t hold back, I can lie down. I know you actually want to do that kind of thing.\n\nHolding it in for too long isn’t good, especially since your body isn’t original. Otherwise, there really could be problems, you know.”\n\nThe female corpse spoke very openly, and then she smiled, saying, “Don’t worry, I won’t get pregnant.”\n\nZhou Ze went downstairs to wash up, then started cooking instant noodles. With everything ready, Zhou Ze took out the plum juice and, with great difficulty, finished his morning meal with the instant noodles.\n\n“It must be painful, eating human food,” the female corpse said, sitting on the stair step, turning her face to look at Zhou Ze.\n\n“None of your business.”\n\n“You’re already dead, yet you insist on living like a human. Don’t you get tired?”\n\n“You’re talking a bit too much,” Zhou Ze frowned slightly.\n\n“You said yesterday I’m not allowed to leave the bookstore. So what else can I do besides talk to you?”\n\nZhou Ze picked up the mop and broom from behind the counter and tossed them all to the female corpse.\n\n“Clean up.”\n\n……………………\n\nThe sun was beautiful today. The female corpse knelt on the bookstore’s tiled floor, wiping it with a rag. Zhou Ze, meanwhile, had moved a plastic stool outside the shop and was basking in the sun.\n\nIt wasn’t until noon that Xu Qinglang opened his shop door and came out. He took a cigarette from Zhou Ze, glanced at the scene inside the shop, and smiled:\n\n“You’ve trained her well.”\n\nZhou Ze continued to squint, enjoying the sunlight.\n\nXu Qinglang exhaled a smoke ring, then, as if he remembered something, said:\n\n“Your signboard is well-made, it has a good vibe. It makes my place next door look inadequate. I’m also planning to get a custom signboard.”\n\n“Pretentious?” Zhou Ze chuckled.\n\n“Is that a problem?” Xu Qinglang raised an eyebrow. “If I display my twenty-something property deeds, who can say I’m not refined?”\n\nZhou Ze shook his head helplessly.\n\n“Come on, help me brainstorm. I think your ‘*Gū wàng tīng zhī, rú shì wén*’¹ is pretty good. I plan for the horizontal scroll of my couplet to be ‘*Rén shēng rú mèng*’². How’s that? It sounds stylish.\n\nBut for the couplet, I’d like something related to ‘eating,’ to fit my restaurant, right?\n\nI haven’t thought of anything good. Do you have any suggestions?”\n\nZhou Ze pondered for a moment. “Do you really want to hear it?”\n\n“Just say it,” Xu Qinglang urged.\n\nZhou Ze looked at the female corpse inside the shop and said:\n\n“Humans eat dirt all their lives,\nDirt eats humans once.\nHorizontal scroll:\nLife is but a dream.”\n\n---\n¹ *Gū wàng tīng zhī, rú shì wén*: An idiom that can be translated as “Hear it as you wish; thus I have heard.” It implies that the speaker is relaying information as they heard it, without necessarily endorsing its truth, or that the listener can take it with a grain of salt. In this context, it likely adds an air of detached wisdom or philosophical depth to the bookstore.\n² *Rén shēng rú mèng*: “Life is but a dream.”",

    "content": "\"Here, have a taste, the new version of Sour Plum Juice.\"\n\nXu Qinglang placed a cup on Zhou Ze's counter. This sour plum juice looked richer in color than before. He shook it in his hand, as if holding a glass of wine.\n\n\"What's different?\" Zhou Ze asked before drinking.\n\n\"The flavor is richer, a bit like old Huangjiu, with a kick that comes later. It'll keep you from wolfing down your food like before, improving your quality of life.\"\n\n\"Heh, how *sweet*.\"¹\n\nThe female corpse, who was organizing the bookshelf nearby, let out a sour remark.\n\nZhou Ze took a sip. Unlike the sour plum juice he'd had before, this one was somewhat sweet and refreshing, with a pleasant aftertaste. The flavor was excellent.\n\nHowever, it didn't seem to be the feeling he was looking for.\n\nBut just after he had tasted it for a short while, Zhou Ze felt a sharp pang in his stomach.\n\n\"Hiss...\"\n\nHis body also began to tremble uncontrollably.\n\nThat lingering sourness...\n\nSo potent.\n\nHis fingers curled slightly, then slowly unfurled. Zhou Ze nodded, very satisfied.\n\n\"You've thought this through,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Don't mention it.\" Xu Qinglang smiled slightly. \"I plan to make this one of my signature side dishes. It's a shame that people who like this flavor are probably quite few.\"\n\n\"Mm.\" Zhou Ze agreed with that.\n\n\"Creak.\"\n\nThe bookstore door opened, and a group of students walked in. There were quite a few of them, seven or eight, all looking like \"good kids.\"\n\n\"Boss, what's the WiFi password?\" a girl asked.\n\nZhou Ze pointed to the wall, where it was written.\n\n\"Phew...\"\n\nThe students each found plastic stools and sat down. Then the girl took some homework out of her backpack and distributed it for the others to copy.\n\nWith the winter break about to end, this was a pretty normal sight.\n\nZhou Ze naturally wouldn't be so bored as to go educate these kids about the meaning of learning or the drawbacks of copying others' homework. He tapped his finger on the counter, and the female corpse, understanding, came over to pour Zhou Ze a cup of warm water.\n\nThe leading girl walked over to the bookshelf, casually flipping through books. After choosing a few, she walked up to Zhou Ze. \"How much?\"\n\n\"Ninety-five,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\n\"Here, keep the change.\"\n\nThe girl was generous, throwing down a hundred-yuan note.\n\nZhou Ze took the money and said nothing more.\n\nBy about five in the afternoon, this batch of students had finished copying their homework and left. The bookstore returned to its usual quietness.\n\nXu Qinglang wasn't in the shop; he had gone to custom-order a plaque. Of course, he wouldn't order one like Zhou Ze had suggested:\n\n\"Man eats earth a lifetime, earth eats man once.\"\n\nBecause anyone with a normal brain could tell that such a plaque was not suitable for a dining place; it was more fitting for the sides of a grave.\n\nThe female corpse worked quite efficiently. Today, she cleaned both the first and second floors. Apart from occasionally posing suggestively to show off her charm, she basically showed no other flaws.\n\nShe didn't say where she was going, and Zhou Ze didn't ask.\n\nOf course, Zhou Ze remembered Madam Bai's reminder: \"Next Cold Clothes Festival, cremate the corpse with bamboo and wood.\"\n\nZhou Ze wasn't sure if Madam Bai knew that her corpse had already developed sentience.\n\nIf she knew, yet still entrusted it to him, and at the same time, told him the method and time to cremate her, what did that mean?\n\nLast night, the female corpse also admitted that even if Zhou Ze were to kill her, she would not *bingjie*² on her own, letting the malevolent energy escape and harm innocents, thereby implicating Madam Bai in Hell.\n\nHowever,\n\nMadam Bai seemed to simply want to cleanly resolve this problem.\n\nFrom this perspective,\n\nThis female corpse, whom he treated as a maid,\n\nwas actually a pitiful person.\n\n\"What's your name?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"My surname is Bai,\" the female corpse replied.\n\n\"Bai what?\"\n\n\"Bai Yingying.\"\n\n\"Bai Yingying?\"³\n\nZhou Ze nodded. That name was a bit strange.\n\n\"Actually, you don't have to struggle so much with eating.\" The female corpse stretched, her ample figure accentuated. \"It's like how you can sleep peacefully when you sleep with me.\n\nYour soul is tainted with the aura of Hell, but your body is still that of a living person.\n\nYou need to sleep and eat to replenish your physical body, but your soul doesn't need these things, so it instinctively resists and rejects them.\"\n\n\"Keep going.\"\n\n\"I can feed you from now on.\" The female corpse smiled shyly. \"Food, after passing through my mouth and carrying my juices,\n\nwill be imbued with the aura of a ghost. Then, when you eat it, you won't feel so uncomfortable.\"\n\nZhou Ze suddenly understood why that glass of water had tasted sweet to him last time. It wasn't that the female corpse's mouth was sweet, but because of this reason.\n\n\"Thank you.\"\n\n\"Don't mention it.\"\n\nA man in a leather jacket walked out from the shop door. His clothes were a bit unfashionable, his hair was messy, and his face was red; he must have been drinking recently.\n\nHe walked around outside twice, then finally pushed open the door and entered the bookstore.\n\nAt first, Zhou Ze didn't pay much attention, but soon, Zhou Ze's gaze slightly narrowed.\n\nHe knew this man.\n\nSun Tao, his former assistant, a... very promising young doctor.\n\nThe female corpse's gaze also sharpened slightly. She lightly poked Zhou Ze's waist and said softly,\n\n\"Officer, that, can I eat him?\"\n\nEat a person?\n\nZhou Ze frowned slightly.\n\n\"Officer, didn't you notice, on that person's back?\"\n\nUpon this reminder, Zhou Ze stood up and looked at the man's back, which surprisingly had a dark, blob-like object hanging on it.\n\nAn ordinary person might not know what it was, because it was indeed quite abstract, somewhat similar to a black worm, but it also had some special human-like features.\n\nBut Zhou Ze, due to his former profession, recognized it at a glance—a premature infant.\n\n\"Woo woo woo... woo woo woo...\"\n\nPerhaps because Zhou Ze had noticed him, the infant let out a faint cry.\n\nThis sound was somewhat familiar. Zhou Ze began to search his memories for related incidents. Finally, he found the source of the familiarity.\n\nNurse Chen.\n\nTo be precise, it was the sound that had once come from Nurse Chen's belly, though only Zhou Ze could hear it at the time.\n\nZhou Ze felt no glee at being able to perform \"paternity tests\";\n\nonly sorrow welled up inside him.\n\nThat child, was it still not saved?\n\nThe female corpse had said she wanted to eat him, not referring to the person, but the soul of that male infant.\n\nZhou Ze glared at her. The female corpse pouted, not daring to say anything more, only swallowing her saliva unwillingly, while also pitifully adjusting her heavy chest:\n\n\"I don't eat living people's food, and every night I'm like a furnace top, having my malevolent energy harvested by you.\n\nIf I don't replenish myself, these will shrivel up, and then you won't be able to peek at me while I work.\"\n\nZhou Ze was momentarily stunned. She had been aware of his gaze all along?\n\n\"You lecherous ghost,\" the female corpse cooed.\n\n\"Boss, do you have any alcohol?\" Sun Tao called out.\n\n\"Go next door,\" Zhou Ze replied, but still stood up and poured him a glass of water.\n\nAfter all, he was a junior whom Zhou Ze had once mentored. Zhou Ze had grown up in an orphanage, and Sun Tao in a single-parent family. Back then, Zhou Ze had ignored even fangirls like Dr. Lin, yet he had taken great care of this junior named Sun Tao.\n\nFor no other reason than their similar personalities; their childhood experiences had taught them the meaning of striving and hard work, both wanting to live and fight to become someone to prove themselves.\n\n\"Pfft... hahahaha...\" Sun Tao took the water, drank a large gulp, then burst out laughing. \"Boss, why are you looking at me like that? I'm not interested in men.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\nThere's such a beautiful man living next door, I'm not interested in you yet.\n\nSun Tao sat on the plastic stool, bit his lip, then shook his head.\n\n\"Boss, do you have any children?\"\n\n\"We haven't planned on it yet. He thinks I'm too young,\" the female corpse interjected from the side, desperately trying to get attention.\n\nSun Tao looked up at the female corpse. Although she had a full figure and was tall, she looked to be only a high school student. He immediately laughed,\n\n\"You really are still young.\"\n\nThe female corpse indignantly turned her face away, then swallowed another mouthful of saliva.\n\n\"I actually had a child,\" Sun Tao said with some emotion.\n\nZhou Ze wanted to say, you do have a child, and that child is hanging on your back.\n\nWith the development of modern medicine and the \"modernization\" of people's thinking, abortion and induced miscarriage are no longer such harsh words. However, few people realize that the resentment of unborn infants is actually the greatest.\n\nThese kinds of untimely deaths make infants most likely to turn into ghosts. Of course, their ability to seek revenge is actually very weak.\n\nAt most, due to their resentment, they will bind themselves to their so-called parents for a period, and then they will dissipate on their own.\n\nThe female corpse said she wanted to eat him because these kinds of infants, not having been fully born, are like unsprouted seeds. For entities like the female corpse, they have extremely high \"nutritional value.\"\n\n\"What happened?\" Zhou Ze asked. \"Did your girlfriend disagree?\"\n\nZhou Ze remembered that although Nurse Chen had been very uneasy and shocked at the time, she had said she would keep the child.\n\n\"No, she was willing, but I wasn't. I chickened out. I told her to abort the child.\"\n\nFor some reason, Sun Tao really wanted to talk to this bookstore owner. In this bookstore owner, he found a familiar big-brother feeling.\n\nAnd that big brother had passed away more than half a year ago.\n\n\"Chickened out?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Her parents originally looked down on me, hehe, their family has very good circumstances,\" Sun Tao looked up, seemingly trying to hold back his tears.\n\n\"But the deed is done,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"But I wasn't willing to use something like that to blackmail their family. I didn't want my colleagues, my friends, to think I used such means to get into their family;\n\nI didn't want others to think I was a *phoenix man*⁴.\n\nI don't covet their family's money, nor anything else.\n\nI didn't want to get married and have my head still be beneath in-laws who looked down on me, or even their whole circle of relatives.\n\nI grew up in a single-parent family, so I understand even more that dignity is earned through one's own efforts.\"\n\n\"Even if she was willing?\"\n\n\"Her willingness is her willingness, but I wasn't willing. I wanted to live with dignity.\n\nHehe, when I first started in this profession, an old big brother told me that dignity and how others treat you are earned with your own hands. I haven't achieved anything yet, so I didn't want to...\"\n\nZhou Ze took a deep breath, then asked, \"Then did that big brother of yours tell you one more thing?\"\n\n\"What?\" Sun Tao asked in surprise.\n\n\"That is, when you're having fun, don't forget to wear a ***condom***.\"\n\nWith that, Zhou Ze directly swung his fist and smashed it into Sun Tao's face.\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nSun Tao was inexplicably hit hard by a punch, falling to the ground, utterly bewildered.\n\n\"Don't make excuses, don't talk about dignity, don't say anything else,\n\nYou are just selfish, completely and utterly selfish.\"\n\nWith that,\n\nZhou Ze kicked Sun Tao, who was still on the ground.\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nSun Tao curled up, in great pain and still drunk, but he still shouted angrily:\n\n\"Are you sick? Hitting people!\"\n\n\"Yes, I'm sick. I was blind as a bat back then, thinking about cultivating you and giving you a hand!\"\n\nAt this moment,\n\nThe curled-up mass that had been hanging on Sun Tao's shoulder crawled towards Zhou Ze,\n\nMaking \"squeaking\" sounds in its mouth.\n\nThe female corpse heard it,\n\nZhou Ze heard it too,\n\nBut Sun Tao couldn't hear it.\n\nHis unborn child, who had never truly seen the world,\n\nAt this moment, was baring its teeth,\n\nTowards the person who hit its father,\n\nLetting out an angry cry...\n\n***\n¹ \"奸、、、情\" (jiān... qíng) literally means \"illicit... affair\" or \"adultery,\" but here, it's a play on words, a homophone for \"甘情\" (gān qíng) meaning \"sweet feeling\" or \"sweet affection.\" The original text includes ellipses, hinting at the speaker's hesitation or playful suggestion of a hidden meaning. The closest English equivalent to capture the humorous, slightly suggestive, and sarcastic tone is \"how *sweet*.\"\n\n² *Bingjie*: A Taoist concept where a cultivator intentionally disperses their physical form to release their soul, often to achieve immortality or avoid earthly entanglements.\n\n³ \"白莺莺\" (Bái Yīngyīng) and \"白嘤嘤\" (Bái Yīngyīng) are pronounced the same. \"莺莺\" typically refers to a warbler (a type of bird), often implying something delicate or beautiful. \"嘤嘤\" is an onomatopoeia, like a faint crying or whimpering sound, often used to describe someone acting childishly or cutely (in a slightly annoying way). Zhou Ze's repetition with the second character implies he's thinking of the onomatopoeia, highlighting the strangeness of the name when heard.\n\n⁴ *Phoenix Man*: A derogatory term in Chinese culture referring to a man from a poor rural family who, through personal effort and education, achieves success in the city. However, he is often perceived as still adhering to traditional, conservative, and sometimes patriarchal rural values, leading to conflicts with his more urbanized wife and her family.",

    "content": "Zhou Ze sat down, not continuing to hit the man. Indeed, he had no reason to hit him. Whether or not to have children was the man's own freedom and power.\n\nMoreover,\n\nnow even the only victim,\n\nwas unwilling to hit the man himself.\n\n\"Heh...\"\n\nZhou Ze lit a cigarette.\n\nSun Tao got up from the ground, pointed at Zhou Ze, and shouted, \"Are you crazy? I'm calling the police. I'm going for an injury report.\"\n\n\"You deserved it,\" Zhou Ze exhaled a smoke ring without lifting his head.\n\n\"You... you... you...\" Sun Tao pointed at Zhou Ze, then pushed open the bookstore door and walked out. He secretly cursed his luck, wondering why he had inexplicably come to this bookstore today.\n\nThe infant tried to follow him out but was grabbed by Zhou Ze.\n\nThe infant struggled, very displeased, but Zhou Ze ignored its reaction and still pressed it to the ground.\n\n\"What are you still following for? If you keep following, you won't even have a chance in your next life,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Squeak, squeak, squeak...\"\n\nThe infant was still struggling, completely ignoring Zhou Ze's words.\n\n\"My Lord,\" the female corpse approached Zhou Ze, her eyes full of appeal and flattery. Evidently, she thought Zhou Ze kept the infant to nourish her.\n\nRight?\n\nMost men have a nurturing dream.\n\nThe female corpse felt she was perfect for it,\n\nboth in terms of age and figure.\n\n\"My Lord... *ma... hmm... ma...* Boss... *hmm... ma... ma...*\"\n\nThe female corpse swayed her figure, shaking just right.\n\nThen the person wished for stillness, but the flesh did not cease;\n\nit was spectacular.\n\n\"They can still grow, you know, as long as they get enough nutrition.\"\n\n\"Get out.\"\n\n\"............\" the female corpse.\n\n\"Help me keep an eye on him. Don't let him run. If you try to eat him, you'll die with him,\" Zhou Ze stood up expressionlessly.\n\n\"Yes, Boss.\"\n\nThe female corpse had no choice but to squat down and grab the infant with both hands.\n\n\"Boss, he won't call the police, will he?\" The female corpse was afraid of trouble.\n\n\"No, a person like him wouldn't make a fuss and let the whole world know he got drunk and was beaten.\"\n\n\"Heh, such a prideful fellow,\" the female corpse sneered.\n\nActually, Zhou Ze didn't say one thing: that guy's personality was quite similar to his own in the past.\n\nZhou Ze looked at his right palm, slowly closed his eyes, silently recited something in his mind, then opened his eyes.\n\nHmm,\n\nnothing happened.\n\nImmediately after, Zhou Ze squatted down and extended his palm towards the infant.\n\nHmm,\n\nstill nothing happened.\n\nThe female corpse holding the infant at first looked confused, but quickly realized what Zhou Ze was trying to do, and then her body trembled slightly, struggling to hold back laughter.\n\nZhou Ze glanced at the female corpse. \"If you can't hold it in, then don't.\"\n\nYes, Zhou Ze himself had to smile bitterly.\n\nThe little loli said she put the key to the Gate of Hell in his hand, but when he first tried to open the door to send a ghost in, he didn't know how to open it.\n\nIn short, it was unlikely that the little loli was simply playing a joke on him by putting something like a tattoo on his hand.\n\n\"Hahahahahaha... How could this concubine possibly laugh at you, Boss...\n\nHahahahaha... This concubine dares not be disrespectful to Boss...\n\nHahahaha.\"\n\n\"Alright, do you know how to open it?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nThe female corpse shook her head. \"Boss, I really don't know. Or, is there a chant?\"\n\nZhou Ze heard this and silently recalled the scene Xu Qinglang described when the little loli took back his parents' souls.\n\nImmediately, he spread his hand and said in a deep voice:\n\n\"The Underworld has order, the Yellow Springs can be crossed.\"\n\n\"Whoosh...\"\n\nOutside the glass door, withered yellow leaves blew past.\n\nIt seemed a crow also flew away, cawing \"caw... caw... caw\";\n\nInside the bookstore, it was still quiet.\n\nIn short, there was still no reaction.\n\n\"Or, a different chant?\" the female corpse suggested. \"Everyone must have one that suits them, right?\"\n\n\"Are you telling me to shout 'Open Sesame'?\" Zhou Ze retorted.\n\n\"Well, that depends on what position you prefer, Boss.\"\n\nThe female corpse looked innocently childish.\n\nZhou Ze recalled that during the fight that night, Xu Qinglang also shouted the incantations \"Heaven and Earth, boundless; Mystical Heart, righteous Dharma,\" and then produced talismans and a bronze mirror;\n\nBut afterward, as Xu Qinglang said, those were just lines he thought sounded cool from TV shows, like background music for a protagonist's entrance in a movie.\n\nActually, they were useless.\n\nThinking about it now, perhaps the phrase \"The Underworld has order, the Yellow Springs can be crossed\" that the little loli said with her mouth open and tongue sticking out was also something similar to add \"coolness.\"\n\nIt seemed that the little loli was no different from Xu Qinglang in terms of humor, even though she was a seasoned Ghost Catcher.\n\nZhou Ze's thoughts stirred, and the fingernail on his left index finger began to grow long.\n\nThe female corpse showed a look of fear. She was afraid of Zhou Ze, and most afraid of his fingernails, which carried an aura that terrified her.\n\nThis made Zhou Ze himself somewhat suspicious that the old man who died in front of him back then might not have been so simple.\n\nSmugglers also fell into two categories: one like his former self, who had to behave cautiously, and another like the one in Rongcheng the little loli mentioned, who caused a lot of trouble, even making it difficult and thorny for the Ghost Catchers.\n\nIn short, the old man who infected him with gray nail fungus shouldn't have been so simple.\n\nThe black nail pierced the mark on Zhou Ze's right palm. Immediately, when Zhou Ze pulled out the nail, a black thread was pulled out.\n\nIt was like hot caramel, very sticky but unbroken.\n\nThe pulled-out thread was used by Zhou Ze to draw a square frame,\n\nand then,\n\nthe frame floated up,\n\nthe inside also turned black and empty, and gusts of阴风 (yin wind) began to blow.\n\nThe infant in the female corpse's hands began to struggle. Evidently, it did not want to return to Hell.\n\nWhen a person dies, it's like a lamp goes out,\n\nbut not many people can truly accept it.\n\nHow many seventy or eighty-year-olds, or even people who have been evil and done bad things their whole lives, try to cling to life, let alone this little infant.\n\nBut Zhou Ze knew that sending it to Hell, to anticipate a new beginning and reincarnation, was the most correct choice.\n\nWithout asking for its opinion, Zhou Ze became quite overbearing at this moment. He directly took the infant from the female corpse and threw it into the dark square frame.\n\nThen, the frame slowly dissipated, and a faint burnt smell permeated the air.\n\nThe female corpse stuck out her tongue and said nothing.\n\nZhou Ze was a bit lost in thought. After all, this was his first time sending a ghost back to Hell; he hadn't done so with the woman who wanted to accompany her son for the college entrance exam last time.\n\n\"Have you ever been to Hell?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"No,\" the female corpse answered honestly. \"And I can't go down there.\"\n\nThe female corpse had no soul of her own,\n\na zombie does not enter the Five Elements, nor does it reincarnate as a human.\n\nThis sounded quite impressive,\n\nbut a line needed to be added afterwards:\n\nHated by humans and ghosts, abandoned by heaven!\n\nMeaning, if the female corpse went for a stroll without anything to do, there was a certain probability that a sudden dry thunderbolt in broad daylight would strike her and turn her to ashes.\n\nThis world was just that unfriendly to her.\n\nHumans have the mortal realm,\n\nghosts have Hell,\n\nbeings that belong to neither are anomalies.\n\nZhou Ze sat back behind the counter. He didn't feel happy, only somewhat dry and bored.\n\nIf the mortal world was compared to a production line, then what he did was merely toss defective products into the incinerator for remanufacturing.\n\n\"Boss, here's a stack of these.\"\n\nThe female corpse picked up a few sheets of joss paper from the tile floor and handed them to Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze was a bit surprised; he hadn't expected any payment this time.\n\n\"It's easier to meet the King of Hell than the petty demons,\" the female corpse said, then regretted it slightly but still toughened her resolve: \"It is only right for a Ghost Catcher to 'flay' those they escort on their way.\n\nPerhaps his mother had burned joss paper for him before.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded, took the joss paper. There was some leftover joss paper in the drawer behind his counter from last time; even with these few sheets, it was still a bit scarce.\n\n\"Do you know any other friends? Refer some business our way. To be human... oh no, to be a ghost, one must study more to progress better.\"\n\n\"Boss, this concubine only knows some lonely spirits who have long since lost their incense offerings and have no money at all. And they wouldn't dare come before you. If you were to take them, wouldn't that just be giving you free performance credit?\"\n\n\"Performance credit?\" Zhou Ze heard this for the first time. \"Ghost Catchers have performance credit?\"\n\n\"Don't they?\" the female corpse asked, somewhat confused.\n\n\"I don't know,\" Zhou Ze shrugged. He genuinely didn't know, because the little loli had only left him with a line: \"You're the most *bishi*<sup>1</sup> person I've ever seen,\" and then:\n\n*Biu*\n\nShe disappeared.\n\nShe didn't leave him a copy of \"Ghost Catcher's Code of Conduct\" or \"How to Be an Ideal, Aspiring, and Driven Ghost Catcher.\"\n\n\"I suppose there should be,\" the female corpse said with some difficulty. \"Just like my Madame, who lingered in the mortal realm for two hundred years, protecting the local area, diligent and conscientious, all she wanted was to atone for her past lingering sin and also seek an official position when she returned to Hell.\n\nIf her temple hadn't been destroyed back then and the incense offerings were still there, it wouldn't have taken her this long.\"\n\n\"Do you know any other Ghost Catchers?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"How could this concubine know so many Lords?\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Zhou Ze nodded. It seemed he would have to ask someone knowledgeable in the future.\n\nJust then, the sound of an electric scooter came from outside. Xu Qinglang was back.\n\n\"Oh my god, I'm exhausted.\"\n\nXu Qinglang walked into the bookstore and threw a cigarette to Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Didn't you go to order the signboard?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"That's ordered, and then I picked up a batch of goods along the way. Wanchai Ferry is on special discount recently, so I stocked up a lot. It really tired me out.\"\n\n\"Aren't your dumplings freshly made?\"\n\n\"Hehe, the cola in fast-food restaurants is bought from the supermarket next door and then resold. How could I have the free time to make dumplings at home every day?\"\n\n\"Wanchai Ferry, quite fitting for you.\"\n\n\"Right, I like that flavor too... Hey, gotta go, I'm going back to put them in the fridge first.\" Xu Qinglang waved to Zhou Ze and went back to his own shop.\n\nAfter Xu Qinglang left, the female corpse suddenly giggled.\n\nZhou Ze was a bit surprised. \"Did you understand?\"\n\nThe female corpse laughed:\n\n\"He really is good-looking. Most men would turn gay with him around.\n\nSo,\n\nWanchai (彎仔, literally \"bent boy\") Ferry.\"\n\n——————\n\nPS: Given that since the book was published, readers in the comment section often leave messages saying \"the author plagiarized 'He Comes From Hell'\" or \"the author's beginning is very similar to 'He Comes From Hell',\" I, Long, will give a unified response:\n\n\"He Comes From Hell\" was written by Long.\n\n<sup>1</sup> *Bishi* (逼数): A slang term, often used to describe someone who is \"in the know\" or \"has a clue,\" but can also imply arrogance or overconfidence, depending on context. Here, it likely means \"knows what's what\" or \"has a good grasp of the situation.\"",

    "content": "In recent years, Tongcheng has become famous not for its economy or its snacks, but for its Gaokao.\n\nFor most high school seniors across the country, the Tongcheng practice exams are on par with the Huanggang secret exams.\n\nOf course, these matters usually had no impact on Zhou Ze. His bookstore had long since shed its reliance on \"living business\" and had completed its industrial restructuring and transformation, earning money from the dead.\n\nHowever, the胖子 who had come to him last time sought him out again.\n\nHis purpose was simple: the next semester was the Gaokao semester, and 胖子 planned to make another big splash by pirating the secret exams.\n\nThere were likely many twists and turns, and even an extremely intricate chain of interests involved. Zhou Ze wasn't very clear on it, and in fact, Zhou Ze believed Xu Le wouldn't be either.\n\nThe reason 胖子 wanted to bring Xu Le in, both last time and this time, was purely to leverage some of Xu Le's student connections.\n\nXu Le, in this whole arrangement, was actually an intermediary satisfactory to both sides.\n\nBlitheringly idiotic,\n\nYet the most trustworthy.\n\nPiracy is an unavoidable hurdle in contemporary Chinese society, and the so-called \"shanzhai\" culture it spawned, seemingly grand and flourishing, has even begun to gradually move out of the realm of derogatory terms and into neutral ones.\n\nBut when all is said and done, it is still illegal. While the prevailing atmosphere makes this phenomenon almost universally widespread, if you're unlucky enough to be targeted, it's always a lot of trouble.\n\nZhou Ze refused 胖子, who left somewhat dejectedly. As he stood by the door, 胖子 lit a cigarette, touched his gold-dusted gold chain,\n\nAnd cursed:\n\n\"Sabi.\"\n\nZhou Ze, meanwhile, continued to sit behind the counter, reading. 胖子's visit was just a minor interlude in his life recently.\n\nThe female corpse, as usual, sat in her chair with her eyes closed after cleaning the bookstore, leaning against the wall, as if spacing out or feigning sleep.\n\nTheir lives had taken on the aroma of an old woman's bound feet.\n\nZhou Ze was content, recalling that what he had most looked forward to in his previous life was living exactly like this: whiling away the hours, wasting time, reading, and spacing out.\n\nNo need to be ready to face emergency patients at any moment, nor to constantly push himself to climb higher and higher.\n\nAs for the female corpse, she had been lying in a coffin for two hundred years and was long accustomed to monotony and silence. Now, it was just a drizzle.\n\nCompared to the bookstore's \"calm as water,\" Xu Qinglang was far more ambitious and progressive. He was wealthy and didn't have much pursuit in the occult; instead, he thought about how to make money and develop through his own abilities.\n\nTherefore, Xu Qinglang was very displeased with the decadent style of the master and servant next door!\n\n\"Look at you, lazy as a dead man every day.\" Xu Qinglang, as usual, came over after a day of work to smoke a cigarette and shower Zhou Ze with some mockery.\n\n\"I am a dead man already,\" Zhou Ze waved his hand, exhaling a smoke ring.\n\n\"Look at you, a man who's lived two lives, and you barely have any money. I'm a man with over twenty apartments, and I'm still working hard.\"\n\nAs usual, after belittling Zhou Ze, he had to praise himself.\n\nZhou Ze glanced at Xu Qinglang and chuckled, \"Are you preparing your dowry?\"\n\n\"Nothing good ever comes out of a dog's mouth.\" Xu Qinglang looked up at the night sky (the ceiling). \"I want to live more comfortably when I retire later.\"\n\n\"Twenty-some residences are enough to attract a ghost madam to carry you back in an eight-person sedan for marriage. If you work harder, earn more money, buy more houses, maybe next time a female ghost king or something will consider you a suitable match, and I, a Ghost Messenger, can also bask in your reflected glory.\n\nWhen you become rich, don't forget me.\"\n\n\"Hehe.\" The female corpse, feigning sleep nearby, cooperated well with her boss.\n\n\"It's almost eight, I need to get ready,\" Xu Qinglang said, checking the time.\n\n\"For what?\" Zhou Ze was a bit surprised.\n\nUsually, Xu Qinglang retired quite early in the evening.\n\n\"Today is the opening day of the Confucius Temple. Isn't Gaokao just a few months away? I have a relative's child back home who's taking Gaokao this year, and they asked me to burn incense for them at the Confucius Temple.\"\n\n\"You'd go for that?\" Zhou Ze knew Xu Qinglang's temperament. To say he was indifferent and selfish would be an overstatement, but he was generally too lazy to bother with anything other than making money.\n\n\"I ate at their house when I was a kid and received aid from them. Otherwise, I don't know if I would have lived to see the demolition, so I owe them this favor,\" Xu Qinglang said earnestly.\n\n\"Hmm,\" Zhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"How about we go together?\" Xu Qinglang suddenly invited, \"Help me grab the first incense?\"\n\n\"Does the Confucius Temple also value the first incense?\"\n\n\"Heh, it's always a good omen, isn't it?\"\n\n\"I don't have much strength.\" Zhou Ze had seen how crazy people were when vying for the first incense. With his physique, he really couldn't take it, unless he used his fingernails to clear a path, but he couldn't just knock everyone around him down, could he?\n\n\"Ask her,\" Xu Qinglang pointed at the female corpse. \"She's strong as an ox, she can take the brunt of it for me.\"\n\nThe female corpse frowned, preparing to retort.\n\n\"Do you want to go out for a stroll?\" Xu Qinglang raised an eyebrow.\n\nThe words on the female corpse's lips immediately vanished, replaced by a radiant smile.\n\nShe hadn't stepped out of the bookstore these past days.\n\nHelpless, Zhou Ze could only nod in agreement. He didn't trust the female corpse to go out alone. Though she was currently as attentive and compliant as a maidservant, one's heart is hidden, let alone a zombie without a \"heart\"?\n\nZhou Ze even believed that if his powers ever vanished, the first one to devour his flesh and blood would likely be this very female corpse who was now so subservient to him.\n\nThe three took a taxi to the Confucius Temple. To say the area outside the temple was a sea of people would be an exaggeration, but it was certainly packed three layers deep.\n\nOh, the pity of parents' hearts!\n\nXu Qinglang met his relatives, a couple who looked very honest and reliable middle-aged people, outside the Confucius Temple.\n\nTheir son, of course, hadn't come. Everyone was there to seek good fortune; no one was foolish enough to truly believe this would guarantee high scores. There were almost no students present, likely all at home studying or something.\n\nTongcheng's Confucius Temple \"opened its doors\" after the New Year. As for why not before, perhaps the esteemed scholars in the temple felt it would be beneath their dignity to compete for incense with those demons and monsters during the festive season.\n\nBetter to do it after the New Year,\n\nTo see your gates desolate, while their gates are crowded with believers, thereby showing their class.\n\nAs for the specific reasons and how it was done in other parts of the country, Zhou Ze wasn't clear. Customs were simply inexplicable rules; who could explain them?\n\nJust like the recent viral news about a father-in-law kissing his daughter-in-law at a wedding in a city adjacent to Tongcheng, claiming it was a custom. There was even less logic to that.\n\n\"Creak!\"\n\nThe red wooden gate opened,\n\nAnd suddenly, the waiting parents outside transformed into \"fierce beasts,\" charging into the Confucius Temple.\n\nThe female corpse took the lead, with Xu Qinglang and his relatives following closely behind, like Zhao Zilong at Changbanpo.\n\nZhou Ze didn't join the commotion. He just squatted on the curb outside, smoking.\n\nAs he smoked, Zhou Ze was surprised to find the cigarette in his hand suddenly went out.\n\nZhou Ze lit it again, but the subsequent puffs were suddenly tasteless.\n\n\"Heh.\" Zhou Ze flicked the cigarette butt away and looked around. He knew his cigarette had been offered up as incense.\n\nNot partaking of pure incense, not accepting offerings,\n\nJust to smoke this one puff of a mortal's cigarette,\n\nHe wondered which demon or god it was.\n\nZhou Ze naturally wasn't angry, thinking, \"Damn, someone dared to steal my cigarette.\" A month ago, he was still an illegal immigrant; half a month later, he was only promoted to a temporary worker.\n\nHe had no \"sudden rise to power\" or \"this road is mine\" arrogance.\n\n\"Clang!\"\n\nA gong sounded,\n\nIn the night, it was so abrupt, and so jarring.\n\nZhou Ze followed the sound,\n\nFrom the flower garden behind the Confucius Temple walked out a short, dwarfish old man. The old man held a copper gong, a cigarette in his mouth, and was hopping and skipping outwards.\n\nThe old man even specifically glanced at Zhou Ze, opening his mouth and exhaling a smoke ring, seemingly indicating his thanks for Zhou Ze's cigarette.\n\nZhou Ze also smiled,\n\nHe lit all the remaining cigarettes in his hand with a lighter and arranged them on the ground, keeping only one for himself.\n\nSoon, the cigarettes on the ground went out. The dwarfish old man hopped even more excitedly, seemingly growing fonder of this sensible junior. His small pockets were bulging, likely filled with cigarettes.\n\nThe dwarfish old man led the way with his gong,\n\nBehind him, a group of people slowly followed.\n\nThey weren't the parents who had just crammed into the Confucius Temple,\n\nBut a group of strangely dressed people.\n\nThe first few, with feathered fans and scholar's caps, staggered in their steps, their faces ashen, slowly following the old man forward.\n\nThen came two with greasy pigtails, their gazes dull, also following the old man forward.\n\nAfter them, the attire became increasingly modern. The last few were even dressed in modern clothes, indistinguishable from ordinary high school students.\n\nHowever, some of them had greenish faces, others had shattered skulls.\n\nOut of professional habit, Zhou Ze quickly deduced that the latter students had either died from poisoning or had jumped from a building.\n\nOne of them looked somewhat familiar to Zhou Ze; he seemed to have seen his photo when browsing the news a few years ago. He had committed suicide by jumping from a building due to the pressure of a poor performance on a mock exam.\n\nThe dwarfish old man walked forward, beating his gong, while the group of \"scholarly students\" behind him followed like puppets on strings.\n\nThey were like a parade,\n\nCircling the Confucius Temple.\n\nAnd the nearby pedestrians,\n\nExcept for Zhou Ze, no one could see them.\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nA gong sounded,\n\n\"To live in peace, no need for high buildings; in books, there is gold!\" the dwarfish old man shouted in a hoarse voice.\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nAnother gong sounded,\n\n\"To marry, do not despair of a good match; in books, there is beauty!\"\n\nThe dwarfish old man continued to shout.\n\nAfter circling the Confucius Temple three times,\n\nThis bizarre procession slowly vanished.\n\nA moment later,\n\nThe parents who had finished burning incense began to emerge from the Confucius Temple,\n\nTheir faces filled with satisfaction,\n\nWith hope,\n\nWith the eager desire for their children to succeed.",

    "content": "Xu Qinglang, the female corpse, and the middle-aged couple all emerged. The couple's faces were beaming, clearly having secured the \"first incense\" with the female corpse's help.\n\nWhether useful or not, it was a good omen.\n\nEven non-superstitious parents, before a child's big exam, would give them a _zongzi_ (rice dumpling) and a _niangao_ (rice cake), symbolizing \"high-grade sticky rice cake\" (meaning \"high school graduation\").\n\nThe female corpse's expression was not very good. As everyone walked back, she lagged behind.\n\n\"Let's get some late-night supper, how about barbecue?\" Xu Qinglang suggested.\n\nHe owned a restaurant himself, but he wouldn't let himself prepare barbecue late at night;\n\nEmpress Xu's skin was precious, how could she endure such smoke and fire?\n\nHowever, Xu Qinglang regretted his suggestion as soon as he made it.\n\nAmong this group,\n\nThere was a zombie, and a living dead person who didn't partake in human food.\n\nJust imagining the scene at dinner, these two would sit there motionless, like clay statues in a temple enjoying incense offerings.\n\nThe thought alone was enough to kill one's appetite.\n\n\"You go, we'll head back first,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Oh, we couldn't possibly,\" the middle-aged man said.\n\n\"It's fine, uncle, we'll go eat. Let the young couple enjoy their walk.\"\n\nXu Qinglang pulled the middle-aged couple away.\n\nZhou Ze didn't rush to hail a taxi, walking along the sparsely populated side street with the female corpse.\n\nThe weather was starting to warm up; the evenings weren't as cool as before.\n\n\"What's wrong?\" Zhou Ze asked the female corpse.\n\nThe female corpse had been sulking ever since leaving the Confucius Temple.\n\n\"Uncomfortable,\" the female corpse replied.\n\n\"Still haven't stopped menstruating?\"\n\nIt had been two hundred years.\n\n\"............\" the female corpse.\n\nAfter a moment of silence, the female corpse finally spoke, \"The statues in the Confucius Temple were staring at me; it felt strange.\"\n\n\"You think they were looking at you?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" the female corpse nodded.\n\n\"You think they disapproved of you?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" the female corpse continued to nod.\n\n\"You think that because you're a zombie, you shouldn't have been in that place?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" the female corpse still nodded.\n\n\"The sage advocated 'teaching without discrimination'.\" Zhou Ze smiled, reaching out to pat the female corpse's head, saying, \"You are a zombie, a type of existence that both humans and ghosts dislike, but you went to the Confucius Temple to help someone offer incense, and you contributed incense and popularity to them.\n\nYou feel they were looking at you,\n\nIt might be because of your uniqueness, so they were noticing you.\n\nIt's like a husky suddenly joining a pack of prairie wolves; anyone would take an extra look, right?\n\nOf course, it's also possible they're just a bunch of clay figures, and their eyes are reportedly made from donkey dung balls, because it makes them look more lively and lustrous.\n\nEverything is just you putting psychological pressure on yourself.\"\n\n\"But what if they really were looking at me, what if they really had an issue with me...\" The female corpse still hesitated.\n\n\"Then they don't deserve to be enshrined in a temple as those so-called sages!\"\n\nZhou Ze's words were forceful,\n\n\"Sages enjoy offerings for thousands of generations; if they don't even have that much magnanimity, then what face do they have to sit on the temple altar?\n\nA false sage, what is there to be afraid of?\"\n\nThe female corpse looked at Zhou Ze, a smile playing on her lips, and said, \"Boss, what you just said was really domineering.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" Zhou Ze savored the flattery from his servant.\n\n\"But Boss, you are a ghost messenger; there is a certain destiny in the unseen. For ordinary people, the implication might not be great, but for you, it's different.\n\nFurthermore, you run a bookstore, which falls under the good fortune of the sages. For you to malign a sage like that, it's really not good for you.\"\n\nThe female corpse rarely spoke so candidly to Zhou Ze; in the past, she would have wished for Zhou Ze to court death;\n\nJump, jump, jump yourself to death, and I'll collect your body, then peel off your nails and grind them into powder to brew as pearl powder tea,\n\nOh no, feed them to pigs!\n\n\"Still the same words: 'If you have a clear conscience, you won't fear ghosts'… or sages knocking on your door.\"\n\nZhou Ze looked up at the streetlights and continued:\n\n\"In my previous life, I treated the sick and saved lives, never taking red envelopes, never crossing ethical lines. I always upheld medical ethics.\n\nIn this life, even after becoming a ghost and possessing a new body, I haven't done anything with a guilty conscience.\n\nWhat is there to be afraid of?\"\n\nZhou Ze took a deep breath and repeated, \"There's nothing to be afraid of.\"\n\nUpon hearing this, the female corpse fell into contemplation.\n\nZhou Ze's words weren't a declaration of a rebellious teenager, but rather a warning to himself.\n\nThe two continued to walk aimlessly forward, the evening breeze cool but pleasant.\n\nFinally, the female corpse stopped and asked, \"Boss, where are you going?\"\n\nZhou Ze stopped, subconsciously looking around, and was surprised to find that he had walked into the entrance of a small residential complex.\n\nFamiliar surroundings,\n\nFamiliar guardhouse,\n\nFamiliar guard in the guardhouse secretly sleeping on duty,\n\nFamiliar express delivery lockers.\n\nHe had simply walked,\n\nNaturally, back to the complex where he used to live.\n\nAlthough he had been at the bookstore for a month, subconsciously, this was still his home.\n\nHaving grown up in an orphanage, he understood the meaning of \"home\" even more deeply, and he was also more attached to housing.\n\nFortunately, when he bought his house, Tongcheng's housing prices hadn't soared to such ridiculous levels. It was also because he couldn't wait to become a \"mortgage slave\" after starting work, which turned out to be a stroke of luck, much to the envy of his colleagues who bought homes later.\n\nHowever, Zhou Ze couldn't even retrieve his old WeChat and QQ accounts now; mobile verification was impossible, and asking friends in his contact list to help verify would either make them think he was crazy or scare them to death.\n\nEven his own house was sold by the hospital after his death, and the money was donated to the orphanage in his name.\n\nZhou Ze didn't object to this, as he had no other relatives in the world.\n\n\"This is where I used to live,\" Zhou Ze told the female corpse.\n\n\"So, shall we go up and take a look?\" the female corpse suggested.\n\n\"It's already been sold,\" Zhou Ze sighed.\n\n\"Just consider it a visit to an old haunt.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded and walked over.\n\nHe entered Building 8, Unit 2, took the elevator up to the fifth floor.\n\nZhou Ze walked to a door. It was still the same door; the buyer probably hadn't had time to redecorate.\n\nEven the mat at the entrance hadn't changed.\n\nAnd the cactus placed at the door was still there.\n\nZhou Ze reached out and felt under the pot, pulling out a key.\n\nBack then, he was often called to the hospital for emergency shifts at night, and many times he forgot his phone or keys. So, his spare key was kept here, to prevent him from being locked out of his home.\n\nWith a hopeful try, he inserted the key and turned it.\n\n\"Click...\"\n\nThe lock opened.\n\nThe door hadn't been changed,\n\nAnd the lock hadn't been changed either?\n\nZhou Ze was a bit surprised. He pushed open the door and casually turned on the light.\n\nThe furnishings in the living room were all as they were.\n\nZhou Ze even saw his own slippers, changed into them, and walked in. The female corpse followed him in.\n\n\"Boss, is it still the same as before?\" the female corpse asked.\n\n\"Yes, that's what puzzles me the most.\"\n\nIt was indeed still the same as before,\n\nBut this didn't make sense.\n\nWouldn't an ordinary person who bought a house throw away everything that belonged to a deceased person?\n\nHow could they keep everything, preserving it all, without feeling it was bad luck?\n\nPerhaps, the person who took over his house just bought it for investment? Not actually to live in?\n\nZhou Ze sat down on the sofa, as if at this moment, he had become himself again.\n\nEach time he returned home exhausted, he would watch TV, cook a late-night snack. Life was busy, yet fulfilling.\n\nThe female corpse went to make tea, poured a cup for Zhou Ze, and then said:\n\n\"Boss, you've been dead for more than half a year, haven't you?\"\n\n\"Seven months.\"\n\nZhou Ze replied, but why did the conversation feel a bit strange?\n\n\"But it's so clean here, it doesn't look like no one has lived in it for seven months,\" the female corpse reminded him.\n\nZhou Ze nodded; indeed, it was true. The place was very clean, someone must be cleaning it regularly.\n\nBut Zhou Ze found it hard to imagine that the person who bought his house would be so lazy as to throw nothing away, change nothing, and even keep the original door lock.\n\nZhou Ze pushed open the bedroom door and found that even his bedding and sheets were the ones he used to use.\n\n\"Boss, I'm going to take a shower. I was stared at by those old things in the Confucius Temple for so long, I've got goosebumps all over.\"\n\n\"Go ahead, turn on the water heater first,\" Zhou Ze reminded her, \"The bath towel is in the cabinet by the bathroom door.\"\n\nIf,\n\nAll the furnishings were truly the same.\n\nThe female corpse went to take a shower. She was very clean; women naturally were. In her previous life, she was a young lady from a good family, and lying in a coffin for two hundred years without being able to bathe must have been difficult.\n\nSo she basically showered once in the morning and once at night, wasting a lot of Zhou Ze's water bill.\n\nBut thinking about how she worked as a server in his shop without asking for wages, Zhou Ze just put up with it.\n\nPulling back the curtains, Zhou Ze stood on the balcony, looking at the shimmering night lights ahead.\n\nThis place,\n\nIt was his home.\n\nIt hadn't changed,\n\nBut it no longer belonged to him.\n\nThings remained, but people had changed;\n\nIt was truly a case of things remaining while people changed.\n\nHe took out a cigarette, lit it, and exhaled a smoke ring.\n\nHe felt a little lost inside; he thought he should have been able to let go, but in reality, he couldn't.\n\nJust as he had personally cast that infant into hell to await reincarnation,\n\nHe now deeply realized,\n\nAs a living person, his attachment to the human world was truly hard to describe in words.\n\nEven he, at this moment, had an urge to buy his house back.\n\nAs for money,\n\nWith his abilities, if he really wanted to illegally get some money,\n\nWould it be difficult?\n\nThis impulse was finally suppressed. Zhou Ze knew that this was a path of no return, a Pandora's Box; once opened, he definitely wouldn't be able to stop himself.\n\nZhou Ze considered himself a disciplined person, but no matter what, when it could be avoided, one should not test one's \"human integrity.\"\n\n\"Click...\"\n\nUnexpectedly,\n\nThe sound of a key in the lock came from the door.\n\nHad the owner returned?\n\nZhou Ze turned around and walked from the balcony back into the living room. He was thinking about how to explain his presence in the house to the owner, but he wasn't overly nervous.\n\nAll things considered, he was a ghost messenger. If he ended up being caught by the police for trespassing,\n\nWouldn't that be too much of a loss for him?\n\nDiscipline was discipline, but there was no need for self-torture.\n\nThis, after all, was his former home.\n\nHowever, when the door was pushed open,\n\nThe one who walked in,\n\nWas a familiar figure.\n\nDoctor Lin stood at the door, looking at Zhou Ze standing in the living room, her face showing shock and panic, and she said,\n\n\"You... how are you here?\"\n\nZhou Ze was momentarily speechless,\n\nThe one who bought his house,\n\nIt was Doctor Lin?\n\n\"Listen to my explanation.\" Lin Wanqiu.\n\n\"Listen to my explanation.\" Zhou Ze.\n\nThey both said the same thing at the same time,\n\nFor Lin Wanqiu, she was panicking because she thought Zhou Ze had discovered evidence of her \"emotional infidelity,\"\n\nThat he had found this place; she was his wife, yet she had bought another man's former house and had been cleaning and tidying it, and because of that man, she had refused to share conjugal life with him.\n\nDoctor Lin felt very much in the wrong.\n\nFortunately, this awkward atmosphere didn't last long,\n\nBecause something even more awkward appeared,\n\n\"Boss, I accidentally got my clothes wet.\"\n\nThe female corpse said as she walked out, wrapped in a bath towel,\n\nShe walked into,\n\nThe living room,\n\nAnd stood between Zhou Ze and Lin Wanqiu.",

    "content": "The air was suddenly quiet, which was the most terrifying thing…\n\nZhou Ze pursed his lips. Doctor Lin lowered her head, also somewhat relieved.\n\nOne had an emotional affair,\n\nThe other had a “physical affair.”\n\nOne person’s mistake was guilt;\n\nTwo people making a mistake together was gender equality.\n\nZhou Ze laughed at this moment, a somewhat uninhibited laugh.\n\nThat’s right,\n\nAfter his death, the person who bought his house was his current “wife.”\n\nIndeed, Doctor Lin had money. It was easy for her to buy a second-hand house with a deceased owner in Tongcheng. Moreover, it seemed only she would clean it and keep its original layout.\n\nMoved?\n\nOf course, he was moved.\n\nZhou Ze was Zhou Ze. Even though he was currently in Xu Le’s body, he still viewed things from his own perspective.\n\nXu Le was a thing of the past. No matter how rough or undignified that kid’s emotional life was, Zhou Ze wouldn't pay much attention to it.\n\nIt was like during Chinese New Year, when everyone was having a reunion dinner, and a fool at the table suddenly pulled out his phone and asked everyone, \"Look at how some refugees in Africa are starving and skinny. Can you still eat your food?\"\n\nTo have such a woman, as if possessed, constantly remembering him, missing him,\n\nAs a man,\n\nHow could he not be proud, not moved?\n\n\"Find my clothes for me to change into,\" Zhou Ze pointed to Bai Yingying.\n\nThe female corpse nodded and said, \"Oh.\" This time was different from last time; she didn’t dare to act on her impulses and intentionally add fuel to the fire out of fun. She dutifully went to Zhou Ze's bedroom, found his clean clothes, changed, and came out.\n\nDoctor Lin still stood in place, saying nothing.\n\nShe seemed to feel a sense of relief and release. However, Zhou Ze didn't let her continue with that emotion. Instead, he walked forward, took Doctor Lin's hand, and said very earnestly:\n\n\"There's something I need to tell you. Come with me.\"\n\nHolding Doctor Lin's hand, Zhou Ze, with a hint of forcefulness, led her out the door and into the elevator. Bai Yingying followed behind, silent. She knew that anything she said now would be wrong.\n\nOne could only say that everything was too coincidental.\n\nAfter getting downstairs, Zhou Ze walked to Doctor Lin’s Cayenne and extended his hand, signaling Doctor Lin to give him the car key.\n\nZhou Ze had decided he would tell her his identity, regardless of whether she could accept it, or if she was like the \"Lord Ye's love of dragons\"* in ancient stories.\n\nIn short, Zhou Ze wanted to tell her the truth. He didn’t want to be hesitant or hide anymore. After all, circumstances were different now. He used to be an unregistered person, but now he had been cleared.\n\nThere was no reason to make himself suffer.\n\n\"You don't have a driver's license,\" Doctor Lin reminded him.\n\n\"Give me the key,\" Zhou Ze said forcefully, with no room for doubt.\n\nHe wanted to take her to the hospital, to that familiar operating room, to show her his true identity with practical actions;\n\nOtherwise, he worried that if he merely described it, she might think he was having an \"imaginary husband syndrome\" episode.\n\nDoctor Lin handed the car key to Zhou Ze, and then all three got into the car.\n\nZhou Ze sat in the driver's seat, Doctor Lin in the passenger seat, and Bai Yingying obediently in the back.\n\nThe car started, backing out.\n\nZhou Ze looked skillful and at ease.\n\nXu Le, that dimwit, didn't even have a driver's license.\n\nHe, however, was an experienced driver.\n\nThen,\n\nOnly the ear-piercing sound of \"screech, screech, screech…\" was heard, and the car body shook.\n\nZhou Ze fell silent.\n\nThe other two women in the car also fell silent.\n\nThe Cayenne's body had scraped against the utility pole, grinding hard for a full rotation.\n\nIn the dark night, it was as if another very diligent crow,\n\nBy extreme coincidence, flew across the sky again,\n\nOccasionally letting out \"caw... caw... caw\" sounds.\n\nThe air became awkwardly silent again.\n\nZhou Ze unbuckled his seatbelt and said, \"You drive.\"\n\n\"To People's Hospital?\"\n\nDoctor Lin asked after switching seats.\n\n\"Yes, People's Hospital.\" Zhou Ze, sitting in the passenger seat, covered his forehead with his hand, then gently tapped the car window.\n\nIt had been too long since he drove, and he had changed bodies, so his driving skills were much rustier.\n\nBut no matter how many reasons there were,\n\nIt was truly embarrassing just now.\n\nThe car got on the road and soon ascended the East Expressway Viaduct.\n\nThe car was quiet. Doctor Lin didn't speak. Even if she didn't know why Zhou Ze wanted to go to the hospital, she didn't ask.\n\nTheir current marital relationship,\n\nIt was truly riddled with holes.\n\nBai Yingying sat in the back seat, looking at the scenery outside the window. She hadn't been out for a long time. Although Madam Bai used to talk to her almost every day, she rarely had the chance to personally go out and see the world outside.\n\nMoreover, she knew it wasn't appropriate for her to speak now.\n\nZhou Ze suddenly sat up straight and said, \"Is that car driving against traffic?\"\n\nOn the other side of the low concrete wall was the opposing lane of the viaduct. A white car was there, but its front was facing the same direction as Zhou Ze's car.\n\nThis meant the other car was driving against traffic.\n\nAnd at this moment,\n\nA bus drove past in the adjacent lane, its high beams blinding.\n\nImmediately after, there was the ear-piercing screech of sudden braking.\n\nZhou Ze instinctively closed his eyes and covered his head with both hands. The bus was in the adjacent lane and couldn't hit them, but this scene was almost the most terrifying image in his memory.\n\nHe himself was hit by a large truck in this manner on his way home from work back then.\n\nEverything at this moment triggered the most terrifying and unwilling-to-recall scene in his heart.\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nA dull impact sound came, and Doctor Lin immediately stopped the car.\n\nIn the adjacent lane, the bus and the white car driving against traffic collided. The car was pushed out, then heavily slammed into the concrete barrier by the front of the bus. Its body was completely deformed.\n\nTurning on the hazard lights, Doctor Lin quickly got out of the car. Looking at her husband, who was curled up and trembling in the passenger seat, a hint of disappointment flashed in her eyes. But she immediately opened the trunk, took out the warning triangle, placed it behind the car, and then quickly climbed over the barrier to the other side.\n\nShe was a doctor; she needed to fulfill her responsibilities. When an accident occurred, if there were professional rescue personnel nearby, the victims' lives had a high probability of being saved.\n\n\"Boss?\" Bai Yingying called from the back.\n\nZhou Ze released his hands and looked around blankly. He saw the accident scene in the adjacent lane, and Doctor Lin had already rushed over.\n\n\"Come with me, let's save them.\"\n\nZhou Ze got out of the car, his legs feeling somewhat weak.\n\nThis was a kind of self-preservation instinct in humans. When mental trauma was triggered, it often led to the body producing a weak protective response.\n\nTaking a deep breath, Zhou Ze didn't hesitate at all. He also climbed over the barrier to the other side, ready to save people.\n\nBai Yingying followed him.\n\nThe bus driver also had blood on his face, probably from hitting his head on the steering wheel or something during the crash. Three other people got off the bus, presumably passengers. In short, the bus was quite empty.\n\n\"This motherfucker must be sick. Driving against traffic on the viaduct, seeking death but harming others!\" the bus driver cursed, covering his forehead wound with one hand.\n\nAnyone would be furious to encounter such bad luck.\n\n\"Stop shouting, save people!\" Doctor Lin snapped at the bus driver.\n\nThe accident responsibility could be discussed later; for now, they needed to get the people out of the car.\n\n\"Hey, are you still conscious? Can you answer me?\" Doctor Lin shouted at the person in the deformed car.\n\nBut there was no response.\n\nThe bus driver grumbled but still participated in the rescue. This road was already a bit remote, a section of the viaduct where few cars traveled. Occasionally, a car would pass by, but it didn't stop to watch curiously; it just drove off.\n\n\"Pry open the car door!\" Zhou Ze suggested.\n\n\"No equipment, how do we pry it?\" Doctor Lin's emotions were a bit agitated, especially when her husband, who didn't understand, was giving misguided instructions, making her even more annoyed.\n\nThere were two people in the car, a woman and a child. Their condition was very bad, both covered in blood, and there was no response to their shouts.\n\nThe car door was dented inwards and almost jammed. This required the fire department to come with specialized equipment to cut it open.\n\nZhou Ze stepped forward and grabbed the car door. Bai Yingying also came over at this moment. As a zombie, she was, of course, strong. She exerted force with Zhou Ze.\n\nOnly a \"crack\" was heard,\n\nThe car door was directly detached, and Bai Yingying also pressed down the back of the car seat.\n\nDoctor Lin looked on, stunned.\n\nThe bus driver and the few passengers on the bus also looked on, stunned.\n\nThis must be good luck, it was only lightly jammed.\n\nZhou Ze bent down, one hand supporting the person's neck and the other holding their leg, carefully dragging the woman out first. Then, he went to pull out the boy's body.\n\nDoctor Lin first examined the woman's body, her expression solemn. When the boy was pulled out, she examined his body as well, and her expression immediately turned somber.\n\nDead,\n\nBoth were dead.\n\n\"Dead?\" the bus driver asked in disbelief, his face very grim. He was having terrible luck! \"These bastards, coming out late at night to harm people, they've ruined me!\"\n\n\"Call the police and 120,\" Doctor Lin, whose phone was left in the car, shouted to the bus driver.\n\nThough furious, the bus driver still took out his phone to make the call.\n\nZhou Ze, however, turned over both the woman's and the boy's bodies. Doctor Lin looked at Zhou Ze's action, a little puzzled.\n\n\"I just quickly checked them when I pulled them out. They have many external injuries, all caused by the car accident.\n\nHowever, they have one thing in common: there are concave skull injuries at the back of their heads. If I'm not mistaken, these should be fatal injuries.\n\nI think they might have been hit with a hammer wrapped in cotton cloth.\"\n\n\"What does this mean?\" Doctor Lin immediately followed up to examine the wounds at that location, then quickly understood, saying, \"They were already dead before the car accident!\"\n\nYes, otherwise, it would be difficult to explain why two people suffered the same fatal injury in the same spot. It was too coincidental, almost impossible.\n\n\"Dead people were placed in the car, and then it drove against traffic.\" Zhou Ze looked at Doctor Lin, a smile on his face, and said, \"Then it was disguised as a car accident. Quite a good accidental event.\"\n\nImmediately after, Zhou Ze turned his face to look at the bus driver behind him, who was calling the police. The few passengers who had originally been standing around the bus also slowly started to surround them.\n\nThe bus driver also looked at Zhou Ze, a meaningful smile appearing on his face, and said to the person on the other end of the phone:\n\n\"Boss, I'm a bit unlucky. I ran into a few busybodies.\"\n\n---\n* Lord Ye's love of dragons: An idiom that describes someone who pretends to love something but is actually afraid of it.",

    "content": "As a surgeon, Zhou Ze could easily detect abnormalities in the cause of death of a corpse, so forensic pathologists, whose profession aligns with this, could obviously also discover them.\n\nTherefore, in Zhou Ze's view, the staging of this car accident was actually quite a failure; it was merely \"superficial\" and couldn't withstand scrutiny.\n\nHe wondered if these people had other contingencies or methods to perfectly complete this case as an accident, or if they were truly just \"rookies.\"\n\nOf course, now was not the time to ponder this question, because these people seemed disinclined to prolong the discussion.\n\n\"Grab them, then drive their car away.\"\n\nThe bus driver checked the time; time was precious now.\n\nSeveral of his subordinates lunged forward. To them, a thin man and two young women wouldn't cause any trouble.\n\nBai Yingying tilted her head, glancing at Zhou Ze. She was waiting for his command.\n\nDr. Lin stood still. It was clear she was nervous, but she didn't scream or shout, which was already quite remarkable.\n\nMost people facing this situation, even those who usually boasted of having guts as big as the sky, would find it normal to be scared to their knees, begging for mercy and claiming, \"I didn't see anything.\"\n\n\"Don't kill anyone,\" Zhou Ze reminded.\n\n\"Haha,\" the bus owner laughed upon hearing this.\n\nUnfortunately, Zhou Ze wasn't speaking to him.\n\nBai Yingying responded with a cheerful \"Got it!\" and charged forward.\n\nZhou Ze took a step back, grasping Dr. Lin's hand, and said, \"It's alright, I'm here.\"\n\nBai Yingying, charging at the front, almost stumbled.\n\n*I'm out here fighting for my life,* she thought.\n\n*And you're over there being lovey-dovey?*\n\n*Mistress,*\n\n*Oh no, even a maid has dignity, alright!*\n\nDr. Lin pursed her lips and blamed herself, \"I'm sorry.\"\n\nIt was her stopping to help the injured that led them into this crisis, so she apologized.\n\n\"It's just occupational hazard,\" Zhou Ze said with a wry smile. Last time in the cinema, he also rushed in like that. It just goes to show that some professional habits are truly impossible to change.\n\nThe female corpse, having just been fed a mouthful of dog food, instinctively struck a bit harder.\n\n\"Little girl, come here, big brother will show you some love.\"\n\nA man opened his arms, ready to embrace this high school girl.\n\nThe boss wouldn't let them kill here; he intended to take them away. After all, they couldn't linger here for too long.\n\nHowever, his arms embraced empty air.\n\nImmediately after, his left arm was seized by the female corpse.\n\n\"Crack...\"\n\n\"Crack...\"\n\n\"Crack...\"\n\nDr. Lin's body trembled as she listened, and Zhou Ze also found it grating.\n\nHe even felt that if the sound of \"Crispy Corner\" (a type of snack) breaking were used here, it would be more effective than the current \"GG\" sound.\n\nCrispy and crunchy.\n\nThe man's mouth hung open; he couldn't even cry out in pain. The female corpse took another step forward and kicked the man's lower leg.\n\n\"Creak... Creak... Creak...\"\n\nThree more crisp sounds.\n\nPringles could also be used for the \"GG\" sound, Zhou Ze thought.\n\n\"What... the...\"\n\nThe man crumpled to the ground. One arm was completely crippled, and one leg was also completely broken. He lay on the ground like a toad, only able to wail and squirm.\n\nZhou Ze felt no compassion. He forbade the female corpse from killing because matters of the living realm should be handled by the police. He believed that the judicial organs of this country would ensure that all evil would be exposed.\n\nBut these people before him were, after all, cold-blooded murderers who had intended to attack him. Zhou Ze wasn't so overflowing with saintly compassion that he felt sorry for treating them this way.\n\nWho knew what they had intended to do to the three of them just now?\n\nIf he were still the doctor from his past life, and the female corpse were merely a high school girl, then who would pity them?\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\n\"Clang!\"\n\n\"Slap!\"\n\nThe other two men were directly knocked down, also with broken bones. Though not fatal, they were incapacitated.\n\nFrom Zhou Ze's professional perspective, even if these three men on the ground received hospital treatment, they would likely be unable to live independently for the rest of their lives.\n\nThe bus owner's phone dropped and hit the ground.\n\nHe instinctively swallowed,\n\nfeeling that everything before him was so unreal.\n\nHe hadn't brought a shotgun because, according to the plan, he would be facing questioning and investigations from traffic police and the regular police, so he naturally couldn't carry any prohibited items.\n\nHe had originally thought that even with the addition of Zhou Ze and these \"kind-hearted\" people, this matter wouldn't lead to too many variables.\n\nEven if variables appeared, he would still be able to control them.\n\nHowever, the problem was now quite severe, because the girl had walked up to him.\n\n\"I...\" The bus owner, who had just been so brilliant in his acting, couldn't even speak now.\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nThe female corpse reached out and flipped the bus owner directly onto the ground, placing a foot on his neck.\n\n\"Stop for a moment.\"\n\nZhou Ze called out.\n\nThe female corpse stopped without asking why.\n\nZhou Ze walked forward, crouched down, and patted the bus owner's bearded face.\n\nThen he felt he was being redundant and wiped his hand on the female corpse's trouser leg.\n\nThis guy's face was so greasy.\n\n\"...\" The female corpse.\n\n\"Do you have anyone else?\"\n\nWhat Zhou Ze had to consider now was how to eliminate all future troubles. He wasn't afraid himself, but this matter couldn't be kept under wraps. What if they dealt with the small fish, and the big fish escaped, retaliating against Dr. Lin?\n\nThere's no such thing as being able to guard against a thief for a thousand days.\n\nEarlier, the little loli had mentioned that there was someone like her in Rong City, overstepping bounds and acting as a judge. Zhou Ze naturally couldn't follow in their footsteps.\n\nAlthough emotionally, Zhou Ze truly admired him and found him impressive and ambitious.\n\nBut this matter had already affected his daily life, so he had to personally take action and bring it to a close.\n\nThe female corpse directly smashed down on the bus owner's left arm.\n\n\"Creak...\"\n\n\"Ahhh!!! No more, no more... It's just us few. We all met while working... Just us few. We were hired by an employer.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded, then looked at the female corpse and said, \"Is there any way to make them forget this incident?\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't want to cause trouble, nor did he want to make the news.\n\nThe female corpse made a throat-slitting gesture.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. He couldn't kill them, at least not by himself.\n\n\"Or, boss, you can prick them with your fingernail a little. It can make them disoriented for a while, like they're drunk, and then they'll black out.\"\n\n\"How much to prick?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Just a little, otherwise they might actually die. Also, I know you don't want to cause trouble, boss. After you go back, burn all the remaining joss paper you have, and trouble won't come knocking.\n\nBut then, probably no one will throw money in front of the shop either.\"\n\nZhou Ze looked up at Dr. Lin in the distance, then silently walked to each of the thugs lying on the ground, subtly pricking them one by one with the black nail that had grown on his little finger. All these individuals trembled, foamed at the mouth, and then quickly lost consciousness.\n\nBut, none were in life-threatening danger.\n\nScanning the surroundings, there didn't seem to be any cameras here, otherwise they wouldn't have chosen this spot for staging an accident. Zhou Ze picked up one of their phones, dialed the emergency number, and then threw the phone away.\n\nAfter all that was done, Zhou Ze waved to Dr. Lin, then got back into her car.\n\nDr. Lin also got into the driver's seat.\n\n\"Drive away first, don't stop here,\" Zhou Ze reminded her.\n\n\"Okay.\" Dr. Lin took a deep breath and started the car.\n\n\"Don't tell anyone about this.\"\n\nZhou Ze reminded her while the car was moving.\n\n\"Why?\" Dr. Lin clearly couldn't quite understand.\n\nZhou Ze pointed behind them,\n\n\"She's a practitioner of Tai Chi Bagua Palm. She accidentally crippled someone during a sparring match, so she fled to me. She just saved me, so our identities can't be exposed, otherwise she'd be arrested by the police.\"\n\nThe female corpse in the back rolled her eyes.\n\n*He's telling lies that wouldn't even fool a ghost.*\n\nDr. Lin remained silent, unsure if she truly believed him, and simply continued driving without a word.\n\nThe car was still heading towards People's Hospital. For Dr. Lin, even if Zhou Ze hadn't said where to go initially, she would have instinctively driven there. After all, it was her workplace, and she could feel safe there.\n\nThe car drove into the People's Hospital parking lot, and all three got out.\n\nDr. Lin didn't ask Zhou Ze where he was going. She couldn't have guessed that the place Zhou Ze wanted to go was actually the emergency room. She simply walked forward in silence.\n\nThe female corpse leaned close to Zhou Ze's ear and whispered, \"Are you still confessing tonight?\"\n\nShe was very clever; from details like Lin Wanqiu buying Zhou Ze's former house, she had already deduced many inside stories.\n\n\"It's not a Qiong Yao drama; why would I make it so melodramatic?\" Zhou Ze shrugged.\n\nAlthough there was a small interlude on the road that left Dr. Lin somewhat distraught, Zhou Ze didn't intend to abandon his original plan.\n\nSuch a woman, and the legal wife of his current body,\n\nIf he didn't tell her the truth so she could sleep peacefully with him tonight,\n\nWas he out of his mind?\n\nConcealing things, taking roundabout paths, making it a song and dance, then being hysterical—that was Aunt Qiong Yao's preferred style. He, Zhou Ze, didn't like it.\n\nDr. Lin sat down on a long bench at the parking lot exit, and Zhou Ze sat beside her.\n\nThe female corpse very tactfully didn't approach them.\n\nThey sat side by side.\n\nLin Wanqiu took a deep breath. Her beautiful face appeared even more exquisite in the moonlight.\n\nZhou Ze admired her from beside her.\n\nTo have such a beautiful woman, and such a good-looking married woman…\n\nwho had been longing for him, who had died more than half a year ago,\n\nThe sense of accomplishment was truly overwhelming.\n\n\"Is what happened just now really alright?\" Dr. Lin clearly hadn't fully detached herself from the recent events.\n\n\"We didn't do anything wrong, did we?\" Zhou Ze comforted her.\n\nDr. Lin nodded.\n\n\"Just like those brave anti-drug police officers, they also conceal their identities, and their families do too. This is to ensure their safety. It's a great sacrifice they make.\"\n\n\"So, you're afraid of retaliation?\"\n\n\"Mm.\"\n\n\"Okay, I understand.\" Dr. Lin nodded.\n\nZhou Ze raised his hand, preparing to embrace the woman, and then it would be \"time to witness a miracle.\" But Dr. Lin spoke first:\n\n\"What exactly is your relationship with her?\n\nXu Le, please answer me seriously. This time, no matter what you say, I'll believe it,\" Dr. Lin asked Zhou Ze, \"and I'll forgive everything.\"\n\n\"It's really nothing,\" Zhou Ze said with a wry smile. He could only say that both times were too coincidental.\n\nDr. Lin fell silent again. Just as Zhou Ze was about to speak, Dr. Lin actively reached out and clasped Zhou Ze's hand. Zhou Ze was stunned for a moment.\n\n\"Xu Le, I'm sorry. I've always loved another man. You must have already realized it, otherwise you wouldn't have appeared in that house.\n\nAlthough that man and I are innocent, I admit I cheated emotionally. I'm sorry, because you are my nominal husband.\"\n\n\"It's no...\"\n\nJust as Zhou Ze was about to speak, Dr. Lin spoke again:\n\n\"I've thought through our situation.\n\nI'll give you two choices:\n\nOne, we get a divorce. I'll compensate you one million, and the bookstore is also yours.\"\n\n\"What divorce?\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Two, I will try hard to forget that man, and I will genuinely choose to live with you, to be your... true wife, to make up for what I owed you before.\n\nXu Le, I am willing to try and give you everything I have, fulfilling a wife's duties and responsibilities.\"\n\nAs she spoke these words, Dr. Lin's eyes reddened. She had resigned herself to her fate.\n\n\"Okay... wait a minute.\"\n\nZhou Ze's mind was a bit muddled for a moment; this relationship was a bit tangled, and he needed to sort it out. Then Zhou Ze finally understood the details, and in anger, he immediately stood up, pointing at Dr. Lin and speaking somewhat incoherently:\n\n\"No,\n\nYou have to keep cheating!\"\n\n\"...\" Dr. Lin.\n\n\"Pfft...\" The female corpse, who had been pretending to look at the scenery but was actually eavesdropping on the gossip with her superhuman hearing, burst out laughing directly,\n\nThen she clutched her stomach and squatted down,\n\n\"Hahahaha, my tummy hurts from laughing!\"\n\n————\n\nLong is very happy to see everyone's active presence in the chapter comments. This indicates the popularity of a book. Long reads the chapter comments several times for each chapter and also records everyone's excellent reviews.\n\nTherefore, the friendly joke everyone made before about \"the first comment makes a lot of sense,\" please don't make it again, and don't intentionally spam that kind of reply. Try to discuss the plot normally.\n\nBecause,\n\nIt affects Long's ability to copy book reviews!\n\nFinally, an announcement: \"Midnight Bookstore\" will be released on April 1st!\n\nAnd then, in the chapter on March 31st, Chuan'er will return to this book.\n\nTo make up for Long's regrets, and also to make up for everyone's regrets,\n\nAnd then,\n\nOn the day it's released, we'll reclaim the achievements that belong to us!",

    "content": "\"No, you must continue cheating!\"\n\n\"............\" Dr. Lin.\n\nDr. Lin's red lips parted slightly, a mix of bewilderment and confusion on her face.\n\nHad her \"husband\" not forgiven her yet?\n\nOr did her \"husband\" simply have a certain affinity for being cuckolded?\n\nUnder the weight of guilt and pressure, Dr. Lin had chosen to compromise. In truth, of the two conditions she offered, any choice-maker who wasn't foolish or overly naive would surely pick the second.\n\nThe first was to take a million plus a failing bookstore.\n\nThe second was to get both her person and her money. With her person, why would a million *yuan* still be lacking?\n\nBesides, she wasn't an ugly rich woman.\n\nHowever, for Zhou Ze, the situation he faced was even more difficult.\n\n*I've been busy for half a day, and now you say you want to forget me and contentedly settle down with that little bastard Xu Le?*\n\nZhou Ze absolutely couldn't allow this to happen.\n\nOriginally, he was the one cuckolding someone else, feeling great, a sense of accomplishment *biu biu biu*.\n\nNow that he was the one being cuckolded, it wasn't so pleasant.\n\nZhou Ze reached out, pointing at his own face, and said very seriously:\n\n\"I'm not Xu Le, I'm Zhou Ze.\"\n\nDr. Lin was stunned.\n\nAfter a long silence between the two,\n\nDr. Lin finally sighed and said,\n\n\"No matter what you choose, I admit I'm sorry for you, but you shouldn't play tricks on me like this. Or, do you still hold a grudge?\"\n\nZhou Ze shrugged. \"I really am Zhou Ze. I died in a car accident, but woke up inexplicably and transmigrated into this guy's body. I don't know if you usually read novels and TV shows, but transmigration plots shouldn't be that uncommon, right?\"\n\n\"Whatever you say... I guess that's what it is.\" Dr. Lin humored him.\n\nBut Zhou Ze knew that the woman in front of him probably planned to contact a psychologist for him tomorrow. If she were more extreme, she might even forcibly send him to a psychiatric hospital.\n\nIn the distance, the sound of an ambulance echoed, and the hospital building suddenly became a hive of activity.\n\n\"I'll go check.\" Dr. Lin stood up, intending to temporarily abandon her conversation with her \"husband.\" In her opinion, her \"husband\" had suffered a considerable mental shock.\n\nBut precisely because of this, she felt even more guilty towards Xu Le.\n\nThe female corpse, who had been eavesdropping on the gossip, came up behind Zhou Ze after seeing Dr. Lin walk away and said,\n\n\"Boss, why didn't you let her see your nail fungus?\"\n\n\"Or let her check if you're cold?\" Zhou Ze retorted.\n\nThe female corpse pouted and said, \"It's not impossible, I guess. If she stuck her hand in and felt, she'd understand.\"\n\n\"I want it to be more aesthetic,\" Zhou Ze said. \"As gentle as possible.\"\n\n\"Pretentious,\" the female corpse dared to mock her boss at this moment.\n\n\"Yes, pretentious. Weren't you also pretentious when you, a young lady from a good family, secretly met with a poor scholar?\" Zhou Ze stretched. \"Come on, follow me in.\"\n\n\"To the hospital?\"\n\n\"Nonsense. With such a big commotion over there, it must be a major accident. There must be many injured, and the chief resident in the emergency department must be short-staffed. Those interns don't have enough experience or guts to handle this situation.\"\n\nZhou Ze spoke as he and the female corpse walked into the hospital and directly turned into the staff changing room.\n\n\"But boss, what does that have to do with you?\"\n\nZhou Ze chose a white coat roughly his size, put it on, and tied on a mask.\n\n\"I was a doctor in my previous life. Dr. Lin was an intern I supervised back then.\"\n\n\"Hehe, teacher-student romance.\" The female corpse also put on a white coat, her voice tinged with excitement. \"Boss, what should I do?\"\n\n\"Pick some background music for me,\" Zhou Ze said, pulling on his gloves.\n\n\"BGM?\" The female corpse paused.\n\n\"Because I'm about to show off.\"\n\nZhou Ze took a deep breath, then exhaled heavily.\n\nA familiar feeling.\n\n*I'm back.*\n\n............\n\n\"Doctors today are so different from doctors in my time,\" the female corpse said, feeling a bit awkward in her nurse's uniform.\n\n\"Mhm,\" Zhou Ze said noncommittally.\n\n\"It makes me feel a bit lost,\" the female corpse mused. \"I feel like I'm out of touch with this world. Looks like I'll have to go out more often in the future.\" The female corpse said tentatively.\n\n\"Stop messing around. You even know what Wanchai Pier* means, and you still have the nerve to say you're out of touch?\" Zhou Ze quickly countered.\n\nThe female corpse stuck out her tongue and said, \"Boss, what kind of doctor were you before? I hear being an obstetrician is quite good.\"\n\n\"You read novels in your coffin?\" Zhou Ze retorted.\n\n\"What?\" The female corpse was confused.\n\n\"Golden ophthalmology, silver surgery, dirty and tiring obstetrics and gynecology.\"\n\nZhou Ze smiled. \"Only those outsiders who don't know, or those influenced by other literary works, would think that obstetrics and gynecology is wonderful and leisurely.\"\n\nJust then, the elevator opened, and a stretcher cart was pushed out by several porters.\n\nZhou Ze immediately walked over and asked, \"What happened?\"\n\nThe intern instinctively replied as if addressing his \"master,\" \"Patient is unconscious.\"\n\nZhou Ze's gaze sharpened. He immediately flipped onto the stretcher cart, performing chest compressions while shouting,\n\n\"Quick, push to the emergency room!\"\n\nAt that moment, several porters and nurses pushed the stretcher cart inside together. Many patients and family members in the corridor had to quickly make way.\n\n\"Clear the way!\" Zhou Ze shouted.\n\nDr. Lin, who had just finished treating a patient's wound, wiped the sweat from her forehead and walked out. She froze at the sight of the figure kneeling on the stretcher cart, performing CPR.\n\nThen she immediately ran over.\n\n*What is he trying to do?*\n\n*This is a hospital!*\n\nUpon reaching the emergency room, Zhou Ze immediately ordered, \"Push the crash cart, prepare for intubation!\"\n\n\"Yes!\" the intern responded. The surrounding nurses, seeing the intern comply, naturally followed the orders.\n\nThey each assumed that others knew this new doctor, which was the biggest misunderstanding. Of course, this was also because of the urgent situation, plus Zhou Ze's tone and command truly didn't give away that he was a \"fake doctor.\"\n\nZhou Ze stood at the head of the bed, personally performing the intubation.\n\nAt the same time, he extended his hand to the left: \"Stylet.\"\n\n\"Yes!\" The nurse immediately handed the item to Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze then said to the intern beside him, \"Listen for placement.\"\n\n\"Okay.\" The intern, who had been a bit nervous before, was no longer nervous. Many young doctors are like this: technically proficient but not suited to lead alone, more suited to be a grunt under someone's command.\n\nHe put on his stethoscope and began to listen for placement, then nodded to Zhou Ze, \"Placement is fine.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded. \"Switch, keep compressing.\"\n\n\"Yes!\"\n\nAnother nurse immediately came over to replace the previous one, continuing the CPR.\n\nAt this point, a nurse looked at the monitor next to them and exclaimed, \"Patient is in ventricular fibrillation.\"\n\nZhou Ze looked up. \"Prepare for defibrillation.\"\n\n\"Understood.\"\n\nThe intern immediately took out scissors and cut open the patient's clothes. Zhou Ze took over from the previous nurse and began to personally perform CPR, saying at the same time,\n\n\"Charge to two hundred joules.\"\n\n\"Understood.\" The nurse immediately prepared, then said, \"Charging complete.\"\n\nAt this moment, Dr. Lin pushed aside the curtain and walked in, seeing the figure organizing the resuscitation.\n\nYes, it was Xu Le, her husband.\n\nDr. Lin pointed at Zhou Ze. She was furious. She didn't know what was wrong with her husband. He had just told her he was Zhou Ze, and she thought he might be delusional, but she absolutely would not allow him to gamble with a patient's life!\n\n\"Prepare to discharge, clear!\" Zhou Ze warned those around him, then specifically stared at Dr. Lin.\n\nDr. Lin's body trembled, a familiar feeling washing over her.\n\nA familiar scene,\n\nA familiar tone,\n\nA familiar style.\n\nAt this moment, she couldn't even speak.\n\nAfter the first defibrillation, Zhou Ze continued CPR, his gaze fixed on the monitor.\n\nBut the situation didn't improve. Zhou Ze directly said, \"Again, charge to two hundred joules!\"\n\n\"Yes!\" The nurse prepared again, then said, \"Charging complete.\"\n\n\"Clear!\"\n\nZhou Ze performed defibrillation again.\n\nUnder the electrical shock, the patient's entire body trembled.\n\nThe intern beside him continued CPR.\n\nZhou Ze looked at the monitor, which finally showed a return to normal.\n\n\"Restore power, get an ECG.\" Zhou Ze said to the intern beside him.\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\nThe intern immediately went to prepare, then handed the ECG report paper to Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze took it and glanced at it, saying, \"Acute myocardial infarction. Contact cardiology. Prepare for emergency PCI immediately.\"\n\n\"Okay, understood.\" The intern wiped his sweat and let out a long sigh of relief.\n\nZhou Ze also walked out of the emergency room at this moment.\n\nDr. Lin stood outside, looking at him with suspicion, disbelief, excitement, and also fear.\n\nZhou Ze directly reprimanded,\n\n\"What are you standing around for? There are so many patients. Go save people!\n\nIf you want to cry or be scared, wait until after work and go home and hide in bed, hugging a doll and crying.\"\n\nDr. Lin immediately burst into tears.\n\nHe had lectured her like that back then too.\n\nThe next moment,\n\nDr. Lin rushed over, wrapping her arms around Zhou Ze, pressing her face directly against his chest.\n\nZhou Ze was stunned.\n\nHe had anticipated many reactions from Dr. Lin after his confession:\n\nFear?\n\nBreakdown?\n\nTerror?\n\nBut he had never expected this scene.\n\n*Holy shit,*\n\n*She's throwing herself into my arms just like that?*\n\n*That's it? It's okay now?*\n\nZhou Ze had always been curious how he, such a blunt and unromantic person, had managed to win the heart of Dr. Lin, who was a little innocent girl back then.\n\nNow he seemed to understand a little.\n\nDid Dr. Lin have Stockholm Syndrome?\n\nAfter being lectured and scolded, she actually fell for him instead?\n\nHowever, it seemed women with this syndrome might also accept certain bedroom \"tastes\" that ordinary people find unacceptable...?\n\nHehe;\nTranslator's note:\n*灣仔碼頭 (Wanchai Pier): A famous brand of frozen dumplings in China, often sold in supermarkets.

    "content": "The twilight sun was like a crimson apple, or a little sister’s face, baked till rosy.\n\nZhou Ze sat in the bookstore, organizing the latest batch of bills. The bookstore's operations had fallen into financial straits, the key issue being the meager inheritance he received from Xu Le. If not for reclaiming his share from the pirated booksellers, the shop might not have been able to continue operating.\n\nThe night he returned from the hospital, Zhou Ze burned all the remaining Hell Bank Notes. He then squatted at the doorway, smoking half a pack of cigarettes and waiting for a while. Indeed, no one came to drop off money.\n\nAccording to the female corpse, this was called using yin de (merit from good deeds) to ward off disaster. The Hell Bank Notes given by a ghost were equivalent to yin de; when you needed money, you could \"exchange\" them for it, and when you needed to avoid trouble, you could use them to cancel out problems.\n\nThe previous incident had been reported in the news: a wealthy man hired someone to murder his wife. There was a rumor that the suspect claimed a high school girl appeared and beat them up, though no one believed it. It wasn't like she was a Sailor Moon character. In any case, that matter concluded, and Zhou Ze’s Hell Bank Notes weren't burned in vain.\n\nXu Qinglang came over from next door, holding two cups of tea in his hands. His lifestyle was becoming increasingly refined. Originally a diligent and aspiring young man, after acquiring over twenty properties, he finally succumbed to indulgence and a decadent pace of life.\n\nThe two sat by the counter, drinking tea together.\n\n\"What happened with your wife in the end?\" Xu Qinglang asked.\n\n\"She said she needed some quiet time and some time to think,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\nThe confession process was very smooth, almost too smooth. Dr. Lin’s affection for him had even begun to verge on the \"pathological,\" but fortunately, she was still a rational person. Xu Le was dead, and he, Zhou Ze, had returned to life in Xu Le's body. With all these incredible things happening before her, it would be difficult for her to accept it all at once and continue a shamelessly happy life with her \"dream lover\" and \"current husband.\"\n\n\"That's already good. She's stronger than I imagined,\" Xu Qinglang smiled. \"Most people would probably be scared out of their minds.\"\n\nZhou Ze was noncommittal. Xu Qinglang shouldn't have known about this, so someone obviously leaked it. The leaker didn't need to be sought out; it was clearly Ms. Bai Yingying.\n\n\"By the way, I have a question for you,\" Zhou Ze asked seriously. \"Was Xu Le so hard up when he first opened the shop?\"\n\n\"No, I thought he lived quite comfortably. But I didn't interact much with him before he died; he was a very dull guy, totally boring. But he must have had a lot of money; I remember he often helped out his relatives at the bookstore, very generous.\"\n\nAfter speaking, Xu Qinglang glanced at Zhou Ze again, even sticking out his tongue and licking his lips. \"You're much more interesting.\"\n\nFor a moment, his waist swayed, and his eyes were like waves, truly captivating.\n\n\"It's a shame you didn't become a gigolo; you could have been the Gigolo King of your generation.\"\n\n\"Can we not have a proper conversation?\" Xu Qinglang said, annoyed.\n\n\"That's a compliment.\"\n\n\"Heh...\" Xu Qinglang pointed at Zhou Ze. \"You should worry about yourself.\"\n\n\"Worry about what?\" Zhou Ze gestured to the bookstore. \"Business hasn't been good lately. Not only are there few living people, but there are hardly any ghosts either.\"\n\n\"How do you plan to develop your relationship with your doctor wife? I think she just needs some time to adjust, and then she'll accept it. After all, with a woman like her, honestly, you've hit the jackpot. Who would've thought that in this day and age, someone like an ancient young lady from a good family would appear? Her parents must be eccentric too.\"\n\n\"Hmm.\" Zhou Ze nodded. His in-laws were indeed eccentric. His father-in-law had been a hospital director and had also run a medical company. By all accounts, he should have been an absolute success, yet in some ways, he was very feudal and stubborn.\n\n\"Once you tame a woman like that, she'll willingly be a good wife and mother,\" Xu Qinglang said with a look of yearning. \"I want a woman like that too.\"\n\n\"You already are one,\" Zhou Ze quipped.\n\n\"Let's get back to your problem. You're going to live with her, right?\"\n\n\"Probably,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Then you'll definitely sleep together, right?\" Xu Qinglang stretched out his hand, wiggled it, and continued, \"When I say 'sleep,' I mean a verb that includes many complex actions and special positions. You understand, right?\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded, still not understanding what Xu Qinglang was getting at.\n\n\"Okay, so here's your problem: you're currently using Xu Le's body. If you two actually 'sleep' together, doesn't that mean Xu Le is cuckolding you?\"\n\nXu Qinglang narrowed his eyes; at this moment, he smiled mischievously.\n\nThen, Zhou Ze fell into thought.\n\n\"Even your DNA isn't your original DNA; it's Xu Le's. So, the child you have after going through this extremely complex and rich verb, 'sleep,' isn't actually your child, but Xu Le's and Lin Wanqiu's. Right?\"\n\nThen, Zhou Ze fell into thought again.\n\nXu Qinglang spoke with increasing enthusiasm, watching Zhou Ze remain silent, feeling an unspeakable delight! When Mrs. Bai had her subordinates carry him over in an eight-man sedan chair, it was Zhou Ze who secretly pointed a finger at him. He had written down that grudge!\n\nZhou Ze took a sip of water, showing no emotion.\n\n\"Do you feel very anxious and bewildered?\" Xu Qinglang asked.\n\n\"I'm the one who's enjoying it,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\nXu Qinglang frowned and continued, \"But this body is Xu Le's. When you sleep with her, it's Xu Le's body.\"\n\n\"I'm the one who's enjoying it.\"\n\n\"But the child's DNA...\"\n\n\"I'm the one who's enjoying it.\"\n\nXu Qinglang slapped the counter hard and snapped, \"Damn it, you can't be so open-minded!\"\n\n\"Anyway, I'm the one who's enjoying it. That guy Xu Le has long gone to hell, who knows where he ended up. Maybe he even drank the Meng Po soup and reincarnated. Why should I care about that? As long as I'm enjoying it.\"\n\nXu Qinglang's chest heaved with anger. He didn't know why he was angry, but he was just so frustrated!\n\n\"Alright, let's stop this. Any more and it'll turn into a debate about the spirit and the flesh, reaching the height of philosophy,\" Zhou Ze said, signaling an end to the somewhat boring discussion.\n\n\"Whatever makes you happy,\" Xu Qinglang said, full of resentment.\n\n\"Oh, by the way, there's something else I need to ask you,\" Zhou Ze remembered another matter.\n\n\"Speak.\"\n\n\"Do you know any other ghost messengers?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"I used to live with the souls of my parents; would I dare to get to know ghost messengers?\" Xu Qinglang retorted.\n\n\"Okay, I understand.\"\n\nIt seemed he still needed to find time to go to the Confucius Temple. The drumming dwarfish old man he saw last time should also be on the payroll.\n\n\"What exactly do you want to ask?\" Xu Qinglang asked.\n\n\"I want to ask if ghost messengers have performance reviews or anything like that—promotions, raises, benefits.\"\n\n\"They should... have them, right?\" Xu Qinglang thought for a moment. \"Look at Mrs. Bai; she was able to accumulate merit and go from a ghost lingering in the human world back to the Underworld to seek an official position. You should have something similar. Didn't that little loli tell you?\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head.\n\n\"I also think your ghost messenger role came a bit too easily. I reckon she probably had some other serious matter to deal with, so she temporarily dumped the job on you to handle.\"\n\n\"You mean, I'm really just a temporary worker?\"\n\n\"Heh heh, once she's done dealing with her affairs, you'll probably have to vacate the position. If she's in a good mood, she might turn a blind eye; if she's in a bad mood, she could just drag you back to the Underworld.\"\n\n\"What exactly is she going to deal with?\" Zhou Ze muttered to himself.\n\nImmediately after, a scene flashed in Zhou Ze's mind: the young man eating porridge in the old Taoist priest's livestream.\n\nRongcheng,\n冥店 (Underworld Store/Paper Incense Shop)?\n\nConsidering the little loli's reaction when he mentioned Rongcheng, it seemed quite possible.\n\nBut no matter what, he couldn't easily give up this temporary worker status. Living as an unregistered ghost was not comfortable.\n\nXu Qinglang went back to his shop, telling Zhou Ze \"Happy Lantern Festival\" as he left.\n\nZhou Ze was also tidying up, while instructing Bai Yingying to go out and buy him a few packs of cigarettes and some yuanzi (glutinous rice balls). He had to change his plans; he would go to the Confucius Temple tonight to chat with that dwarfish old man.\n\nJust then, the bookstore door was pushed open, and a man in a white down jacket walked in.\n\n\"Brother A-Le! I'm here to pick up my dad from the hospital.\"\n\nZhou Ze paused, then began to ponder, roughly guessing the man's identity. He must be the son of his elder uncle, younger than him, and a paternal cousin to Xu Le. Xu Dachuan had come to the city to see him last time and suffered a minor fracture in a car accident on his way out. Zhou Ze had visited him once, and Dr. Lin had covered the medical expenses, so he hadn't paid much attention since.\n\n\"Hello,\" Zhou Ze responded somewhat coolly.\n\n\"Brother A-Le, I'm a bit short on cash lately. You see, my dad fell, and he'll need at least two months of recuperation at home; he can't go out and work to earn money.\"\n\nThe cousin smiled at Zhou Ze.\n\n\"I've already given Uncle some nutritional expenses,\" Zhou Ze had given some, but Xu Dachuan refused to accept them, so Zhou Ze secretly tucked them into his clothes.\n\n\"Hey, Brother A-Le, I recently started dating a new girlfriend, and I'm a little tight on cash. Brother, could you help your little brother out?\" The cousin was asking directly.\n\n\"Business isn't good here,\" Zhou Ze had no intention of giving him money.\n\n\"Brother, that's not cool,\" the cousin said unhappily. \"I was the one who helped you with that thing last time.\"\n\n\"What thing?\"\n\n\"Brother, don't be ungrateful, forgetting about it after the job is done? I'm telling you, I'm not shamelessly asking for money; have I come to you to ask for money at all in the past six months? Last time, that driver promised he wouldn't spill the beans. Besides, he's been locked up for six months already and will be out in another half a year or so. He'd be stupid to blurt it out, right? He's definitely tight-lipped, or else it would have changed from illegal driving to intentional murder. Little brother is really short on cash this time, Brother. Just lend me a thousand or two; I'll pay you back when I have money, okay?\"\n\nZhou Ze picked up the teacup on the counter. Hearing this, he suddenly frowned slightly and said, \"What are you talking about? I don't understand.\"\n\n\"Brother, are you really planning to kick me to the curb after crossing the river?\nSix months ago, you asked me to find a truck driver and pay him to deliberately run over that doctor,\nYou can't forget my contribution...\"\n\n\"Crack...\"\n\nThe glass cup in Zhou Ze's hand was directly crushed.",

    "content": "“Brother Ah Le?” The cousin watched Zhou Ze crush the glass and saw blood continuously dripping from Zhou Ze's palm. The cousin was so scared that he instinctively took several steps back.\n\n“Brother Ah Le, if you’re short on money, just forget it, really, just forget it.” The cousin was clearly scared, his voice tinged with a slight sob.\n\nThey were like grasshoppers tied to the same rope, so there was no question of one threatening the other. Of course, he initially just wanted to leverage this favor for more money.\n\nIf he pushed his cousin too hard…\n\nYes, his cousin was the mastermind, and he?\n\nHe was also a participant, even acting as a go-between. His crime might not be lighter than his cousin’s. As for the truck driver, he was practically the killer.\n\nSo, he didn’t dare to push his cousin too hard. He was also afraid.\n\nZhou Ze finally understood why Xu Le had so little money after Zhou Ze’s soul possessed Xu Le’s body. The bookstore’s losses were one reason; the other was that Xu Le had spent most of his money on that matter.\n\nHow absurd,\n\nHow ridiculous,\n\nIn the end,\n\nThe cause of his own death turned out to be such a result.\n\nZhou Ze slumped back into the chair, looking at the glass shards stuck in his palm and his blood continuously dripping.\n\nHe didn’t try to stop the bleeding, nor did he feel much pain,\n\nIn fact, he found it quite interesting.\n\nEven the most excellent black comedy couldn’t write the irony he was feeling right now, could it?\n\nThe man he had always thought was so cowardly,\n\nSo spineless,\n\nSo useless,\n\nEven so humble that he felt a little pity for him,\n\nWas actually the mastermind who hired someone to kill him!\n\nEverything, in a circular fashion, seemed to have returned to a complete circle.\n\nYes,\n\nYou could say that karma is a bitch!\n\nYes,\n\nYou could interpret it as fate’s decree!\n\nYes,\n\nYou could cheer that heaven has eyes, that what goes around comes around!\n\nBut these were all the views of bystanders. From their perspective, they expected to see a story of evil conclude with a villain being punished and a good person being compensated.\n\nThis would make bystanders feel very secure and good,\n\nMaking them feel good during dinner and eat a few more bites of rice.\n\nHowever,\n\nWho could pay for his original life?\n\nZhou Ze slightly lowered his head. His body began to twitch slowly.\n\nAn intense feeling of anger began to consume his entire being.\n\nDr. Zhou,\n\nDirector Zhou,\n\nHe had walked out of the orphanage, every step fraught with thorns, every step difficult!\n\nHe had no connections, no background, yet he had climbed the ranks in the hospital system purely by his own effort and ability, adhering to his medical ethics while hoping to achieve greater success and a higher position.\n\nHe had been trembling with fear, walking on thin ice!\n\nHe had finally reached that position at that age,\n\nHe had finally made a name for himself in the field with his medical skills,\n\nHow much sweat had he poured into it?\n\nNight after night, lying in bed, he would motivate and encourage himself,\n\nEven, how many times had he bitten his teeth and swallowed his frustrations!\n\nIt’s all gone,\n\nAll gone!\n\nAll because of this bastard, this good-for-nothing,\n\nHe discovered his wife’s secret crush on him,\n\nHis own wife wouldn’t sleep with him,\n\nHe felt wronged,\n\nHe was angry,\n\nHe was indignant!\n\nHe wouldn’t reflect on why he had lost all dignity and willingly became a live-in son-in-law,\n\nHe wouldn’t reflect on why he was looked down upon everywhere,\n\nHe wouldn’t reflect on himself,\n\nNor would he introspect,\n\nHe directed his anger at himself!\n\nIf he truly had an illicit relationship with his wife, then it would be understandable,\n\nBut at that time, he had long forgotten the little intern girl he had mentored years ago!\n\nHe was completely unaware,\n\nBut on his way home from work, at a traffic light intersection where he was carrying a cake and gifts to celebrate Children’s Day with the kids at the orphanage,\n\nThat truck driver, who had been paid,\n\nSimply stepped on the gas,\n\nAnd directly crushed the life he had so hard fought for!\n\n“Brother Ah Le, um, I’m leaving now. Please take care of yourself.”\n\nThe cousin didn’t dare to stay there any longer. He turned and pushed open the bookstore’s glass door, leaving. He still had to pick up his father from the hospital. Besides, with Zhou Ze in his current state, he was genuinely afraid of irritating his cousin, who usually seemed a bit sickly and gentle but could be terrifying when he got serious!\n\n“I’m going to kill that guy, kill him! With the money I got from her, kill him AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!”\n\nThe cousin still remembered that evening half a year ago, when his cousin placed several stacks of money in front of him, his face contorted as he said those words.\n\nThis cousin, whom he had secretly ridiculed behind his back, thinking he was spineless, cowardly, even willing to marry into a wealthy family as a live-in son-in-law, so much so that his own children couldn’t even bear his surname,\n\nOn that dusk,\n\nCompletely changed the image he had of him in his mind.\n\nWatching his cousin’s retreating back, Zhou Ze’s bleeding hand, his fingernails repeatedly growing out and receding.\n\nWisps of black energy continuously swirled around his fingertips.\n\nZhou Ze’s eyes also showed a violent intermingling of blood red and black light.\n\nThis was his enemy,\n\nOne of the masterminds who murdered him.\n\nHe wanted to keep this person forever,\n\nHe wanted Bai Yingying to treat this person as food, suck all the blood out of him, and turn him into a dried corpse!\n\nBut he, just walked away,\n\nAnd Zhou Ze, from beginning to end,\n\nDid not strike.\n\nHe didn't even stand up and shout “Stop.”\n\nReason,\n\nThis damned reason,\n\nThis desperate, almost maddening reason!\n\nZhou Ze knew he couldn’t kill him.\n\nEven if he didn’t consider the other consequences of taking revenge as a ghost messenger,\n\nJust speaking of killing him,\n\nWhat would the driver in prison think after learning about it?\n\nWould he think he was eliminating witnesses?\n\nThen, would he have to kill that driver too?\n\nYes, the driver was the primary killer who murdered him!\n\nIt was that damned bastard who, that night, kept staring at him, then ran a red light at the intersection and intentionally hit him!\n\nHis cousin deserved to die,\n\nAnd that driver deserved to die even more!\n\nBut if both of them were killed, no matter what method was used to hide or arrange an accidental scene,\n\nThe police would definitely find something unusual.\n\nAt that point, a clear line would emerge!\n\nActually,\n\nThe most crucial thing was that the person who truly spent money to hire a killer was the current Zhou Ze!\n\nHe was the true mastermind!\n\nIf he sought revenge and killed them, it would expose him.\n\nThey had already ruined his first life,\n\nSo,\n\nShould he ruin the opportunity he had so painstakingly obtained through soul transference because of them?\n\nRuin himself,\n\nHis second life now?\n\nZhou Ze clenched his fists and slammed them heavily on the counter.\n\n“Bang!”\n\nA wave of dizziness,\n\nZhou Ze staggered, retreating several steps, his back against the corner of the wall, and slowly sat down.\n\nHis bloodied hands covered his eyes,\n\nHis other hand unconsciously scraped against the tile.\n\nYou are furious,\n\nBut you have no way to vent,\n\nThis,\n\nGoddamn life!\n\nThis dog-day justice,\n\nThis utterly bastardly karma!\n\nIn my past life, I saved many people, and helped many people!!!\n\nTears streamed down Zhou Ze’s face,\n\nEveryone has their moments of weakness. The only thing they can do is cover their tear-filled eyes with their hands;\n\nEveryone also has moments when they curse heaven and earth and complain about injustice. Not everyone is a pure robot who can always calmly analyze themselves when facing difficulties.\n\nIn his previous life, Zhou Ze believed he had never done anything to be ashamed of. In his hands, many patients’ lives were saved, and many people’s lives and families were rescued by him.\n\nHe didn't let himself go, nor did he join the corrupt. Even with a strong ambition to climb and advance, he still adhered to his duties as a person and a doctor. Because of this, when he climbed, the difficulties he faced and the effort required were greater than those who were willing to humble themselves!\n\nIn the corner of the counter, there was a piece of ghost money,\n\nIt must have been one of the remaining pieces of paper he burned after returning that night.\n\nAs Bai Yingying said, ghost money given by the dead is equivalent to Yin virtue.\n\nHeh,\n\nPerhaps it was because heaven saw he had accumulated too much virtue in his previous life, so this life, it gave him compensation.\n\nAllowing him to \"reincarnate,\" directly having a beautiful wife, a bookstore, and even, to show its \"enlightened ruler\" wisdom,\n\nAllowing him to come out of hell, his soul swaying on the roadside, on the verge of collapsing and dissipating,\n\nAnd stumble upon Xu Le, who had been accidentally killed by a petty thief.\n\nAllowing him to inherit Xu Le’s life.\n\nMaking this person, who was originally the mastermind behind his murder, pay the price that, in the eyes of Heaven, was deserved.\n\nBut… who asked Zhou Ze if he agreed?\n\nSo much so that,\n\nHe is now,\n\nUnable to even exact revenge!\n\nWhen that bastard walked up to him and talked about hiring someone to run over that doctor,\n\nHe could only sit there dejectedly,\n\nMotionless!\n\nThe lingering glow of the setting sun,\n\nFell on the corners of the bookstore entrance,\n\nTaking away today’s,\n\nLast trace of warmth.\n\n“Oh, right, I just developed a new strawberry juice. Do you want to try the flavor first so I can make some improvements?” Xu Qinglang pushed open the door and walked in, holding a wine glass.\n\nSeeing Zhou Ze sitting in the corner, his hands covered in blood, he froze for a moment, then immediately put down the strawberry juice and ran over, crouching beside Zhou Ze.\n\n“What happened to you?” Xu Qinglang asked.\n\n“Why… this isn’t fair… no… this damned fairness.” Zhou Ze murmured to himself.\n\nXu Qinglang fell silent. He didn’t know what had happened to Zhou Ze to make him like this. The Zhou Ze he had always known was always very rational and composed, no matter what.\n\nEven amidst his strictness and rigidity, he would occasionally crack jokes. He was a very disciplined person, but disciplined people, when they break down after a setback, are often more helpless.\n\nAt this moment, Zhou Ze made Xu Qinglang feel as if he was seeing himself that day when the little girl took his parents’ souls in the shop.\n\nHe complained about the unfairness,\n\nBecause the Zhou Ze next door was also a ghost,\n\nBut the little girl allowed his existence, while taking his parents’ souls instead.\n\nXu Qinglang sighed,\n\nHe reached out and put his arm around Zhou Ze’s shoulder, letting Zhou Ze’s forehead rest against his chest, and then echoed:\n\n“Brother, I don’t know what happened, but I can empathize with your current emotions.\n\nEven the greatest Chopin can’t play our sorrow.”",

    "content": "In her left hand, three packs of cigarettes; in her right, a bag of tangyuan.\n\nOn her back, a beautiful shoulder bag.\n\nBai Yingying wouldn't waste any opportunity Zhou Ze gave her to leave the bookstore. Heaven knows how she managed to buy a shoulder bag so quickly after purchasing cigarettes and tangyuan!\n\nPushing open the bookstore door,\n\nBai Yingying saw two men embracing. She immediately dropped her things and covered her eyes,\n\nwhile simultaneously peeking through her fingers,\n\nnot forgetting to stomp her feet and coo shyly:\n\n\"Yingyingying,\n\ndid I come back at the wrong time?\"\n\nXu Guiren—\n\noh, no,\n\nXu Qinglang glared back at Bai Yingying, a look of mournful charm that was almost dripping like summer dew.\n\nThis overwhelming sense of a maiden's resentment,\n\nit was terrifying!\n\nIt made Bai Yingying wonder if she was the zombie, or if the noodle shop owner in front of her was the zombie.\n\n\"Did you get the stuff?\" Zhou Ze stood up.\n\nHe straightened his clothes.\n\nXu Qinglang also stood up, pretending to button his shirt.\n\n\"Boss, it's all back,\" Bai Yingying answered obediently.\n\n\"Good, I'm going out for a bit.\"\n\nZhou Ze walked over, picked up the cigarettes and tangyuan, and said to Bai Yingying, \"You watch the shop.\"\n\n\"Alrighty.\"\n\nAfter Zhou Ze left the shop, Bai Yingying and Xu Qinglang stared each other down.\n\n\"What are you looking at, corpse?\" Xu Qinglang said grumpily.\n\n\"If you kept hiding in the cabinet, I wouldn't be able to see you,\" Bai Yingying retorted.\n\n\"You're an ice cube, an ice cube! An ice cube that can freeze into a popsicle!\"\n\nXu Qinglang continued his counterattack!\n\n\"Heh, your water passage is blocked,\n\ntaking the dry path makes you prone to encountering robbers and experiencing a bloody disaster.\"\n\nBai Yingying retaliated sharply.\n\n\"Hmph!\"\n\n\"Hmph!\"\n\nThe two parted ways unhappily. Xu Qinglang returned to his noodle shop, while Bai Yingying imitated Zhou Ze, sitting on the boss's chair behind the counter, pouring a cup of hot water, and then casually picking up a book, pretending to read it with an air of sophistication.\n\n............\n\nZhou Ze intended to go to the Confucius Temple. No matter how much sorrow life throws at you, you always have to endure it first, and then continue living as you should.\n\nIt's like the last night of a short holiday, the thought of waking up early for work tomorrow is despair-inducing,\n\nyou want to give up, but you still have to set your alarm.\n\nThis is life. For some successful people, everyone is always eager to know the secret to their success, envying their current triumphs.\n\nIt's like when a pregnant woman has just given birth, friends and relatives come to congratulate her, but no one cares how many times she was fucked to get pregnant with this baby.\n\nCrude words, but not unreasonable.\n\nZhou Ze could only comfort himself.\n\nAs for his so-called cousin and the truck driver, how to respond to them needed careful consideration. At the very least, Zhou Ze wasn't such a magnanimous person.\n\nHe couldn't be as arrogant and overbearing as that colleague in Rongcheng, but this matter involved his \"murder case,\" so it definitely couldn't be brushed aside lightly.\n\nHe took out his phone, ready to call a taxi, but then he happened to see a WeChat message:\n\n\"What are you doing?\"\n\nIt was a message from Doctor Lin.\n\nZhou Ze hesitated, and was also a little unsure. To be honest, his mood was complicated right now, because the reason Xu Le wanted to kill him was also because this beautiful female doctor had a secret crush on him.\n\nAlright, being secretly liked by a beautiful woman,\n\nbeing secretly liked by a beautiful... married woman,\n\nbeing secretly liked by a beautiful, and still chaste, married woman,\n\nwas indeed something to be proud of.\n\nBut in his last life,\n\nhe was killed by her this way!!!!!\n\n\"In the shop.\" Zhou Ze still replied to the message.\n\nHe wasn't Xu Le, he wouldn't be so irresponsible. His and Xu Le's twisted karmic retribution had nothing to do with Doctor Lin.\n\nAnd honestly, after discovering Doctor Lin's infatuation with him step by step after his death, it was impossible for him not to have a good impression of this woman.\n\nEspecially her confession at the hospital last week,\n\nshe was very scared,\n\nand very flustered,\n\neven her body was trembling,\n\nbut she still embraced him without hesitation.\n\nWhether God was blind or not, Zhou Ze didn't know, but Doctor Lin's existence was indeed the biggest highlight in his life since his rebirth.\n\n\"I'm on the road outside your shop.\"\n\nZhou Ze looked up, scanning his surroundings, and indeed, he saw a white Maserati at the street corner.\n\nThe previous Cayenne had been scraped against a utility pole when he was driving that night. Clearly, Doctor Lin had gotten another car.\n\nThe scourge of materialism!\n\nZhou Ze walked over, opened the car door, and sat in the passenger seat.\n\nDoctor Lin was a little reserved, and somewhat at a loss, but it was clear that she had come to see him with great courage.\n\nAfter all, he was a ghost.\n\n\"Xu Le, he's already...\"\n\nZhou Ze frowned slightly. He didn't want to hear anything about \"Xu Le\" right now.\n\n\"Don't mention him. Just pretend he never existed,\" Zhou Ze interrupted stiffly.\n\n\"Then... will that make you think... I'm a bad woman?\" Doctor Lin asked.\n\nThree obediences and four virtues,\n\nalthough not as rigid and dogmatic, Doctor Lin was indeed deeply poisoned by feudal ideology due to her parents' influence.\n\nNow her husband was Zhou Ze,\n\nso what about the original Xu Le?\n\n\"Don't think too much.\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head.\n\nIt was truly this comical:\n\nWhen Doctor Lin realized Xu Le was Zhou Ze, her tone and demeanor became much softer, as if she had returned to her intern days, and Zhou Ze was still her teacher.\n\nAt that time, Zhou Ze was far from polite to his interns, male or female. He simply used them as \"intern dogs,\" making them do all the dirty work, heavy lifting, and coffee runs.\n\nAnd Zhou Ze, after the confession, gradually began to display that \"superior\" attitude in front of Doctor Lin.\n\nHis chauvinistic tendencies became increasingly apparent.\n\nThe one who is loved is always fearless.\n\n\"Okay.\" Doctor Lin nodded.\n\nThen,\n\nsilence.\n\nZhou Ze didn't want silence. He looked at Doctor Lin and saw that she was wearing a pink down jacket and jeans today. While her figure was perfectly accentuated and her temperament made her look truly beautiful, Zhou Ze felt something was missing.\n\n\"Next time, wear stockings. I like to see women in stockings,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nDoctor Lin was stunned, her pretty face flushed.\n\nShe felt that she should be sad. After guessing that Xu Le was likely dead, as a wife, she should be grieving, not being teased by Zhou Ze in the car like this.\n\nBut that feeling of shame and annoyance made her unable to resist.\n\nPerhaps,\n\nshe was actually a bad woman.\n\nA bad woman who cheated emotionally.\n\nDoctor Lin closed her eyes, resigned to her fate in her heart.\n\n\"I'm talking to you,\" Zhou Ze reminded her.\n\n\"Oh... okay,\" Doctor Lin replied, her face even redder.\n\nZhou Ze's lips curled into a smile.\n\nHe knew that his outrageous words were also partly a deliberate retaliation against Xu Le. Perhaps he wasn't a good man either.\n\nAlright,\n\none person thought she wasn't a good woman, and the other thought he wasn't a good man.\n\nIn ancient times, they would almost be a replica of Pan Jinlian and Ximen Daguanren.\n\nAs for the Wudaliang in between,\n\nwho cared?\n\n\"Are you hungry?\" Doctor Lin asked.\n\n\"No,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\nThen,\n\nmore silence.\n\nZhou Ze now genuinely felt that his being single in his previous life wasn't just because he was obsessed with work and had no time for anything else; it was probably because his emotional intelligence was inherently low.\n\nIt's normal to have awkward silences when talking to a strange girl,\n\nbut if you're still having awkward silences with your legal wife, there must be something wrong with you.\n\n\"Let's just live like this, okay? Don't tell anyone about my situation. Just pretend I'm... Xu Le,\" Zhou Ze said through gritted teeth, speaking those two words.\n\n\"Okay,\" Doctor Lin nodded. This was also what she wanted.\n\nEverything, as before.\n\n\"But there's one thing I need to remind you.\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"In bed, you're only allowed to call me Zhou Ze.\" Zhou Ze picked at his ear with his pinky. \"I don't want to suddenly hear you call out 'Xu Le.' When no one else is around, you can only call me by my name.\"\n\nIn bed?\n\nDoctor Lin's heart suddenly skipped a beat.\n\nAlthough she was already a married woman, she was still a virgin.\n\nThis kind of topic and innuendo,\n\nwas truly shameful!\n\nBut she still nodded as if by a ghost's impulse, softly responding,\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\nZhou Ze truly felt that Doctor Lin had a bit of Stockholm Syndrome.\n\nIf the original Xu Le hadn't been so timid, but instead simple and direct,\n\nhe might have gotten his wish, and it wouldn't have been so convenient for him.\n\nBut thinking about it from another perspective, if Xu Le had been simple and direct, he wouldn't have hated him and hired someone to kill him, right?\n\nSo, was it better to have a chaste Doctor Lin?\n\nOr was it better for him to have lived in his previous life?\n\nWhich one was truly better?\n\nZhou Ze reached up and patted his forehead.\n\n\"What's wrong?\" Doctor Lin looked at Zhou Ze with concern. \"Is your body having some issues because of that matter...?\"\n\nOh my goodness,\n\nshe used the honorific \"您\" (nín)!\n\nOld Master Zhou felt a rush of self-importance.\n\nThis Doctor Lin might not just have Stockholm Syndrome; she might also be a masochist.\n\nNo,\n\nwait a minute,\n\nsomething felt off?\n\nBody issues?\n\nZhou Ze immediately looked at Doctor Lin.\n\nHow could a man's body possibly have issues?\n\nImpossible!\n\nZhou Ze looked at the car seat; it was a bit cramped in the front.\n\n\"Get out of the car,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Mm.\"\n\nThough Doctor Lin didn't know what they were going to do, she still got out of the car.\n\nZhou Ze opened the back car door, pointed inside, and said, \"Get in.\"\n\nDoctor Lin, utterly bewildered, got in.\n\n\"I need to prove that I'm fine,\" Zhou Ze muttered to himself.\n\nIt was already dark,\n\nand the area around his bookstore was deserted.\n\n\"Aren't you not feeling well?\" Doctor Lin, sitting in the back seat, asked with a puzzled expression.\n\nZhou Ze's body stiffened.\n\nShe meant his inability to eat when she said he had body issues?\n\nPhew...\n\nHe let out a long breath,\n\nrelieving the psychological pressure,\n\nbut he still had to charge ahead!\n\nBut Zhou Ze still said, \"I need to prove that another aspect is also fine.\"\n\n\"What problem?\" Doctor Lin still looked confused.\n\nThen, Zhou Ze also climbed into the back seat,\n\nand closed the car door.\n\nIt was very dark,\n\nthe car shook violently,\n\nand they had a blast.",

    "content": "\"They're in the car.\"\n\nAt the bookstore entrance, Bai Yingying sat on a small stool, intently watching the Maserati in the distance.\n\n\"Oh, a Maserati's interior space isn't as big as a Cayenne's. I remember last time she drove a Cayenne, didn't she?\"\n\nXu Qinglang also sat on a small stool at his noodle shop entrance.\n\n\"The Boss scraped it while driving; she probably got a new car.\"\n\nInitially, both were busy with their own tasks, but the female corpse was no ordinary person. As someone who had lain underground for two hundred years, her hearing was incredibly sharp.\n\nDuring those two hundred years, Madame Bai would occasionally visit her, chatting and telling her about the outside world, like close confidantes.\n\nHmm, much like college girls in a dorm might sometimes gather to discuss lengths and hardnesses,\n\nOr perhaps watch educational action films from a certain Eastern country.\n\nBecause of this, even though the female corpse hadn't been out for two hundred years, she hadn't become out of touch with the times. When Madame Bai wasn't around, she would listen to the sounds from both underground and above, thus cultivating an incredibly terrifying sense of hearing.\n\nUpon \"hearing\" that the plot seemed to be sliding in an indescribable direction, she immediately carried her stool over, while patting the wall, signaling Xu Qinglang next door to come out and watch the show with her.\n\nIt must be said that although the two usually bickered quite a bit, in crucial moments, they knew how to share.\n\n\"Oh, the Boss got out of the car,\" Bai Yingying whispered.\n\n\"Huh, that doctor also got out,\" Xu Qinglang narrated.\n\n\"Oh, the Boss opened the back car door,\" Bai Yingying continued to whisper.\n\n\"Huh, that doctor got into the back seat,\" Xu Qinglang continued to narrate.\n\n\"The car's shaking,\" Bai Yingying covered her mouth, her eyes fixed on the car without blinking.\n\n\"They must be having a blast,\" Xu Qinglang took a deep breath.\n\n\"The air is filled with a sour smell. Did your sour plum juice leak in the kitchen?\" the female corpse waved her hand, covering her nose.\n\n\"Heh, bullsh*t. Come on, let's place bets. How long will it last?\" Xu Qinglang checked his watch. \"I bet ten minutes.\"\n\n\"Fifteen minutes!\" the female corpse replied.\n\n\"One, two, three, four... eight, nine, ten seconds!\"\n\n*Pay attention,\n\nNote the unit of time.*\n\n\"Huh, the car stopped shaking,\" the female corpse asked curiously.\n\n\"Did they change positions?\" Xu Qinglang frowned; he refused to believe that terrifying conclusion!\n\n\"Ten seconds to change positions?\" the female corpse giggled. \"You're a greenhorn too, aren't you?\"\n\nThe female corpse was experienced. Back in the day, Madame Bai and the impoverished scholar had trysts and stolen forbidden fruit; she had experience.\n\nXu Qinglang's expression was displeased. As a man with over twenty properties,\n\nWas it not okay to take his first time a little more seriously?\n\n\"The car's moving again!\" Xu Qinglang exclaimed.\n\n\"One, two, three, four... eight, nine, ten seconds!\"\n\n\"The car stopped moving again,\" Bai Yingying sniffled. \"Did they change positions again?\"\n\n\"Did your boss never marry before?\" Xu Qinglang frowned. \"Wait, I think I looked up Zhou Ze's information. It said 'unmarried.' Could he be a virgin?\"\n\n\"He probably hasn't married,\" Bai Yingying replied.\n\n\"That doctor's brows aren't open, and her legs are together; she should also be a virgin.\" Xu Qinglang slapped his forehead. \"Hahahahaha, I'm dying of laughter. I get it. Two virgins, and their first time they're playing such high-level games.\"\n\nBai Yingying remained silent beside him.\n\n\"What's wrong?\" Xu Qinglang asked.\n\n\"I remember when Madame and that scholar had their first time, the scholar seemed very experienced,\" Bai Yingying said with a hint of sadness.\n\n\"Ancient scholars were all cunning devils; they loved to trick you young ladies. In reality, they were all shameless old hands.\"\n\nXu Qinglang had a world-weary expression. \"Holy sh*t, the car's moving again.\"\n\nTen seconds, stop.\n\nTen seconds, move.\n\nTen seconds, stop.\n\nTen seconds, move.\n\nEvery time the car moved, the female corpse and Xu Qinglang would tilt their heads; when it moved again, they'd tilt back.\n\nEventually, both felt their necks aching.\n\nFinally, the back car door opened.\n\nZhou Ze and Doctor Lin got out, drenched in sweat, then both moved to the front seats.\n\n\"I don't get it,\" Xu Qinglang shook his head.\n\n\"Me neither,\" Bai Yingying also looked bewildered.\n\n\"Is Zhou Ze's rhythm different from ordinary people?\" Xu Qinglang shook his head again.\n\n\"Perhaps,\" Bai Yingying guessed.\n\nFinally,\n\nThe Maserati drove away,\n\nThe excitement ended.\n\nXu Qinglang and Bai Yingying exchanged a glance,\n\nEach snorted,\n\nAnd mentally scorned \"hussy!\"\n\nThen, they each turned and left,\n\nOne to the kitchen,\n\nOne to read.\n\n..................\n\n\"Huff... huff...\"\n\nIn the passenger seat, Zhou Ze was panting heavily, his hair on his forehead soaked with sweat.\n\nDoctor Lin drove the car, also with many beads of sweat on her, which added to her charm.\n\n\"I'm sorry, it's my fault. I wasn't attractive enough,\" Doctor Lin bit her lip, blaming herself. \"I don't have experience; I don't understand this aspect, which made it... not enjoyable for you.\"\n\nZhou Ze leaned his head back and shook it.\n\n\"It's my fault. Given all that, it must be my fault.\"\n\nZhou Ze pulled out a tissue from the front and wiped his wet hair.\n\n\"We are both doctors. This matter, in fact, we both understand. It's on my end; I indeed have a problem,\" Zhou Ze took a deep breath, then exhaled heavily.\n\nHe now wished he could go straight back,\n\nGrab Xu Qinglang,\n\nAnd hang him from a tree to whip him a hundred times!\n\nJust now,\n\nZhou Ze suddenly remembered what Xu Qinglang had said to him.\n\n*You're using Xu Le's body,\n\nSo are you cuckolding Xu Le, or is Xu Le cuckolding you?\n\nYour body is Xu Le's, your DNA is Xu Le's, and the child is Xu Le's.*\n\nNormally, he wouldn't feel anything,\n\nBut at that moment,\n\nZhou Ze even found his own *thing* down there,\n\nA bit disgusting, as if he was holding someone else's.\n\nUnder this psychological pressure,\n\nAfter many attempts,\n\nHe finally surpassed Yu the Great in terms of achievement.\n\nUtterly unenthusiastic!\n\n\"Give me some time,\" Zhou Ze lit a cigarette, then, thinking better of it, threw it out the window.\n\nIt wasn't that Zhou Ze felt it was impolite to smoke in a lady's car, but rather that he didn't feel he had the right to smoke a post-coital cigarette.\n\n\"Next time, I'll wear stockings,\" Lin Wanqiu said very seriously.\n\n\"Then that would completely prove it's my problem,\" Zhou Ze said with a wry smile, but looking at Doctor Lin's solemn expression beside him, Zhou Ze's heart softened instantly.\n\nHe even felt like he was being a jerk,\n\nHaving somewhat vented the anger he had just been enduring onto this woman.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" Zhou Ze said inwardly.\n\nRegardless of the complex hatred between Xu Le and himself, at least this woman was innocent, and her feelings for him were very pure.\n\nIn his previous life, he seemed very successful, but six months after his death, it seemed only she remembered him.\n\n\"Stop up ahead. You go back, get some sleep early tonight,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"You should also rest early,\" Lin Wanqiu stopped the car.\n\nOnly after Zhou Ze got out did she drive away.\n\nZhou Ze had said before that their life rhythm would continue as before, as usual.\n\nThere was no way not to continue as usual; even if Zhou Ze was willing to go back and face his in-laws and even his sister-in-law's bitter faces,\n\nHe couldn't sleep in the same bed as Doctor Lin at night.\n\nWas he supposed to ask Doctor Lin to sleep in the freezer with him?\n\nHe wouldn't freeze to death, but what about Doctor Lin?\n\nOr call Bai Yingying over and have them all sleep together?\n\nZhou Ze wasn't that beastly.\n\nEating and sleeping, the two biggest things in life, were now restricted for him, making it really hard to let loose.\n\nThe Temple of Literature had long since closed. It wasn't like that \"door-washing\" incident when everyone vied to offer the first incense, with people bustling about.\n\nChinese people have always been quite pragmatic about ghosts and gods; of course, this seems to be a kind of advantage.\n\nZhou Ze opened the pack of cigarettes he brought.\n\nAlthough there had been a little mishap in between, Zhou Ze still knew what he had to do.\n\nNo matter what, he couldn't just wait for the little loli to finish her business and then strip him of his temporary status, with his own fate depending on her mood.\n\nOne by one, the cigarettes were placed in a row on the ground. Zhou Ze lit them one by one, then arranged the tangyuan. After doing all this, Zhou Ze cupped his hands and called out to the front:\n\n\"Junior has brought some offerings to honor your elders; please show yourself.\"\n\nAfter speaking, he waited for a long time, but there was still no sound.\n\nZhou Ze then took out another carton of cigarettes, preparing to light them, when he noticed the long row of cigarettes he had just lit suddenly extinguished themselves collectively.\n\nLooking up, Zhou Ze saw the dwarf elder sitting on the mound in front, his pockets bulging, grinning from ear to ear.\n\n\"Young man, you're certainly being overly solicitous for no reason.\"\n\nThe dwarf elder had a gong on his back and a face full of wrinkles.\n\n\"Indeed, I have something to ask you,\" Zhou Ze's posture was very humble.\n\nSomeone capable of leading patrols by the Temple of Literature certainly wasn't a lonely ghost; he should be someone within the system. Therefore, he should know a lot about ghost messengers.\n\n\"Don't fret. Let this old man calculate,\" the elder pinched his fingers, looking at Zhou Ze meaningfully, pondering, \"This old man has served at the Temple of Literature for sixty years, so I have some skill. I can certainly calculate what it is your heart desires and craves.\"\n\nZhou Ze listened, waiting quietly beside him.\n\nFinally,\n\nThe elder slapped his thigh, saying:\n\n\"I've calculated it!\"\n\n\"Please, senior, enlighten me,\" Zhou Ze asked respectfully.\n\nHow could he remove the \"temporary worker\" prefix from his ghost messenger status?\n\nAnd what should his path be from here?\n\nThe elder chuckled, a look of \"I've seen through your heart\" on his face,\n\nAs if everything was within his grasp.\n\nHe slowly stroked his beard, saying, \"The matter you crave most, this old man already knows.\n\nVery well, seeing your meticulous etiquette this time, I shall point you to a clear path.\"\n\nZhou Ze waited attentively.\n\n\"Jiu Zhi Tang Concentrated Liuwei Dihuang Pills,\" the elder said.\n\n\"............\" Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Hmm, no, that's not right? It shouldn't be. That stuff has good quality for three hundred years;\n\nThis old man even took it when I was young and alive, and it worked.\"\n\nAt this moment,\n\nZhou Ze suddenly wanted to strangle the smug old man in front of him.",

    "content": "\"Uh, did I guess wrong?\"\n\nThe dwarfish old man tilted his head.\n\n\"My cultivation has regressed again, oh dear.\"\n\nThe dwarfish old man pulled out a cigarette and started smoking it, looking very melancholic.\n\nZhou Ze calmed his emotions. He couldn't very well say, \"You seem to have a point?\"\n\n\"Senior, I came to ask about the Hellish Constables.\"\n\n\"Hellish Constables?\" The dwarfish old man frowned. \"Why are you, young man, asking about Hellish Constables? Those people are not easy to deal with. If you encounter them, you'd better steer clear.\n\nYou have a physical body and managed to come back to life. This is a great fortune; you should just secretly enjoy it.\"\n\nThe old man said, clearly puzzled.\n\nZhou Ze slightly frowned. This old man in front of him couldn't tell that he was a Hellish Constable?\n\nAlthough he was a temporary worker, given the old man's previous divination skills, he was definitely not some half-baked practitioner, yet he couldn't detect Zhou Ze's Hellish Constable identity.\n\nDid this mean that the little loli indeed treated him as a temporary worker, and besides the so-called \"Gate of Hell,\" she actually withheld other important things from him?\n\nXu Qinglang once said that the loli came and went in a hurry, definitely not just to hand over duties. She simply had things to attend to and temporarily grabbed him to be a free laborer.\n\nAs for the reason she chose him, it was simple: she valued his non-troublemaking nature, that he wouldn't cause problems while subbing for her.\n\nBut this identity was something Zhou Ze had to grasp. His life had been ruined once, and this time, he had to completely control it. The Hellish Constable identity was the best protective charm, preventing him from becoming an unregistered ghost, living in perpetual fear.\n\nZhou Ze opened his palm to the old man, revealing the symbol.\n\nThe old man's expression immediately hardened, and his breathing paused for a moment. His eyeballs then darted around before he suddenly realized:\n\n\"I understand. That long-tongued girl pulled you in as a substitute.\"\n\nThe dwarfish old man paced back and forth on the mound with his hands behind his back, as if contemplating something. Zhou Ze stood quietly beside him, not interrupting.\n\nFinally, the old man asked again, \"You ask this old man about Hellish Constables, what is your intention?\"\n\n\"To contribute my strength for the harmony of the underworld and the peace of the mortal realm.\"\n\n\"Oh.\" The old man shook his head, then nodded. \"Heh, this old man knows what you want to do. You want to replace that long-tongued girl?\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't refute him.\n\nNot refuting meant acquiescence.\n\n\"There is a way, and it's very simple,\" the dwarfish old man pondered. \"Considering you brought me so many gifts tonight, I'll tell you.\"\n\n\"I'm all ears.\"\n\n\"Inside the Confucius Temple, there live sages. The sages are above; humans walk the human path, and ghosts cross the Bridge of No Return. The sages see everything clearly.\n\nIs that not right?\"\n\n\"It is,\" Zhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"The long-tongued girl gave you this key, which is equivalent to half an identity, but she can take it away at any time.\" The dwarfish old man mused, \"But as long as you enter the Confucius Temple, and I personally pray to the sages for you, and you then express your stance, make your promises, and show your determination before the sages.\n\nThat is to say, you repeat those pretty words you spoke earlier, but even prettier. As long as one of the sages nods, your identity will be solidified.\n\nBut there is one crucial point: the sages' gaze is like a torch, discerning everything. Should you harbor ill intent, or commit any outrageous acts in the future, then what will punish you, besides the laws of the underworld, will be the wrath of the sages!\"\n\nThe dwarfish old man's expression was serious.\n\n\"It's that simple?\" Zhou Ze asked in return.\n\n\"How difficult it is,\" the dwarfish old man sighed. \"To gain the sages' favor and be granted an identity, this is merely one method, a method to just give it a try.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded and said, \"Then let's try it.\"\n\nThe dwarfish old man walked to the entrance of the Confucius Temple and blew a breath inside. A \"click\" sound came from behind the door, which seemed to be the latch of the large red wooden door falling into place.\n\n\"You go in first and speak well before the sage statues. Next, this old man will make the arrangements for you.\"\n\nZhou Ze reached out and pushed the door open, then looked at the dwarfish old man beside him. Seeing him standing still, he asked somewhat strangely:\n\n\"Senior, aren't you coming in with me?\"\n\n\"You jest. I am but a lackey under the sages. How dare I idly wander before them? You have half an official status; you may enter.\"\n\nZhou Ze hesitated for a moment, then stepped inside.\n\nThe old man gently clapped his hands together, and the wooden door closed again.\n\n\"Speak well to the sages!\"\n\nAfterward, the old man took out another cigarette and put it in his mouth. He didn't need to light it; the cigarette spontaneously ignited.\n\nAfter finishing one cigarette, the old man smiled, took out his gong, and struck it forcefully!\n\nA crisp sound rang out.\n\nThe old man stretched his voice and shouted:\n\n\"Dry weather, beware of fire!\"\n\nImmediately after,\n\nAnother gong strike:\n\n\"Dry weather, beware of fire!\"\n\nThe old man beat his gong and danced joyfully at the entrance of the Confucius Temple, much like a shaman performing a ritual in Northeast China.\n\nHis short stature made him appear even more endearing as he hopped.\n\n\"Kid, you continue to chat with the sage statues, express yourself more. This old man will help you reach heaven's ears!\"\n\nThe dwarfish old man yelled into the Confucius Temple.\n\n\"Alright, thank you for your trouble, Senior.\"\n\nZhou Ze's voice came from behind the wall.\n\n\"No trouble, no trouble at all. Just bring me a few more packs of cigarettes and visit me occasionally in the future. This old man has no descendants left, and my incense offerings have ceased. It's difficult to even get a cigarette now.\n\nThere's no shortage of food and drink in the Confucius Temple, but I wouldn't dare touch anything from the Sage Lord's altar, not with ten guts.\"\n\nThe dwarfish old man burst into hearty laughter,\n\nThen happily continued beating his gong.\n\n\"Dry weather, beware of fire!\"\n\n\"Boom!\" The gong rang!\n\n\"Dry weather, beware of fire!\"\n\n\"Boom!\" The gong rang.\n\nEach gong strike was lower than the last,\n\nAt the same time, the dwarfish old man's club, which had been wrapped in white cloth, began to seep blood.\n\nAt first,\n\nThe blood was just faint specks, but with each gong strike, the blood spread.\n\nIt became thicker and more dazzling,\n\nUntil finally,\n\nEvery time the dwarfish old man struck, a large amount of blood spattered, staining his clothes and giving his formerly endearing appearance a touch of ferocity!\n\n\"Dry weather, be! ware! of! fire!\"\n\n\"Boom!\"\n\nWith the last gong strike,\n\nThe dwarfish old man threw the bloody red gong and drum into the Confucius Temple, and at the same time, he shouted at the top of his lungs:\n\n\"Sages, open your eyes! Evil spirits, face judgment!\"\n\nAfter shouting that last phrase,\n\nThe old man was shocked as if struck by lightning. His body became much blurrier than before, even showing signs of dissipating.\n\nBut he still laughed wildly, and at the same time, he shouted inside:\n\n\"Do you feel good? Do you feel good now?\"\n\n\"No, I don't.\"\n\nZhou Ze's voice came from behind the wall.\n\n\"It's good that you don't feel good, young man! This old man will teach you today what it means for things to be impermanent and for hearts to be unpredictable!\n\nA human's heart is separated by their belly, let alone a ghost's!\n\nThis old man will sacrifice sixty years of meritorious service as an attendant to have the sages kill you!\"\n\n\"Do I... have a feud with you?\"\n\nZhou Ze's voice came from the other side of the wall, full of confusion.\n\n\"A feud? Of course, there's a feud!\" The dwarfish old man's body flickered, but he continued to shout, \"This old man doesn't want to reincarnate, doesn't want to enter the cycle of rebirth, doesn't want to go to the next life!\n\nNight and day, I serve this Confucius Temple, waiting on these ancestors,\n\nAll for,\n\nIs it not to accumulate some yin virtue for my descendants and bless them?\n\nMy lineage suffered from wicked deeds committed by my ancestors, leading to sparse offspring. That's why I was forced to stay here, only wishing for the continuous flow of incense!\n\nBut a year ago, my last descendant, my only descendant, died!\n\nWhat meaning does my sixty years of humble service have then?\"\n\nThe dwarfish old man cried out,\n\n\"Is it fun to be with these clay statues every day?\n\nHahaha, Heaven has eyes! That day during the 'door-opening' ritual, when I just glanced at you and borrowed a cigarette from you.\n\nI didn't see anything at all then.\n\nBut just now, when I properly calculated, to hell with your Liu Wei Di Huang Wan!\n\nYou made this old man realize that your death is inextricably linked to the demise of my last descendant!\n\nThis is the cause you created, and today, you will face the consequence!\n\nThis old man will trade sixty years of meritorious service for your soul to scatter!\n\nYou're worth it! You're not losing out!\"\n\n\"That descendant of yours, did he die on the operating table?\" Zhou Ze asked from behind the wall.\n\n\"No, he didn't die on the operating table; he died in a car accident.\"\n\nThe dwarfish old man wiped away tears. Although his figure was much blurrier, his tears seemed to have red specks.\n\n\"I wasn't a driver in my last life.\"\n\nZhou Ze wanted to add that he was also killed by a car in his previous life.\n\n\"That drunk driving bastard, he should have died, his lifespan should have ended, but you forcefully saved him on the operating table, propping him up for half a month!\n\nFinally, his time came, and he died in a drunk driving accident, but he also dragged my lovely great-great-great-grandson with him in the crash.\n\nTell me,\n\nIsn't this your karma?\n\nIsn't this the evil you created?\n\nIsn't this the debt you owe?!\"\n\n\"Your thought process is truly powerful,\" Zhou Ze marveled.\n\nThe dwarfish old man, who was slowly recovering from his initial vengeful exhilaration, suddenly discovered an extremely strange thing. Logically, by sacrificing sixty years of his attendant's merit to make a sage in the Confucius Temple open his eyes once.\n\nAccording to the usual temperament of those clay sages, who were extremely lazy on weekdays, any ghost in front of them, even a legitimate Hellish Constable, would be suppressed and killed if they opened their eyes, let alone Zhou Ze, who wasn't legitimate.\n\nZhou Ze, at this moment, should have his soul shattered, his spirit dispersed, and be suffering immense pain under the sage's gaze, shouldn't he?\n\nWhy did he respond with such a relaxed tone every time?\n\nThis wasn't right.\n\nSomething wasn't right!\n\n\"How can you be fine? How can you be fine?!\"\n\nThe dwarfish old man suddenly roared,\n\nHe had sacrificed sixty years of his attendant's merit, all at once!\n\nZhou Ze walked out from behind the wall,\n\nLooking at the dwarfish old man.\n\nThe temple of the Confucius Temple was surrounded by a rectangular wall. When Zhou Ze spoke earlier, he was standing outside the wall, so when the dwarfish old man stood at the main entrance, it sounded as if Zhou Ze was speaking to him from inside the temple.\n\nThe dwarfish old man was struck as if by lightning, looking in disbelief at Zhou Ze, who had appeared outside the Confucius Temple,\n\n\"How are you outside? How did you get out?\"\n\nZhou Ze gestured with his chin towards the back, saying:\n\n\"You've been working at this establishment for so long,\n\nAnd you don't know there's a back door?\"",

    "content": "\"You've been messing around in this unit for so long, and you don't even know that you can actually use the back door here?\"\n\nThe \"back door\" here doesn't refer to the unwritten rules of social connections, but rather that the Temple of Confucius, besides its front gate, indeed has a back door.\n\nIn this world, there is no love without reason, and pies falling from the sky can kill people according to physics.\n\nIf the dwarfish elder had just given him a few pointers and said some mysterious, veiled words, imitating Patriarch Bodhi tapping Sun Wukong three times on the back of the head, Zhou Ze might have pondered it carefully and found it more realistic and reassuring.\n\nBut the strange thing was that the dwarfish elder was simply too enthusiastic, so enthusiastic that Zhou Ze found it unreal.\n\nHad ghosts recently started a trend of learning from Lei Feng and doing good deeds?\n\nEspecially after the elder refused to enter the Temple of Confucius with him, Zhou Ze became a bit more cautious. The Temple of Confucius wasn't very big; Zhou Ze went in through the main gate and immediately came out through the back door and circled around.\n\nFacts proved that Zhou Ze's choice was correct.\n\nAs the elder himself said, hearts are separated by stomachs, let alone ghosts?\n\nFurthermore, what Zhou Ze found somewhat absurd was that the reason the elder wanted revenge on him was because of that...\n\nHe had saved a patient, and half a month later, that patient got into a car accident due to drunk driving, causing the dwarfish elder's grandson to also die in the accident.\n\nThe dwarfish elder actually blamed Zhou Ze, believing that if he hadn't tried his best to save that patient's life, his grandson wouldn't have died.\n\nWhat a peculiar way of thinking.\n\n\"I was a doctor in my previous life; healing the sick and saving lives is my duty,\" Zhou Ze smiled. \"I don't believe I did anything wrong. Your hatred for me, even to this extent, is really unreasonable.\n\nPerhaps, you just feel that your descendants have been cut off, that you've wasted sixty years* serving these clay figures, and it's all come to nothing, so you have resentment in your heart and want to find someone to vent it on, and you chose me?\"\n\nThe dwarfish elder stared fiercely at Zhou Ze, licked his lips, and said hoarsely:\n\n\"This is the evil you created! Why did you save someone who should have died!\"\n\n\"In a doctor's eyes, only those who die after full treatment are truly dead. I don't accept your reason, and that so-called karma is utter nonsense.\"\n\nIf everything the people he saved did had to be attributed to him, wouldn't that be a global absurdity?\n\nZhou Ze remembered reading in a British veteran's memoir that during World War I, he personally captured the Fuehrer and had the chance to turn a blind eye and shoot that little man, but he didn't and took him as a prisoner of war.\n\nDoes that mean all the evils committed by the Third Reich later should be attributed to that British veteran?\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. There was no reasoning with this guy. The next moment, Zhou Ze's fingernails began to lengthen, and black energy swirled around his fingertips.\n\n\"Are you going to eliminate the young ones and take out the old ones in one swoop too?\" the dwarfish elder said exasperatedly. \"This is the Temple of Confucius, the resting place of sages. Even proper ghost messengers wouldn't dare to be presumptuous here!\"\n\n\"Fuck you.\"\n\nZhou Ze walked directly toward the dwarfish elder,\n\n\"I only adhere to one principle: you just tried to kill me, so now I'm going to kill you!\n\nIt's inconvenient to get revenge for past lives, but if I let go of the current grudge, then Zhou Ze's temper would be too good!\n\nI can't deal with living people for now, but can't I deal with ghosts?\n\nThe dwarfish elder tried to run away, but Zhou Ze's hand directly grabbed him and then yanked him violently backward!\n\n\"Whoosh!\"\n\nThe dwarfish elder let out a scream, and his body became even more transparent.\n\n\"I don't want to go to hell, I don't want to go to hell! Sage, save me, save me!\"\n\nUnfortunately,\n\nThe clay figures in the Temple of Confucius remained motionless. If they truly had spirits, how could they allow the dwarfish elder's family to completely lose their incense and lineage?\n\n\"Who said I was sending you to hell?\" Zhou Ze smiled. \"Do you think you still have a chance to go to hell?\"\n\nAfter saying that, Zhou Ze thrust forward, then spread his hands. The pent-up malice in his heart erupted at this moment, and the dwarfish elder's soul body disintegrated directly!\n\nIt was very simple,\n\nAnd very decisive.\n\nBefore dealing with Bai Yingying, Zhou Ze didn't know he was so capable;\n\nAnd now, he had a very solid confidence in his own strength, especially his ability against ghosts, though the dwarfish elder's easy defeat was also largely due to his soul body being weakened by sacrificing sixty years of devoted service.\n\nZhou Ze didn't know if doing this would have any side effects, nor was he sure if not even giving the old man a chance to go to hell complied with the little loli's \"know your limits\" route.\n\nBut if he kept holding back like a turtle, he felt he'd eventually cause himself problems.\n\nDusting off his shoulders, Zhou Ze pulled out his phone and hailed a taxi.\n\nAfter getting in, the driver was very friendly and even offered Zhou Ze a cigarette, which made Zhou Ze feel a bit \"flattered\" for a moment. Then, while smoking and chatting casually with the driver,\n\nHe secretly used the burning cigarette tip to touch the car door,\n\nThe car door wasn't burned through.\n\nZhou Ze felt at ease. The last paper car incident had truly exhausted him.\n\nWhen he returned to the bookstore, it was already past one in the morning. Bai Yingying was sitting behind the counter, looking at the computer and awkwardly operating the mouse.\n\nZhou Ze showered and changed, preparing to go upstairs to rest, when he saw Bai Yingying still sitting motionless behind the computer.\n\nHow was he supposed to sleep if she didn't go up?\n\nZhou Ze walked behind Bai Yingying and found that this female corpse was actually playing a single-player game of Beach Head 2000, playing very excitedly.\n\n\"Time to rest,\" Zhou Ze reminded her.\n\n\"Oh,\" Bai Yingying responded, not fully comprehending.\n\n\"I said, time to rest,\" Zhou Ze emphasized his voice.\n\n\"Oh, okay!\" Bai Yingying stuck out her tongue, exited the game, and then obediently went upstairs.\n\nThere were two straw mats on the second floor. The freezer had temporarily been moved to a corner. With one straw mat each, if an outsider accidentally came upstairs, they might think there were two corpses lying on straw mats.\n\n\"Boss, you must be tired today, right?\" Bai Yingying asked tentatively.\n\nZhou Ze didn't reply. He didn't want to talk much about what happened tonight, especially his multiple instances of passing by his own home without entering; there was really nothing to brag about.\n\nSeeing Zhou Ze ignore her, Bai Yingying obediently closed her eyes. A faint chill began to emanate from her, lowering the surrounding temperature and allowing Zhou Ze's mind to slowly relax.\n\nHmm,\n\nTime to sleep.\n\n…………\n\n\"Gurgle... gurgle... gurgle...\"\n\nLike the sound of boiling water,\n\nZhou Ze slowly opened his eyes and found himself floating on a pond. Hot air billowed around him, like lying in a large public bath.\n\nIn the distance, there was a very wide but also muddy road, and groups of white figures were moving along the road numbly.\n\nThis place was so familiar.\n\nZhou Ze slowly sat up, realizing that he could actually sit on the water surface without sinking.\n\n\"You've come too.\"\n\nA man's voice sounded beside Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze abruptly turned his head and saw a young man wearing a hoodie standing beside him.\n\nBeside the hooded man, there was a small, crouching figure, like a cat.\n\nThe man had his hoodie pulled up, so his face wasn't clear, but he gave Zhou Ze a very familiar feeling.\n\nHowever, Zhou Ze couldn't remember who he was for a moment.\n\n\"Don't be nervous, this is a dream,\" the hooded man said. \"Just like Zhuang Zhou dreaming of a butterfly, for us dead people, dreaming of hell is quite common.\"\n\n\"Who are you?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Does a name mean anything here?\"\n\nThe man retorted.\n\nZhou Ze was momentarily speechless. Indeed, the hooded man had made it clear: only the dead would dream of hell. Everyone was already dead; what was the point of exchanging names?\n\n\"They're coming for me,\" the hooded man said.\n\n\"Coming for you?\" Zhou Ze was startled. \"Coming for you back to hell?\"\n\n\"Heh...\" the hooded man chuckled.\n\nImmediately after, the hooded man turned to leave, and the cat beside him slowly followed him.\n\nSuddenly, something clicked in Zhou Ze's mind, and he immediately said, \"Are you that person from Rongcheng?\n\nThe employee of the old Daoist's underworld shop?\"\n\nThe hooded man stopped, turned his head, and looked at Zhou Ze, \"Employee?\"\n\n\"Is... isn't that right?\"\n\n\"If it is, it is. You know that old Daoist?\" the other party asked.\n\n\"Something like that,\" Zhou Ze responded.\n\n\"Oh,\" the hooded man said, then pointed around. The white mist around them grew thicker. He said, \"The dream is about to end.\"\n\n\"This is my first time having a dream like this,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"You'll get used to it,\" the hooded man seemed to want to say a few more words because of Zhou Ze's connection with the old Daoist, no longer in a hurry to leave. He pointed to the pond water beneath their feet. \"Do you remember this pond?\"\n\nZhou Ze looked down at his feet and nodded.\n\n\"Go down!\"\n\nThe hooded man walked to Zhou Ze's side, placed a hand on Zhou Ze's shoulder, and then both of them sank into the pond water.\n\nThe pond water was incredibly clear, and visibility was high underwater.\n\n\"Did you notice anything missing?\" the hooded man asked.\n\n\"That... that woman... she's gone.\"\n\nZhou Ze looked around the pond and found the problem: the faceless woman he had encountered the first time he went to hell was gone!\n\n\"Oh,\" the hooded man responded. Immediately after, Zhou Ze saw two reddish glows appear beneath the man's hood—his eyes.\n\nBlood-red eyes!\n\nIn an instant, an overwhelming sense of dread began to wash over him.\n\nA terrifying sense of crisis suddenly descended,\n\nZhou Ze's fingernails also grew long, and a black halo appeared in his eyes.\n\n\"What are you going to do?\" Zhou Ze asked cautiously.\n\nThe hooded man smiled and pointed at him, \"Look at yourself.\"\n\nZhou Ze lowered his head and looked at himself,\n\nHe was astonished to find that\n\nHis body was entwined with layer upon layer of black hair. He hadn't even noticed when this hair had appeared.\n\n\"She's already come for you,\" the hooded man reminded him.\n\n…………\n\nThe morning sun felt warm and comforting. Xu Qinglang brewed a cup of tea, moved his rattan chair to the shop entrance, and basked in the sun. At this time, no one would be ordering takeout, so he was content with the leisure.\n\nA taxi stopped at the intersection ahead, and a high school-aged girl got out.\n\nThe girl was very pretty, with a slightly chubby face, already half-grown into a beauty.\n\nThe girl walked to the bookstore door. Seeing it locked, she immediately kicked the door:\n\n\"Xu Le, you bastard, get out here!\"\n\nBut there was no reaction.\n\nXu Qinglang took a sip of tea and said, \"What do you need him for?\"\n\n\"My sister's been on sick leave at home for over a week, cooped up in her room every day, not eating or drinking. It must be that bastard Xu Le who made my sister angry again!\n\nI'm here to make him come back today and apologize to my sister.\"\n\n\"Your sister?\" Xu Qinglang figured it out. \"Your sister must have been very tired last night.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by that?\" the younger sister asked with a frown.\n\n\"Nothing. Adults' romantic matters, children shouldn't interfere. Just manage your own little boyfriend,\" Xu Qinglang said in a lecturing tone.\n\n\"You're so weird. Don't think just because you're handsome I won't hit you!\n\nOur family matters, it's none of your business!\"\n\nThe younger sister raised her hand, indicating she was really going to hit him!\n\nXu Qinglang \"hmph\"-ed, saying leisurely, \"Don't worry, your sister and brother-in-law's relationship is fine.\"\n\nActually, there was something Xu Qinglang didn't say, but thought to himself: that Doctor Lin seemed like a very traditional woman, who knew she could be so open-minded.\n\nThe speed at which she overcame her inner struggles and embraced a new life was astonishingly fast.\n\nTsk, tsk,\n\nIndeed, the power of love is truly immense and inexplicable. Throughout history, how many lovesick men and women have become moths drawn to this flame called love?\n\n\"What do you mean by that?\"\n\n\"Nothing. Never mind, let me give you a small piece of advice: tell your sister that her Cayenne has more space than that white Maserati, so it's more comfortable for doing things inside.\"\n\n\"Maserati?\" the younger sister asked, puzzled.\n\n\"Yeah, isn't it your sister's new car?\"\n\n\"My sister hasn't left the house for over a week. Where would she get a new car, and a Maserati at that?\"\n\nThe younger sister looked at Xu Qinglang in confusion, then seemed to realize something and suddenly kicked the bookstore door again:\n\n\"Alright, Xu Le, I get it now!\n\nYou eat my family's food,\n\nUse my family's things,\n\nThe money for this bookstore also came from my sister,\n\nAnd now you're too confident, you've found another rich woman, haven't you?\n\nAnd that rich woman drives a Maserati to meet you, right?\n\nXu Le, that's called biting the hand that feeds you, you're heartless!\"\n\n\"Slap!\"\n\nA crisp sound echoed,\n\nThe younger sister jumped in surprise,\n\nTurned her head to look at Xu Qinglang, who was lying in the rattan chair beside her,\n\nIt was the sound of Xu Qinglang's water cup falling.\n\nXu Qinglang's mouth hung open, his face filled with horror,\n\nThen he suddenly leaped out of the rattan chair,\n\nAnd furiously kicked the bookstore door:\n\n\"Damn it,\n\nWake up, you bastard,\n\nWhat the hell are you still sleeping for,\n\nYou really did something ghostly that night!\"\n***\n**Translator's Notes:**\n* \"一甲子\" (yī jiǎ zǐ) literally means \"one sexagenary cycle,\" which is 60 years.",

    "content": "Not long after Xu Qinglang kicked the door, Zhou Ze came down and opened the bookstore. His forehead was sweaty, and he looked a bit tired, as if he hadn't rested well.\n\nTo be honest, he had just woken up himself, but not naturally as usual; he had been startled awake.\n\nThe last image in his dream, those black strands of hair wrapped around his body, still made his scalp tingle even now, recalling it.\n\n\"Xu Le!\"\n\nThe sister-in-law stood with her hands on her hips, in a posture that demanded an explanation!\n\nZhou Ze nodded at Xu Qinglang, motioning for him to come in. Then, in front of his sister-in-law outside, Zhou Ze locked the bookstore door again, isolating her outside.\n\nThe sister-in-law looked incredulous.\n\nXu Le actually dared to ignore her!\n\nThe young girl's princess temper flared up. She had come this time to demand an explanation for her sister and had even learned about the Maserati woman from Xu Qinglang. How could she just leave?\n\nFine, you lock the door, do you?!\n\nThe sister-in-law bent down, found a larger stone on the ground, and prepared to smash the glass door. But just as she was about to take a running start, Zhou Ze, inside the bookstore, turned and glanced at her.\n\nAt this moment, black light swirled in Zhou Ze's eyes.\n\nThe sister-in-law shivered, stumbling back several steps, and instinctively clamped her legs together.\n\nThe scene from that night in the bathroom, when she was scared, resurfaced in her mind.\n\nThat night,\n\nShe had been so scared she wet herself.\n\n\"Xu Le, you... you just wait!\"\n\nThe sister-in-law uttered one last threat, then left in a panic, silently blaming herself for meddling. She should just go home and tell her parents about all this.\n\nShe would say that their obedient son-in-law, whom they had chosen themselves, had another woman outside!\n\n…\n\nInside the bookstore, after Xu Qinglang entered, he had been organizing his words, swallowing his saliva. He had seen his share of big scenes, but at this moment, he still felt a deep sense of lingering fear.\n\nBecause at that time, neither he, nor the female corpse, nor Zhou Ze, had recognized the true identity of that woman!\n\nThis was too terrifying,\n\nAnd it made one deeply ponder!\n\nIt was like watching those impressionists on variety shows imitating celebrities singing; you might find it quite interesting.\n\nBut suddenly, someone imitated your parents, your husband, or your wife, and lived with you, yet you remained completely unaware.\n\nHow terrifying would that be!\n\n\"Last night, the one who came in the Maserati wasn't Doctor Lin, wasn't your wife!\n\nYour wife didn't change cars at all. She took leave from work after you confessed to her.\"\n\nXu Qinglang finally spoke.\n\nZhou Ze's pupils constricted slightly.\n\nHe didn't say anything but sat down on the chair behind the counter.\n\nIn his dream, the man in the hoodie from Rongcheng had already given him a warning, so even though he was indeed surprised by Xu Qinglang's words now, he could still handle it.\n\n\"How can you be so calm?\" Xu Qinglang asked, somewhat strangely. \"Or do you know who that woman is?\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head, \"At the time, I really had no idea. I thought it was Doctor Lin.\n\nBut thinking back now, many things don't add up.\n\nShe suddenly came to me, seemingly having accepted everything.\n\nI suddenly became very proactive and impulsive.\n\nShe was also very cooperative, every movement, though appearing shy and hesitant, perfectly managed to stir the most sensitive part of a man's heart.\"\n\n\"What kind of ghost was that?\" Xu Qinglang pursed his lips and asked again, \"Which kind of ghost?\"\n\n\"A woman from the Yellow Springs Road in Hell who likes to dance with both hands in the pond. This woman has no face.\"\n\nUpon saying this,\n\nZhou Ze suddenly felt a sense of realization.\n\nThe Faceless Woman,\n\nThose who saw her appearance always found her facelessness horrifying and bizarre,\n\nBut they overlooked that,\n\nShe had no face,\n\nBecause she had the ability to transform into any face she needed!\n\nThis was the essence of being faceless.\n\nFrom nothing, something can be created!\n\n\"The Faceless Woman?\" Xu Qinglang frowned. \"I think I read about her in a Qing Dynasty ghost story. It's said she's a ghost formed from the resentment of the deceased on the Yellow Springs Road, always waiting for a chance to return to the mortal realm.\"\n\n\"Something like that,\" Zhou Ze nodded, adding, \"Find that ghost story, and let me read it too.\"\n\n\"I'll look for it when I get back. It's something I read as a child, so I probably won't find it.\n\nBy the way, did you have a relationship with that female ghost?\n\nJust as you said, she came to you to seduce you, right?\"\n\n\"No.\" Zhou Ze shook his head, picked up the new teacup on the counter, and took a sip of tea.\n\nHe said gravely, \"At the last moment, I sensed something was wrong.\n\nI beat a retreat.\"\n\nZhou Ze couldn't admit that it was because Xu Qinglang, that damn bastard, had talked to him so much that afternoon about body, soul, DNA, and being cuckolded, causing him to have a psychological block and thus preventing him from being successfully seduced.\n\nIn fact, Zhou Ze himself was baffled. His bookstore mostly stocked online novels and physical books, with plenty of rebirth and transmigration stories.\n\nIn those books, it was normal for protagonists to have children, and it seemed natural, without any sense of incongruity.\n\nWhy, when it came to him acting out the plot of a novel, were there so many complications?\n\nWas he...\n\nToo idle?\n\nNo, Xu Qinglang should be the idle one.\n\nOnly this buffoon would be so bored as to help him analyze and ponder such philosophical questions.\n\nBut it seemed he couldn't blame Xu Qinglang. If Xu Qinglang hadn't said those things to him that afternoon, he would probably have already sealed the deal.\n\nAnd the consequences would be severe.\n\nIf someone was fishing, and he bit the hook, his fate would be to become meat on the chopping block.\n\n\"She failed?\" Xu Qinglang asked.\n\n\"Mm.\" Zhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"Then why did she target you?\"\n\n\"Maybe she's not like that Madam Bai, who values matching status,\" Zhou Ze chuckled.\n\n\"......\" Xu Qinglang.\n\n\"It's probably out of jealousy. Because I could come back, and she couldn't. And now, I have a physical body and a new life,\" Zhou Ze speculated.\n\n\"She's back now too, and clearly, her target is you,\" Xu Qinglang analyzed. \"This means her return isn't so pure; there might be other restrictions.\"\n\n\"For example, for some special purpose, someone intentionally allowed her to return?\" Zhou Ze considered the problem from a different angle.\n\n\"I always feel like you know something, so, am I worrying for nothing? Do you actually have everything under control?\"\n\n\"I found out in a dream.\"\n\n\"Do you think I'm stupid enough to believe such nonsense?\" Xu Qinglang retorted.\n\nZhou Ze gently rubbed his forehead.\n\nThe little loli hastily handed over the Ghost Catcher's duty to him, and the Faceless Woman was released from Hell.\n\nIt was highly likely that this was to catch the man from Rongcheng, the one who had warned him in his dream.\n\nBut that Faceless Woman clearly intended to use her official duties to carry out some personal schemes.\n\nFor example,\n\nTo set him up?\n\n\"Anyway, for now, I'll try not to leave the bookstore until this blows over.\"\n\n\"That's understandable.\" Xu Qinglang nodded, then leaned closer and said to Zhou Ze, \"Hey, do you still have issues with the body and DNA stuff?\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head, \"Am I that boring?\"\n\n\"Actually, it's easy to get over this. DNA is just a code, but offspring are also the crystallization of one's soul. Anyway, I can't explain this topic clearly.\n\nIn short, even normal people who haven't transmuted or possessed bodies, whose children with their wives might not even be their own,\n\nYou don't need to care too much about this.\"\n\n\"I never realized you were so good at comforting people,\" Zhou Ze stood up and said to Xu Qinglang, \"Come with me to the bathroom.\"\n\nXu Qinglang followed Zhou Ze to the bathroom.\n\nZhou Ze directly took off his jacket and the clothes underneath.\n\n\"You need to exercise more,\" Xu Qinglang shook his head, looking very displeased.\n\nJust then, the female corpse came down the stairs. The bathroom was next to the staircase, and Bai Yingying immediately saw the two men together in the bathroom!\n\n\"Oh, I suddenly realized I haven't had enough sleep yet.\"\n\nFeigning a yawn, Bai Yingying pretended to go back upstairs to rest, not wanting to disturb the two men's private time downstairs.\n\n\"Bring the first-aid kit from upstairs and get some gauze and antiseptic ready,\" Zhou Ze said to Bai Yingying.\n\n\"Got it, Boss.\"\n\nBai Yingying hurried upstairs to get the items, thinking to herself, *Are the boss and them going to be that intense?*\n\n*They're preparing for blood already?*\n\n\"What exactly are you doing?\" Xu Qinglang crossed his arms, looking at Zhou Ze, with obvious distaste in his eyes.\n\nZhou Ze smiled, \"You're clearly not gay, so why do you usually act that way?\"\n\n\"It's for the fun of life, don't you get it?\" Xu Qinglang pointed at Zhou Ze's abdomen, \"Even if it's someone else's body, you should still exercise more. Look at this flab, tsk, tsk, disgusting.\"\n\nZhou Ze's fingernails immediately grew long.\n\nXu Qinglang froze for a moment.\n\n*Shit,*\n\n*I just made fun of your body, is that really worth getting so angry about?*\n\nHowever, in the next moment, Zhou Ze directly used his index fingernail to lightly slice downwards from his jawline. A streak of blood slowly appeared, and beads of blood seeped out.\n\nAt the same time,\n\nFrom Zhou Ze's neck to his abdomen, lines of black powder appeared. These powders were like the chalk lines used by carpenters, very fine, and previously invisible.\n\nAs the fingernail passed, these chalk lines also fell off.\n\nZhou Ze let out a long breath,\n\nLooking at himself in the mirror, and the long bloodstain on his chest.\n\n\"What is this?\"\n\nXu Qinglang held his breath, bending down to examine the fallen black powder.\n\n\"It's hair,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\nHair wrapped around,\n\nHis soul.\n\n\"Boss, I'm coming in.\" Bai Yingying walked into the bathroom with the first-aid kit. When she saw the black powder on the floor, a strange look immediately appeared on her face, saying:\n\n\"Boss, are these things you use for foreplay?\"\n\n\"Do you recognize this?\" Xu Qinglang pointed to the black powder.\n\n\"This is Ghost Saliva Incense. It's resentment formed from ghosts over a hundred years old. My Madam used to have some too.\"\n\n\"Tell me the effects,\" Xu Qinglang asked.\n\n\"It incites a person's impulses. For example, if you want to do something, and you also inhale this stuff, it can make you ten or even a hundred times more eager to do that thing.\"\n\nUpon hearing this, Xu Qinglang's mouth twisted into a smile, then he glanced at Zhou Ze.\n\nHe chuckled:\n\n\"Old Zhou, is this Faceless Woman trying to breed with you?\"",

    "content": "Zhou Ze didn't believe the Faceless Woman would do anything evil. Her restrictions would only be more numerous than his, otherwise she wouldn't have needed to \"disguise\" herself as Dr. Lin to get close to him.\n\nIt was just that being targeted by someone like her was truly uncomfortable.\n\nShe could become a security guard in a mall, a bus driver, an old granny by the roadside waiting for you to help her up,\n\nor a caring big sister in an alley calling you in for tea.\n\nAs long as you had a social network, as long as you needed to go out, she had the ability to approach you, and you had to be constantly ready for an ambush from anyone around you.\n\nWhat exactly she wanted from him, Zhou Ze didn't understand, but judging from many examples in supernatural novels where female ghosts liked to absorb men's yang essence to replenish themselves, the Faceless Woman probably had nothing more than these few motives.\n\nOr, she wanted his body?\n\nOr, she wanted his current temporary employee qualification?\n\nZhou Ze wasn't sure if the little loli knew about this, but even if she did, she probably wouldn't intervene, because it was very likely that the Faceless Woman was deliberately released by the little loli's group of ghost-catchers to help them with things.\n\nThe Faceless Woman hadn't directly attacked him, perhaps because she had other concerns. Of course, looking at the now incredibly well-behaved Bai Yingying, perhaps the Faceless Woman was also very wary of his fingernails.\n\nWhen he first entered the Underworld, the Faceless Woman wanted to keep him, but he managed to escape by injuring her with his fingernails. Perhaps that incident indeed left a deep impression on her, forcing her to use a honey trap to deal with him.\n\nBut one thing also made Zhou Ze a little sad:\n\nGhost Drool Incense,\n\nten or a hundred times the urge,\n\nyet he was still able to restrain himself.\n\nZhou Ze felt no pride in his strong willpower,\n\nonly a faint, elusive melancholy.\n\nSitting at the counter, casually flipping through some books, Zhou Ze also searched online for information about the Faceless Woman, to see if he could find any valuable clues.\n\nHe didn't find any valuable information, but he did find Stephen Chow's movie \"Forbidden City Cop.\"\n\nThen Zhou Ze and Bai Yingying spent half the afternoon rewatching the movie.\n\nThere was a villain BOSS in it who also had no face and could transform into other people.\n\nAfter the movie, it was already evening. Zhou Ze motioned for Bai Yingying to open the shop door.\n\nBai Yingying hesitated and said, \"Boss, aren't you afraid she'll come again?\"\n\n\"Are we not doing business?\" Zhou Ze retorted, \"Or can you contribute some burial goods for me to exchange for money to\ncirculate the shop's funds?\"\n\nThe female corpse pouted and still went to open the door.\n\nShe was rich. When Madam Bai was buried, she was at least a rich young lady, so she should have had a lot of burial goods. Plus, Madam Bai had stayed in the human world for two hundred years, and she couldn't have taken those *mammon* into the Underworld, so they were naturally left behind.\n\nSeeing how many bags Bai Yingying had bought during her limited few outings, Zhou Ze knew well enough.\n\nAt first, Zhou Ze suspected that the female corpse might have stolen money from the shop to spend, but later, when Zhou Ze found that all the money in the shop combined wasn't enough for the price of a few of her bags, he stopped suspecting.\n\nMadam Bai, in her time, had wanted Xu Qinglang, who owned more than twenty *yang houses*, to marry her in an eight-person sedan chair.\n\nBai Yingying was obsessed with brand-name handbags.\n\nThis was definitely not good news for single people in the world, meaning that even after you died and became a ghost, it was still tough.\n\nSoon after the shop door opened, while Zhou Ze was just making a cup of tea, a middle-aged man walked into the shop.\n\nBai Yingying stood still, staring at him.\n\nZhou Ze also subconsciously looked at him. Although his rationality told him it was unlikely the Faceless Woman would be so eager to change into another appearance and come back, he always had to be wary.\n\nThe middle-aged man was wearing a leather jacket that was faded in many places, and on his feet, he had a pair of somewhat old leather shoes. His trousers were casual pants, not very flashy.\n\nOn his head, he wore a tall hat, which looked a bit comical.\n\nThe middle-aged man walked to the bookshelf, subconsciously rubbing his hands, ready to find a book to read. But as he looked left and right, his brows furrowed deeper and deeper, and he complained:\n\n\"Boss, your place is all novels and other random stuff. Don't you have any other readable books?\"\n\n\"Here they are.\"\n\nZhou Ze motioned for Bai Yingying to move the box from behind the counter.\n\nBai Yingying did as told.\n\nThe man squatted down and continued to choose books from the box. He flipped through several, and the covers were all indecent.\n\nFor example, \"A Bin,\"\n\nfor example, \"The Doorman,\"\n\nfor example, \"Chen Pipi,\"\n\nThe middle-aged man's fingers trembled with anger as he pushed the box forward.\n\n\"Why are you giving me these things!\"\n\nThe middle-aged man was furious. He stood up and pointed at Zhou Ze:\n\n\"Are all booksellers nowadays so shameless!\n\nFilth and corruption!\n\nFilth and corruption!\"\n\nZhou Ze lit a cigarette, one foot propped on the counter, and ignored the guy.\n\nThe middle-aged man angrily turned to leave. When he reached the shop door, he turned his head and saw that there seemed to be some relatively serious books on the small bookshelf by the door. He stopped then and there, picked out a copy of Mr. Qian Mu's \"A General History of China,\" and sat down on a small stool to read.\n\nZhou Ze didn't bother him. His bookstore, anyway, welcomed all comers, humans and ghosts, and even those who were neither. It was just that the current period was a bit tense, and he needed to pay more attention to the Faceless Woman's movements.\n\nJust then, Zhou Ze's phone rang. He took out his phone and saw that it was his sister-in-law's call.\n\n\"Hello.\" Zhou Ze listened carefully to the call.\n\nLast time, it was Dr. Lin's WeChat. This time, it was his sister-in-law's phone call. It wouldn't be surprising if the Faceless Woman played the \"half-ass\" trick again.\n\n\"Brother-in-law...\" his sister-in-law's voice purred from the other end of the line.\n\nZhou Ze immediately hung up.\n\nProblematic,\n\nvery problematic!\n\nWhen had his sister-in-law ever been so gentle?\n\nThis was clearly the rhythm of offering herself up on a silver platter,\n\njust like Dr. Lin saying she'd wear stockings next time in the Maserati that night.\n\nZhou Ze didn't think he had... no, Zhou Ze didn't think \"Xu Le's face\" could possess the ability of a female killer.\n\nThe phone rang again, still her number.\n\nAfter thinking about it, he answered the phone again:\n\n\"Hello.\"\n\n\"Xu Le, you bastard, how dare you hang up on me!\"\n\nNow the persona was normal.\n\n\"What is it?\" Zhou Ze replied coldly.\n\n\"My friend and I went to KFC to study, and my wallet was stolen. Do you have any money? Just seven or eight thousand would be enough for an emergency.\"\n\nZhou Ze hung up the phone again.\n\nHmm,\n\nit must still be the Faceless Woman.\n\nEven if it wasn't the Faceless Woman, when he heard \"seven or eight thousand\" being enough, Zhou Ze was convinced she was disguised by the Faceless Woman.\n\nYes,\n\nthat's right.\n\nThe phone rang again, and Zhou Ze was getting annoyed. The middle-aged man sitting there reading frowned and looked at Zhou Ze; clearly, Zhou Ze's repeated phone rings had disturbed his reading.\n\n\"Sorry, I'll put it on silent,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nThe man lowered his head and continued reading.\n\nHowever, his sister-in-law kept calling, so Zhou Ze had to answer again.\n\n\"Xu Le, you can't abandon me! I can only ask you for this money. Can I borrow it from you?\n\nWhat if I don't tell my parents and my sister about the Maserati woman?\"\n\n\"You'd better tell them.\"\n\n\"…………\" his sister-in-law.\n\nHoly cow, don't just give up like that! You still have a chance to be saved!\n\nAfter paying all sorts of fees last time, he only had a few thousand left in his pocket. If he gave it all to her, he'd be left with nothing.\n\n\"Xu Le, please, help me out. I'll tell you the truth. My friend and I went to a disco, and both our wallets were stolen. My parents and sister can't know about this, or they'll kill me.\n\nMy friend also needs to pay her painting class fee tomorrow. Her tuition was already in her wallet, and this can't be delayed.\"\n\n\"Tell her to ask her parents,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Her family's not well-off. This tuition money was earned by her working during the winter vacation. Her family won't agree to give her money, Xu Le, can I borrow it from you? I'll pay you back next month when I get my allowance.\"\n\nZhou Ze still wanted to refuse,\n\nbut just then,\n\nthe middle-aged man who had been sitting there quietly reading suddenly stood up,\n\nhis breathing began to grow heavy,\n\nveins bulging on his neck,\n\nlike he was in heat!\n\nZhou Ze pressed his hand directly on the man's shoulder, holding him down.\n\nAt the same time, he told Bai Yingying, \"Get the money.\"\n\nBai Yingying took out five thousand yuan from behind the counter and handed it to Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze took the money with one hand and gave it to his sister-in-law, while also instructing her:\n\n\"You have to pay it back.\"\n\n\"Got it.\"\n\nHis sister-in-law, having received the money, her gaze lingered on Bai Yingying, saying, \"Who is she?\"\n\n\"A shop assistant, your sister knows her,\" Zhou Ze explained.\n\n\"Oh, okay.\"\n\nHis sister-in-law, being beholden, pulled her female classmate and directly turned to leave the bookstore.\n\nMeanwhile, the middle-aged man next to Zhou Ze made to chase after them but was directly pressed against the glass window by Zhou Ze, who had turned around.\n\nIf this guy hadn't suddenly gone crazy, how could Zhou Ze have given the money so readily?\n\n\"Are you incapable of changing your ways?\" Zhou Ze said in a deep voice, \"I was still hesitant, but now there's nothing to hesitate about. I'll just send you back to the Underworld.\"\n\nThe middle-aged man was still struggling.\n\n\"You won't believe it until you see your own coffin, will you?\" Zhou Ze laughed in extreme anger, pointing directly at the glass window in front of them and saying, \"Look at what hat you're wearing on your head.\"\n\nThe middle-aged man looked at the glass window and saw his \"reflection,\"\n\nIn the reflection,\n\nhe was wearing a tall hat,\n\non which were written four large black characters: \"Dignified Beast.\"\n\nThe middle-aged man froze,\n\ninstantly stopped struggling,\n\nand murmured:\n\n\"Disgraceful... disgraceful...\"",

    "content": "\"Yo, a wolf in sheep's clothing?\"\n\nXu Qinglang was just about to close the door when he saw a \"customer\" in Zhou Ze's shop and came over to tease,\n\n\"Brother, your outfit is quite trendy.\"\n\nZhou Ze pointed to the tall hat on the middle-aged man's head and asked, \"What does that mean?\"\n\n\"A definitive judgment, you know.\"\n\nXu Qinglang stretched,\n\n\"It's like how emperors, empresses, and high-ranking officials in ancient times would receive a posthumous title after death, or like how elementary school students get 'excellent,' 'good,' 'pass,' or 'average' on their final report cards.\"\n\n\"So, this hat is an evaluation given to him by his social network after his death?\"\n\n\"Pretty much, yeah. It also depends on luck. Most people aren't famous after they die, so they don't get this kind of thing. Even famous people rarely do. Anyway, it's about luck, just like how you could crawl out of hell, while ninety-nine percent of other ghosts have to go and reincarnate peacefully.\n\nOh, I remember reading in a book that Qin Hui also had a tall hat on his head after he died, with 'Framed Loyal Officials' written on it.\"\n\n\"Then Yue Wumu's hat would say 'Serve the Country Loyally'?\"\n\n\"Nonsense. People are paraded with tall hats for infamy. A good reputation doesn't need a hat.\"\n\nZhou Ze let go of his hand, looked at his right palm, and prepared to open the Gates of Hell to throw this guy in. This guy had acted like a bull in rut when he saw the young girl earlier. He really was a wolf in sheep's clothing, looking quite refined and scholarly.\n\n\"Are you sending me down?\" The middle-aged man seemed to have quieted down now.\n\n\"Otherwise?\" Zhou Ze retorted.\n\n\"Can I finish the last volume of this book?\" The middle-aged man took out a piece of hell money from his pocket.\n\n\"Heh, are you trying to bribe a beggar?\" The female corpse on the side couldn't help but sneer, \"Looks like you were quite a failure in life, not even your relatives gave you any incense offerings.\"\n\nHell money given by a dead person themselves is different from hell money burned by living people. Of course, the amount of hell money a dead person has is usually related to how much their relatives offer, but there are also limits, otherwise, couldn't one just burn a lot and become the richest person in the underworld?\n\nThe middle-aged man pursed his lips, looking at Zhou Ze with pleading eyes: \"Please.\"\n\nXu Qinglang lit a cigarette beside them, saying nothing. This was Zhou Ze's business; it wasn't appropriate for him to interfere.\n\nZhou Ze glanced at the *Outline of National Studies* in the middle-aged man's hand and said, \"I've read this book before. In my opinion, there are several obvious errors in it.\"\n\n\"Any book with academic research value will have its own errors. Errors are also the accumulation of predecessors,\" the middle-aged man said seriously.\n\n\"But what's the point of a book that's all praise?\" Zhou Ze retorted.\n\n\"Zeng Guofan once wrote to Zeng Jize, 'One must not lightly criticize ancient people.' Boss, although you run a bookstore, you are not, after all, a scholar.\n\nMr. Qian Mu wrote this book during the Anti-Japanese War, preparing for the worst-case scenario of national subjugation. He wrote this book hoping that if the nation truly fell, there would still be people who could secretly read and savor it in the dead of night, recalling our ancestors' civilization and heritage.\n\nBooks of criticism and satire are naturally more satisfying to read, but if the nation truly falls in the future, and someone sees such a book, filled with nothing but ridicule and criticism, who would still feel a connection to their former country and to China?\"\n\nThe middle-aged man spoke eloquently, gesturing continuously with one hand while holding the book in the other.\n\nLike a teacher on a podium explaining his theories to students,\n\nHe was very agitated and deeply engrossed.\n\n\"You're a teacher, aren't you?\" Xu Qinglang asked with a smile, \"Oh, I mean, when you were alive.\"\n\n\"I was a middle school Chinese teacher,\" the middle-aged man replied.\n\n\"A wolf in sheep's clothing, indeed.\" Xu Qinglang snorted, \"I'm going to bed. Good night, Boss Zhou.\"\n\nXu Qinglang waved his hand and left the bookstore, walking back. His swaying posture was quite graceful.\n\nZhou Ze turned his head to look at Bai Yingying, \"Was his back just now very much like a pimp in the pleasure houses of your era?\"\n\n\"My era, huh.\" Bai Yingying thought hard, then shook her head, saying, \"Even the courtesans weren't as pretty as him.\"\n\nZhou Ze pursed his lips, not too surprised by Bai Yingying's answer.\n\nThe middle-aged man sat down again to read, seemingly not caring if Zhou Ze had agreed or not. Reading a little more was the most important thing; perhaps he could savor it a bit longer on the road to the Yellow Springs.\n\nThinking of this guy's agitation when he saw the young girl earlier, Zhou Ze felt agitated for him.\n\n\"Boss, I think he's quite learned,\" the female corpse whispered.\n\n\"Was your mistress's old poor scholar quite learned too?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nBai Yingying nodded.\n\n\"That's hard to say.\" Zhou Ze also found it difficult to quantify, so he just said, \"Mr. Ji Xianlin recorded in his diary, 'I have no other wish in this life, I only wish to sleep with more women and interact with women from various places.'\"\n\n\"Literati are truly lustful,\" Bai Yingying muttered.\n\n\"Men are all lustful,\" Zhou Ze corrected.\n\nBai Yingying looked at Zhou Ze and said coquettishly, \"Boss, you have such great self-control.\"\n\n\"Go scrub the toilet in the bathroom.\"\n\n\"............\" Bai Yingying.\n\nZhou Ze didn't know why, but he wasn't in a hurry to open the Gates of Hell and send the middle-aged man in. Instead, he sat down opposite the middle-aged man, pulled out his phone, and idly browsed the web.\n\n\"What's your name?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nThe other party didn't answer, seemingly absorbed in reading.\n\n\"If you don't answer, you won't get to read the book.\"\n\n\"Ren Xindu.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded. Just as he was about to try searching for this guy's name to see if there were any scandalous news about him, the bookstore door was pushed open again.\n\nHis sister-in-law, having left, had returned.\n\n\"What are you back for?\" Zhou Ze stood up, instinctively reaching out to press down on the middle-aged man's shoulder. He was afraid this guy would go into rut again.\n\nHowever, to Zhou Ze's surprise, the middle-aged man remained quietly seated, reading, with no signs of agitation whatsoever.\n\nHmm, has he learned his lesson this time?\n\nHis sister-in-law took out her phone, took a photo of the bookstore and Zhou Ze, then sent it, and then clicked on a voice message:\n\n\"Sis, I told you I was reading at Xule Bookstore all afternoon, but you just wouldn't believe me.\n\nAlright, alright, I'm going back now, right now, okay?\n\nHonestly, I just wanted to read in peace, and you had to disturb me.\"\n\nAfter sending the voice message, his sister-in-law stuck out her tongue and let out a long sigh, saying:\n\n\"Phew, that was close. Good thing I hadn't hailed a taxi yet, or I would've been busted.\"\n\n\"At your young age, don't go to those shady places; it's easy to get taken advantage of.\"\n\nZhou Ze still gave a reminder, even if she wasn't his sister-in-law, this was purely a middle-aged man's advice to a younger relative.\n\n\"Alright, alright, Xule, how did you become just like my sister?\" His sister-in-law clearly didn't listen.\n\n\"Where's that girl?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"She went home. I just watched her take a taxi; her home is a bit far. I was planning to take a taxi too, but then my sister WeChat messaged me to check up on me.\"\n\n\"The money?\"\n\n\"Of course I gave the money back to her!\" His sister-in-law said somewhat nonchalantly, \"Don't worry, it's just five thousand yuan. I'll pay you back when I get my allowance.\"\n\n\"You pay it back?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Yeah, who else would pay it back, me or her?\n\nHer father is paralyzed at home, and her mother runs a breakfast stall. Life is very hard for them. I don't want to see her suffer working part-time anymore.\n\nOh, and she was sexually harassed by her homeroom teacher in middle school, which is why she's so quiet now.\n\nI consider her a good friend, so I should take care of her a little more, right?\n\nAlright, Xule, that's enough for today. I'm going back now.\"\n\nHis sister-in-law waved her hand, pushed open the bookstore door, and left.\n\nZhou Ze sat back down on his chair, glancing at his phone for a moment, then at the middle-aged man engrossed in his book.\n\nThen he muttered to himself:\n\n\"He molested a student in his class, and after being discovered, he committed suicide by jumping off a building.\"\n\nThe middle-aged man continued reading, as if he hadn't heard anything, but his tall hat was so clear, so glaring.\n\nIn ancient times, criminals had characters tattooed on their faces to mark them as lower-class citizens, which had a similar effect to this tall hat.\n\nBai Yingying worked very fast. There was nothing she could do; she was once a lady from a wealthy family, but now she had to humble herself. Plus, Zhou Ze was a bit of a germaphobe, which undoubtedly increased her workload.\n\n\"Boss, I'm exhausted.\"\n\nBai Yingying took off her jacket. She wasn't afraid of the cold, coming out in just a short-sleeved shirt with a rag in her hand.\n\nShe looked very young, but was well-developed.\n\n\"Boss, why doesn't he react to me?\" Bai Yingying asked, puzzled.\n\n\"You're dead.\"\n\n\"But I'm still very pretty!\" Bai Yingying struck a seductive pose.\n\n\"Forget it. You're so cold down there, any man who goes in will probably freeze stiff and become eternally erect. No need for Viagra.\"\n\n\"No boss talks down to people like you do.\" Bai Yingying rolled her eyes at Zhou Ze. \"By the way, did your sister-in-law come back just now? I heard her voice from the bathroom.\"\n\n\"Yeah, she came back and left again.\"\n\nZhou Ze suddenly thought of something.\n\nNo, wait,\n\nIf this middle-aged man had no reaction to Bai Yingying because Bai Yingying was a zombie,\n\nThen why did he also have no reaction to his sister-in-law?\n\nBy elimination, one could easily arrive at an answer:\n\nThis guy only had a reaction to the girl next to his sister-in-law.\n\nThe news reports found online had no photos to protect the privacy of the victimized girl.\n\nSome things,\n\nCannot withstand scrutiny,\n\nNor consideration.\n\nSlowly,\n\nZhou Ze began to figure it out.\n\nHis sister-in-law seemed feisty, but she was actually incredibly naive, like a big dummy.\n\n\"Hey, was that girl your student?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nThe middle-aged man continued reading, not answering.\n\nZhou Ze directly snatched the book from his hand, \"I'm asking you a question.\"\n\nThe middle-aged man looked up at Zhou Ze, then nodded.\n\n\"Did you or did you not molest her?\" Zhou Ze asked again.\n\nThe middle-aged man still didn't answer.\n\n\"If you don't answer properly, I'll send you to hell right now,\" Zhou Ze threatened.\n\n\"I've finished the book, I can go now.\" The middle-aged man stood up, looking quite unburdened.\n\n\"You're trying to be like Wen Tianxiang, huh?\" Zhou Ze sneered.\n\n\"No matter what she is, she is ultimately my student. It's my responsibility for not having educated her well,\" the middle-aged man replied.\n\n\"So you're saying the news report I just read was false, that you didn't molest her, and she deliberately slandered you to get compensation from the school?\" Zhou Ze pursed his lips.\n\nThen it was easy to imagine what happened: his sister-in-law's wallet was probably stolen by that girl, who then concocted a reason and got his sister-in-law to give her five thousand yuan.\n\nWould a girl from a poor family who worked a winter holiday job carry five thousand yuan in tuition money and go wild at a disco?\n\nHis sister-in-law had been played.\n\n\"Tell me, did you or did you not molest her?\" Zhou Ze grabbed the middle-aged man's shoulder, asking very seriously.\n\nThe middle-aged man was silent for a moment, then said, \"That's my business, it has nothing to do with you.\"\n\n\"Screw you, that's my five thousand yuan!\"\n\nZhou Ze really wanted to slap him, but he held back, raising his hand and hitting the man's hat. But upon touching the hat, Zhou Ze felt a burning sensation in his palm; it hurt a little.\n\nThis hat,\n\nSo hard,\n\nIt actually caused a slight stinging sensation in his fingernails,\n\nAnd looking again, even though the entire person was flung away, the hat remained firmly rooted on the middle-aged man's head.\n\nZhou Ze remembered what Xu Qinglang had said earlier: \"Many mouths can melt metal.\"¹\n\nThis hat,\n\nWhether true or false,\n\nCould not be removed.\n\n---\n¹ \"眾口鑠金\" (zhòng kǒu shuò jīn) is a Chinese idiom that literally means \"many mouths can melt metal.\" It refers to the power of public opinion or gossip to influence, slander, or damage someone's reputation, even if it's unfounded. In this context, it implies that once a reputation, especially a bad one, is established by common consensus, it's very difficult to change, regardless of the truth.",

    "content": "“Mom, I’m home.”\n\nThe girl pushed open the front door and called out. From the inner room, she heard her parents arguing.\n\nWhether she was home or whether she had eaten dinner was irrelevant to her parents.\n\nHer father was paralyzed in bed. Although he could move a bit, he couldn’t do anything other than barely managing to relieve himself into a spittoon.\n\nHer mother went out daily to set up a breakfast stall, working from dawn till dusk.\n\nLogically, their family atmosphere should have been as depicted in many TV reports and newspaper articles:\n\nImpoverished, resilient,\n\nYet not lacking in family warmth and harmony.\n\nAnd she, too, should have excelled in her studies, bringing honor to her parents.\n\nBut perhaps fairy-tale stories are, after all, rare.\n\nHer home was truly very different from the similar reports she had read before.\n\nHer father, paralyzed at home, had not cultivated his character. He had a very violent temper, especially towards her mother who worked outside every day. He often cursed her, saying she had found another man outside, a paramour.\n\nHe called her mother shameless, a whore.\n\nHer mother would always argue with her father, and then her father would throw things and roar.\n\nThis man’s strength for the rest of his life was likely spent on lying in bed and cursing.\n\nYet, she couldn’t fully sympathize with her mother, because the small pieces of jewelry and some clothes her mother occasionally wore back were clearly not the kind her mother would buy herself;\n\nAnd once, when she was with her boyfriend at a hotel, she ran into her mother, who was supposed to be getting ingredients, with another man, entering the same hotel.\n\nAt that moment, both parties almost entered the same elevator. If she hadn’t reacted quickly and told her boyfriend she needed to go to the restroom first, a terribly awkward situation might have unfolded.\n\nThis was a broken home,\n\nAppearing to be precarious, and in fact, it was indeed drafty everywhere.\n\nShe didn’t know why her mother didn’t divorce her father, nor did she know why her father, who lay in bed, having lost the ability to work and earn money, or even do housework, had no self-awareness whatsoever.\n\nIn short,\n\nShe habitually unlocked the door with her key,\n\nHabitually heard her parents arguing,\n\nHabitually walked into her small room in the attic,\n\nHabitually poured herself a glass of cool boiled water,\n\nHabitually opened her latest Apple laptop,\n\nHabitually took out her newly bought gentle makeup remover,\n\nHabitually opened the beauty vlogger videos she often watched,\n\nHabitually logged into Zhihu.\n\nThis was her life, and her current rhythm.\n\nThe *gaokao* (national college entrance examination) was already an unreachable dream for her, because her grades were so poor, so terrible that she had already despaired.\n\nShe felt some regret,\n\nRegret that in junior high, she shouldn’t have said her homeroom teacher molested her just for those tens of thousands of yuan.\n\nAt the time, her mother was very agitated, her father very agitated. After she told them about it, her mother didn’t go out to set up her stall for several days. She called a few relatives, who carried her paralyzed father on a stretcher to the school gate.\n\nThe couple cried, embracing each other,\n\nMiserably, pitiably, sorrowfully,\n\nReporters arrived upon hearing the news, like sharks scenting blood.\n\nMorality and ethics, the lack of humanity,\n\nWere often the hot topics most favored by reporters at the time, because they didn’t cross lines, carried very low risk, but the hot topic effect they could reap was immeasurably huge.\n\nIn short,\n\nThe turn of events in that matter caught her somewhat off guard.\n\nInitially, she just wanted a bit more pocket money to buy clothes.\n\nHer homeroom teacher, who was also her Chinese language teacher, knew about her family situation and had helped her out a few times, even paying some of her miscellaneous school fees in advance.\n\nOccasionally, Teacher Ren’s mother would also invite her to their home for dinner.\n\nTeacher Ren was not yet married,\n\nPlus, she often ran to his office and home,\n\nWhich indeed gave many people an opportunity to speculate.\n\nRumors had already started before she exposed the incident, but at that time, she didn't care.\n\nAlthough, she had heard them.\n\nAfter she was caught by the teacher on her way out of a bar where she had secretly gone to play, the teacher became cold towards her. He seemed very disappointed, in her.\n\nHis mother no longer called her over for meals,\n\nHe even stopped paying some of her miscellaneous school fees in advance,\n\nNor did he help her out anymore,\n\nThis made her furious.\n\nThen she used the threat of being molested to demand money from the teacher. She needed money; the lipstick she coveted, the clothes she coveted, the proxy-bought items she coveted, all required money to buy.\n\nBut the teacher refused her, even when she threatened to expose the matter.\n\nEven now, she still believes that her middle school homeroom teacher was indeed a scholar.\n\nAt the time, he even pounded on the desk and admonished her: “Justice resides in people’s hearts.”\n\nHowever,\n\nWas that truly the case?\n\nAfter the matter blew up,\n\nHe was directly suspended from school.\n\nThe immense pressure from public opinion eventually led to his collapse.\n\nHe had angrily fought back,\n\nResponded at length online,\n\nFull of classical Chinese expressions,\n\nEven though she was just a middle school student at the time, just a poor student, she could see then that the teacher’s rebuttal was very pale and powerless.\n\nAlthough seemingly forceful, full of righteous integrity, fearless of rumors.\n\nBut in the eyes of outsiders, this was a dead duck quacking, self-important, trying to muddle through by relying on his teacher status.\n\nThe teacher had taught Chinese for a lifetime, teaching generation after generation of students how to write good essays, but his own “essays” were not well-written.\n\nWhat the outside world and public opinion wanted to see was not his style of writing, and his forceful, “Lu Xun”-esque rebuttals and sarcasm further irritated the nerves of public opinion.\n\nWhat?\n\nAre we all wrong?\n\nOnly you are wise?\n\nImpossible.\n\nThen, there was an even stronger backlash.\n\nNowadays, when celebrities get embroiled in scandals, they immediately hire public relations firms to calm the situation with various maneuvers.\n\nIf simply stating reasons and presenting facts were all it took, if things were truly that simple,\n\nThen most public relations firms today would starve.\n\nAnd at that time, another piece of news was unearthed: one of the teacher’s uncles was a section chief in the local education bureau.\n\nA very minor section chief, over fifty years old, who usually adhered strictly to morals, and was also an old pedant, fond of studying the School of Mind. Because of this, his interpersonal relationships were very poor, and at fifty, he had no chance of further promotion.\n\nBut for this news, the outside world only needed a short headline: “Beast Teacher’s Background Exposed!”\n\nEverything exploded completely.\n\nPeople indulged in venting their “anger,” feeling they were fighting against dark forces and worldly powers,\n\nThe media fully exploited the traffic and exposure,\n\nThis was a grand feast initiated by her.\n\nIn the end, it concluded with the teacher’s leap from the teaching building.\n\nAnd the several tens of thousands of yuan the school initially compensated her family to smooth things over and resume normal teaching served as the “final verdict” for the incident.\n\nIf you weren’t guilty,\n\nHow could you compensate?\n\nRight?\n\nAfter learning of the teacher’s death,\n\nShe suffered for one night, then regretted for a month.\n\nSuffering for one night was because she still had a conscience;\n\nRegretting for a month was because she realized that if she had waited until after she went to university to do this again, she could have profited more, such as securing a master’s recommendation, or even more compensation.\n\nShe took out her wallet from her pocket; it belonged to a girl named Lin Yi, a classmate of hers.\n\nThe wallet contained a good amount of cash and many VIP cards.\n\nA sarcastic smile played on her lips: Hmph, rich people.\n\nRich bitch.\n\nThen she took out the five thousand yuan from her pocket and placed it in her locked small drawer. She felt today’s harvest was good; in fact, she had received many donations afterwards, which she and her parents had split evenly.\n\nShe removed her makeup, washed her hair,\n\nShe reopened the webpage,\n\nLogged into Zhihu,\n\nToday, she was preparing to write about her day’s life.\n\nFor example, she had a brother-in-law who owned a bookstore, a sister who was a doctor, and a father who owned a pharmaceutical company and had once been a hospital director.\n\nShe wrote that today, a classmate who had claimed to be molested by a teacher, but was actually a “green tea bitch,” had lost her wallet. She despised her in her heart, yet still took five thousand yuan from her brother-in-law to give to her.\n\nBecause five thousand yuan, for her, was just a fraction of her monthly pocket money.\n\nJust consider it pity for this “green tea bitch.”\n\nShe had a large group of followers who paid attention to her updates. As soon as she posted something, many people would comment and like it. She liked this feeling; here, she found her new life.\n\nSometimes, she even had trouble distinguishing between the virtual world of the internet and the reality of real life.\n\nShe felt she was Lin Yi.\n\nOf course, some people also mocked her for looking down on the poor, being snobbish just because she came from a wealthy family.\n\nShe calmly replied: “Who cares?”\n\nShe closed her laptop, preparing to rest. Staying up late was a woman’s enemy; she needed to take care of herself. Her appearance seemed to be the only truly valuable thing her parents had given her.\n\nShe went to the bathroom to wash up.\n\nHer parents’ argument continued. Her father was throwing cups, cursing her mother, and her mother cursed him back, calling him a good-for-nothing, asking why he didn’t just die,\n\nTo find a car on the road, lie down under it, and then pay the family a sum of money, thus fulfilling his duty as a man.\n\nShe chuckled listening to them,\n\nAfter washing up, she returned to her bedroom.\n\nOpening the door,\n\nShe found someone sitting on her bed,\n\nA man,\n\nThe man was smoking a cigarette,\n\nThe ash falling into the lid of her newly bought skincare product.\n\nFor a moment, she didn’t know how to face this man.\n\nHer closed laptop had been reopened by the man,\n\nHe was looking at her posts on Zhihu.\n\nSilence,\n\nLasted about three minutes.\n\nShe finally asked tremblingly, “What are you doing here?”\n\nShe knew him, had just seen him, Lin Yi’s brother-in-law who owned the bookstore.\n\nZhou Ze stubbed out his cigarette in her skincare product.\n\nHer mouth twitched. That one was very expensive; she had only bought it after spending time with an old man.\n\nZhou Ze looked at her with a half-smile,\n\nThen said very seriously,\n\n“Time to pay up.”",

\n\n\n\n  女孩兒主動向周澤走了一步，\n\n\n\n  「我父親癱瘓在床，他沒能力阻止你。\n\n\n\n  我和我母親都是女人，也打不過你。\n\n\n\n  你來殺吧，\n\n\n\n  殺了我們全家。」\n\n\n\n  女孩兒走到了周澤面前，聲音平緩。\n\n\n\n  周澤側著頭，看著女孩，順帶欣賞著對方的身體。\n\n\n\n  只是，\n\n\n\n  的確是有些頭痛啊。\n\n\n\n  這位，\n\n\n\n  生冷不忌的樣子。\n\n\n\n  而且，\n\n\n\n  她似乎篤定自己不想殺人。\n\n\n\n  周澤有些後悔了，早知道應該讓白鶯鶯上來，讓女人來對付女人，似乎是最合適的方式。\n\n\n\n  「又或者，我現在喊一嗓子，就說你非法入室打算強、、、、奸。」女孩兒低下頭，讓自己年輕的臉湊到周澤面前。\n\n\n\n  「然後，我父母會聽到我的聲音過來，鄰居們也會來，也會有人報警，你就會身敗名裂。」\n\n\n\n  周澤笑了笑，道：「是不是這次我不光討不回我的錢，還得另外再給你錢消災？」\n\n\n\n  「你不缺錢吧？」女孩微微抬起下顎，她下顎圓潤，鎖骨也很精緻，連那眼睫毛，都帶著些年輕女孩迷人的姿態，「林家，很有錢的。」 \n\n\n\n  但我窮啊。\n\n\n\n  周澤有些無奈地嘆了口氣。\n\n\n\n  「一千塊，我陪你睡一次。」女孩盯著周澤，伸出舌頭舔了舔自己的嘴唇，「就在這裡，就在我家，就在我父母房間的隔壁，怎麼樣？」\n\n\n\n  周澤感知到一種老司機的氣息撲面而來，\n\n\n\n  羞愧，\n\n\n\n  萬分羞愧，\n\n\n\n  有了上次的三過家門而不入之後，\n\n\n\n  周澤覺得眼前這個女孩經驗豐富到足以引領自己入門。\n\n\n\n  只是她的皮囊很好看，\n\n\n\n  但內在，\n\n\n\n  卻有些陰毒。\n\n\n\n  「當初你的老師，也是這樣被你逼死的麼？」周澤問道。\n\n\n\n  女孩愣了一下，微微皺眉，有些驚訝於周澤為什麼會知道這件事。\n\n\n\n  「他對你不錯，還經常接濟你，還請家裡不方便的你去他家吃飯，他沒碰過你，你卻誣陷說他侵犯了你。」\n\n\n\n  「我對不起他。」女孩聳聳肩，「他確實沒碰過我，但我真的沒想到他會傻到直接跳樓自殺。我當時只是想要學校賠一點錢而已。」\n\n\n\n  「你父母，也知道吧。」周澤問道。\n\n\n\n  「當然。」女孩微微一笑，站直了身子，看著周澤，「你怎麼知道這些的。」 \n\n\n\n  「你這樣做，是不對的。」周澤很認真地說道。\n\n\n\n  手微微抬起來，模仿起了書店裡看書的中年男子說話的架勢：\n\n\n\n  「他對得起自己的良心，也對得起自己的職業道德，而這些，都是他最看重的東西，你卻把它們都毀了。」\n\n\n\n  「你是來說教的？」女孩有些不能理解周遭的腦迴路。\n\n\n\n  自己衣服都脫了，就剩他親自解開自己最後的扣子了，結果眼前的這個男人，卻在這裡和自己上課。\n\n\n\n  她以前倒是遇到過一個客人，是一個好為人師的教授，出手也很大方，做事兒前還教育她應該好好學習，不應該做這個，女孩要自重，諄諄教導她。\n\n\n\n  然後那個教授一晚上要了自己七次。\n\n\n\n  這種人最虛偽了，明明打算解開皮帶了，卻依舊要跟你裝一下正人君子。\n\n\n\n  「你應該給你老師證名，他是被誣陷的。」周澤說道。\n\n\n\n  「憑什麼？」\n\n\n\n  女孩後退兩步，將衣服穿起來，她知道了，眼前的這個男人對自己並不感興趣。\n\n\n\n  「憑良心，做人的良心。」\n\n\n\n  「做人的良心？」女孩攤了攤手，故作調侃道：「我沒想當人啊，如果有的選，我想當鬼的。」 \n\n\n\n  「哦，是麼。」\n\n\n\n  周澤慢慢地站起來，\n\n\n\n  雙手負於身後，指甲已經完全長出來，\n\n\n\n  同時，周澤的眼眸里開始有黑色的光圈流淌，整個人的氣質也瞬間改變。\n\n\n\n  當初，性子大大咧咧的小姨子見到這樣子的自己，嚇得直接尿失禁。\n\n\n\n  而眼前的女孩也是臉色驟然一變，「噗通」一聲坐倒在了地上，手指著周澤，害怕得說不出話來。\n\n\n\n  「你……你是人是鬼……」\n\n\n\n  周澤從抽屜里取出了五千塊錢，還有小姨子的錢包，放入自己口袋裡。\n\n\n\n  至於裡面的其他東西，他沒興趣。\n\n\n\n  他只是回來取走自己被騙的錢，\n\n\n\n  合理合法。\n\n\n\n  其他的事兒，他不想去做。\n\n\n\n  離開時，周澤彎下腰，伸手提起女孩的下巴，很認真地對她道：\n\n\n\n  「我多麼希望你現在是一隻鬼，那樣的話，我會讓你連投胎的機會，都沒有。」\n\n\n\n  說完，周澤離開了這個烏煙瘴氣的家。\n\n\n\n  而女孩，則一直癱坐在那裡，身體不停打著擺子。\n\n\n\n  ………… \n\n\n\n  走到外面，白鶯鶯在那裡等著，她在嚼著口香糖，當周澤出來時，她主動剝開一片口香糖討好似地送入周澤嘴裡。\n\n\n\n  「老闆，錢拿回來了？」\n\n\n\n  周澤點點頭。\n\n\n\n  「那女的呢？」白鶯鶯不在乎錢，這點小錢，她隨便拿自己陪葬品賣一件都不止了，她只是關心那個女孩的下場。\n\n\n\n  當初自己的老闆可是把自己虐得很慘，所以她很期待自己老闆如何料理那女孩的。\n\n\n\n  「在家啊。」周澤開始準備打車。\n\n\n\n  「在家？死在家裡了？」白鶯鶯問道。\n\n\n\n  「我沒對她怎麼樣。」周澤回答道。\n\n\n\n  「為什麼啊！」白鶯鶯很不解，「那種女人，就該受到懲罰。」\n\n\n\n  「那也不是我應該做的事。」周澤很平和地說道。\n\n\n\n  「老闆，你好慫唉。」\n\n\n\n  「人家老師都對我說不關我的事了，我幹嘛要自找麻煩？」\n\n\n\n  說著，周澤伸手指了指四周的花圃草叢，繼續道：\n\n\n\n  「再說了，這裡面不知道藏了多少雙通紅的眼睛，等著我犯錯呢。」\n\n\n\n  蓉城的那位到底日後如何，周澤不清楚，也不確定，小蘿莉可能聯合了其他鬼差一起去圍剿他了，甚至連黃泉路邊的無面女也被放出來參與這次行動。 \n\n\n\n  當然，因為自己在夢中欠了對方一個人情的原因，周澤希望那位能夠安然度過這次事兒。\n\n\n\n  但是，讓自己去學他一樣直接做判官，他做不到。\n\n\n\n  前世他是一個醫生，只會救人，可不會殺人。\n\n\n\n  打車回到了店裡，一路上，白鶯鶯一句話都不說，顯然，她對周澤的消極應對很不滿意。\n\n\n\n  回到書店時，周澤看見那個中年男子仍然坐在那裡看書，他沒跑，哪怕周澤說要把他送入地獄，他也依舊沒跑。\n\n\n\n  「幫我倒杯水。」周澤對白鶯鶯道。\n\n\n\n  「我累了，去休息。」白鶯鶯哼了一聲，直接在櫃檯後面坐了下來。\n\n\n\n  周澤沒說什麼，在中年男子面前坐了下來。\n\n\n\n  「你家裡還有什麼人麼？」\n\n\n\n  中年男子聞言，抬起頭，「父母都已經過世，只有一個姐姐。」\n\n\n\n  「你姐姐聯繫方式告訴我，或者告訴我住址。」\n\n\n\n  周澤拿出了手機，點開了一個視頻，聲音從裡面傳出：\n\n\n\n  「又或者，我現在喊一嗓子，就說你非法入室打算強、、、、奸。然後，我父母會聽到我的聲音過來，鄰居們也會來，也會有人報警，你就會身敗名裂…………」\n\n\n\n  手機視頻里錄製了當時的情景。 \n\n\n\n  中年男子嘴唇微張，有些激動，也有些彷徨，然後戰戰兢兢道：\n\n\n\n  「這個公布出去，會毀了她的人生的。」\n\n\n\n  「那麼，誰來給你的人生負責？以及，被你牽連的學校和你的親戚婦人之仁？」周澤很不客氣道，「以及，對教師這個職業名譽負責。」\n\n\n\n  中年男子面露掙扎之色，然後點了點頭，「好吧，我把我姐姐地址告訴你。」\n\n\n\n  在中年男子說出了地址之後，他的身體開始慢慢的虛化，慢慢地像是融入了地下。\n\n\n\n  書看完了，\n\n\n\n  執念也了結了，\n\n\n\n  他不需要周澤強制送，自己就步入地獄去了。\n\n\n\n  真正的讀書人，走得灑脫。\n\n\n\n  周澤把視頻發給了白鶯鶯，白鶯鶯有些驚喜道：「老闆，只要他姐姐把這段視頻交給警方，他走在黃泉路上時應該就不用戴帽子了吧？」\n\n\n\n  「呵……」周澤笑了一聲，「帽子，摘不掉了。」\n\n\n\n  「怎麼會呢？這件事反轉了呀。」白鶯鶯有些不理解，「公道自在人心。」\n\n\n\n  「通常來說，在網上一名消防員戰士殉職的新聞點擊和討論量遠遠比不過一條寵物狗被虐殺的新聞。」\n\n\n\n  「這是什麼意思？」白鶯鶯顯然有些不了解，她剛接觸網絡才只會玩一些單機遊戲。 \n\n\n\n  「你知道，人們對一件事的關注度取決於什麼麼？」\n\n\n\n  「比如這件事麼？肯定是事情的真相啊。」\n\n\n\n  「不，人們只關心他們所看見的『真相』是否有趣。」\n\n\n\n  周澤伸手指了指頭頂，\n\n\n\n  「當初給他戴上那頂帽子的人，其中能有多少會看見闢謠反轉的消息尚且不得而知，哪怕其中有一小部分人看見了，你猜他們會有什麼反應？」\n\n\n\n  「羞愧，難受？」\n\n\n\n  「如果是面對面做錯了事被別人當面批評了，正常人都會愧疚和難受。」\n\n\n\n  「那不就對了麼？」\n\n\n\n  「但隔著一個屏幕的話，大部分人通常只會有一種反應。」\n\n\n\n  「什麼反應？」\n\n\n\n  「哦。」\n\n\n\n  「哦？」白鶯鶯不理解，追問道：「然後呢？」\n\n\n\n  「然後該幹嘛幹嘛。」",

    "content": "The sister-in-law's wallet was sent back by Zhou Ze via anonymous express.\n\nYes,\n\nthe shipping was cash on delivery.\n\nThe two thousand yuan that was originally inside had been swiped by Zhou Ze. Anyway, that girl had plenty of spending money, so he just considered it his hard-earned fee for helping her find her wallet. Zhou Ze felt his charge was very reasonable.\n\nThen, the next day, Zhou Ze saw his sister-in-law post on WeChat Moments:\n\n\"This thief has such professional ethics. They stole my wallet but mailed back all my cards and documents. This society still has many good people.\"\n\nZhou Ze read the post and was silent for a while.\n\nForget it, it's better for a silly girl to stay silly. Simpletons are blessed.\n\nBai Yingying secretly delivered the USB stick with the edited video (trimmed at both ends) to the middle-aged man's sister's house. Her sister reported it to the police station that same day. A few days later, the local police's official Weibo also published the news.\n\nThis incident caused quite a stir. Many people denounced the girl's shamelessness and heartlessness, but its popularity couldn't compare to when the incident first happened.\n\nMoreover, those who are scolding this girl now probably also called that teacher an \"animal in human clothes\" back then.\n\nIn short, days passed peacefully. Business was still slow. Bai Yingying became even more engrossed in the internet, making rapid progress, and also gradually became addicted to online games. She would sit there for a long time every day, just reading dungeon guides.\n\nShe was a complete internet addict.\n\nAt dusk, as usual, they ate at Xu Qinglang's place, accompanied by Xu Qinglang's newly developed strawberry juice.\n\nZhou Ze felt that he was slowly starting to taste the flavor in his meals.\n\nAfter dinner, Zhou Ze and Xu Qinglang, as usual, shared a cigarette.\n\nXu Qinglang was holding his phone, scrolling through Weibo, leisurely.\n\nZhou Ze noticed that Xu Qinglang's restaurant business had been getting quieter lately, and there were fewer and fewer delivery riders coming and going. Of course, this wasn't due to a business downturn or a decline in Xu Qinglang's restaurant's reputation; it was simply because the man in front of him was getting lazier and lazier.\n\nBut according to Xu Qinglang, the problem lay with Zhou Ze.\n\nHow could he possibly be balanced inside when he himself was toiling from dawn till dusk, while the neighbor just sat in the bookstore, not moving at all?\n\nPlease, he was a man with over twenty properties!\n\nWhy was he not living as comfortably as the pauper next door?\n\nSo, he should also live well, enjoy himself, and rest when he needed to.\n\nHe's fallen from grace, Zhou Ze sighed internally.\n\n\"Hey, there have been a lot of strange things happening in the East District lately,\" Xu Qinglang said, blowing out a smoke ring.\n\nThe East District was to the east of Tongcheng's urban area, slightly off-center. The Confucius Temple and City God Temple were located there, usually only lively during festivals, as many people went to offer incense.\n\n\"What's wrong?\" Zhou Ze asked, flicking his cigarette ash.\n\n\"Look at this one. Someone posted on Weibo saying that last night, while passing by the Confucius Temple, they saw a few cosplay enthusiasts dressed in ancient costumes. When they went to say hello, the people suddenly disappeared.\"\n\n\"There's another one here, saying that while taking a walk with their parents after dinner in the woods behind Confucius Temple Street, they saw someone composing poems there.\"\n\n\"And another one, posted by a driver, saying that when they drove past the Confucius Temple, they heard many people crying by the roadside.\"\n\nConfucius Temple?\n\nZhou Ze frowned slightly. This matter seemed to be somewhat related to him.\n\n\"However, these incidents have made the Confucius Temple popular again. It's said that more people have been going to offer incense lately, all saying it's become more 'efficacious',\" Xu Qinglang remarked with emotion.\n\n\"Heh heh,\" Zhou Ze pondered his own affairs.\n\n\"Logically, it shouldn't be. The Confucius Temple is where Confucian sages reside; it's impossible for any wandering spirits to cause mischief there,\" Xu Qinglang said.\n\n\"There probably were, but someone might have been managing them before,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"What about now? What happened to the one managing them?\"\n\n\"I killed him.\"\n\n\"............\" Xu Qinglang.\n\n——————\n\nLeft with no choice, Zhou Ze and Bai Yingying came to the Confucius Temple after nightfall.\n\nThe last time, Zhou Ze had utterly annihilated that dwarfish old man here, then simply brushed off his sleeves and left, leaving no trace.\n\nBut linking it with recent events, it was clear: without the dwarfish old man's control, those scholar-ghosts who previously served as an honor guard were slowly becoming restless, gradually letting themselves go.\n\nZhou Ze was a ghost messenger, so this matter naturally fell under his jurisdiction. Not to mention, he was the one who took out the dwarfish old man, so it was indeed up to him to clean up this mess.\n\n\"Boss, these lingering spirits can't really amount to much. They'll just vanish in a couple of months. Previously, they were only sustained by the Confucius Temple's system, and if they didn't cause trouble, the ghost messengers would just turn a blind eye and ignore them.\n\nNow that they've lost their restraints, once they've bounced around for a few days and vented their grievances, those who are destined to vanish will vanish, and those who are meant for hell will go to hell.\"\n\nBai Yingying, having been personally taught by Madam Bai, actually understood these matters of ghosts and gods more clearly than Zhou Ze.\n\n\"I can't rest easy without seeing the situation here. It's better to take care of them all if possible,\" Zhou Ze tilted his head slightly, searching for any lingering scholar-ghosts nearby.\n\nThose who failed to pass the imperial examinations, or who committed suicide due to setbacks in their studies throughout history, many of their souls, carrying immense resentment, came near the Confucius Temple. From then on, drawn by the spiritual energy, they became the \"honor guard\" of the Confucius Temple.\n\nOf course, there were certainly others mixed in who were just there to make up the numbers, not all of them were \"scholars,\" after all, a large forest attracts all kinds of birds.\n\nThose scholars mostly just composed poems and cried. Li Baojia of the Qing Dynasty once wrote in the sixth chapter of his \"A Brief History of Civilization\":\n\n\"Scholars rebelling, it won't succeed in three years. Whether they're involved or not, there's no need to pay them any mind.\"\n\nBut Zhou Ze was worried that if other entities also gained \"freedom\" there, they might cause trouble. If something really happened, and it was traced back, he would definitely be partly responsible.\n\nYet tonight was perfectly quiet. Zhou Ze had smoked half a pack of cigarettes, and Bai Yingying was simply lying on the grass with her eyes closed. Not a single ghost could be seen.\n\nGrowing somewhat impatient, Zhou Ze reached out and slapped Bai Yingying's ample, rounded behind, watching the ripples of flesh.\n\nHe said:\n\n\"Shout a few times and call those ghosts out.\"\n\nBai Yingying rolled her eyes at Zhou Ze, clearly ignoring the suggestion. Having spent more time together, Bai Yingying had also figured out some of Zhou Ze's personality traits and habits, and dared to put on a dignified air just enough so as not to displease Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Human life is like a dream; I will toast the moon over the river. Revisiting the old country, indeed, things are no longer the same.\"\n\nA man's voice came from behind the tree.\n\nImmediately after, a man wearing long boots and an official's robe walked out. The man had a long beard, symbolizing dignity, a square face, and a straight posture. He looked like an official.\n\nNo, he looked like someone who was an official in his previous life.\n\nAnd he still had a long queue braided at the back of his head.\n\nBai Yingying slowly stood up, looking at the man in front of her, and then exclaimed in surprise:\n\n\"Boss, I was wondering why we hadn't seen any of those scholar-ghosts tonight. So he swallowed them all!\"\n\nZhou Ze also saw it. The man appeared to have an extraordinary demeanor, but inside his stomach, many small points of light could be seen, which must have been the scholar-ghosts he had swallowed.\n\n\"Heh heh, a prime minister's stomach can hold a boat. I'm not a prime minister, but I was once an official of the nine chief ministers. This belly of mine has no problem holding these fallen scholars from past imperial examinations.\"\n\n\"Alright, it's you. Go down.\"\n\nZhou Ze prepared to open the Gates of Hell and drag this guy down.\n\nThe other party had indeed swallowed quite a few scholar-ghosts, and he seemed to be in good spirits, much better than the usual ghosts who frequented his bookstore.\n\nBut he was not formidable enough to make Zhou Ze wary.\n\nThey were all ghosts; having a physical body or not was truly two different matters.\n\nAnd he still had his fingernails.\n\n\"Are you the local ghost messenger?\" the man looked at Zhou Ze and said with reserve, \"You do have the qualification to sit as an equal with this official.\"\n\n\"Oh, quite the big talk. Did the Great Qing Dynasty fall?\"\n\nBai Yingying scoffed.\n\n\"When men are speaking, is there a place for you women to interrupt? Retreat, this official commands you.\" The man reprimanded with considerable authority.\n\nBai Yingying cracked her knuckles, making a crisp sound.\n\nThe man looked at Zhou Ze, who was preparing to open the Gates of Hell on the other side, and said:\n\n\"Esteemed constable, this official held a scholarly degree and once held significant influence. Even if I am to be sent down, it shouldn't be done so casually, should it?\n\nMoreover, this official encountered a judge of the Underworld in the human realm during my lifetime. That judge said this official would die on the nineteenth day of the third month of the Jiashen year.\n\nThis official was trembling with fear, anxious day and night, finally enduring to that very day. But after that day, this official did not die.\n\nThis is proof enough that this official is blessed with great fortune; even the rules of the Underworld are ineffective against this official. Therefore, this official advises you not to waste your efforts in vain.\n\nWhen this official's tour of the old country is complete, if I wish to go down, this official will naturally descend. Perhaps after this official goes down, I might even secure a position as a supervisor in the Underworld. In the future, if we meet, you will still have to kneel and respectfully address me as 'Lord'.\"\n\n\"You, you really are asking for a beating,\" Bai Yingying said with a laugh.\n\n\"No, that just shows that his hometown's customs are simple. Otherwise, he would have been beaten to death before he even grew up.\"\n\n\"Preposterous! Hmph, this official is too lazy to engage in such verbal sparring with the likes of you. This official speaks no falsehoods. If you intend to forcibly escort this official to hell, then be prepared to incur this grudge.\n\nEven a judge of the Underworld couldn't accurately determine this official's death date, let alone a mere ghost messenger like you?\"\n\nZhou Ze wasn't in a hurry to open the Gates of Hell anymore. He just found the person in front of him quite interesting, and honestly, modern ghosts weren't that rare, but ancient ghosts,\n\nThey were truly uncommon.\n\nPeople often say precious cultural relics are records of history; the one before him was truly a historical repeater.\n\n\"You have a queue at the back of your head, but you're not wearing a Qing Dynasty official's uniform,\" Zhou Ze observed for a moment, then continued, \"It should be a Ming Dynasty official's uniform.\n\nNo, wait, you just said you were once a Nine Chief Minister, but this Ming Dynasty official's uniform isn't one of a Nine Chief Minister; rather, it's the attire of a low-ranking official.\"\n\nUpon hearing this, the man said proudly, \"This official served in two dynasties, a censor in the former dynasty, and a Nine Chief Minister in the latter. I brought great benefit to the common people, and my reputation as an official was outstanding.\n\nAs for what clothes this official wears, what right do you have to comment?\"\n\nZhou Ze took out his phone, typed \"nineteenth day of the third month of Jiashen year,\" looked it up, and then smiled:\n\n\"That judge was not wrong; you really should have died on the nineteenth day of the third month of the Jiashen year.\"\n\n\"Nonsense! This official did not die on that day. This official ultimately died of old age and enjoyed a beautiful posthumous title!\" the man said with disdain.\n\n\"You were supposed to die that day, really,\" Zhou Ze repeated, then a mocking smile appeared on his face, \"But you shamelessly refused to die.\"\n\n\"Arrogant words!\" The man flicked his sleeve. \"Ignorant!\"\n\n\"Think again about what day the nineteenth of the third month of the Jiashen year was! Should you have died or not!\"\n\nZhou Ze emphasized his tone, reprimanding him.\n\nThe man frowned slightly, seemingly pondering and recalling.\n\nFinally,\n\nSuddenly,\n\nHis body trembled, revealing a look of shock.\n\nThen he glanced back at the Confucius Temple.\n\nAt that moment,\n\nHe finally understood why, after his death, when his soul returned home, he had been imprisoned within this Confucius Temple, and had spent several centuries in a daze with those he called failed imperial examination candidates!\n\n\"This... this... this...\"\n\nThe man slumped to the ground, utterly disheartened.\n\nThe nineteenth day of the third month of the Jiashen year,\n\nThis was precisely the day the Ming Dynasty fell, when Emperor Chongzhen hanged himself on Coal Hill, and Ming officials followed their emperor to their deaths.",

    "content": "The man remained silent, somewhat lost in thought at that moment.\n\nZhou Ze had initially expected him to turn into a malevolent spirit, just like the victims' souls who had been burned to death by the delivery man in his bookstore.\n\nThe existence of ghosts—once they transform into malevolent spirits, their obsession solidifies completely, severing all paths of reincarnation. Their only fate is to dissipate into thin air.\n\nIt's somewhat like a person taking a hundred times the overdose of a stimulant; they'd certainly be high as a kite, but after the high, all that's left is a corpse.\n\nHowever, the person before him seemed unusually calm.\n\nVery lost, very bewildered, very helpless, and very conflicted.\n\nHe turned back to look at the Confucian Temple behind him and sighed, \"So, to the sages, am I, who grew up reading their books, no different from those destitute scholars who failed the imperial examinations?\"\n\nHe had once thought himself unique, believed he was blessed by fortune, that even the Ghost Judge couldn't determine his fate. Who knew, in the end, it was merely his own self-importance.\n\nIn fact, he should have realized it long ago; otherwise, he wouldn't have been imprisoned here for hundreds of years, constantly in a stupor, unable even to possess self-awareness, only able to follow successive generations of night watchmen circling the Confucian Temple.\n\nThe man looked at Zhou Ze: \"Do you think I deserve to die?\"\n\nZhou Ze did not answer.\n\n\"I had a close friend, surnamed Liu. After learning that the former emperor had hanged himself on Coal Hill, he led his entire family, old and young, to commit suicide in their residence, following the emperor.\"\n\nThe man spoke softly,\n\n\"The day before it happened, his thirteen-year-old granddaughter secretly ran to my mansion, hoping to seek my protection. Her mother was a concubine and wanted to find a chance for her to live.\n\nThen my old friend personally came to my door and took his granddaughter away.\n\nFinally, over twenty members of the Liu family, young and old, committed suicide for the nation. That little granddaughter was killed by a precious sword; she didn't want to die, but she died nonetheless.\"\n\nThe man smiled, \"Do you think that was right?\"\n\nThis time, Zhou Ze didn't remain silent but said, \"She shouldn't have died.\"\n\n\"Yes, she shouldn't have died, which is why I believe that whether to live or die, everyone has their own considerations. I knew my family didn't want to die, and my children didn't want to die, so I had to grit my teeth and live, to survive.\n\nI wasn't just living for myself; I had to live for their entire family.\n\nFurthermore, during my tenure in the succeeding dynasty, I saved countless lives and reduced much bloodshed.\n\nIt's like Li Shimin knew after the Xuanwu Gate Incident that he would undoubtedly leave an indelible stain on history, so he painstakingly strove to be a wise and good emperor.\n\nI was in the same state of mind then.\n\nI always felt that by doing more good deeds, by saving more lives, even if I couldn't sacrifice myself for the nation, at least I would keep my useful body to do things beneficial for the country and its people, which could be considered as making up for my mistakes in another way.\"\n\nThe man said a lot; clearly, he was unconvinced.\n\nAncient scholars referred to themselves as disciples of the sages because they read the sages' books and learned their principles. But now, it was evident that the sages in the Confucian Temple had deemed him an unfilial disciple.\n\nHe was originally a member of a ducal clan of the Nine Ministers, yet his treatment after death was the same as those who had failed the imperial examinations and committed suicide in the Confucian Temple.\n\nThis already showed the attitude of the sages.\n\nZhou Ze slowly squatted down, looking at the man before him. After a moment's thought, he said, \"What you just said sounds a bit familiar to me. Less than a hundred years ago, someone said something similar to your argument.\n\nHis name was Wang Jixin.\n\nDuring a time of national crisis, he became a traitor, acting as a tiger's accomplice, under the beautiful name of 'saving the nation through a circuitous path.'\"\n\nThe man opened his mouth slightly, wanting to say something, but didn't know where to begin.\n\n\"You went from being a censor in the previous dynasty to a Nine Minister in the succeeding dynasty; there's no need to make excuses for yourself anymore.\n\nThe most fundamental reason is actually very simple:\n\n'The water is too cold.' \"¹\n\nUpon hearing this, the man's face showed a mix of shame and anger, and he glared furiously at Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze spread his hand, his fingernails grew, and then he drew out the symbol in his right palm, drawing a circle, and the gate of hell opened.\n\n\"Please, what you want is nothing more than dignity, isn't it? Walk in yourself.\n\nIf I were to seize you myself, you would lose even that last bit of dignity.\"\n\nThe man stood up and walked forward step by step. Before stepping into the gate, he cast a final meaningful look at Zhou Ze:\n\n\"Do you think the water is cold?\"\n\n\"A clear conscience is enough.\"\n\nThe man appeared thoughtful, then shook his head, unsure whether he had finally understood or not, but ultimately took that step and entered the gate.\n\nZhou Ze waved his hand, the gate dissipated, and everything here concluded.\n\nIt seemed he also had to thank that official, who had swallowed all the scholarly ghosts nearby, saving Zhou Ze a lot of trouble.\n\n\"Boss, is that it?\" The female corpse said with disappointment, \"I thought you'd give him a beating.\"\n\n\"Beating him or not, it's meaningless.\" Zhou Ze gave a deep look at the Confucian Temple not far ahead and said, \"Besides, the sages in the Confucian Temple have already held him here for hundreds of years; he's been punished enough.\"\n\nBai Yingying pouted, \"It seems these clay figures in the Confucian Temple are somewhat useful; they're not all blind.\"\n\n\"Yes, they held that former imperial censor's soul here because they felt this censor wasn't their disciple, that he did something shameless, disgraced them, and needed to be punished.\n\nThey punished him,\n\nThen, the dynasty changed; the Ming dynasty became the Qing dynasty. Many things changed, but the Confucian Temple remained the Confucian Temple. These sage clay figures still enjoyed the incense offerings of the new dynasty.\"\n\n\"............\" Bai Yingying.\n\n\"Boss, your words are becoming more philosophical now. Are those clay figures in the temple good or bad?\"\n\nBai Yingying still remembered when she last helped someone get the first incense stick into the Confucian Temple, and she felt an uncomfortable sensation of being \"watched.\"\n\n\"They're just... things.\"\n\nAfter taking a taxi, it was already ten o'clock at night when they returned to the bookstore, but usually, this was Zhou Ze's real business hour.\n\nProbably because there were fewer ghosts during the day, and ghosts were more active at night.\n\nIn recent days, he had earned some hell money, but after giving out that video last time, Zhou Ze had burned a lot of hell money to avoid trouble.\n\nThat video, of course, couldn't be used as direct evidence, but as long as the relevant parties knew the truth of the matter and put in some effort to investigate thoroughly, the truth wouldn't be difficult to uncover.\n\nThat video was merely an opening; it couldn't be used as real evidence.\n\nZhou Ze didn't read but listened to music with headphones, casually flipping through some news. Bai Yingying sat behind Zhou Ze, playing games on her phone.\n\nMaster and servant, each enjoying their own pleasure. In the eyes of the man next door, who was even more beautiful than a woman, this was a sign of depravity!\n\nThe bookstore door was pushed open late at night, and a girl walked in, leading a Corgi dog.\n\nA familiar girl, a familiar Corgi.\n\nZhou Ze stood up and poured her a glass of water. As his first VIP customer, she naturally deserved such service.\n\nZhou Ze also leaned in to take a look.\n\nThe person was alive,\n\nThe dog was also alive.\n\nIt was genuinely late at night, and the probability of a living person entering his bookstore was quite low.\n\n\"Boss, my dog was found!\"\n\n\"Congratulations,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nThe Corgi excitedly circled Zhou Ze twice, then joyfully ran to Bai Yingying.\n\nBai Yingying was playing \"Honor of Kings\" when she was suddenly startled by the dog. She immediately glared, and the Corgi froze in fear.\n\nAs the saying goes, dogs look down on people, but in reality, dogs can see things that humans cannot.\n\nImmediately, the dog slumped to the ground, its urine and feces coming out all at once.\n\n\"I'm so sorry, boss, I'm really sorry,\" the girl immediately stood up, ready to clean.\n\n\"It's fine.\" Zhou Ze gestured for the girl to calm down, then told Bai Yingying, \"Clean it up.\"\n\nBai Yingying put down her phone and went to the bathroom with a mournful expression to get a mop and rag.\n\n\"Boss, your bookstore's business has always been poor, hasn't it?\" The girl pulled her dog back to her feet, not letting it run around.\n\nOf course, the dog didn't dare to run around now, not even daring to breathe loudly.\n\n\"Just getting by,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Thanks to you telling me where my dog was last time, I was able to find the person who took it and pay to get it back.\"\n\n\"How much did it cost?\"\n\n\"Over ten thousand yuan, I guess. The person wouldn't return it, saying she raised it, but after we agreed on a price, she still gave the dog back to me.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"Boss, I think you could add more things to this bookstore. For example, these chairs are really uncomfortable; you could change them to sofas.\"\n\nIf I had money, I'd want to change them too.\n\n\"How about I invest? You can spruce things up here,\" the girl said to Zhou Ze, stroking her dog's head.\n\nZhou Ze understood that she merely wanted to repay him, so she wouldn't mind losing money. But Zhou Ze couldn't agree.\n\nHe couldn't very well ask her, \"Do you mind receiving dividends in hell money?\"\n\n\"Hell money that accumulates Yin virtue when burned, you know?\"\n\nWhen that Taoist priest said that to him, Zhou Ze considered the other party a fool.\n\nHmm,\n\nSo Zhou Ze didn't want the girl in front of him to also think he was a fool.\n\nJust then, a \"loud laugh\" came from the noodle shop next door. Immediately after, Xu Qinglang, dressed in pajamas and striking a seductive pose, ran out to the bookstore next door and shouted to Zhou Ze and Bai Yingying, who was cleaning dog feces:\n\n\"I won! The lottery! One hundred thousand!\"\n\nXu Qinglang was very happy. When people are happy, they always want to share. The only place he could find living people nearby was the bookstore next door.\n\nHowever, it seemed the two people in the bookstore next door weren't living people either...\n\n\"Congratulations, congratulations,\" Zhou Ze offered.\n\n\"Tsk tsk, buy me a bag, Boss Xu,\" Bai Yingying took the opportunity to ask for some lucky money.\n\n\"Small potatoes, small potatoes,\" Xu Qinglang began to act reserved, then, seeing a young and pretty girl next to them, he became even more reserved:\n\n\"It's just one hundred thousand yuan. After tax, it's only eighty thousand. It's just a bit of prize money. For someone like me who has over twenty resettlement apartments in Shiqiao District, it's just a drop in the bucket, with no real impact on my life.\"\n\n\"Shiqiao District?\" the girl asked.\n\n\"That's right,\" Xu Qinglang replied.\n\nShiqiao District was close to the city center, and house prices there were higher than in other places, so naturally, one could be more ostentatious—oh no, one could be more reserved.\n\n\"Oh, that should be my family's residential compound.\"\n\n\"Your family lives there too?\" Xu Qinglang smiled even more brightly, \"Next time, maybe we can get coffee together?\"\n\n\"My family doesn't live there.\"\n\n\"Then what do you mean?\"\n\n\"I mean, the company that demolished your homes and compensated you with resettlement apartments should be my family's company.\"\n\n\"............\" Xu Qinglang.\n\n***\n¹ \"The water is too cold\" (水太凉, *shuǐ tài liáng*) is a historical anecdote and idiom related to the late Ming dynasty. When Emperor Chongzhen committed suicide, many Ming officials chose to surrender to the incoming Qing dynasty instead of dying for their emperor. The phrase reportedly comes from one official who, when pressured to drown himself in a lake to show loyalty, claimed \"the water is too cold\" as an excuse, implying he valued his life over imperial loyalty. It's used to mock those who make excuses for not sacrificing themselves or not upholding their principles.",

    "content": "This was perhaps Xu Qinglang's deepest wound;\n\nMen like to show off in front of the opposite sex, boast, and strut around, just like a gorilla beating its chest and constantly grunting, \"Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh!\" when seeking a mate.\n\nIn Zhou Ze's opinion, this was the first time the fawning Xu Qinglang seemed to be releasing that kind of mating signal.\n\nUnfortunately, the girl's words: \"Your house is a resettlement property provided by my family's company.\"\n\n\"Crack!\"\n\nIt was as if something shattered.\n\nXu Qinglang wanted to clutch his chest and kneel down.\n\nPain,\n\nSo much pain,\n\nHeart-wrenching pain.\n\nThe girl slowly stood up and said to Zhou Ze, \"Boss, let's add each other on WeChat. If we plan to cooperate in the future, you can contact me.\"\n\n\"Okay.\" Zhou Ze naturally wouldn't refuse.\n\nAfter adding each other on WeChat, the girl led her Corgi dog away.\n\nXu Qinglang let out a long breath, waved his hand, slowly turned, and left the bookstore.\n\nHe needed some time to recover from his injuries.\n\nZhou Ze's lips curved into a smile. It seemed that for at least the next while, the phrase \"dozens of houses\" wouldn't be leaving Xu Qinglang's mouth.\n\nTurning around, Zhou Ze saw Bai Yingying sitting on a plastic stool, lost in thought. No, not lost in thought; more precisely, she was reading a copy of *Those Matters of the Ming Dynasty*.\n\n\"Boss, what did you mean by 'the water is too cold' when you were talking to that ghost?\"\n\nA large part of the female corpse's memories were inherited from Madame Bai. In that era, the types of books women read were few, and they naturally couldn't be as \"learned\" as men who studied for official examinations.\n\nAs for the collection of talented women in *Dream of the Red Chamber*, that could probably only appear in books.\n\n\"He was a literary leader in the late Ming Dynasty and seemed to have served as the Minister of Rites. When the Qing army entered the passes and the Ming Dynasty was about to fall, he prepared to die for his country. His beloved concubine, Liu Rushi, was ready to accompany him, but when his concubine jumped, he never dared to jump, saying, 'The water is too cold.' He eventually surrendered to the Manchus.\"\n\n\"Then that person truly isn't a good person, is he, Boss? Were you using that to mock that ghost?\" Bai Yingying asked.\n\n\"In fact, although Qian Qianyi eventually surrendered to the Qing, he secretly funded anti-Qing forces and even provided information to the anti-Qing army, for which he was once prosecuted by the Qing court.\"\n\n\"This...\" Bai Yingying didn't know how to evaluate this person.\n\nShe was very simple, just like old people and children watching TV who like to ask directly: \"Is this person good, or is this person bad?\"\n\nFor many people, the world is either black or white. As for the gray area, it's too complicated, too difficult to understand, so they simply pretend not to see it.\n\n\"The one I just threw into hell is essentially similar to Qian Qianyi.\" Zhou Ze smiled, picked up his teacup, and sat down on the chair behind the counter.\n\n\"Then why did you send him to hell?\" Bai Yingying asked, somewhat confused. \"At least, you could have turned a blind eye and let him stay in the human world for a bit longer, right?\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. \"Are you starting to pity him?\"\n\n\"The water is too cold, it's human nature.\" Bai Yingying pouted. \"I'm dead now, a zombie, but if I were still alive, I think it should be my own choice not to be buried with the emperor and the court.\n\nDying, of course, can be praised, but not dying can also be understood.\"\n\n\"The Ghost Judge said he should have died on that day, which is actually correct.\" Zhou Ze put his water cup down. \"I originally died and then came back to life through a corpse. I myself am trying my best to cling to life. I shouldn't have the right to ask others if they should die.\n\nDon't you think so too?\"\n\nBai Yingying nodded.\n\n\"Everything needs to be considered within a specific context. To understand ancient people and their ways of behaving, one must immerse oneself in that era, in the culture, customs, and other backgrounds of that time.\n\nFrom a modern perspective, of course, ethnic harmony means all Chinese people are one family.\n\nBut in the late Ming Dynasty, everyone should have had their own stance.\n\nYour thoughts are like an old farmer in ancient times thinking the emperor ate ten fried dough sticks and ten large meat buns for breakfast every day. It's wrong and inappropriate for us, with our commoner's mindset, to project onto those great figures in history.\n\nYes, Qian Qianyi did many things to help the anti-Qing army after surrendering to the Qing, and even mocked the Qing Dynasty in the documents he compiled, but that was not enough for him.\"\n\n\"Not enough? Does he really have to die?\" Bai Yingying asked, puzzled.\n\n\"He must die.\" Zhou Ze answered very seriously. \"Including the ghost I just threw down, he must also die!\"\n\nAfter speaking, Zhou Ze took a deep breath,\n\n\"He doesn't have to die. He could leave freely, become a wealthy old man, completely disappear from the world, abandon wealth and glory, and remain utterly unknown. That's also an option.\"\n\n\"Why?\" Bai Yingying clearly disagreed. \"Everyone's life should be in their own hands.\"\n\n\"When Dodo's army entered Nanjing, Qian Qianyi was the highest-ranking official in Nanjing. He led everyone to kneel and welcome the Qing army into the city, surrendering to the Manchus.\n\nHe could not surrender, nor was he qualified to surrender.\n\nHis prestige, his identity, his power, his status, his enjoyment, his preferential treatment, all were given to him by the imperial court, which can also be understood as given by the country.\n\nThe more benefits you receive, the more responsibility you are naturally obligated to bear.\n\nYou received so much from the country, rising to the highest ranks of officialdom. Even when your waist was almost too weak to move, you still pursued Liu Rushi, living a carefree life like 'a pear blossom pressing down on a crabapple tree'.\n\nThen, when the country needed him, he naturally had the duty to fulfill his responsibilities.\n\nThis is a kind of contractual spirit.\n\nWhen the nation is in trouble, every commoner has a responsibility. In fact, if ordinary people just looked up,\n\nAt the sky,\n\nNo one would criticize them.\n\nBut those ancient officials who received salaries and enjoyed the people's hard-earned money, they themselves had a duty, when the nation's ship was about to sink, to do everything possible to prop it up, or even, to be buried with the ship.\n\nIt's hard to be a hero, but easy to be a villain. We should applaud heroes even more, not seek excuses by identifying with villains.\n\nIt's not that 'since I can't be a hero, it's understandable to be a villain.' That's never the case.\"\n\nBai Yingying listened, nodding in a half-understanding way.\n\n\"Take the one at the Confucius Temple, for example. In the Ming Dynasty, he was an Censor, similar to a prosecutor today, but not yet a chief prosecutor. But later, he became one of the Nine Ministers, similar to a minister today.\n\nAfter surrendering, he still did so well, rising steadily. You tell me, should he have died?\n\nThere was a high official in the Ming Dynasty who once declared, 'The nation has nourished scholars for a hundred and fifty years; to die for righteousness is today.' He was speaking of this very principle.\"\n\n\"My head is spinning.\" Bai Yingying shook her head.\n\n\"This is a bookstore. Although there are more novels, you can also read other books.\" Zhou Ze stretched his neck. \"Anyway, you don't have anything else to do.\"\n\nBai Yingying glanced at Zhou Ze, implying that he didn't seem to have anything to do either.\n\nZhou Ze stood up, went to the restroom to wash his face, and when he came out, he saw Bai Yingying refilling his teacup. Bai Yingying then asked:\n\n\"Oh, by the way, Boss, what happened to that high official who declared, 'The nation has nourished scholars for a hundred and fifty years'?\"\n\n\"Oh, the emperor sent the Brocade-Clad Guard to beat him severely with sticks in front of the Left Shun Gate.\"\n\nZhou Ze sniffed,\n\n\"And then there was no 'then'.\"\n\n\"...\" Bai Yingying.\n\nThe master and servant, for once, were in a literary mood, discussing history and worldviews;\n\nOf course, this good atmosphere didn't last long, because the female corpse immediately put down her book and picked up her phone to play *King of Glory*.\n\nHowever, a new customer arrived at the shop. He was a middle-aged man, about forty years old, wearing a black down jacket. His face was a bit rough, and his clothes were somewhat worn, making him appear a bit simple and honest.\n\n\"Boss, can I put up a notice here?\" the man humbly asked Zhou Ze.\n\n\"What notice?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"A missing person notice,\" the man honestly replied.\n\n\"Go ahead and post it.\" Zhou Ze stood up and walked to the entrance of the shop, watching the man post the notice on the wall.\n\n\"No photo?\" Zhou Ze noticed that the notice only had text and no photo.\n\n\"She was still small when she was taken, only a few months old, so there's no photo.\" The man rubbed his hands and offered Zhou Ze a cigarette. \"Don't mind it.\"\n\nZhou Ze took the cigarette and asked, \"Was she abducted?\"\n\n\"No, she was given up for adoption. She already had an older sister back then, and at that time, there was no second-child policy. I couldn't afford the fine and was afraid of losing my job, so I had to give her up for adoption.\n\nThese years, we've thought about her day and night, hoping to see her again. But we haven't had much contact over the years. After all, she was adopted by another family. As long as they treated her well, we didn't want to bother her; it wouldn't be good for her.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Zhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"This time, her younger brother is unlucky. He got leukemia. I only know that the family who adopted her a dozen years ago lived somewhere near here, so I can only look for her here.\n\nHer eldest sister wasn't a match, so now her brother's life depends on her to save him. And it would be a chance for our family to reunite.\"\n\n\"Brother?\" Zhou Ze frowned and asked, \"How old is she this year?\"\n\n\"Seventeen.\"\n\n\"How old is her brother?\"\n\n\"Sixteen.\"\n\n\"Pitiable,\" Zhou Ze sighed.\n\n\"Yes, how could such a young child get this disease? Boss, please keep an eye out for me. I'm going to continue posting further down. I've already contacted the media, and there might be an interview tomorrow.\n\nI estimate we'll find her soon, and then our family can be reunited, and her brother can be saved.\"\n\nThe middle-aged man smiled very simply and honestly,\n\nThen walked towards the front.\n\nAfter he had walked far away and his figure disappeared into the night,\n\nZhou Ze looked at the missing person notice on the wall by the shop entrance and said softly,\n\n\"Pitiable.\"\n\nThen,\n\nZhou Ze reached out,\n\nAnd tore down the notice that had just been put up.",

    "content": "The second daughter is seventeen this year, and the youngest son is sixteen.\n\nIn other words, after that simple and honest middle-aged man sent his second daughter away, he immediately, with feelings of intense guilt, longing, and grief, had another child with his wife.\n\nSo, all that talk about violating the one-child policy, fines, and so on, was fake.\n\nHe just wanted a son. The first child was a daughter, and the second was also a daughter, so he simply gave her away, then immediately rushed to conceive new life.\n\nEven when she was given away, he didn't even know her address or have any contact information, clearly indicating he wouldn't bother with her later.\n\nLuckily, the next child was a son, otherwise he would have given away a third daughter, a fourth daughter...\n\nNow, because his son has leukemia and needs a match, and their eldest daughter failed to match, they finally thought:\n\nOh, we seem to have a girl we gave away.\n\nThen, to save their son, they started looking.\n\nThey mobilized the media and posted missing person flyers.\n\nTo move others, you must first move yourself; humans are such emotional and complex beings.\n\nIn the more than ten years since their daughter was given away, they might have felt some guilt, but they didn't regret it. If they regretted it, they would have started searching long ago, and it would have been easier to find her in the first few years after she was given away than after more than a decade has passed.\n\nIf you make a mistake that causes you pain, you will constantly self-hypnotize in the following days to alleviate or even erase that pain.\n\nThat middle-aged man was very successful. He fabricated many reasons, and after telling the lie a hundred times, he even believed it himself.\n\nHe thought he still loved and missed his second daughter. He thought he had given her away out of helplessness, out of necessity, a heaven-moving, unavoidable act, much like the story of \"Orphan of Zhao\".\n\nThey wouldn't consider that the daughter they gave away is now seventeen;\n\nShe should be in high school, have her own social circle, and live a life no different from her peers;\n\nPerhaps her adoptive parents never even told her she was adopted, and she believes her adoptive parents are her biological parents.\n\nHer life should be very peaceful,\n\nBut soon, a bolt from the blue will strike her!\n\nMy child, let me tell you some happy news: your biological parents have been found!\n\nMy child, let me tell you some exciting news: your previous parents were not your biological mom and dad!\n\nMy child, let me tell you some joyful news: you have an older sister and a younger brother!\n\nMy child, let me tell you something great: you can save your sick younger brother!\n\nIsn't it unexpected?\n\nIsn't it a surprise?\n\nIsn't it touching?\n\n\"Boss, what's wrong with you?\" Bai Yingying asked, seeing Zhou Ze standing at the door in a daze.\n\n\"There's one thing that always makes my hair stand on end whenever I think about it,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Is it that exaggerated, Boss? You've even been to hell. What could scare you like this?\" Bai Yingying looked at Zhou Ze curiously.\n\n\"It's that to do many jobs, to work in many industries, to apply for many positions, you need to be certified, you need to pass tests, just like getting a driver's license. You have to be confirmed that your skills are up to par, that you're familiar with traffic laws, and they even make you drive on the road to see if you can withstand the test.\n\nOtherwise, allowing someone with unqualified driving skills and mindset to get a driver's license is actually irresponsible to other pedestrians and car owners on the road.\"\n\n\"And then?\" Bai Yingying pressed.\n\n\"But to be a parent, you don't need a license.\"\n\n...\n\nThe night passed without a word. When Zhou Ze woke up the next morning, he habitually went to the shop next door for breakfast, but its door was closed.\n\nThis made Zhou Ze a little worried that Xu Qinglang might have been too devastated last night and just given up entirely.\n\nZhou Ze didn't care if he gave up, but he couldn't do without his juices.\n\nHe called, and Xu Qinglang answered quickly. It turned out he had gone to claim his lottery winnings and said he'd buy everyone a gift as a token of appreciation later.\n\nThere was nothing Zhou Ze could do but order takeout. He wolfed it down with the plum juice he still had at home and finished.\n\nThe shop door was still closed. Although not locked, it clearly showed an attitude of not bothering to do business, something Zhou Ze had long since come to terms with.\n\nHowever, when he sat back down at the counter and opened the drawer, Zhou Ze unexpectedly found a thick stack of冥钞 in it.\n\nAt first, Zhou Ze thought Bai Yingying had purposely bought some冥钞 to surprise him, but then he thought Bai Yingying wouldn't be that childish.\n\nHe flicked the冥钞 in his hand; it was real.\n\nIsn't it ridiculous...\n\nNow, with the convenience of mobile payments, the situation where people in shops or wet markets would hold large banknotes up to the sun to check for authenticity has become increasingly rare.\n\nBut these were real bills.\n\nZhou Ze thought for a while. It must be the commission he received yesterday for escorting that Imperial Censor. That official would later reach the rank of one of the Nine Ministers in the Qing Dynasty, with a vast family fortune. Naturally, the offerings from his descendants and filial piety would be considerable.\n\nZhou Ze estimated that if these冥钞 were burned, someone would probably drop several wallets at his door, at least five thousand yuan's worth.\n\nThis wave seemed profitable. He earned over five thousand in the middle of the night, and the only cost was less than a hundred yuan in taxi fares for the round trip.\n\nZhou Ze wasn't in a hurry to burn the paper money now. These冥钞 would be useful at critical moments, able to ward off minor misfortunes and avoid trouble or interference in certain matters. Sometimes, they were more effective than several thousand Renminbi.\n\n\"Xu Le!\"\n\nThe voice called out before the person even entered the shop.\n\nZhou Ze looked up and saw his sister-in-law walk in.\n\n\"Here, for you.\"\n\nHis sister-in-law was carrying a shoulder bag today. She took out a wad of money and placed it on Zhou Ze's counter.\n\n\"Your money back.\"\n\nZhou Ze smiled, \"You could have just transferred it by phone.\"\n\n\"Nah, it feels better to hand over a stack of cash directly,\" his sister-in-law pouted.\n\nAfter the last incident, his sister-in-law's opinion of Zhou Ze had improved a little. Of course, it was also because the old Xu Le was too cowardly to even control his own wife, so his sister-in-law naturally looked down on him even more.\n\nBut now, Zhou Ze was somewhat unyielding with her, adopting the air of an elder, and she, in turn, began to take him seriously.\n\n\"Xu Le, your business is really bad,\" his sister-in-law said, hands in her pockets.\n\n\"No classes today?\"\n\n\"It's the weekend,\" his sister-in-law pouted discontentedly. \"But I'm going to a bar later. I told my sister I was coming here to read and do homework, so don't you dare spill the beans.\"\n\nYour sister hasn't contacted me in half a month.\n\nZhou Ze felt a little melancholic. He had originally thought that Dr. Lin actively embracing him after that confession was a good start, but perhaps that was just Dr. Lin's courage at the moment.\n\nOnce a person calms down, their thoughts slowly become more complicated. Dr. Lin might not have found her way out of that strange dilemma and knot.\n\nHer legal husband, whom she didn't like, died.\n\nThen the person she liked reincarnated into her legal husband's body.\n\nIt seemed like a happy ending,\n\nBut there was an insurmountable moral chasm.\n\nFortunately, after the incident with the faceless woman, Zhou Ze was no longer in a hurry regarding this matter.\n\nAt least the thought \"she's not sleeping with me\" hadn't crossed his mind for a long time.\n\nPerhaps it was also because Bai Yingying had been accompanying him to sleep every night recently.\n\nEven though Bai Yingying could only be looked at and not used,\n\nJust being able to look was good.\n\n\"Those places like bars, go less,\" Zhou Ze reminded. \"It's not too late to relax and do what you like after you get into college.\"\n\n\"Alright, you're just like my parents and my sister. You say you're a college student, how did you end up like this?\"\n\nHis sister-in-law's way of speaking,\n\nTo describe it positively, was straightforward;\n\nTo describe it negatively, was thoughtless.\n\nZhou Ze believed that this cowardly Xu Le's decision to hire someone to buy his own life was definitely assisted by his sister-in-law constantly \"filling up his rage bar\" on the side.\n\nIt seemed his sister-in-law didn't know about the female classmate's incident, possibly due to considerations for protecting minors.\n\n\"I'm back!\"\n\nXu Qinglang returned, carrying a pile of things.\n\n\"I'm exhausted. It's really weird today, couldn't get a taxi. I don't know if I'm just unlucky today or if all the taxi drivers went to a conference.\"\n\nXu Qinglang put the things down, then wiped his sweat.\n\nBai Yingying walked over at this moment, her eyes lighting up when she saw the things on the ground.\n\nThese were computer parts.\n\n\"Install it in my shop. You can play whenever you want,\" Xu Qinglang said to Bai Yingying.\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\nThen, Xu Qinglang handed Bai Yingying a bag and tossed Zhou Ze an exquisite lighter.\n\n\"Here, fair share!\"\n\n\"What's this?\"\n\nHis sister-in-law wasn't interested in these gifts. What interested her was the plastic fan still tucked behind Xu Qinglang's neck.\n\nWinter wasn't over yet, carrying a fan was interesting.\n\n\"A group of people were doing an event at the mall and forced it on me,\" Xu Qinglang replied.\n\nHis sister-in-law took the fan. It was a very ordinary plastic fan with \"GG\" printed on it. After seeing it, his sister-in-law couldn't help but let out a \"Pfft\" of laughter.\n\n\"What's so funny?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"It says 'Where Are We Going, Dad?' on it,\" his sister-in-law replied.\n\n\"What's so funny about that? Is your funny bone that ticklish?\" Xu Qinglang reached for the fan, then his eyes widened.\n\n\"Perfect, you go with my brother-in-law,\" his sister-in-law cast a mischievous glance at Xu Qinglang and Zhou Ze.\n\n\"'Where Are We Going, Dad?' GG?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nXu Qinglang's expression was a bit volatile, but he still tossed the fan to Zhou Ze, \"See for yourself.\"\n\nZhou Ze took the fan and glanced at it,\n\nOnly to see a hospital building in the background,\n\nAt the very top was a large line of text: \"Where Are We Going, Dad?\"\n\nThen below it were two lines of cartoon text:\n\n\"Take your son for a circum...cision!\n\nSecond one half price!\"",

    "content": "\"Seriously, today is really weird. Taxis are genuinely invisible.\"\n\nDropping the fan, Xu Qinglang restacked his things, preparing to assemble a computer at home.\n\n\"Just bad luck, I guess.\" Zhou Ze didn't take it seriously and walked out of the shop to light a cigarette.\n\nThe morning sun was still very pleasant.\n\nBai Yingying didn't like being in the sun, which might be related to her identity and nature. However, she wasn't like the zombies in old Hong Kong films that would turn to ash upon contact with sunlight.\n\nAccording to Xu Qinglang, Bai Yingying, having been nourished by Madam Bai's soul for two hundred years, was no longer an ordinary being. While not as terrifying as a drought demon, she was definitely no low-level zombie.\n\nAnd indeed, if Bai Yingying wished, she could completely change her appearance and blend into urban life with a different identity.\n\nBut her soul-blood was in his hand, so she couldn't leave. Besides, she didn't seem to want to leave. Maybe one day a bolt of lightning would strike her dead, as she wasn't favored by Heaven.\n\n\"Smoke less. You're smoking too much lately.\"\n\nHis sister-in-law also walked out of the shop, seemingly planning to go out and have fun.\n\nZhou Ze ignored her.\n\nActually, Zhou Ze envied her. She had grown up in a pampered environment, a sweet innocent, but that was also a kind of happiness. Unlike himself, a child raised in an orphanage, always with an inherent sense of insecurity. Anyone who wanted to succeed would strive relentlessly.\n\nLike his childhood friend Wang Ke, who worked tirelessly day and night, not even knowing when his wife went out to get her hair done.\n\nPeople,\n\nIt seemed, were just that coincidental, because a red car quickly pulled up on the road in front of Zhou Ze's shop.\n\nOut stepped familiar faces: Wang Ke's wife and the little loli.\n\n\"Hello, Sister. Hello, Uncle.\"\n\nThe little loli greeted them very politely.\n\nHis sister-in-law couldn't help but crouch down and pinch the little loli's cheek, saying, \"This little doll is so cute.\"\n\nThe woman smiled at Zhou Ze and said, \"I'm going to get my hair done. She'll read a book here for a while.\"\n\n\"Alright,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\nThe woman thanked him, then turned and got back into her car and drove off, her movements wide, showing an eagerness.\n\nHis sister-in-law also hailed a taxi and left, reminding Zhou Ze again to cover for her before she went.\n\nAt the shop entrance, the little loli stood beside Zhou Ze, who was squatting and smoking.\n\n\"You didn't come back, did you?\" Zhou Ze suddenly asked.\n\n\"Uncle, what are you saying?\" The little loli looked a bit confused, adorable in her blankness.\n\n\"Hehe.\"\n\nZhou Ze reached out and patted the little loli's head.\n\n\"Come on, let's read.\"\n\nZhou Ze picked out a copy of *Gǔwén Guānzhǐ* for the little loli and handed it to her, then asked, \"How are your grades at school?\"\n\n\"My grades are very good,\" the little loli said proudly.\n\n\"Do you have any hobbies?\" Zhou Ze asked again.\n\n\"I can dance ballet and I'm learning to play the piano,\" the little loli replied.\n\n\"What would you like to drink?\"\n\n\"I want to drink Coca-Cola.\" After saying that, the little loli stuck out her tongue. \"Mom usually doesn't let me drink it.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded, went to Xu Qinglang's place next door, and brought back a can of Coca-Cola.\n\n\"Here.\"\n\nThe little loli took the Coca-Cola and said sweetly:\n\n\"Thank you, Uncle.\"\n\nAfter taking a sip of Coca-Cola, the little loli turned another page of the book and read with relish.\n\n\"You're back.\"\n\nZhou Ze, holding a glass of water, suddenly spoke.\n\nThe playful cuteness on the little loli's face gradually faded, replaced by a deep solemnity akin to an adult's.\n\nShe held up the book in her hand,\n\n\"When I realized I shouldn't be reading this book, it was already too late.\"\n\nThe book the little loli was holding was the *Gǔwén Guānzhǐ* that Zhou Ze had initially handed her, and it wasn't a modern or youth edition.\n\n\"Why did you come looking for me?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nHad the one in Rongcheng been dealt with?\n\nSo, she was back?\n\n\"I just came back from Hell. I missed you, so I came to see you.\" The little loli stood up, tilted her head slightly, looked at Zhou Ze, and smiled, \"I've noticed you're quite lazy, and very unmotivated.\"\n\n\"I don't understand what you mean,\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"The attendance record shows that my performance in this large region lately is at the bottom,\" the little loli licked her lips. \"I told you to handle things before, but I didn't tell you to be this lazy.\"\n\n\"Attendance record?\" Zhou Ze's heart stirred when he heard that.\n\n\"What, is there a problem? Do you think ghost officers don't have performance reviews?\" The little loli retorted.\n\n\"Can you... let me see it?\"\n\n\"Why don't you ask why I can't just give it to you directly?\"\n\nThe little loli leaned close to Zhou Ze. She wanted to look him in the eye, but she was too short. When she got close, it turned into Zhou Ze looking down at her.\n\nThis made her very uncomfortable.\n\nImmediately, she waved her hand,\n\nAnd said, very annoyed:\n\n\"Pick me up.\"\n\nZhou Ze bent down and picked up the little loli, allowing her eyes to meet his.\n\n\"Don't think I don't know what's on your mind.\" The little loli's cool fingers stroked Zhou Ze's chin for a moment. \"Do you really want to become a full-time employee?\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\nThere was nothing to be ashamed of admitting.\n\n\"I can give you something to look forward to. I'll be going to Rongcheng in a while. Once I've dealt with that troublemaker, I might get a chance for a promotion.\n\nAt that time, my original position can be transferred to you, as long as you raise my performance again next month.\"\n\nThe little loli gave Zhou Ze a big promise.\n\nZhou Ze understood a bit. The little loli's behavior was somewhat like a person working at a company who hands over their tasks to someone else to help them, while they go off to do freelance work.\n\n\"Perhaps, I can anticipate another possibility,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"What possibility?\"\n\n\"You die in Rongcheng, and then the position naturally becomes mine.\"\n\nDeep down, Zhou Ze didn't wish for that person to get into trouble. After all, the other party had helped him out in his dream last time.\n\nAs for why he spoke so directly, it was simple: there was no need for too many twists and turns between them.\n\n\"Hehe...\"\n\nThe little loli didn't get angry or upset. Instead, she jumped down from Zhou Ze's arms, clasped her hands behind her back, and said:\n\n\"Do you think he still has a chance? You don't know how many ghost officers have come this time.\"\n\n\"You shouldn't explain it to me,\" Zhou Ze lit another cigarette, exhaling a puff of smoke. \"Explaining means you're also afraid.\"\n\n\"Don't flatter him, or yourself.\" The little loli turned around, her deep eyes fixed on Zhou Ze. \"Aren't you a doctor? Why would you wish for my death?\n\nIsn't she cute?\"\n\n\"Oh, what a cute child! Where did you come from?\"\n\nBai Yingying just came down from the second floor at this moment. Upon seeing the little loli, she happily walked over, ready to hug the child.\n\n\"Madam Bai?\"\n\nThe little loli frowned slightly.\n\n\"Uh...\"\n\nEven a fool like Bai Yingying knew that the person in front of her wasn't just some neighborhood kid.\n\n\"Oh, my old neighbor has cultivated enough merit and gone down. You are the shell she left behind.\" The little loli glared at Zhou Ze, \"You kept her by your side, no wonder fewer ghosts actively came to you!\"\n\n\"Who are you?\" Bai Yingying asked timidly.\n\n\"My time is limited. This is just a reminder to you. I'm not afraid of you having other intentions. Who wouldn't have other intentions?\"\n\nThe little loli walked confidently to the bookshelf,\n\n\"I'll be back in a month. I'm not sure if you can take over my position, and I'm not sure if I'll be promoted.\n\nBut if you can't raise my performance next month,\n\nThen there's no need for you to stay in the human world. Go back to your Hell and wait to drink Meng Po's soup.\"\n\nAfter saying these words, the little loli tilted her head and fainted. Immediately, a black light suddenly rose up,\n\n*Biu!*\n\nIt shot directly into the ground!\n\n\"Boss, who is she? Is she a Judge?\" Bai Yingying asked Zhou Ze.\n\n\"She's a ghost officer. I'm a temporary worker; she's a permanent employee.\" Zhou Ze picked up the sleeping little loli and placed her on the boss's chair behind his counter, covering her with a blanket.\n\n\"She's just a ghost officer, but it feels like even a Judge wouldn't put on airs as much as she does.\"\n\n\"Have you seen a Judge?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"What identity will your madam have after she goes down?\"\n\n\"I'm not sure, but she should get an official title in Hell.\"\n\nJust then, a middle-aged man in a police uniform pushed open the bookstore door and walked in.\n\nAs soon as he entered,\n\nHe felt the temperature in the bookstore seemed to rise, and Zhou Ze and Bai Yingying both sensed a discomfort.\n\nAs if thorns were in their backs.\n\nZhou Ze turned around and looked at him. The man wore a police cap, with the national emblem on it shining brightly under the reflection of the sunlight outside.\n\nHe had a square face, thick lips, and a large build, exuding a sense of authority.\n\n\"Boss, recommend some good books for me to read. I'm going on a business trip later and need something to pass the time on the road,\" the police uncle said, taking off his hat and scratching his scalp.\n\n\"Oh, alright.\"\n\nZhou Ze smiled slightly, observing the other person carefully for a moment to confirm he wasn't a ghost.\n\nOnly then did he turn to the bookshelf, find a few books, and hand them to him.\n\nThe police uncle took the stack of books. He paused when he saw the first one, which was *Basic Knowledge of Public Security*.\n\nWhen he flipped to the second book,\n\nThe police uncle paused again; it was *The People's Police Law of the People's Republic of China*.\n\nBelow those were two more books: *Theory and Practice of Dispute Resolution* and *Explanation of Grappling Techniques*.\n\nThe police uncle took a deep breath, seemingly deliberating how to phrase his words, then put the books down,\n\n\"I misspoke. I'm taking my son on a trip, and I'm worried he'll get bored on the way, so I'm buying him some books to pass the time. He prefers horror.\"\n\n\"Oh, got it.\"\n\nZhou Ze took two books from a box below and handed them to the other person again.\n\nThey were *Horror Web Novels* and *Horror Broadcasts*.\n\nThe police uncle finally nodded with satisfaction:\n\n\"These are good.\"",

    "content": "The police officer sat there, flipping through a book, occasionally taking out his phone to check the time.\n\nHonestly,\n\nHis presence in the shop was a huge source of pressure for Zhou Ze and Bai Yingying.\n\nIt was like having thorns in their backs.\n\nHe was a good police officer, full of righteousness, and with his uniform on, he could practically make all evil spirits retreat.\n\nBut Zhou Ze couldn't retreat; after all, this was his own shop.\n\nFortunately, Zhou Ze and Bai Yingying weren't low-level lone spirits or mountain sprites and monsters. Although it was uncomfortable, there was no actual harm.\n\nOn the contrary, Zhou Ze felt a genuine respect for this person from the bottom of his heart.\n\n\"People's hearts are hidden behind their bellies,\" is true,\n\nBut as ghosts, they were more sensitive to this feeling.\n\nSo, the batch of books Zhou Ze initially gave him wasn't meant to trick him. Zhou Ze had preconceived notion that a police officer who could cultivate such a righteous aura would likely enjoy serious and valuable books.\n\nHowever, Zhou Ze later realized that police officers are also human;\n\nAnd as humans, they have their own interests and hobbies. For example, the police officer sitting there now was deeply engrossed in a novel.\n\n\"Uncle, have some tea.\"\n\nBai Yingying timidly brought over a teacup.\n\n\"Oh, thank you.\" The police officer took the teacup, looked at Bai Yingying, and asked, \"Aren't you in school?\"\n\n\"Today's a holiday.\"\n\nBai Yingying didn't dare to say she wasn't in school and was just messing around, to avoid further trouble.\n\nBai Yingying was a little afraid of the man in front of her, even more so than Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze was a modern person and could understand this mindset. While the man in front of him instinctively made him feel scared, from another perspective, it also meant that this person was more worthy of respect.\n\nBut Bai Yingying just felt her heart beating a little fast. After handing over the tea, she immediately ran upstairs and didn't want to come down again.\n\n\"Boss, how much?\" The police officer looked at Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Just pay what you think is right,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"That won't do. Never mind, I'll settle up when I leave. They'll probably be here to pick me up in about half an hour.\" The police officer sat back down, patted his pocket, and paused.\n\nAs an old smoker, Zhou Ze understood and offered him a cigarette.\n\n\"Thanks.\"\n\nThe police officer thanked Zhou Ze for lighting his cigarette, and then they both smoked.\n\nCigarettes are indeed a bridge for male social interaction, turning strangers into smoking buddies, and making it easier to boast a little.\n\n\"Your business here isn't very easy, is it?\" the police officer asked.\n\n\"Just getting by,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\n\"Oh, I remember who you are now.\" The police officer patted his head and said, \"During the last fire, you bravely rushed into the flames to save people, didn't you?\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"Look at my memory. Oh, right, the bureau wanted to give you a commendation banner last time, why didn't you go receive it?\"\n\n\"It was just my duty; I didn't want to show off,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\nThe police officer nodded, somewhat helplessly saying, \"Indeed, in the end, no one expected that the arsonist would be one of the heroes who rushed into the fire to save people.\"\n\n\"Damn it, taxis really have disappeared, and ride-hailing cars are hard to get at this time. I can't even get a taxi. Old Zhou, it seems we really have to move. You can't even get a cab in this godforsaken place.\n\nI'm missing a cable here; I have to go back and buy one, otherwise, the host won't be able to be assembled.\"\n\nXu Qinglang complained as he walked in, then saw the police officer sitting in the bookstore.\n\n\"Oh, Bureau Chief Zhao!\"\n\nXu Qinglang clearly knew the police officer. He immediately smiled and said warmly:\n\n\"Bureau Chief Zhao, you look as robust as ever. *Hiss*, I remember seeing news about you a while ago. What was it about? I forgot, but it seemed like you earned another merit and received a medal. Yes, that must be it. Congratulations!\"\n\n\"You little rascal, you've grown more handsome.\" Bureau Chief Zhao stood up with a laugh, patted Xu Qinglang's shoulder, looking quite affectionate, \"Are you still stealing chickens and snatching dogs?\"\n\n\"How could I dare? My family's house was demolished, and we got over twenty apartments. Now I'm a law-abiding taxpayer,\" Xu Qinglang replied.\n\n\"You...\" Bureau Chief Zhao pointed at Xu Qinglang, \"You've really turned your fortunes around.\"\n\n\"Bureau Chief Zhao, your son is getting married soon, isn't he? How about I give you an apartment as a wedding gift for your son?\"\n\n\"You brat, if you dare to say such nonsense in front of me again, believe it or not, I'll arrest you and throw you back in the bureau?\" Bureau Chief Zhao sternly scolded.\n\n\"Hey, I'm just a noodle shop owner, I'm not bribing you. If it weren't for you back then, I probably wouldn't have made it until my family's old house and land were demolished. It's only right to honor you with an apartment.\"\n\n\"You just live your life well.\"\n\n\"You two know each other?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nBureau Chief Zhao nodded and said, \"Know each other? More than just know each other. This kid has been running around stealing things and picking pockets since before he was ten. I've caught him so many times.\n\nThe first time I caught him, I even told my subordinate police officers that I caught a little girl thief, who knew he was a boy!\"\n\n\"I didn't know better back then, so let's not bring it up,\" Xu Qinglang didn't want Zhou Ze to hear about his past embarrassing incidents.\n\n\"Bring it up, we must bring it up. You little rascal did a lot of foolish things back then. Those mistakes cannot be forgotten; they must be kept in mind to warn yourself not to commit them again. Good times are hard to come by.\"\n\n\"Bureau Chief Zhao, I understand.\" Xu Qinglang nodded.\n\n\"By the way, I sent you to be an apprentice to Master Sun. How is Master Sun doing these days?\" Bureau Chief Zhao asked.\n\n\"He's alright, but his shop has been passed on to his son, and I've also branched out on my own.\"\n\nIt turns out that this was also the reason Xu Qinglang opened a noodle shop. Back then, his family experienced changes, and he was almost becoming a hoodlum on the streets. Bureau Chief Zhao, who was then the director of the police station, caught and educated him several times. Finally, Bureau Chief Zhao even arranged for him to be an apprentice at a noodle shop, which put him on the right path.\n\nOtherwise, Xu Qinglang might have needed an additional \"apartment\" now – a prison cell.\n\n\"Bureau Chief Zhao, why are you here?\" After saying that, Xu Qinglang quietly reminded him, \"Let me tell you, you should rarely come to this place; the *feng shui* isn't good.\"\n\nThe implication was that Zhou Ze's bookstore had far more dead people looking at books than living ones.\n\nZhou Ze raised an eyebrow at the side.\n\nWhat did he mean?\n\n\"You brat, you still haven't changed your habit of playing ghostly tricks. I was born under the red flag, grew up under the red flag; I don't believe in these crooked, evil teachings.\n\nBesides, if you walk upright and sit straight, and haven't done anything guilty, you won't be afraid of a ghost knocking on your door.\n\nEven if there really are ghosts in this world, the ghosts will be afraid of me, not the other way around!\"\n\nZhou Ze rubbed the tip of his nose beside them. You really hit the nail on the head.\n\n\"Bureau Chief Zhao, I'll personally cook up a few dishes. We haven't seen each other for many years. How about we have a couple of drinks tonight?\"\n\n\"Can't do it, someone will pick me up soon. I'm going on a business trip to another province. I just bought two novels to read on the way, in case I get bored.\"\n\n\"You're already a bureau chief, and you're still so busy,\" Xu Qinglang said, a little regretfully.\n\n\"It's good to be busy. I'm a police officer. If police officers become lax, the common people won't be able to rest easy.\"\n\nBureau Chief Zhao scratched his head, put his police cap back on, then took out his phone to check the time again and said:\n\n\"It's about time. They should be here to pick me up. I'm leaving now.\"\n\n\"Have a safe trip.\"\n\nZhou Ze thought to himself that he finally sent this magnificent great god away.\n\nBureau Chief Zhao walked to the door, then seemed to remember something, reaching into his pocket as if to get his wallet:\n\n\"Look at my memory, I took books and drank tea, almost forgot to pay.\"\n\n\"Look at you being a stranger, I paid for it,\" Xu Qinglang immediately stepped forward and said, \"This boss grew up eating my food; he's family.\"\n\n\"............\" Zhou Ze.\n\n\"No, that won't do. Why should you pay for the books I bought?\" Bureau Chief Zhao disagreed.\n\n\"Alright, in a few days, I'll visit you personally and let you repay me for the books, and I'll also grab a meal. How about it?\" Xu Qinglang pleaded, \"You have to give me a reason to visit, don't you?\"\n\n\"Alright then, your aunt's cooking is still pretty good. I might not be home then, but I'll have your aunt cook you a meal, and you learn a thing or two. Just tell her I said so. Strive to turn this noodle shop into a hotel in the future.\n\nPeople always need some pursuits; don't just lie around on those apartments, living off them and waiting to die. That's no fun either.\"\n\n\"Heh, what would I go there for if you're not home?\" Xu Qinglang laughed.\n\n\"Alright, I'm leaving now, goodbye!\" Bureau Chief Zhao waved to Zhou Ze and Xu Qinglang, pushed open the bookstore door, and left.\n\n\"Boss, there are so many cars outside!\" Bai Yingying, who had been upstairs, came down the stairs and called out to the people in the bookstore.\n\n\"What cars?\" Xu Qinglang asked, \"Is it a wedding procession?\"\n\n\"Wedding cars don't have the same prestige as an eight-bearer sedan chair,\" Zhou Ze teased Xu Qinglang.\n\n\"Not wedding cars, they're taxis, so many taxis, the whole road is full of taxis,\" Bai Yingying said, she could see clearly from the upstairs window.\n\n\"Taxis?\" Xu Qinglang paused, then said, \"Damn, no wonder it was so hard to get a taxi today, I couldn't even see any. Are they organizing a strike and protest?\"\n\nSuddenly, Xu Qinglang froze.\n\nHe seemed to have remembered something and immediately took out his phone to search. Finally, he found it.\n\nIt was a news report from half a month ago.\n\nThe headline featured a large photo of Bureau Chief Zhao, and the content below described how a car theft ring that had been active across multiple provinces was apprehended in Tongcheng. They were discovered by an off-duty deputy police bureau chief returning home. During the struggle, the deputy bureau chief unfortunately died in the line of duty.\n\nThree days later, the police apprehended the entire criminal gang, not missing a single member. This car theft ring mainly stole taxis and was also responsible for the deaths of two taxi drivers.\n\nBureau Chief Zhao had died a long time ago.\n\n\"He's already dead... I remember reading that news and being sad for a long time, but just now, as soon as I saw him in front of me, I instinctively felt that he was still alive and completely forgot about that news.\"\n\nAfter saying that, Xu Qinglang angrily looked at Zhou Ze:\n\n\"He's a ghost; he's not a living person! Why didn't you tell me just now? I had so many things I didn't get to say to him!\"\n\nZhou Ze was also astonished and said, \"He's a ghost?\"\n\n\"You didn't realize? You're a ghost messenger; you didn't realize?\"\n\n\"When he came in, I observed him carefully. He was human.\"\n\n\"How could he be human!\" Xu Qinglang almost roared.\n\nHe could have said goodbye to him earlier, but he was just chatting!\n\n\"Why would I lie to you? I observed him carefully and truly didn't realize he was a ghost.\"\n\n\"I didn't notice either,\" Bai Yingying said as she came over.\n\nAt that moment, on the road outside the shop,\n\nA line of taxis, arranged in two parallel rows, moved slowly forward. The line was very long, almost endless.\n\nXu Qinglang pushed open the bookstore door and walked out. Zhou Ze and Bai Yingying followed him out.\n\nNearly a thousand taxis spontaneously organized themselves into a procession, moving forward. The taxi drivers, both men and women, changed their usual habit of driving fast and constantly overtaking.\n\nThis time,\n\nThey drove very, very slowly.\n\nAt the end of the procession,\n\nThere was a hearse playing a funeral dirge.\n\nAt the same time, a large black-and-white photo, Bureau Chief Zhao's portrait, hung above the hearse.\n\n\"Is it a funeral today?\" Xu Qinglang said despondently, \"So when he said he was going on a business trip and someone would pick him up, it was this funeral procession?\n\nBut how could I not tell he was a ghost, and you couldn't either.\"\n\n\"Some people are alive but already dead;\n\nSome people are dead but still alive.\n\nPerhaps, that's why,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Sigh.\" Xu Qinglang nodded upon hearing this, then waved his hand at the long procession, bidding farewell.\n\nAt the same time, he felt a sense of relief, no wonder it was so difficult to get a taxi in Tongcheng today.\n\nZhou Ze watched as the car carrying the portrait slowly drove past,\n\nAnd silently said in his heart:\n\n\"Rest in peace.\"\n\n——————\n\nThis story is based on a true event.",

    "content": "Xu Qinglang had originally planned to perform a ritual for Bureau Chief Zhao, hoping he would pass peacefully, and to do his part.\n\nBut then he reconsidered: Bureau Chief Zhao had passed quite peacefully already, even bringing two books along for the journey, lest the path to the Yellow Springs be too dull.\n\nFurthermore, the spontaneous farewell convoy of thousands of taxis and numerous citizens was surely enough to ensure Bureau Chief Zhao's smooth journey; there was no need for him to gild the lily.\n\n\"Old Zhou, he was a really good person.\"\n\nXu Qinglang puffed on his cigarette, eyes reddening slightly, a truly pitiable sight.\n\n\"He also left with dignity.\"\n\nEven though he was a doctor in his previous life, and had saved and helped many people, Zhou Ze didn't consider himself particularly great. His profession was doctor; saving the dying and helping the injured was simply his duty.\n\nIn truth, those ordinary yet great people merely do their jobs in society, but the brilliance they exude isn't confined to their work.\n\nThere are always some things that can move you, and move many others.\n\nPeople often ponder whether the eyes of the masses are truly discerning.\n\nBut the nearly one thousand taxi drivers, male and female, who formed the farewell escort, their hearts were crystal clear.\n\n\"I'm going to rest.\"\n\nXu Qinglang pulled out a tissue, wiped away the tears from the corners of his eyes, and turned to go back to his noodle shop. He wanted to drink some alcohol, then get a good night's sleep. Strong people never like to show their vulnerable side to others.\n\nAfter finishing his cigarette, Zhou Ze also walked back to the bookstore. The little loli told him to boost his performance, but Zhou Ze remained as lazy as ever.\n\nThis was largely due to a lack of initiative, and also, Zhou Ze was waiting for a result: what would be the fate of that person in Rongcheng?\n\nAlthough Zhou Ze himself felt that the other party's chances of turning things around were slim—the little loli had personally gone back to Hell and even released the Faceless Woman to help, also uniting with many other ghost messengers.\n\nBut,\n\nWhat if?\n\nWhat if?\n\nYes, what if!\n\nZhou Ze even genuinely considered and hoped that if the person in Rongcheng managed to kill the little loli, wouldn't the little loli's position naturally fall to him?\n\nOne must always have dreams.\n\nTaking out his phone, Zhou Ze dialed a number—Old Daoist's phone.\n\nAfter treating Old Daoist to dinner last time, they hadn't contacted each other again.\n\nNo one answered on the other end. Zhou Ze put down his phone, but soon, the call was returned:\n\n\"Hello, big brother, I'm not in Tongcheng right now, I'm in Xucheng. What's up, do you need something?\"\n\n\"Oh.\"\n\nZhou Ze had originally wanted to tell Old Daoist to warn that person to be careful, but on second thought, he didn't bother with extra words, nor did he chat much, simply hanging up.\n\nOld Daoist on the other end of the line probably felt bewildered.\n\nIn that dream, the young man clearly knew he was being targeted, so his current reminder was redundant.\n\nThat person already knew.\n\nStretching, the little loli woke up, returning to her cute and blank expression, and then her mother, having finished her hair, came back to pick her up.\n\nIt was evident that her mother's hair treatment was very successful; while seemingly unchanged, she looked much more radiant and healthy, like dewdrops on a summer morning's flower bud, appearing more mature and tender.\n\nWhen she walked out of the car, her legs were spread wider.\n\nToday's matters should have ended here. Zhou Ze had planned to take a shower and then prepare for the evening's business.\n\nThe little loli said that keeping Bai Yingying, this zombie, by his side was like putting a lampshade over himself, a white-hot bulb, which would affect the probability of encountering ghosts. But Zhou Ze currently had no intention of sending Bai Yingying away.\n\nSleeping with a freezer was, of course, not as comfortable as sleeping with Bai Yingying.\n\nMoreover, ghosts kept coming to the bookstore, and Zhou Ze was getting a bit annoyed. This was with Bai Yingying present; if she weren't, he'd probably have to deal with a large number of lingering spirits every night.\n\nZhou Ze felt he had degenerated. In his previous life, he was so ambitious, so motivated.\n\nIn this life, he only wanted to muddle through, but this lazy and aimless feeling, a life of just reading books and slouching in a chair every day,\n\nIt was truly comfortable.\n\nAs Zhou Ze asked Bai Yingying to get his clean clothes for a shower,\n\nSomeone pushed open the shop door. Zhou Ze turned around, slightly surprised by this person's arrival, as his daughter and wife had just left the shop.\n\n\"I'm here for a follow-up, to see how you're doing lately.\"\n\nWang Ke naturally pulled out a plastic stool and sat on it, motioning for Zhou Ze to sit opposite him.\n\nHe owned his own psychiatric hospital, and his fees were quite high, so actively following up and offering free consultations to Zhou Ze was, in his and others' eyes, a great honor for Zhou Ze.\n\nOf course, half of this honor was attributed to the real Zhou Ze, and the other half was because Zhou Ze had saved his daughter earlier.\n\nZhou Ze sat opposite Wang Ke,\n\nTrying to keep his gaze low, not looking at Wang Ke's head.\n\nBecause Wang Ke's head was radiating a dense green light, as if ten thousand horses were galloping.\n\nThe bookstore's computer was connected to a small Bluetooth speaker, randomly playing some pop music. At this moment, it happened to switch to Stefanie Sun's \"Green Light.\"\n\nEven random playback was so mischievous these days.\n\n\"Tell me, how have you been feeling lately?\" Wang Ke asked.\n\n\"I think I'm very well, the problems are mostly gone now,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\n\"I can see that. You're very calm, and you're handling things with ease now,\" Wang Ke nodded.\n\nHowever, a silence fell between them.\n\nZhou Ze found it a bit strange; it seemed that the other party wasn't specifically here for a follow-up on his condition, that was just a pretense.\n\n\"There's something I'd like your help with,\" Wang Ke said again.\n\n\"Tell me.\"\n\nRegardless of their relationship in the previous life, simply based on the advice and analysis he provided for Zhou Ze's condition recently, Zhou Ze owed him a favor.\n\n\"I have a client who has dissociative identity disorder. Her case is quite complex and a bit difficult to handle, so I need you to go and observe and analyze her.\"\n\n\"That shouldn't be difficult for you, should it?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"It is,\" Wang Ke gave a wry smile. \"Her father is an important business partner of mine; my psychiatric hospital was established with his investment.\n\nIf it were simply a matter of helping the first personality eliminate the second, or vice versa, I have ways and the ability to try.\n\nBut the complexity lies in this:\n\nTo my partner, his daughter's first personality is, of course, his daughter herself, but the second personality is very similar to his wife.\"\n\n\"So... mother and daughter are living in one body?\"\n\n\"Yes, his wife passed away from illness last year, and he was very sad. His daughter is only sixteen this year. I analyze that it might be because the girl subconsciously couldn't accept the fact that her mother had passed away.\n\nSo, in her own consciousness, she gradually 'recreated' an image of her mother to accompany her.\n\nIf this problem had been discovered earlier, it would have been fine, but by the time it was truly noticed and taken seriously, it was too late. The second personality had already formed and was very mature.\n\nDuring the day, she's the daughter; at night, she's the mother.\n\nDuring the day, she goes to school, plays computer games, and watches TV series in her room.\n\nAt night, she wants to rest in her father's bedroom. If my friend doesn't open the door, she cries outside, saying he has another woman and doesn't want to touch her anymore.\"\n\n\"Quite interesting,\" Zhou Ze chuckled.\n\nWang Ke's expression was a bit awkward. Zhou Ze's comment made him uncomfortable; joking about a patient was very disrespectful.\n\n\"My apologies.\" Zhou Ze raised a hand, indicating he had spoken out of turn, but still said, \"So, how does your business partner want to resolve this issue?\"\n\nHave his \"wife\" die again,\n\nOr, have his daughter become his wife?\n\nHappiness, choose one of two.\n\nZhou Ze was also a doctor in his previous life; logically, he shouldn't be thinking about this matter with such a jocular attitude. But in reality, Zhou Ze couldn't maintain a perfectly serious demeanor, especially as he had already discerned the father's thoughts from Wang Ke's narration.\n\nThere were nothing but three ways to solve the problem: keep the daughter, keep the \"wife,\" or keep both.\n\nOf course, there was another extreme way, keeping neither, but that amounted to murder and was immediately excluded.\n\nAs a doctor, you should only be responsible for your patient.\n\nIn his previous life, when Zhou Ze saved people in the hospital, he often encountered external interference. For example, a pregnant woman had acute inflammation, and her family members actually stopped the doctors from performing an X-ray, saying they were afraid it would affect the baby's health, but the situation at the time was that both the pregnant woman and the baby could die directly from the inflammation.\n\nIn this case, the so-called \"wife\" was merely a virtual personality, a symptom of the daughter's illness caused by missing her deceased mother.\n\nTherefore, helping the daughter recover and shake off the influence of the so-called second personality was the correct direction for treatment.\n\nBut Wang Ke was conflicted, which meant the father chose the third option: he loved his wife, he missed his wife, so he hoped to see his daughter in his daughter's body while also feeling that his wife was still alive.\n\n\"He loves his wife very much,\" Wang Ke said.\n\n\"But often, love is actually a disguise for selfishness.\"\n\n\"So, you're unwilling to help?\"\n\n\"I don't know how I can help you.\"\n\n\"You are the most perfect case of a successful second personality integration I've ever seen. I believe you might be able to communicate with the mother's personality. To ensure they coexist harmoniously in one body; the problem now is that the two personalities are showing unstable tendencies.\n\nThey will gradually cross over and become chaotic.\n\nThen, they will become another stranger.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, I can't do that.\" Zhou Ze looked at Wang Ke, \"Mr. Wang, I remember my good friend Zhou Ze told me about you, saying you were a very upright and principled person.\"\n\nWang Ke frowned slightly, but quickly relaxed, saying:\n\n\"People change. Without that investor's help, I wouldn't be where I am today.\"\n\nWang Ke stood up, appearing ready to leave. Since he couldn't persuade Zhou Ze, he had no reason to stay.\n\n\"I think I bought a lottery ticket, and I forgot to check the winning numbers. Maybe I won five million, I should check now,\" Zhou Ze suddenly said.\n\n\"That probability is too low,\" Wang Ke smiled.\n\n\"Scratching a lottery ticket is like looking at a paternity test. Everyone knows it's pointless, but you can't help but take a look.\"\n\nAfter saying that, Zhou Ze smiled at Wang Ke and continued:\n\n\"Right?\"",

    "content": "Three days had passed since Zhou Ze had refused Wang Ke. Zhou Ze had practically forgotten about it. These past few days, Bai Yingying, having nothing to do, would go to Xu Qinglang’s shop to play computer games, while Xu Qinglang would come to the bookstore to chat with Zhou Ze and read newspapers.\n\nAlthough Bureau Chief Zhao had told Xu Qinglang before he left that it was best not to waste life lying on a house, Xu Qinglang had agreed.\n\nYes,\n\nLaziness certainly doesn't lead to success,\n\nBut,\n\nLaziness can make one comfortable.\n\nXu Qinglang had still fallen into decay. For these three days, his shop hadn't lit a fire except when Zhou Ze ate and when he himself ate. He hadn't even opened his food delivery app; it had remained in \"Shop Closed\" status.\n\nAt noon, Zhou Ze had just finished lunch with strawberry juice. As he strolled at the bookstore entrance, he saw that familiar red car driving over.\n\nThis left Zhou Ze a bit speechless. Just three days, and this woman was going to get her hair done again?\n\nToo much hair styling could damage one's hair.\n\nSoon, the woman stopped the car, and then Wang Ke also got out.\n\nWang Ke jogged over to Zhou Ze, looked at him, and said,\n\n\"Help me.\"\n\nVery simple,\n\nAnd very direct,\n\nJust those two words.\n\nWithout any preamble, it meant these two words directly extended from the previous topic: the patient with the mother-daughter fusion.\n\n\"Things have gotten worse. Her personality is starting to become chaotic,\" Wang Ke said, very urgently. \"You have to help me.\"\n\nZhou Ze shrugged,\n\nMeaning was simple,\n\nSorry,\n\nHe still wasn't willing to get involved in this matter.\n\nA simple one-plus-one-equals-two problem had been delayed into a more serious issue. This was a man-made disaster, not a natural one.\n\nIn this, Wang Ke, who considered the investors' position, had lost his professional ethics and duty as a doctor.\n\n\"I don't have time.\" Zhou Ze pointed to his bookstore. \"I need to mind the shop.\"\n\nHe intended to refuse. He just needed an excuse or a reason, even if it was a lousy one. It didn't matter.\n\n\"Whatever your daily turnover is, I'll pay you ten times that.\"\n\nWang Ke said directly,\n\n\"Come with me. I think you can help. She almost succeeded in committing suicide last night. If she hadn't been discovered early, she would be a corpse now!\"\n\nZhou Ze was in agony.\n\nHis neighbor was richer than him,\n\nHis wife was richer than him,\n\nHis maid was also richer than him,\n\nAnd his childhood friend said, \"Whatever your daily turnover is, I'll pay you ten times that.\"\n\nSo disheartening,\n\nSo disheartening that Zhou Ze even thought of asking \"Little Loli\" to help him check next time he saw her, to see if he was born with a fate of poverty. How could he be so poor in two lifetimes?\n\n\"This is about sentiment; money can't measure it.\" Zhou Ze genuinely didn't want to go. He was a surgeon. To be honest, he only knew a little about psychology.\n\n\"Come with me, give me a hand!\"\n\nWang Ke grabbed Zhou Ze's hand.\n\nThis made Zhou Ze uncomfortable.\n\nEven Xu Qinglang, that man more beautiful than a woman, had never made such a gesture towards him. He immediately took a step back, trying to pull his hand away, but Wang Ke held onto his hand tightly.\n\nZhou Ze's brows furrowed slightly.\n\nWas he going to be so pushy?\n\nJust as Zhou Ze was about to get angry,\n\nWang Ke suddenly lowered his voice and said,\n\n\"A Ze, help me!\"\n\nZhou Ze's eyes suddenly widened, staring intently at Wang Ke.\n\nWhat did he just call him?\n\nWang Ke kept taking deep breaths and said, \"If this matter isn't resolved, my career is over. I won't lie to you, it was my suggestion to my investor to choose the dual personality preservation. I told him I had the ability to handle the treatment and arrangements.\n\nNow, I'm panicking. I'm helpless. I can only rely on you.\"\n\n\"What did you just call me?\" Zhou Ze also lowered his voice.\n\nXu Qinglang happened to walk out of his shop to smoke, watching the two men outside holding hands and \"whispering sweet nothings\" and \"huddling together\" in hushed tones;\n\nHe immediately took a sharp breath, feeling a severe toothache, and sighed,\n\n\"What an outrage, what an outrage.\"\n\nWang Ke's wife and Bai Yingying stood nearby, somewhat bewildered to see their respective men behaving so intimately and exchanging secrets.\n\n\"A Ze, help me.\"\n\nWang Ke repeated.\n\nHe had seen it,\n\nHe had seen it for a long time,\n\nBut he had been pretending to be foolish,\n\nOr rather, he wasn't sure, and this discovery and deduction were too shocking. But at this moment, he could only hope for Zhou Ze's help.\n\nZhou Ze bit his lip, looked up, and then nodded.\n\nHe agreed.\n\nHe had no choice but to agree.\n\nJust as when he had gone to Wang Ke's house to find him, and directly stated the name Zhou Ze, Wang Ke had immediately put down his most important work to treat him,\n\nNow,\n\nWang Ke had said his name. In front of him, he was no longer Xu Le, but Zhou Ze, and there was no longer any room for refusal.\n\nAs childhood friends who had grown up together in the orphanage, although they had largely lost contact after finishing their studies and starting work, each striving in their own fields, the memories of growing up together and encouraging each other were still very real.\n\n\"Come on, get in the car.\"\n\nWang Ke impatiently opened the car door for Zhou Ze, and Zhou Ze got in.\n\nWang Ke and Zhou Ze sat together in the back seat, with the woman driving.\n\nInside the car, for a long time, no one spoke.\n\nThis made the driving woman feel a bit stifled, but she didn't ask anything further.\n\nZhou Ze opened the car window, letting some outside wind in, then said,\n\n\"How did you find out?\"\n\n\"We grew up together, daily habits, detailed actions.\" As he spoke, Wang Ke tapped his own head with a finger. \"Besides, this is my profession.\"\n\nZhou Ze smiled faintly and said nothing more.\n\nWang Ke continued, \"If you help me resolve this, I won't reminisce with you, nor will I contact you again, nor will I bother you again, and I have no other curiosity.\n\nYou can trust me on this, brother.\"\n\n\"Are you still... the old you?\" Zhou Ze retorted.\n\n\"Last time, a man named Xu Le knocked on my door in the middle of the night, saying Zhou Ze introduced him. What did I do?\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\nAfter a while, Zhou Ze added, \"I'm a surgeon.\"\n\nMeaning, there's no use in you calling me here; I'm not a psychologist.\n\nUnless the girl attempted suicide again, he'd have no problem participating in the rescue, but for other matters, he was truly powerless.\n\n\"I've suspected for a long time that it's more than just a multiple personality,\" Wang Ke said, glancing at his wife who was driving, and lowering his voice.\n\n\"Oh?\" Zhou Ze was taken aback,\n\nThen he understood the implication,\n\nWhat's very similar to \"multiple personality disorder\"?\n\nDemonic possession!\n\nNo wonder Wang Ke came to see him last time, saying his second personality could connect with the other party's second personality,\n\nDamn it,\n\nThe implication was:\n\nYou ghosts can communicate with each other!\n\nDamn it!\n\n………………\n\nThis was Tongcheng's most exclusive residential area, nestled at the foot of Lang Mountain. High-end villas dotted the landscape. As the car drove in, the security guards at the gate saluted the people in the car.\n\nThis reminded Zhou Ze of the small community he lived in during his previous life, where the old gatekeeper in the guardhouse would usually skip work and sleep at night.\n\nWang Ke, of course, didn't realize that Zhou Ze was currently suffering from the torment of wealth disparity, and thought Zhou Ze was depressed because he had seen through his identity.\n\nThe car drove up to the villa entrance. A young man, the butler, walked over.\n\n\"Doctor Wang, Mr. Zheng is already angry,\" the butler reminded.\n\n\"Something happened to Miss Zheng again?\" Wang Ke's expression became solemn.\n\n\"Not... that kind of thing...\" The young butler seemed unable to articulate it, finally only saying, \"No life-threatening danger, not suicide this time.\"\n\nWang Ke and Zhou Ze got out of the car and went directly upstairs to the second floor. Wang Ke's wife did not follow.\n\nThere were many rooms on the second floor, all covered with red carpets. The villa was large, but the decoration style didn't appear vulgar or ostentatious, suggesting that the owner was not a parvenu; on the contrary, he should be a person of great taste.\n\nAfter turning a corner, Zhou Ze saw a middle-aged man with half-white hair standing at the door of a bedroom. The man was holding a cigar and looked worried.\n\nWhen he saw Wang Ke and Zhou Ze approaching, a flicker of anger appeared in his eyes, but it vanished quickly, replaced by a genial and helpless smile, and he said,\n\n\"Doctor Wang, Pingping is again...\"\n\n\"What's wrong, Mr. Zheng?\" Wang Ke was also somewhat anxious.\n\nHe was the doctor responsible for Zheng Pingping's treatment. Now that things had turned out this way, he couldn't shirk responsibility, and he clearly knew that the wealthy businessman in front of him must be very dissatisfied with him, but the other party understood that getting angry at this moment was meaningless, so he had been restraining himself.\n\n\"See for yourself.\"\n\nMr. Zheng motioned for the two young men at the door to open the bedroom door. Wang Ke and Zhou Ze walked in.\n\nInside, two nannies were attending to a young girl in a dress with a cloth strip wrapped around her arm, dancing gracefully and singing a \"Child's Play\" opera in a stylized voice.\n\nWang Ke looked bewildered,\n\n\"How could this happen?\"\n\nZhou Ze noticed the girl's wrist was bandaged with gauze, indicating she had recently attempted suicide by slitting her wrists but hadn't succeeded.\n\nAs the girl danced, she seemed to notice the two people who had entered. She immediately raised her voice, flicked the cloth strip, and pointed at Wang Ke, singing:\n\n\"A life of solitude, cursed your parents;\nA lifetime of toil, only to serve others,\nUltimately, destined for separation from wife and children, abandoned by all, in bitter sorrow!\"\n\nThe girl sang, flicking her sleeve and feigning tears, seemingly grieving over it.\n\nWang Ke was a bit lost, not knowing what opera this was.\n\nBut Zhou Ze understood.\n\nThe girl again waved her sleeve at Zhou Ze, singing simultaneously:\n\n\"From a young age, orphaned and destitute, wandering alone;\nSeeking to climb the ladder to the clouds, yet falling to an early death and ruin in the underworld, truly sighing and lamenting...\"\n\nSinging and singing,\n\nAs she \"sighed and lamented,\"\n\nThe girl suddenly stopped short,\n\nLike an old record player that had suddenly jammed,\n\nThen the girl's face showed confusion. She waved her long sleeves again and sang:\n\n\"Born with a good appearance, but with a barbarian mind!\nA man's knees are worth gold, yet you have no part in it!\nUltimately, you'll achieve nothing, having lived on earth in vain...\"\n\nNow,\n\nThe girl jammed again.\n\nThen the girl let out a shriek,\n\nAnd collapsed directly onto the floor, a large wet patch on her pants,\n\nPointing at Zhou Ze, her face filled with fear as she cried out,\n\n\"Ghost... ghost...\n\nA ghost!\"",

    "content": "The girl pointed at Zhou Ze and screamed, but thankfully, she was already deranged and had a split personality, so her so-called \"accusation\" had no effect on Zhou Ze.\n\nNo one would believe what a mentally disturbed person said.\n\nAnd even if a normal person said such things, they would be considered mentally disturbed.\n\nBut the words the girl had sung earlier, in the tune of \"Child's Play,\" might have seemed nonsensical and gossip to others, yet in Zhou Ze's ears, they held an unusual meaning.\n\nShe was singing…\n\n...a judgment!\n\nA \"judgment\" is a poem or verse that summarizes a person's entire life, determining their past and their future.\n\nFor example, in \"Dream of the Red Chamber,\" the line \"Once from two commands, then three persons wood; weeping to Jinling, sorrows more acute\" is the judgment for Wang Xifeng.\n\n\"A solitary fate, cursed her parents;\nA lifetime of toil, just to make wedding clothes;\nFinally ends in spousal separation, children scattered, abandoned by all, in bitter sorrow!\"\n\nThis referred to Wang Ke. Wang Ke, like himself, grew up in an orphanage, implying that Wang Ke had cursed his parents to death. After becoming an adult, he focused on his career and neglected everything else. The last line is easy to understand: spousal separation and children scattered.\n\nZhou Ze felt that Wang Ke might have sensed his wife was having an affair, but he hadn't exposed it. Also, his daughter was chosen by a ghost messenger to become a flesh vessel.\n\nAnd then, the judgment the girl sang about him:\n\n\"Orphaned and helpless from youth, wandering aimlessly;\nAbout to ascend the ladder of success, but cut short and fell into the netherworld, truly lamentable...\"\n\nThis referred to himself: an orphan who, by his own abilities, became a department head before thirty. Just as he was rising rapidly, he suddenly died in a car accident.\n\nAs for \"though born with a good face, inside was but a ruffian,\" this referred to Xu Le being outwardly splendid but inwardly rotten. He looked decent, otherwise, he wouldn't have been chosen by the Lin family parents to be a live-in son-in-law.\n\nHere, \"ruffian\" (草莽) doesn't mean a robber or bandit, but rather that Xu Le, apart from his good looks, was essentially an empty-headed idiot.\n\nThe original line, \"Though born with a good face, inside was but a ruffian,\" is a comment on Jia Baoyu in \"Dream of the Red Chamber.\"\n\nZhou Ze actually thought the judgment's description of Xu Le was very apt. The Lin family was genuinely wealthy. As a live-in son-in-law, it shouldn't have been difficult for Xu Le to start a business or venture, but this fellow, like a dead literati, opened a bookstore that only lost money.\n\nOf course, the girl's final \"skip\" and terror were because she had seen two lives within him.\n\nOne was the physical body,\n\nOne was the soul.\n\nIn an instant,\n\nShe understood that she had seen a ghost.\n\nThis made Zhou Ze smile. In that case, this girl in front of him shouldn't be possessed by a ghost.\n\nHe wouldn't have scared a ghost so badly that it peed itself like his sister-in-law did.\n\nThe two nannies immediately came over, held the girl down, and continuously comforted her.\n\nWang Ke also went over, trying to persuade her verbally.\n\nZhou Ze, meanwhile, surveyed the surroundings. This should be the girl's original boudoir, with a pink theme and a princess bed, very warm and lovely. It was just a pity that its owner was now in a state of madness.\n\nWhat puzzled Zhou Ze was, if this girl wasn't a ghost, then where did her \"Child's Play\" song and such accurate judgments come from?\n\n\"Child's Play\" is a local Tongcheng曲目 (qumu). Nowadays, only some elderly people listen to it; young people might not even have heard of it. Yet, this girl had just sung it very professionally.\n\nCould it be that the fusion of two disordered personalities created a new personality, and this personality possessed such a special ability?\n\nDon't people often say that there's only a fine line between genius and madness?\n\nBut then he thought it seemed wrong again, yet he couldn't pinpoint exactly what was wrong.\n\n\"Where is the master?\"\n\nAt this moment, the girl suddenly spoke calmly. She pushed away the nannies beside her and stood up.\n\n\"Has my master come home?\"\n\nWang Ke froze in place.\n\nZhou Ze also slightly opened his mouth.\n\nDid the role just switch?\n\nHad she turned into the madam personality?\n\n\"A-Qiu, I'm here.\" Mr. Zheng walked over at this moment and then motioned for everyone else to leave. He wanted to comfort his \"wife.\"\n\nWalking onto the balcony, Zhou Ze lit a cigarette.\n\n\"What's going on?\" Wang Ke asked, standing beside Zhou Ze. His hope rested on Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. \"She's not possessed by a ghost.\"\n\n\"Is it really a mental problem?\" Wang Ke pursed his dry lips. He was in a difficult situation now, somewhat caught between a rock and a hard place.\n\nIn fact, if he had initially adhered to his medical principles and provided psychological treatment to the girl, things might not have escalated to this point.\n\nBut it was too late to say anything now.\n\nHowever, this wasn't entirely Wang Ke's fault. To gain the investor's support, he would naturally try to please his investor.\n\nFurthermore, from the way Mr. Zheng immediately entered when he heard his daughter's personality switch to his wife, and from the tone he used when calling \"A-Qiu,\" it was evident that more than half of the problem lay with him.\n\n\"What's this room for?\" Zhou Ze asked, pointing to the room next to the bedroom. It was draped in white gauze, and the French windows were completely covered.\n\nFor some reason, Zhou Ze always felt there was something inside that made him uncomfortable.\n\n\"It's Miss's art studio,\" the young butler at the side said.\n\n\"Oh, can I go in and take a look?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"This...\" The butler seemed hesitant, then looked at Wang Ke.\n\n\"Let him take a look,\" Wang Ke nodded. \"Learning more about Miss's situation will also help with the treatment's progress.\"\n\n\"Alright.\"\n\nThe butler immediately got the key, opened the door, and then stood outside. Zhou Ze and Wang Ke walked in together.\n\n\"You liked to draw when you were little. I remember you once told me you wanted to be a painter,\" Wang Ke said, somewhat nostalgically.\n\n\"The orphanage didn't have the conditions for that back then,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nFor Zhou Ze's situation at the time, learning to paint and pursue art was quite unrealistic. So, after the college entrance examination, he ultimately chose medical university to find a job and support himself.\n\n\"Don't worry, no matter how this turns out, I won't bother you again,\" Wang Ke gave a wry smile. \"Actually, I'm also scared. The last time I came to find you, I was on edge the whole time.\"\n\nYour daughter is a ghost messenger; if you knew that, wouldn't you just faint?\n\nAt this moment, the butler called from the doorway, \"Doctor Wang, Mr. Zheng is looking for you.\"\n\n\"I'll go check, and I'll give you a ride when I leave.\" Wang Ke left the art studio, leaving Zhou Ze alone there.\n\nZhou Ze walked around the art studio by himself, looking at some of the paintings on the floor and walls. He was a bit lost in thought. To be honest, while these paintings clearly showed they were by a young artist, each one seemed to possess a unique spiritual quality, reflecting the artist's inherent talent.\n\nFinally, Zhou Ze stopped in front of an easel covered with a black cloth. Without the slightest mental burden, he directly reached out and lifted the cloth. Immediately, Zhou Ze's pupils contracted sharply.\n\nThe painting on the easel was a skull.\n\nIt didn't look particularly special; after all, such skull paintings could easily be found online.\n\nBut this skull gave Zhou Ze a feeling of his heart skipping a beat, and even his breathing seemed to slow down because of it.\n\nThis was a special feeling, an unusual resonance.\n\nAfter several deep breaths to calm his mind, Zhou Ze was able to examine the painting more closely. He then noticed that the skull in the painting had a three-dimensional quality, especially on the far left, where there was a spatial fold.\n\nThis was like the difference between a flat drawing of a book cover and a three-dimensional drawing of a book cover.\n\nThis was a copied work, because the girl's previous paintings were all in the style of \"petite and charming, flowing household life,\" but this one was completely different from her previous style!\n\nFrom the painting,\n\nShe must have been copying a book, or a small booklet?\n\nAnd the cover of that book or booklet was this skull.\n\nZhou Ze began to search around. The girl must have placed that object in front of her when she painted it, so it was highly likely that the object was in this art studio.\n\nSoon, Zhou Ze discovered a small cabinet in the corner of the art studio. It wasn't locked. Zhou Ze opened the cabinet, which contained some illustration booklets and art books. After flipping through them continuously, Zhou Ze finally found what he was looking for: a booklet no bigger than the palm of his hand, looking somewhat like a driver's license.\n\nHe took it out and placed it in front of him. The front cover was that skull, identical to the one in the painting.\n\nThat's right, what the girl copied was this thing.\n\nZhou Ze instinctively opened the booklet, but the moment it was opened,\n\nThe girl, who had just fallen asleep in the adjacent bedroom, suddenly opened her eyes, a crimson gleam appearing within them. Then she jumped directly off the bed. If not for the quick reflexes of the nannies who held her, she might have rushed out of the bedroom.\n\n\"Wuwuwu... Wuwuwu...\"\n\nThe girl struggled desperately, her nails carving many bloody lines across the nannies' faces.\n\n\"What now!\"\n\nMr. Zheng rushed back into the bedroom again, looking at his daughter in such a state, feeling immense pain.\n\nMeanwhile, on the other side of the wall, Zhou Ze remained motionless, still holding the booklet open.\n\nHowever, in Zhou Ze's mind, countless men, women, old and young, appeared in an instant. They appeared very quickly and disappeared just as quickly, but each time one appeared, a few lines of black brushstrokes would simultaneously appear beside them, bearing their judgment.\n\nFor a moment, the terrifying amount of information made Zhou Ze's head spin.\n\n\"Hiss...\"\n\nSuddenly, Zhou Ze tilted his head back, drew a sharp breath, and closed the booklet.\n\nThis wasn't an ordinary skull-themed booklet.\n\nIt contained records of countless departed souls and the annotations of their lives.\n\nThis was also something Zhou Ze had never seen before.\n\nAt this moment, Zhou Ze noticed a burnt mark in the center of the skull on the booklet's cover.\n\nZhou Ze instinctively touched the mark with his fingernail.\n\nAnd at that very moment, Zhou Ze's black fingernail seemed to grow uncontrollably. The black aura on his nail swirled into the booklet, and the entire booklet began to feel incredibly hot, yet he couldn't drop it. It felt as if it were branded into Zhou Ze's flesh.\n\nMeanwhile, the girl in the next room, who had been struggling wildly, suddenly quieted down, as if she had finally found release, and fell directly into a deep sleep.\n\nThe painful sensation didn't last long, but it was enough to make Zhou Ze sweat profusely, as if he had just endured the punishment of branding!\n\n\"Thud...\"\n\nThe booklet dropped from Zhou Ze's hand.\n\nZhou Ze hung his head, sweat dripping continuously.\n\nBut he saw that on the back of the booklet, which had only been a black cover, two clear lines of blood characters had appeared:\n\n\"The Underworld has order,\nThe Yellow Springs can be crossed.\"",

    "content": "Pick up this booklet. This time, Zhou Ze didn't feel it hot to the touch; instead, he felt a warm, cool sensation, as if he were holding a piece of ancient jade.\n\nA very strange connection seemed to have formed between himself and the booklet.\n\nZhou Ze had read some wuxia novels before, but the feeling at this moment wasn't like a magical artifact recognizing its owner in those stories.\n\nThe booklet was still a booklet,\n\nHe was still him,\n\nBut inexplicably, Zhou Ze felt a sense of intimacy with this item from the bottom of his heart, like a thirty-year-old man holding a photo of himself taken when he was three or five.\n\nStrange, yet incredibly familiar.\n\nOpening the first page of the booklet, that vast imagery swept over him again. Zhou Ze closed his eyes, and then all those chaotic things disappeared.\n\nLast time, he had been passively infused.\n\nThis time, he seemed able to control the intake.\n\nFinally, the first page was opened. On it was a handprint. Zhou Ze wasn't sure if it was his or someone else's. There was no way to do a detailed fingerprint comparison now, but in fact, this handprint was very strange. Zhou Ze even felt that no one in the world should have such a handprint.\n\nThe lines of the handprint were very harmonious, so harmonious that you couldn't find the slightest flaw, and incredibly neat, every detail achieving a very comfortable feeling.\n\nBelow it were two columns.\n\nFirst column: Name: Zhou Ze.\n\nSecond column: Position: Temporary Ghost Catcher.\n\nActually, Zhou Ze had already had a thought before, that this should be the so-called ghost catcher's ID, or more precisely, the Underworld's ID. After all, the Underworld was also a small society, small but complete, and ghost catchers were just one of its positions.\n\nZhou Ze and Xu Qinglang had discussed his current situation before, and one clear point was that his temporary worker status was very delicate, liable to be made a scapegoat at any time, and without any security or status guarantees.\n\nWhen the little loli returned last time, she directly admitted this when he questioned her.\n\nAt the same time, she casually drew him a big pie, not caring at all whether he wanted to eat it or not.\n\nThe reason for all this was that he lacked this ID!\n\nWith this ID in hand, he wouldn't be an unregistered person.\n\nMost importantly, this ID meant he had gained access to a \"performance review\" system, much like the establishment and development of the imperial examination system in ancient times, which opened up channels for the lower class to move upward.\n\nIn the past few months of running the bookstore, Zhou Ze had been very lax. It wasn't that Zhou Ze was naturally like that, but his previous awkward status meant that doing more was prone to more mistakes, and not doing anything wasn't a big deal.\n\nIt was similar to the mentality of those money-losing state-owned enterprises a decade or two ago.\n\nNow, he could at least set a small goal for himself.\n\nOne hundred million was out of the question,\n\nBut there was hope that he could raise his rank through his own efforts.\n\nSimilar to Madam Bai, a female ghost who protected her hometown folks for two hundred years in the human world and managed to cultivate merit to seek a position in Hell, Zhou Ze's starting point was actually much better than Madam Bai's.\n\nHowever, what made Zhou Ze uncomfortable was why his current position was still only \"Temporary Ghost Catcher\"?\n\nZhou Ze knew that this absolutely wasn't something granted by Heaven out of appreciation for his \"diligence,\" \"devotion to duty,\" \"exhaustion of efforts,\" or \"until death\"\n\n*Biu*\n\n—a certificate suddenly delivered.\n\nZhou Ze also knew that with his previous work attitude of \"three days fishing, two days sunbathing,\" drinking tea and reading novels in the bookstore every day, and sleeping with Bai Yingying at night,\n\nIt was already incredibly merciful of Heaven not to strike him down with a bolt of lightning and turn him, a malevolent spirit, into dust. How could it reward him at this time?\n\nThis was someone else's Underworld ID,\n\nBut he happened to pick it up.\n\nNo, to be precise, Zheng Pingping picked it up, but Zheng Pingping was a living person, an ordinary person. She couldn't control this item at all, and instead suffered its influence, having her mind confused by it.\n\nCoupled with the stimulus of her mother's recent death, this led to Zheng Pingping's behavior becoming abnormal.\n\nShe blurred who she was, because this booklet recorded the verdicts of countless past lives, which was like instantly reading the lives of thousands of people.\n\n\"Zhuang Zhou dreams of being a butterfly,\" or \"returning to the village only to find the axe handle rotted,\" basically described this situation.\n\nLost in oneself, oblivious to all changes around, you were originally a grain of sand, but then a great river washed over you. Forget about others, could you even find yourself?\n\nHowever, since he had \"stolen\" this item now, it should also mean that Zheng Pingping's connection with this ID had been severed, and her psychological illness should recover quickly.\n\nHowever, the key problem was that Zhou Ze didn't think the previous owner of this item was also a \"Temporary Ghost Catcher.\"\n\nCould a temporary ghost catcher's performance record be so exaggerated?\n\nThen were all the people in Hell model workers and pioneers of the era?\n\nWere they all workaholics?\n\nLooking at the little loli's lazy demeanor, she was actually quite similar to him. Otherwise, she wouldn't have left the performance for him to do while she went out to earn extra money.\n\nUpon closer inspection, Zhou Ze found a faint white smudge over his name and the original position of \"Temporary Ghost Catcher,\" somewhat like correction fluid.\n\nZhou Ze reached out and rubbed it, even scraping it with his fingernail, but nothing came off. The white smudge remained.\n\nThis gave Zhou Ze a bit of OCD. The truth was beneath the white smudge.\n\nOriginally, this should have been where the original owner's information was written. It was just that the original owner had likely kicked the bucket, and he had inherited this ID, with the official rank and other information on the ID consequently being \"refreshed.\"\n\nZhou Ze even thought about asking Bai Yingying to try Tide laundry detergent back at the bookstore to see if it could rub off.\n\nThe booklet had several pages. When Zhou Ze turned to the second page, he saw a very simple line of text:\n\n\"Eight percent\"\n\n\"Is this an experience bar?\" Zhou Ze instinctively rubbed his nose.\n\nActually, ancient China already had a way of expressing \"fractions.\" Of course, it wasn't with the Arabic numerals, numerator, denominator, and a horizontal line that people use today, but directly with this method of description.\n\nThe \"Records of the Grand Historian: Book of Celestial Officials\" has writings like \"...two thirds...\" and \"...eight ninths...\" \"Two thirds\" meant \"two out of three,\" and \"eight ninths\" meant \"eight out of nine.\"\n\nHere, \"eight percent\" meant eight out of one hundred.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head, feeling a little ashamed. He had previously felt that the little loli's anger at his laziness and passive work was trivial, that she was making a fuss.\n\nBut now, it seemed that in the past two months, he had only completed eight percent of the temporary ghost catcher's tasks.\n\nHe was indeed quite lazy.\n\nAt the same time, Zhou Ze wondered if this meant that if he completed the remaining ninety-two percent, making it a hundred percent, his \"Temporary Ghost Catcher\" status could become permanent?\n\nFrom a contract worker to someone with a permanent position?\n\nZhou Ze hadn't paid much attention to this before. He even looked down on those who wholeheartedly sought to enter the system in his previous life. Some of his classmates spent hundreds of thousands to get in, and then earned two to three thousand a month, yet still felt superior and complacent, believing that other classmates who were still striving for careers outside or working hard in Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou were just laborers.\n\nBut now, Zhou Ze had a profound and urgent desire to remove the word \"temporary\" and enter the Underworld system!\n\nThis meant a sense of security, meaning he could sleep soundly tonight without worrying about not seeing tomorrow's sun.\n\nPerhaps, his former classmates who were like that were also seeking this sense of security. After all, among all professions, nothing was more stable than an iron rice bowl.\n\nZhou Ze wanted to turn to the next page, but found that the following pages were stuck together, no matter how he tried to separate them.\n\nPerhaps,\n\nBecause of his current rank, he was simply not qualified to view the information on the later pages?\n\nPutting away the ID, Zhou Ze stretched.\n\nWang Ke was still in the adjacent bedroom. Zheng Pingping had already woken up and was slowly regaining consciousness. Wang Ke was very excited and thrilled. As a seasoned psychologist, he could keenly detect that Zheng Pingping's condition was rapidly improving!\n\nHe didn't know what caused it, but he instinctively made \"diligent efforts.\"\n\nZhou Ze walked out of the studio, lit another cigarette, and thought about how he would strive harder after returning to the bookstore. In the future, when he had nothing to do, he would set up a stall with incense and candles and some cold food outside the bookstore to attract ghosts.\n\nThen, regardless of anything, he would send them all to Hell for reincarnation.\n\nFor example, the mother who wanted to stay with her son until he finished his college entrance exams before going to Hell last time—Zhou Ze wouldn't just wave her away next time he encountered her.\n\nYou could say this might be a bit heartless, but the primitive accumulation of capital was inherently bloody.\n\nTo become a permanent employee as soon as possible,\n\nZhou Ze would truly do whatever he wanted.\n\nJust then, Zhou Ze saw Wang Ke's wife and the young butler standing at the staircase entrance, seemingly talking about something. Zhou Ze didn't get too close, but he caught words like \"when to get her hair done again.\"\n\nAnd frankly, looking at Wang Ke's wife's slightly shy, yet feigned calm expression, everything was self-evident.\n\nModern butlers were different from before. This was a new profession, and the income was quite high. Generally, only high-end residential areas like this would have modern butler service, considered high-level service personnel, whose prestige was no less than that of \"flight attendants\" in people's eyes a decade ago.\n\nOf course, Zhou Ze wouldn't run over and shout, condemning \"adulterers.\" Wang Ke probably guessed something, but since he, the party involved, deliberately didn't expose it, Zhou Ze, an outsider, had no reason to help.\n\nHowever, as a childhood friend, Zhou Ze would naturally feel uncomfortable if Wang Ke was cheated on.\n\nMr. Zheng was standing on the balcony, smoking a cigar. His expression was slightly relaxed because Wang Ke had just told him that his daughter's condition had greatly improved.\n\n\"Mr. Xu, where do you work?\" Mr. Zheng finally had the mind to chat with Zhou Ze.\n\n\"I run a bookshop.\"\n\nZhou Ze replied.\n\nThere was no other way. Faced with such a wealthy businessman, he could only pretend to be refined.\n\n\"Oh, very good, very good. I'll visit if I get the chance,\" Mr. Zheng said politely.\n\nZhou Ze then took the opportunity to ask, \"Did Miss Zheng just lose control of her bladder and bowels? I'm not very talented, but I'm skilled in some formulas for regulating mind and body and strengthening foundations.\"\n\nMr. Zheng's face suddenly darkened upon hearing this. As a wealthy businessman, he certainly wouldn't lack good traditional Chinese doctors. He was angry that Zhou Ze dared to say his daughter had lost control of her bladder and bowels right in front of him!\n\nShe had clearly only wet herself once,\n\nAnd there was no poop!\n\n\"Thank you for your kindness, sir. My daughter is just a bit mentally fatigued; there's nothing wrong with her body.\"\n\nOne doesn't hit a smiling person. Since Zhou Ze offered to help with a formula, Mr. Zheng naturally couldn't get angry at Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze's face showed a very obvious look of surprise, saying:\n\n\"She didn't? But the butler was just talking to someone about it, saying Miss's crotch was full of...\"\n\nAt this point,\n\nZhou Ze realized that saying this seemed impolite and inappropriate, so he immediately chuckled, saying:\n\n\"It's good that Miss is fine, it's good that she's fine.\"",

    "content": "Mr. Zheng kept the two for dinner, but Zhou Ze refused, and Wang Ke also refused, both acting as if they were deep in功与名 [1] . Zhou Ze didn’t expose him; he knew his childhood friend needed this favor from the investor, so he let it be.\n\nOn the way back, Zhou Ze didn't see the young butler. However, Zhou Ze knew that after he \"accidentally\" let something slip, Mr. Zheng had given a few words to his two followers, and then the butler disappeared.\n\nIt was still Wang Ke’s wife driving, looking a bit distracted, checking her phone occasionally.\n\nWang Ke himself was immersed in the emotional aftershocks of \"surviving a disaster.\" With Miss Zheng’s condition rapidly improving, his pressure had eased.\n\nZhou Ze didn’t tell Wang Ke about the butler or how he had deliberately badmouthed him in front of Mr. Zheng. It was just a casual act of boredom, and he wouldn’t seek any credit for it.\n\nThe crucial issue was that Zhou Ze didn't know which way Wang Ke's emotional inclinations leaned. Although they were childhood friends, many years had passed, and everyone had their own experiences and, naturally, their own changes.\n\nWhat if he told him, and Wang Ke thought:\n\n\"I treat you like a brother, but you want to take off the green hat [2] from my head!\"\n\nDamn it,\n\nPresumptuous,\n\nUnbearable!\n\nWhat then?\n\nLooking at Wang Ke's wife, who was driving, also his sister-in-law, Zhou Ze slightly pursed his lips.\n\nIndeed,\n\nA wife's heart is like a knife.\n\nHis phone rang, and Zhou Ze answered. It was his sister-in-law.\n\n\"Hello.\"\n\n\"Hello, Xu Le, my sister has started work,\" his sister-in-law said.\n\n\"Oh,\" Zhou Ze responded unhurriedly.\n\n\"She hasn't been feeling well recently. Go see her and make sure she doesn't overwork herself,\" his sister-in-law added.\n\n\"Oh.\"\n\n\"I say, what's wrong with you? I, the esteemed miss, am giving you a heads-up, and you don't even thank me, let alone show any excitement.\n\nOh, oh, oh, 'oh' your head!\n\nI'm telling you, you still haven't explained that Maserati thing!\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. His sister-in-law was truly trying to help him. The reason was simple: recently, when she went out to have fun, her excuses and reasons were always that she was studying at his bookstore.\n\nHer elder sister was busy with work and had no time, and her brother-in-law, though a good-for-nothing, was at least a university student and could still help with her studies.\n\nA very good reason, and a very good excuse.\n\nEven the Lin family parents, who usually couldn't stand Xu Le, tacitly approved of their youngest daughter going to the bookstore for tutoring.\n\nSometimes Zhou Ze couldn't help but want to go back to the Lin family and point at the Lin family parents' noses, telling them that not to mention a university graduate,\n\nEven if you ask second or third-year university students to tutor high school students, how many do you think can actually do it?\n\nBut his sister-in-law still had some conscience. This silly girl, judging from recent events, was not bad, aside from being a bit foolish.\n\nSee, she even specifically gave him a heads-up.\n\n\"Alright, thank you,\" Zhou Ze said perfunctorily.\n\n\"Hmph, oh, I'm coming to your place to read tonight too,\" his sister-in-law added.\n\nAfter hanging up the phone, Zhou Ze stretched, only to unexpectedly find that the car was just passing the West Gate of People's Hospital.\n\nWhat a coincidence,\n\nHe hadn't planned on going.\n\nOf course, Zhou Ze didn't ask Wang Ke's wife to stop the car. He just pretended he hadn't seen it and wouldn't go out of his way to make it a coincidence.\n\nDr. Lin had started work, which meant she had gotten through some of it. But Zhou Ze had just received his certificate and was preparing to make a big push to get promoted quickly, so he didn't have the energy to think about anything else for the time being.\n\nHowever, Wang Ke's wife voluntarily turned the car into the hospital.\n\n\"My father-in-law was recently hospitalized. I'm just stopping by to see him. We'll be quick,\" Wang Ke said apologetically to Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Never mind, I'll go first.\"\n\nZhou Ze pushed open the car door and got out.\n\nWang Ke also got out, and Wang Ke's wife drove the car into the hospital's underground parking lot.\n\n\"Are you taking a taxi back yourself?\" Wang Ke asked.\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"Alright, brother, take care.\" Wang Ke reached out and patted Zhou Ze on the shoulder. \"I won't actively seek you out again, but if you need anything, you can come to me.\"\n\n\"You're too kind,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nAfter Wang Ke finished speaking, he looked at Zhou Ze earnestly twice more, then turned and walked towards the inpatient building.\n\nZhou Ze silently lit a cigarette. People do change, indeed.\n\nWang Ke was a few years older than him and had graduated and entered society earlier. His former \"Brother Wang,\" \"Brother Erdan,\" now seemed a bit unfamiliar to Zhou Ze.\n\nAt wit's end, not hesitating to consult ghosts and gods,\n\nSigh.\n\nZhou Ze exhaled a smoke ring, thought for a moment, and then still walked into the emergency building ahead.\n\nHe could have chosen not to come if he hadn't received his sister-in-law's heads-up.\n\nHe could have pretended not to see the hospital when the car passed by.\n\nBut now that he was already at the hospital, it would be a bit unreasonable not to go see his wife.\n\nBefore, he had an obsession: she wouldn't sleep with him.\n\nDidn't that obsession disappear now?\n\nNo, it seemed that after that obsession was gone, some strange new problem appeared.\n\n\"You can't get it up again, what's the point of thinking so much, get lost!\"\n\nA woman's icy voice came from behind Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze took a deep breath, turned around, his fingernails feeling an urge to grow out.\n\n\"Hey, wife, didn't the doctor say I'm fine? Maybe it's because you're not sexy enough, and not active enough in bed, you're not getting my G-spot.\"\n\n\"Get lost, I'm not willing to serve you. You can't handle things in bed yourself and you want my help? Are you even a man?\"\n\nThe woman and man had probably just come out of the urology department and were arguing.\n\nZhou Ze's expression was a bit bitter.\n\nAt this moment,\n\nIt was as if that diligent crow had reappeared, flying overhead,\n\nEmitting \"caw... caw... caw...\" sounds.\n\nOn the ground, a fallen leaf also appeared, blown by the wind, flipping over Zhou Ze's feet.\n\nZhou Ze didn't want to go to the emergency building anymore.\n\nHe felt that he should give Dr. Lin more time to think, accept, and adapt, and shouldn't stimulate her at this moment.\n\nYes,\n\nHe should think more for her, give her some time and space; he shouldn't pressure her.\n\nZhou Ze nodded, feeling he had convinced himself, and prepared to leave.\n\nBut just then, an ambulance drove into the hospital, and Zhou Ze saw several doctors and nurses running out of the emergency building, among them a familiar figure.\n\nDr. Lin also saw Zhou Ze and froze for a moment. Zhou Ze gave her a slight smile, walked over, and said gently:\n\n\"I was just about to come up and see you.\"\n\nDr. Lin suddenly clutched her lower abdomen and sat down on the steps.\n\n\"What's wrong? Are you uncomfortable?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nDr. Lin shook her head and said, \"It's nothing.\"\n\n\"What exactly is wrong with your body?\" Zhou Ze asked carefully. He remembered his sister-in-law telling him that Dr. Lin hadn't been feeling well these past few days.\n\n\"Woman's stuff,\" Dr. Lin said, lowering her head.\n\nThe ice queen, at this moment, also showed a hint of shyness.\n\nHer period?\n\nZhou Ze felt a surge of speechlessness. Perhaps, for a silly girl like his sister-in-law, menstruation was the most painful thing.\n\n\"Dr. Lin, the patient's condition is a bit serious. She's a pregnant woman.\"\n\nA young male doctor hurried over, pushing a stretcher. He seemed a bit nervous, and then when he looked at Zhou Ze, his expression changed, and he immediately said:\n\n\"You're here too?\"\n\nThe last time Zhou Ze entered the hospital for a rescue operation and confessed to Dr. Lin, this was the intern who had been at a loss that day.\n\n\"Go in first, I'll take a look.\"\n\nDr. Lin forced herself to stand up, preparing to check the patient's condition.\n\nZhou Ze could only follow her inside.\n\nOnce inside the emergency building, the young girl accompanying the pregnant woman kept asking the male intern questions. The intern seemed overwhelmed and very flustered.\n\n\"Can you even treat people? Hurry up! Don't you see how much my sister is hurting? What about the baby? My brother is thirty, and it's so hard for him to finally have this child, do you know how hard it is?!\"\n\n\"I... you wait... let me check again...\" The male intern started to get nervous, even dropping his notepad.\n\n\"What 'you this,' 'you that'? Hey, don't you have any other doctors here? You can't just disregard human life like this!\" the young woman continued to shout.\n\n\"I'll go take a look.\" Dr. Lin, who was behind, quickened her steps to check the situation, but after a few steps, she winced in pain again.\n\n\"Your problem is a bit serious,\" Zhou Ze said. \"Irregular diet recently has made your body worse.\"\n\nDr. Lin said nothing but still walked towards the patient.\n\n\"Never mind, I'll take a look.\" Zhou Ze reached out and patted Dr. Lin on the waist.\n\n\"You...\" Dr. Lin felt this was a bit inappropriate.\n\n\"You don't trust my medical skills?\" Zhou Ze smiled. \"You were trained by me.\"\n\nIt's just that back then, I didn't realize you could become so beautiful. My blindness was my fault.\n\nZhou Ze actively walked to the patient, preparing to examine her.\n\nThe young woman immediately shouted, \"Who are you?! Hey, what are you doing?!\"\n\nZhou Ze was not wearing a white coat.\n\n\"Doctor, please take a look.\" The intern seemed to have found a savior.\n\nZhou Ze glanced at the young woman and said, \"I'm off duty. If you don't want me to check, I'll go home.\"\n\nThe young woman immediately smiled apologetically and said, \"I'm sorry, I was wrong. Please, quickly check my sister. She's not due yet.\"\n\nZhou Ze took a pair of gloves from the intern, then examined the patient and asked:\n\n\"How far along are you?\"\n\n\"28 weeks,\" the young girl answered for her sister.\n\nThe intern looked at Zhou Ze, assisting him.\n\n\"Premature rupture of membranes, fully dilated cervix, severe amniotic fluid pollution,\" Zhou Ze said as he took off his gloves.\n\n\"This... this is going to... going to...\" The young girl was immediately frightened.\n\n\"Premature birth,\" Zhou Ze uttered these two words, then told the intern, \"Notify obstetrics and gynecology to prepare for surgery.\"\n\n\"Okay.\" The intern immediately pulled out his phone and made a call.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head somewhat helplessly. This guy was lucky he wasn't assigned to him for his internship, otherwise, given his old temper with Dr. Lin, he might have verbally abused this guy into changing professions. He was really too stupid.\n\n\"Premature birth?\" The young girl was immediately stunned upon hearing this, then grabbed Zhou Ze's arm and said, \"Doctor, please save my sister, save the baby in her belly. It's not easy for my brother to have this child, it's really not easy.\"\n\nZhou Ze was unmoved. As a doctor, he had seen too many such cases. If he cried every time, doctors would probably become dried husks of people.\n\n\"Then go ask your brother what happened. It's hard enough to have a child, how did it get to this point?\"\n\n\"Doctor, what exactly happened?\" The young woman was a bit confused.\n\n\"This is caused by unhygienic and overly vigorous sexual activity during pregnancy, with a large amount of internal ejaculation.\"\n\nZhou Ze looked at the woman on the bed and asked:\n\n\"When a man gets carried away, he's like an animal, but couldn't you have persuaded him for the sake of the child in your belly?\"\n\nShe was almost 30 weeks pregnant, and they couldn't endure even this much?\n\nThe pregnant woman on the bed didn't speak, seeming very nervous and scared.\n\nBut the young girl who accompanied her immediately exploded, shouting:\n\n\"That's impossible! My brother went to Beijing to work for the baby's milk money before the New Year. He hasn't been back for half a year!\"\n\n\"I fell in love with a wild horse, but my home has no grassland...\"\n\nThe male intern's phone rang. He immediately answered and then told Zhou Ze:\n\n\"Obstetrics and gynecology said the operating room is ready.\"\n\n***\n[1] 功与名 (gōng yǔ míng): \"功\" (gōng) refers to merit or achievement, while \"名\" (míng) refers to fame or reputation.

    "content": "\"Sent to Obstetrics and Gynecology.\"\n\nZhou Ze sat down beside Doctor Lin, looking at her still somewhat distressed face, and said, \"You should rest more, otherwise you're being irresponsible.\"\n\n\"I can manage,\" Doctor Lin shook her head, still a bit stubborn.\n\n\"What I mean is, with your current physical condition, you're being irresponsible to your patients.\"\n\n\"............\" Doctor Lin.\n\n\"Hehe,\" Zhou Ze licked his lips and apologized, \"Sorry, I unconsciously reverted to my old self.\"\n\n\"It's fine,\" Doctor Lin said softly.\n\n\"Go back and rest. Come back to work when your body is well. A doctor's job is indeed important, but it's not like society will stop functioning if one doctor is temporarily absent.\"\n\nDoctor Lin nodded.\n\nJust then, Zhou Ze's phone rang. He checked the caller ID; it was Xu Qinglang.\n\nHe stood up and went to the hallway outside to answer the call. \"Hello, what's up?\"\n\n\"Your shop's doing good business today, come back and take a look,\" Xu Qinglang said with a yawn.\n\n\"Good business?\" Zhou Ze was quite happy. He had just gotten his license, and business was already coming to him?\n\n\"Okay, I'll be right back.\"\n\nZhou Ze decided that this time, no matter how many stories of \"Dou E's injustice\" the departed souls in the bookstore told, he would ruthlessly send them to hell.\n\nThey were departed souls;\nsending them to hell was the proper course, and being iron-fisted about it, he felt no psychological burden.\n\n\"You can go back if you have something to do,\" Doctor Lin pointed to her office. \"I'll go back by myself later.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded and said no more. Nothing was more important now than him getting officially employed as soon as possible. As for his relationship with Doctor Lin, they could take it slow.\n\nThe elevator in the emergency building was still packed, even at night. Zhou Ze simply chose to take the stairs down. When he reached the third floor, Zhou Ze suddenly stopped.\n\nFor some reason, he felt as if someone was following him.\n\nCould it be that Doctor Lin wanted to look at him a few more times but was too embarrassed, so she was secretly following him?\n\nAlright, while there was such a possibility, Zhou Ze wasn't so narcissistic as to immediately believe it. He quickly walked down another floor, then abruptly turned back at the corner.\n\n\"Whoosh............\"\n\nA gust of wind swept down from above.\n\nZhou Ze suddenly looked up and started running upstairs, but still found nothing.\n\nFinding nothing meant there was definitely something strange.\n\nZhou Ze bent down, his black fingernail extending, and lightly tapped the tile floor.\n\nThe next moment, a black footprint appeared on the tile floor. Zhou Ze silently clenched his index finger into a fist and hid it, then slowly stood up and followed the direction of the constantly appearing black footprints below.\n\nFrom his fingernail, an invisible mist continuously emanated, tracking the imprints below.\n\nBecause of its unique nature, hospitals are rarely absolutely clean, but it wasn't late at night yet, and for something unclean to be walking around so openly was very abnormal.\n\nFollowing the imprints, Zhou Ze arrived at the fourth floor. The footprints led out and then turned into a patient room.\n\nThere were patients in the room. Given the current extreme shortage of medical resources, an empty patient room was a rare sight. For instance, right now, some patients could only temporarily rest or receive IV drips on makeshift beds in the hallway.\n\nZhou Ze pushed open the patient room door.\n\nInside, there were three beds.\n\nTwo elderly women lay on the beds on either side, and a young woman lay in the middle. Next to each bed was a caregiver.\n\nWhen Zhou Ze walked in, everyone in the room except one sleeping old woman looked at him.\n\n\"Hello, excuse me, did anyone come in just now?\"\n\nZhou Ze asked directly.\n\n\"No,\" a caregiver auntie replied.\n\nThe others all shook their heads.\n\nZhou Ze nodded, indicating he understood, then turned and left the room.\n\nAt this point, Zhou Ze intended to leave.\n\nYou couldn't blame Zhou Ze for being insensitive and not catching a ghost when he encountered one. Xu Qinglang had just called and said his shop was \"doing good business,\" and Zhou Ze worried that if he returned late, all the customers would be gone, resulting in a big loss.\n\nAs for the unclean thing running outside, if he encountered it and could deal with it, he would. But if it was troublesome or wanted to play hide-and-seek, Zhou Ze really wasn't willing to spend too much energy on it.\n\nHe was a ghost messenger, with the prefix \"temporary\" before it, not a Taoist master.\n\nHowever, as Zhou Ze grabbed the doorknob to close the door, his fingernail accidentally brushed against it.\n\nIn an instant, Zhou Ze felt a sensation like static electricity. Immediately after, the lights in the room went out, then came back on.\n\nThe three beds in the room instantly emptied, and the patients along with their caregivers disappeared.\n\nZhou Ze abruptly took two steps back. Only then did he see that the sign on the door of the room he was facing said \"Storage Room.\" This wasn't a patient room!\n\n\"Whoosh............\"\n\nAnother gust of wind blew, very fast, as if realizing its illusion had failed and intending to flee in a panic.\n\nZhou Ze reached out and grabbed something cold and fleshy, but then there was a crisp snap, and the thing slipped from his grasp.\n\nThe wind dispersed.\n\nZhou Ze looked at his palm. There was a clump of black hair, very long and curly, like the hair from another dense area he saw every day when he showered, besides the hair on his head.\n\nSeemingly out of professional habit, Zhou Ze brought his hand to his nose and sniffed.\n\nA strong, fishy, oceanic smell came over,\nabsolutely nauseating,\nlike a salted fish left in a stuffy warehouse for a month.\n\n\"Hiss...\"\n\nZhou Ze suppressed the urge to gag, then squatted down again, tapping the tile with his fingernail. Another clear string of black footprints appeared.\n\nHe clapped his hands, twisted his neck, and then followed the footprints again.\n\nThe nature of the situation had changed again. If the other party was merely like the old woman lingering in the morgue of the affiliated hospital due to inheritance issues, Zhou Ze wouldn't have pursued relentlessly. After all, there were too many such spirits clinging to the human world due to past attachments, and they generally didn't have the intention to do evil or the ability to cause destruction.\n\nBut the one he had just encountered actively followed him, was able to create an extremely realistic illusion that almost fooled him, and judging by the body hair he pulled from it, the thing had a physical form.\n\nThis meant that the other party already possessed the ability to cause trouble, and it was in the hospital where his wife worked. Zhou Ze now found it difficult to convince himself to stand by idly.\n\nUltimately,\nhe was just being nosy!\nZhou Ze had read many novels in the bookstore in recent months, and he most disliked protagonists who were \"holy mothers,\" feeling no connection to them at all. But when it came to himself, he found he still couldn't completely let go.\n\nOf course, there was another extremely important reason: he had just become a ghost messenger. According to the information he gathered from his conversations with the little loli, if something unclean caused trouble in a ghost messenger's territory, that ghost messenger would also suffer repercussions.\n\nThe footprints went upstairs. Zhou Ze followed them all the way to the eighth floor, which was the operating room floor. After going up the stairs, Zhou Ze found his target without much effort.\n\nA figure in a white lab coat was leaning against the wall of the operating room, pressing its ear to the wall while moving one hand below, doing something many otaku do at home.\n\nWhen Zhou Ze approached, the figure didn't turn around, but Zhou Ze saw its body tremble slightly, speeding up the friction in its hand. It seemed Zhou Ze's arrival increased some kind of pleasure for it.\n\n\"You are a ghost messenger. I don't wish to offend you, but why do you pursue me relentlessly? We can perfectly well mind our own business.\"\n\nThe other party's voice was hoarse, like an old man speaking, but the tone was strange, often pronouncing several syllables very quickly.\n\n\"What are you doing?\" Zhou Ze pointed at it.\n\n\"I'm waiting for my woman to come out,\" the other party replied. \"My lord, please go back. It's not good for either of us to fall out. I can assure you, I will not do anything heinous, nor will I make things difficult for you.\"\n\n\"Heaven is above, and I dare not act recklessly.\"\n\n\"Your woman? Who are you waiting for?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nCould it be another tale of human-ghost love?\n\nBut just then, across the corridor from the operating room, the young girl who had accompanied his sister-in-law earlier ran out with various tickets and receipts. She was probably going to pay the fees.\n\nInside,\nlay the pregnant woman who was about to miscarry!\n\n\"You're not her husband,\" Zhou Ze rebuked.\n\n\"A woman I fancy is my woman. Moreover, she and I have a fateful connection to continue. Even Heaven has silently approved this,\" the other party's tone was very impatient.\n\nZhou Ze was the one who first examined the pregnant woman. He had initially thought he had stumbled upon another cheating incident. He had even lamented that he himself had encountered similar problems,\nhis best friend was already experiencing such a problem,\nand now even when he entered a hospital to see a patient, he encountered such a problem.\nHe seemed to encounter such \"green-colored\" situations wherever he went lately,\nhe even had the urge to rename his bookstore \"Green Bookstore,\"\nto echo the nation's call for environmental protection.\n\nHowever, fortunately, this time it was no longer just a simple dramatic \"green-colored\" situation, but it seemed more troublesome than just that.\n\n\"One corpse, two lives,\" Zhou Ze reminded, taking two steps forward at the same time. \"If her surgery isn't successful now, it'll be one corpse, two lives. And you still say you're not doing anything heinous.\"\n\n\"You, a mere ghost messenger, have you grown brazen!\"\n\nThe other party seemed unable to contain its anger.\n\nIt suddenly turned around.\n\nIt was wearing a doctor's white coat. Its back previously revealed nothing, but when it turned to face him, its terrifying and ferocious image immediately became clear.\n\nThis was a monkey,\na monkey capable of standing in human form.\nMost of its body was incredibly rotten, and even its skull was missing, empty inside. But its lower part, like a bullwhip, swung back and forth, appearing quite disgusting.\n\n\"You are nothing but a petty ghost messenger at the lowest level of the underworld, do not push your luck!\"\n\n\"And what are you, exactly?\" Zhou Ze retorted, then took a few more steps forward.\n\n\"Squeak, squeak, squeak!\"\n\nThe monkey bared its teeth and growled. Then, its black tail behind it suddenly stood erect and plunged violently into the tiles.\n\nThe next moment,\naround where Zhou Ze stood, on the ceiling, tiles, and walls, black holes appeared,\nand from these small holes, long tails emerged, swarming towards Zhou Ze.\n\nThese tails carried an extremely foul, fishy smell, and sticky liquid dripped from them. For Zhou Ze, who always had a cleanliness fetish, he now felt as if he were standing in the most pungent area of a seafood market.\n\nMost importantly,\nthis scene,\nhe had seen it many times in movies before.\n\nImmediately,\nZhou Ze spread his hands, his black fingernails fully grown. In the depths of his eyes, a black halo also circulated.\n\nTo be honest, besides the time he hit Bai Yingying, he had never truly been in a proper fight.\n\nTo Zhou Ze's surprise,\nthe booklet in his pocket began to feel slightly warm at this moment, as if it, too, was somewhat eager.\n\nA little excited,\nand a little expectant,\nhe had just gotten his license, like someone who had just obtained a driver's license always wanted to try driving.\nZhou Ze really wanted to fight.\n\nHowever, a somewhat unexpected scene unfolded before Zhou Ze. As his certificate began to feel slightly warm,\nthe monkey, which had just been so arrogant and disdainful of him as merely a petty ghost messenger of the underworld, suddenly knelt down, continuously kowtowing to him, slamming its head against the ground, and shouting,\n\"Mercy, Lord! Mercy, Lord! This beast knows its wrongdoings, this beast knows its wrongdoings!\"\n\nFor a moment,\nZhou Ze, who had been full of enthusiasm, was left hanging in the air, neither up nor down.\nIt was like a man who had done all the foreplay, sprayed on the delay spray,\ntaken Viagra, put on a chocolate-flavored \"blue elf\" condom, started a porno, mixed the red wine,\nonly to pull back the covers and discover the beauty in bed was actually Xu Qinglang!",

    "content": "\"Lord Prefect?\"\n\nThis was certainly not a title for him. Zhou Ze's identification clearly showed his name in the first field and \"Temporary Ghost Messenger\" in the second.\n\nMoreover, it couldn't be a respectful alternative, like how common folk in the Republican era called soldiers \"Lao Zong.\" If a temporary Ghost Messenger could be called \"Lord Prefect,\" wouldn't such a high honor be too common and worthless in hell?\n\nSo,\n\nthe problem must lie with the small booklet he had just acquired.\n\nThis identification once had an owner. Even though it had been \"refreshed\" because Zhou Ze now had it, there must still be remnants of the previous owner's information on it.\n\nAll in all,\n\nhe had found the relic of a very remarkable individual, and he had done so with effortless ease.\n\nOf course, at this moment, Zhou Ze had no time to gloat or indulge in a glass of red wine to celebrate. Instead, he felt a slight pang of disappointment, as he hadn't gotten to fight this uglified Monkey King.\n\nBut since his opponent had conceded, Zhou Ze wasn't so perverse as to squat down and encourage his opponent to quickly regain confidence in life and stand up and hit him, hit him,\n\nhit him!\n\nSince this was a beautiful misunderstanding, then let the misunderstanding continue.\n\nZhou Ze silently walked towards the monkey, one hand clasped behind his back, subconsciously imitating the little loli's cool pose, to prolong the opponent's misunderstanding.\n\nHe reached the monkey, which was still kowtowing repeatedly. Its skull must have been opened, and it was hollow inside. In fact, besides that \"ox whip\" which was in perfect condition, the rest of its body was decayed and damaged.\n\nZhou Ze extended one hand, pressing his fingernail onto the monkey's brow.\n\n\"Give me your soul blood.\"\n\nZhou Ze said blandly.\n\n\"As Lord Prefect commands.\"\n\nThe monkey looked terrified and was utterly convinced. At its brow, a black earthworm emerged.\n\nZhou Ze used his fingernail to pinch the earthworm and began pulling it out. The earthworm grew longer and thicker.\n\nXu Qinglang had once suggested that Zhou Ze take Bai Yingying's soul blood, which would mean controlling Bai Yingying's life. Zhou Ze now intended to use the same method to completely control this monkey while it was disoriented.\n\nHowever, this monkey's soul blood was really thick, which indirectly showed how formidable this monkey was.\n\nWhy had this monkey suddenly appeared in the city?\n\nJust then, the soul blood suddenly got stuck. Zhou Ze pulled hard, but it wouldn't budge.\n\nAnd the monkey, which had been respectful, suddenly froze, its eyes becoming incredibly clear!\n\nThe high and mighty Lord Prefect wanted to extract its soul blood—this was its honor, an unresisted decree. But why was the high and mighty Lord Prefect having such difficulty extracting its soul blood?\n\nSuddenly, the monkey's mouth split open, emitting a piercing shriek, and its claw directly struck Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze felt as if he had been hit by a large truck, but as he was flung backward, his fingernail instantly exerted force, directly snapping the monkey's soul blood.\n\n\"Crash...\"\n\nZhou Ze shattered the glass behind him, landing amidst the shards. He looked up, his chest heaving, blood spilling from the corner of his mouth, and his entire body was in excruciating pain.\n\n\"Damn it, you're not the Lord Prefect!\n\nYou scoundrel, how dare you impersonate the Lord Prefect!\"\n\nThe monkey went berserk. Although its soul blood hadn't been fully extracted by Zhou Ze, because it had been snapped by him, even if it didn't immediately cause death, it was enough to destroy its foundation for cultivation.\n\nZhou Ze struggled to his feet, his body covered in cuts from the glass shards, looking very disheveled.\n\nHowever, the monkey at this moment was like a mad beast, directly pouncing on Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Thud!\"\n\nThe man and monkey collided, though this time the monkey's force was much weaker than before. They tangled together, rolling several times on the ground.\n\n\"This is my destiny, and my karma. The Heavenly Dao allows it; debts must be paid, it's only right!\n\nYou, a mere Ghost Messenger, why do you interfere? Do you truly believe yourself to be one of the Ten Kings of Hell?\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't reply. Instead, he plunged his fingernail deep into the monkey's body. The pus within the monkey's body continuously evaporated, emitting an odor that even a gas mask would likely be useless against.\n\nFinally, after a round of grappling, the monkey's body slumped, losing all strength, and fell to one side. Zhou Ze staggered to his feet, his fingernails largely corroded away.\n\nHe was a person who took great care of his fingernails. Even in his previous life, besides operating surgical tools, he often trimmed his nails. Not to mention in this life, his fingernails were even more important to him, so he naturally cherished them more.\n\nBut at the moment, this was not the time to dwell on such things. Zhou Ze felt a hint of lingering fear. If his identification hadn't deceived the opponent, allowing him to gain the upper hand and snap the opponent's soul blood, he might have been the one lying on the ground after this confrontation.\n\nThis wasn't a ghost,\n\nthis was a demon.\n\nZhou Ze cursed himself many times in his mind,\n\nwhy had he followed it, almost getting himself killed?\n\nHumans are such complex creatures; they can be driven by a momentary sense of justice and what they perceive as conscience to do things without considering the consequences, but then they often regret it,\n\nfeeling like an idiot.\n\nZhou Ze felt that next time he encountered such a situation, he should call the police, let them handle it, and then he could leave with a clear conscience.\n\nMadam White had stayed in Tongcheng for two hundred years, and the little loli had just turned a blind eye, hadn't she?\n\nShaking his head, he cast away the jumbled thoughts in his mind. Zhou Ze looked at the monkey beside him.\n\nThe monkey's mouth was open, its eyes began to cloud over, and its body started to shrivel, like a leaking balloon. But it wasn't dead yet, because it could still speak.\n\n\"I cultivated for three Jiazi cycles, obtained a fortuitous encounter, performed good deeds, became a spirit, and glimpsed the Great Dao... As a different kind of being, achieving enlightenment in the human world was truly difficult.\"\n\nIt seemed everyone liked to recount their past before dying, making their life sound incredibly impressive and tough. The monkey's mindset was actually not much different from a human's.\n\n\"You've cultivated for so many years, yet you couldn't control that thing between your legs.\" Zhou Ze spat out a mouthful of blood, his teeth filled with bloodstains.\n\n\"One Jiazi cycle, one physical body; one Jiazi cycle, one reincarnation.\" The monkey's voice began to weaken, but it still carried immense resonance.\n\n\"Every Jiazi cycle, I reformed my physical body and started cultivating anew, from scratch. In the wilderness, I rescued lost travelers, gathered and delivered medicinal herbs to the villagers at the foot of the mountain, and drove away nearby mountain monsters and ghosts.\n\nThough I had no temple, I performed the duties of a mountain god, protecting the people of that mountain region generation after generation. Even now, in that small town, there is still a stone statue of me, and stories of the divine monkey helping people are still passed down.\"\n\nZhou Ze wiped his fingernails on his clothes, looking at his damaged nails with great regret. Of course, he only showed a cold smile at the monkey's words.\n\nA divine monkey?\n\nA mountain god protecting the villagers?\n\nHelping others?\n\nYou helped others a bit too much, didn't you? When the husband went out to work, you even went to comfort his lonely wife?\n\nMoreover, recalling how this guy was pleasuring himself against the wall when he went upstairs, it was really hard to associate it with a divine monkey.\n\n\"Don't put on a show for yourself, just picking the good parts to say.\" Zhou Ze raised his hand again, preparing to put an end to this monkey.\n\n\"It was them, during my fourth cycle of cultivation and reincarnation, who caught my newly reincarnated body. At that time, I was just a small monkey. Her husband was a logger in the forest, he fell and injured himself in a canyon. It was I who brought him fruits and dew, it was I who led his fellow workers to rescue him.\n\nBut when he was rescued, he bound me with the logging rope and said to his fellow workers:\n\n'Great calamities survived surely bring great blessings. I heard monkey brains are very good; take them and give them to his wife to taste, it has miraculous effects on infertility!'\"\n\nThe last part, the monkey spoke in classical Chinese, which showed its fury and also that it was at its last gasp, its consciousness gradually becoming hazy, instinctively speaking in its most accustomed way.\n\n\"They opened my head, took my marrow, cut my flesh, and shared it among themselves to eat, saying it was a great tonic!\"\n\nAs the monkey spoke, its body, which had shrunk to the size of an ordinary monkey, began to tremble. This was a biting, deep-seated anger, resentment that went to the bone!\n\nCultivating for three Jiazi cycles, accumulating good deeds, protecting a region, yet on the eve of its great achievement, it was utterly destroyed, not by its own enemies, but by the very people it saved.\n\nFor anyone, this would be an overwhelming hatred.\n\n\"My physical body is destroyed, my Great Dao has collapsed, yet the resentment in my heart is unquelled!\n\nThe cause of that day, the fruit of today!\n\nI am already dead and gone, willing to enter reincarnation and be reborn in the animal realm, but my resentment is unresolved, my soul cannot enter hell. I must descend the mountain to seek revenge, settle the karma, and only then can I be completely liberated.\"\n\n\"Is that why you assaulted his wife?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"You are human, I am beast. For humans to consume beasts is only right!\n\nBut for beasts to repay humans with resentment is intolerable by the Heavenly Dao, is it not?\"\n\nZhou Ze hesitated for a moment, then nodded, \"It is.\"\n\nHe was unwilling to deny it, and didn't want to deny it.\n\nOf course, eating monkey brains was illegal and wrong, but from Zhou Ze's personal emotional perspective, he still couldn't accept this monkey coming down the mountain for revenge, almost causing a double death.\n\nFor example, when you see people eating braised pork in a restaurant, you might think it tastes delicious.\n\nBut if you saw a group of pigs gnawing on human flesh in a restaurant, as a human, what would you think?\n\nIt's a very selfish stance, a very distorted perspective, but the principle is the same: different positions lead to different viewpoints.\n\nMoreover, Zhou Ze felt that no matter what, the child in the pregnant woman's womb was innocent.\n\n\"You must be in great pain. I'll help you find release, then we'll see if I can send your soul to hell.\"\n\n\"Thank...\" The monkey spoke its last word.\n\nZhou Ze's fingernail pierced the monkey's body again,\n\nthe monkey's body trembled,\n\nits body completely lost all life.\n\nBut Zhou Ze searched and waited for a long time, yet found no trace of the monkey's departed soul.\n\nThis likely meant that the monkey's soul had been scattered, because its revenge was incomplete, and so its soul could not enter hell.\n\nStanding up, Zhou Ze noticed a faint layer of black mist dissipating around him, like a barrier that had prevented the events here from being perceived by the outside world. Otherwise, the commotion of his fight with the monkey would have attracted many people by now.\n\nZhou Ze hoisted the monkey's corpse onto his shoulder, supported himself on the stairwell, and slowly walked down.\n\nAt the same time, he reminded himself in his mind to remember today's lesson: he was just a Ghost Messenger, managing ghosts. Mountain spirits and monsters were outside his scope of work.\n\nUnder the cover of night, Zhou Ze used a shovel left in the gardener's shed at a park outside the hospital to dig a pit for the monkey and buried its body.\n\nThen, after simply tending to his own wounds, Zhou Ze, feeling exhausted, leaned against a large tree and sat down.\n\nHe took out his phone, whose screen was shattered but still functional, and sent a message to Doctor Lin:\n\n\"Were the pregnant woman and her child saved?\"\n\nAfter five minutes, Doctor Lin replied:\n\n\"They were saved, mother and child are safe.\"\n\nZhou Ze lit a cigarette, took a deep drag, and then felt a sharp pain in his lungs, coughing violently.\n\nBut soon, Doctor Lin sent another photo and a line of text:\n\n\"However, the child is deformed, with three legs.\"\n\nZhou Ze looked at the photo on his phone,\n\nthe small, premature infant lay quietly, breathing evenly,\n\nbut its lower body had three legs,\n\nthat extra leg,\n\nlooked like a monkey's... tail.",

    "content": "His body was somewhat weary, his heart a little lost. Zhou Ze tossed away his cigarette butt, slung his jacket over his shoulder, and followed the streetlights down a dimly lit path.\n\nHis silhouette stretched long behind him.\n\nAt the park exit stood an old man with white hair, impeccably dressed in a sharp suit, standing stiffly and meticulously, like an old white poplar steadfast in the desert.\n\nJust one glance was enough to tell that the old man was someone who demanded extreme, even abnormal, perfection in his attire and posture.\n\nZhou Ze didn't look at him and continued on his way.\n\nThe air was filled with the sweet, cloying smell of watermelon slush. This scent made Zhou Ze uncomfortable, as the red flesh of watermelon reminded him of many unpleasant scenes.\n\n\"Sir, are you feeling very down?\"\n\nThe old man deliberately matched Zhou Ze's pace, staying a respectful half-step behind.\n\n\"A little,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\nThe two continued forward, keeping perfect step, creating a peculiar synchronicity.\n\n\"Sir, is it because of that monkey?\n\nOr for that corrupted infant?\" the old man asked.\n\nZhou Ze didn't answer, continuing to walk slowly forward.\n\nHe stopped at a traffic light intersection, waiting for the green light.\n\nThe old man also stopped.\n\n\"There's no right or wrong in this matter,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\n\"No right or wrong?\" the old man repeated, then asked, \"But everything has two sides, so right and wrong can naturally be distinguished.\n\nThe monkey was a good monkey; it even did more good deeds than many so-called kind people.\n\nYou admit this, do you not, sir?\"\n\n\"So, your point is?\" Zhou Ze pulled out another cigarette, cupped his hand against the wind, and lit it. \"I was wrong?\"\n\n\"After several transformations and arduous cultivations, to have it all come to naught because of the very person you saved—if it were you, sir, how would you feel?\" the old man asked.\n\n\"I'd be furious,\" Zhou Ze answered directly, without needing to think.\n\n\"And after the fury?\"\n\n\"If given the chance, I'd kill their entire family,\" Zhou Ze exhaled a smoke ring.\n\n\"Sir, your logic is very sound,\" the old man remarked. \"But you prevented it from seeking revenge, even after you learned the whole story and truth from its mouth, you still personally ended it.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Do you think what you did was right?\" the old man asked again.\n\n\"I said, there's no right or wrong in this matter,\" Zhou Ze flicked his ash. \"Stepping back, even by ten thousand steps, the child is innocent.\"\n\n\"According to you, if the monkey had only chosen to take revenge on the husband, you would have understood;\n\nYou likely wouldn't have stopped it, would you, sir?\"\n\nZhou Ze remained silent.\n\n\"But the husband killed the monkey and took its brain because he wanted his wife to eat it to cure her infertility,\" the old man reminded. \"So, cause and effect, seemingly attributed to the monkey and the husband, actually originate from the monkey and that infant.\"\n\n\"Can cause and effect be calculated that way?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Is my calculation unreasonable?\" the old man countered.\n\n\"According to your calculation, you could say that because a meteorite struck Earth, dinosaurs went extinct, which led to new species, then hominids, then humans and monkeys, and then this tragedy.\n\nSo, the cause and effect should be attributed to the meteorite.\"\n\n\"That's sophistry, sir,\" the old man's tone seemed to remain unchanged, very calm, as if he were purely discussing a problem with you.\n\n\"I am human,\" Zhou Ze pointed to his head. \"From a human perspective, I don't think I can allow an anomaly to harm humans in a hospital.\"\n\n\"You are not human, you are a ghost,\" the old man reminded him again.\n\n\"This time, it's your turn to play sophist.\"\n\n\"Heh heh,\" the old man chuckled.\n\nThe light turned green.\n\nZhou Ze stepped forward, and the old man continued to follow.\n\nA young man in tattered clothes,\n\nAn old man in precise attire,\n\nThe two cast only a single shadow on the ground.\n\n\"Ultimately, the child still had problems,\" the old man continued, speaking in a calm tone that made one want to stab him. \"It seems at this moment, one could lament: The ways of Heaven are a cycle, and who can escape them?\"\n\n\"I never believe that children in swaddling clothes should bear collateral responsibility for the wrongs committed by adults.\"\n\n\"Ancient laws included collective punishment, which means it had its reasons for existing,\" the old man said.\n\n\"It has been abolished now, which means its non-existence is better than its existence.\"\n\n\"Sir, you pity that child, but who pities that monkey?\"\n\n\"You can go ask its ancestors on Mount Huaguo.\"\n\n\"So, ultimately, it's still a theory of species-ism above all else, merely a protective color over regional or racial discrimination.\"\n\n\"I have a piece of bread; this is my dinner for today,\" Zhou Ze spread out one hand, indicating he was holding a piece of bread.\n\n\"And then?\"\n\n\"And then, as I was about to eat this bread, I suddenly remembered that in some impoverished regions of the Earth, people are still starving, emaciated from hunger.\n\nSo, I can't bear to eat this bread, content to starve with them, or even die of hunger with them.\"\n\n\"Sir, I think your sarcasm is not very appropriate,\" the old man shook his head. \"Can you consider the monkey an animal? Its actions over three jiazi* have made it more human than most so-called people.\"\n\n\"Alright, then another example.\n\nI have a luxury car, fine red wine, and caviar in front of me, and I remember that people on Earth are still starving. I can't bear to enjoy them, so I decide to starve with them, and die of hunger with them.\n\nIf you eat such good food, if you drive such a good car, people will point fingers and curse you, telling you that you should donate your money for enjoyment to the impoverished regions.\"\n\nThe old man stopped, as if deep in thought.\n\nZhou Ze didn't stop, continuing to walk forward.\n\nFinally, the old man caught up.\n\n\"I'm still very curious why you stopped it.\"\n\n\"What do you think I should have done?\"\n\n\"Pretend you didn't see it,\" the old man replied. \"You are a ghost messenger, a guardian of the rules of the Underworld in the Human Realm. A referee is respected because of his neutrality; if he acts as both referee and player, the game collapses.\"\n\n\"I don't understand what you mean,\" Zhou Ze stopped and looked at the old man, this meticulously dressed old fellow he wished he could crumple his suit.\n\n\"The meaning is simple: the two examples you gave earlier simply meant you made the choice you wanted at that moment, and my questions just now were merely the chattering of an outsider.\"\n\n\"I thought you didn't understand.\"\n\n\"I understood. You are a good person,\" the old man repeated. \"A good 'person'.\"\n\nFrom a 'human' perspective, indeed.\n\n\"So, you deliberately came up to me just to define me?\" Zhou Ze looked at the old man. His fingers were still burning with pain. \"I didn't know trouble would come so quickly after picking up that thing.\"\n\nEarlier, the little loli said he was a incandescent light in the night; now Zhou Ze felt he was an incendiary bomb in the night.\n\nThe old man shook his head and said, \"I am not your trouble. In fact, I am a servant left by the Master, and you have just inherited the Master's identity token.\n\nBecause of this, my seal was lifted, I awoke, and then I found you. And, incidentally, observed you for a while.\"\n\n\"Picked up a good thing, and got an old man as a bonus?\"\n\nA smile appeared at the corner of Zhou Ze's mouth.\n\n\"Should I say:\n\n'Thirty years east of the river, thirty years west of the river, don't bully a young man in poverty'?\n\nAnd then exclaim 'How terrifying' for good measure?\n\nThat seems more fitting.\"\n\n\"I don't understand, sir,\" the old man said directly.\n\n\"You should read more,\" Zhou Ze reminded him.\n\n\"Alright,\" the old man nodded solemnly. \"I've learned something.\"\n\nAhead, they encountered another red light, and the two stopped again.\n\n\"Sir, since you have inherited the Master's identity token, you have naturally become my new Master,\" the old man said, simultaneously bending at the waist and bowing to Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze stood still, looking at the old man.\n\nToday had been truly eventful.\n\nHe picked up a document, killed a monkey, and now an old man appeared, claiming him as his master.\n\nZhou Ze wasn't overjoyed; he just felt a bit troubled. He couldn't discern the intentions of this suddenly appearing old man.\n\n\"The Master once gave an instruction, for me to tell his successor,\" the old man spoke again. \"Of course, this message is for you, and also for me, his servant.\n\n\"Speak.\"\n\n\"If his successor is a good person, then...\"\n\n\"Pfft!\"\n\nThe sound of a sharp object piercing flesh rang out.\n\nZhou Ze looked down in stunned surprise.\n\nHe saw the old man's hand directly pierce his chest.\n\nSo swift,\n\nSo sudden,\n\nHe didn't even have the slightest psychological preparation.\n\nSlowly, Zhou Ze's feet left the ground. The old man raised his arm, and Zhou Ze was lifted with him.\n\nUnder the dim streetlights, Zhou Ze could clearly see his blood flowing down the old man's arm, staining half of his suit.\n\n\"The Master said, if his successor is a good person, then kill him and wait for the next one.\"\n\nThe old man continued to speak these words calmly.\n\nHe wasn't killing someone;\n\nHe was simply discarding trash,\n\nLike a fastidious chef selecting his ingredients, if something wasn't quite right, he'd toss it and get a new one.\n\nAnd Zhou Ze was this inexplicably discarded trash.\n\nBlood flowed ceaselessly. Zhou Ze's broken fingernails elongated, but before Zhou Ze could make another move, the old man's hand, which had pierced through Zhou Ze's palm, suddenly exerted force.\n\nInstantly,\n\nZhou Ze felt immense pain throughout his limbs and bones. Zhou Ze's body convulsed, completely unable to retaliate.\n\n\"I'm very sorry, sir. A minute ago, you might have thought today was your lucky day, because you acquired something you really wanted.\n\nI wonder if you noticed the blurry white smudges under the 'Name' and 'Position' fields on the document.\n\nYou might have thought that hidden beneath the white smudges were the Master's name and position;\n\nAnd indeed, that is true.\n\nBut not just those,\n\nAlso the names and positions of the eight successors before you.\"\n\nThe old man continued to speak calmly.\n\n\"Were they... they... all... good people?\"\n\nZhou Ze opened his mouth, blood constantly spilling from the corners. He felt like a salted fish, hung on a branch,\n\nSlowly, waiting to be air-dried.\n\n\"No, sir, you are the only good person among these nine,\" the old man replied.\n\n\"Then why... why... did they... also... die...\"\n\n\"Because when I asked them if they were a good person, they all thought answering 'yes' seemed more advantageous.\"\n\nThe old man tilted his head slightly, showing a hint of helplessness.\n\n\"And then,\n\nThey all died.\"\n\n---\n* Jiazi (甲子): A traditional Chinese sixty-year cycle, used for reckoning years and days.

    "content": "Zhou Ze remembered clearly what death felt like; he had once been pushed into a crematorium’s incinerator and enjoyed the treatment of being burned to ash.\n\nAnd beforehand, the crematorium staff had even used a steel hook to pierce his stomach to prevent it from bulging and exploding during cremation.\n\nThat feeling was very similar to his chest being pierced through now.\n\nPain?\n\nOf course, it hurt.\n\nBut when the pain became too intense, you became numb instead, like undergoing surgery in a hospital after receiving a spinal anesthetic. Separated by the curtain blocking your view, you could probably only feel something rummaging around inside your belly.\n\nZhou Ze still wanted to resist, but his body was at this moment seized by a deathly spasm. Even his eyelids felt unusually heavy.\n\nNo matter how unwilling, no matter how much he resisted,\n\nhis eyelids,\n\nstill closed.\n\n…\n\nSlowly opening his eyes, Zhou Ze saw dim lights all around. In front of him was a long marble table, its chaotic patterns nonetheless exuding a sense of exquisite artistry.\n\nLooking down, Zhou Ze found himself seated in an armchair, a Grand Tutor’s Chair, leaning back. Below his neck, he wore a white neck wrap, but it looked more like a bib, tied there to prevent food stains from dirtying his clothes.\n\nIn his two hands, he held a silver knife and fork,\n\nand in front of him, on a pristine white plate, lay a piece of roasted meat, emitting faint wisps of steam, garnished with lemon and cauliflower.\n\n\"Sir, I’ve seared the cauliflower with a blowtorch; it will give it a grilled flavor. I hope you enjoy it.\"\n\nThe old man’s voice came from across the table. He was dressed similarly, cutting a steak and putting it into his mouth, chewing.\n\n\"What does this mean?\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't rush to eat; he asked directly.\n\nDidn’t they say they were going to kill him?\n\n\"There was a slight accident.\" The old man picked up the wine beside him and took a small sip.\n\n\"Whoosh!\"\n\nThe old man placed one hand on the table and pushed a credential towards Zhou Ze.\n\n\"I didn’t expect the identity plate to be so damaged.\" The old man finished, then continued to cut a piece of meat and savor it.\n\n\"So?\"\n\n\"So, I apologize, you can’t die now.\" The old man smiled slightly and said, \"Sir, you truly are very lucky.\"\n\n\"You’re not killing me?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. Because the identity plate left by my master can no longer withstand another process of recognition and refresh; otherwise, it would directly shatter and become useless.\"\n\nThe old man shook his head, raised his wine glass, and toasted Zhou Ze,\n\n\"So, congratulations, sir. It seems my previous words were mistaken. Today is indeed your lucky day.\"\n\nZhou Ze picked up the wine glass, looking at the clear red wine inside. He didn’t rush to drink but asked:\n\n\"Is there any strange poison in this wine?\"\n\n\"You jest, sir.\"\n\nJest?\n\nJust now you said I was your new master,\n\nand then what?\n\nYou directly pierced through my chest with one hand!\n\nWho exactly is jesting?\n\n\"Sir, please taste my cooking. When the old master was alive, I was responsible for his daily meals. Though many years have passed, I don't think my culinary skills have deteriorated too much.\"\n\n\"Is there no poison in the meat?\" Zhou Ze asked with a smile.\n\n\"Sir, you are overthinking. For me, to kill you or torture you, it wouldn't require such trouble.\"\n\nYou make a very good point; I really can't argue with that.\n\nZhou Ze cut a piece of meat with the knife, used the fork to put the meat into his mouth and chew. He instinctively wanted to vomit, but unexpectedly found the meat melted in his mouth and had an excellent texture.\n\nMost importantly, he didn't feel the slightest bit of nausea.\n\n\"Is it delicious?\" the old man asked.\n\n\"It's acceptable,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\n\"If it's delicious, eat more. As a chef, it’s a very happy thing when your dishes are liked and eaten a lot.\"\n\nThe old man ate half a plate of meat, then put down his knife and fork, took out a hot towel, and wiped his hands.\n\nZhou Ze ate a few more pieces of meat, then asked:\n\n\"What happens next?\"\n\n\"Sir, you are jesting again.\" The old man’s face showed a benevolent smile. \"After your meal, sir, you are free to leave. I will not restrict your freedom.\"\n\n\"It just ends like this?\" Zhou Ze found it somewhat absurd.\n\n\"Yes, it's over,\" the old man affirmed.\n\n\"But I remember you said that the Prefect wanted a bad person, right?\"\n\n\"Yes, that is indeed true.\"\n\n\"Just because the identity plate is damaged, I get an exception?\"\n\nIs it really just because of good luck?\n\n\"No, the Prefect’s will does not tolerate the slightest discount.\"\n\n\"I don't understand.\"\n\n\"The answer is in your heart,\" the old man reminded him.\n\n\"I really dislike that cryptic way monks talk,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nThe old man reached out and patted his own chest. \"Sir, in that regard, I feel the same way.\"\n\nZhou Ze’s expression suddenly darkened, as if he had thought of something. He immediately lowered his head, pulled aside the neck wrap, and exposed the left side of his chest.\n\nIt was empty there.\n\n\"I’ve applied the best ointment to your wound; it will heal within days, leaving no scar. I even took the liberty of treating other wounds on your body.\n\nYou don’t need to thank me, nor do you need to be polite.\"\n\nThank you for your motherf**king *!\n\n\"My heart? Where's my heart?!\" Zhou Ze demanded.\n\nThe old man pointed to the dining plate in front of Zhou Ze and said amiably:\n\n\"You said it tasted good.\"\n\n\"Clang!\"\n\nZhou Ze slapped the knife and fork onto the table.\n\nThe old man picked up a cup of tea, rinsed his mouth, spat it out, then slowly stood up.\n\n\"Without a heart, there are fewer worries, and you can live more comfortably.\n\nA good person, without a conscience, can't be good anymore, don't you agree?\"\n\nZhou Ze gripped the tablecloth tightly with both hands, looking up at the old man,\n\n\"You'd better kill me now.\"\n\nThe old man smiled faintly, \"So, sir, are you going to say 'Don't bully a young man for being poor' again?\"\n\nThen, the old man lightly patted his chest, took a sharp intake of breath, and feigned,\n\n\"Truly terrifying indeed.\"\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Sir, you won't have a chance to take revenge on me. My lifespan has long since reached its end. When you leave this room, I will also dissipate.\"\n\n\"Will you go to hell?\"\n\n\"Hell has no place for me,\" the old man replied. \"It is the final end.\"\n\nThen, the old man pointed to the plate in front of Zhou Ze again,\n\n\"Sir, would you like me to pack it for you?\"\n\nZhou Ze stood up, feeling an emptiness in his chest. The large hole in his wound was shocking, but he wasn't dead. More precisely, Xu Le's body wasn't dead, and he didn't even feel the slightest bit of pain.\n\nWould the wound heal within days?\n\nPicking up the credential on the table, Zhou Ze walked towards the door, but stopped midway and asked:\n\n\"I'm curious, who exactly is that Prefect?\"\n\n\"Ever since the Prefect was deceived by that Bodhisattva who went to Hell back then, he no longer wishes for his name to be mentioned.\"\n\nWithout an answer, but unwilling to linger, Zhou Ze pushed open the door and stepped out. When he looked back, the door he had just exited was gone.\n\nBehind him was a field of desolate graves.\n\n…\n\nInside the room, the old man quietly cleared the dishes and swept the room clean again.\n\nThen, he spread his hand and clapped the table.\n\n\"Come out.\"\n\nA small golden snub-nosed monkey, appearing from who-knows-where, leaped onto the table, scratching its ears and cheeks at the old man, looking very endearing.\n\nHowever, the monkey's body was somewhat ethereal, clearly not a real entity.\n\n\"Though injustice has its source and debt its owner, what you did this time went too far. Even if the final consequence fell upon that infant, it should not have been the object of your revenge.\n\nIf all were to pursue and comply with karma, why would you, this little beast, strive for the Great Dao?\n\nEating, drinking, birth, aging, sickness, and death—isn’t that the most compliant with karma?\"\n\nThe golden snub-nosed monkey shook its head, then nodded.\n\n\"Don't blame me for seizing the soul attached to that infant. Your 360 years of merit will be compensation for that child. Even if he is disabled, he will have smooth sailing in the future and even become a normal person after surgery.\n\nYou should not feel at a disadvantage. Let this matter end here. Soon, I will give you a new body. You may leave and either resume your cultivation or simply play in the mountains and forests. Just do not repeat what you did today.\n\nEven humans cultivating the Dao face five ailments and three deficiencies, let alone you, a mere beast. Consider this a tribulation on your path to cultivation.\"\n\nWith that,\n\nthe old man pushed open the door to the inner room.\n\nThis small room contained no other furnishings, only a traditional Chinese ink painting hanging on the wall.\n\nIn the painting,\n\nthere was a majestic mountain,\n\nNature’s masterpiece, where yin and yang divide day from night!\n\nA man, wearing a purple crown and a yellow robe, stood atop the mountain.\n\nThe painting had yellowed,\n\nthe person in the painting had long since passed,\n\nonly that majestic mountain in the painting still stood there, towering over all others.\n\n\"Prefect, your humble servant has completed your command.\"\n\nThe old man knelt before the painting.\n\nThe scene of their farewell reappeared in his mind:\n\n…\n\n\"You old rascal, die later, hold on a bit longer. Help me watch who this identity plate falls into. If it's a good person, kill him for me and find someone else!\n\nI was misled by those monks, believed their nonsense about 'Hell shall not be empty before I become a Buddha,' and ruined my reputation!\n\nThe one holding my identity plate absolutely cannot be a good person, or I won't rest in peace!\"\n\n\"Master, what is a good person, and what is a bad person?\n\nA good person might do bad things, and a bad person might do good things.\n\nAs for the distinction between good and bad, this old servant is foolish and fears spoiling the Prefect’s instructions.\"\n\n\"Damn it, there aren’t so many convoluted arguments. If you think he’s not a bad person, just kill him.\"\n\n\"Yes, your humble servant will obey your decree.\"\n\n…\n\n\"Is he a good person?\"\n\nInside the room, the old man, who had been kneeling, slowly raised his head and murmured to the painting:\n\n\"He is indeed a 'good' person,\n\nbut in my eyes,\n\nhe is a 'bad' person.\"\n\nAs the old man spoke, his face began to darken. Yellow hair started to grow on his face and hands.\n\nHis features began to distort, transforming into a hairy face with a pointed mouth like a thunder god!\n\nThis was an old ape!\n\nBorn in the wilderness of Mount Tai, its lifelong ambition was to carry that Mount Tai.\n\nAncient words called it: Mountain-Moving Ape!\n\n\"My disciples and grand-disciples, cultivated for three hundred and sixty years, benevolent and diligent in practice, suffered such a great calamity, encountered such hardship!\n\nHe, relying on his human standing, disregarded everything and directly went and killed it!\n\nWhy!\n\nWhy!\n\nJust because he is human, because he was human in life?!\n\nSo, any non-human, if it threatens humans, regardless of right or wrong, regardless of what is true or false,\n\nshould be killed? Should die?\"\n\nThe old man sat down cross-legged,\n\nand finally murmured:\n\n\"From a human perspective, he is a good person.\n\nFrom the perspective of the ape clan, your humble servant sees him as a bad person.\n\nHeh,\n\nin the end,\n\nit was precisely because of this that I couldn't make him die.\n\nPrefect,\n\nIs this your intention?\n\nPrefect,\n\nYour humble servant is coming to follow you. For all these years, without your humble servant by your side to serve you meals, you must have been unaccustomed, right?\"\n\nThe old man lost his life.\n\nThe ape's body sat there.\n\nThe soul-state golden snub-nosed monkey then ran out, first kneeling and kowtowing to the old man's remains, then burrowed into the old man's skin.\n\nA short while later,\n\nfrom beneath the old man's clothes,\n\na small monkey, no bigger than a palm, emerged,\n\n\"Squeak, squeak, squeak…\"\n\nThe little monkey chirped a few times, then ran off.",

    "content": "It was past midnight when Zhou Ze took a taxi back to the bookstore. The bookstore door was still open, and there were quite a few people inside.\n\nZhou Ze remembered Xu Qinglang calling him earlier to say that business was good tonight. It seemed he was right; even at this hour, there were still customers.\n\nPushing open the glass door, Zhou Ze was a little disappointed to find that all ten-odd people sitting in the shop were alive.\n\nThe last incident with Bureau Chief Zhao was an exception. This time, there's no way ten-odd people could all be exceptions, could there?\n\nEven during the time of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors, the public's customs—no, the ghost-world's customs—weren't this simple.\n\nThey sat in a circle, with one person standing in the middle, telling a story. Everyone else listened intently. It seemed to be a suspenseful horror story, and the narrator spoke with inflections and used some body language, trying to create an atmosphere.\n\nBai Yingying sat behind the counter, playing on her phone.\n\nWhen Zhou Ze returned, Bai Yingying actively stood up and poured him a glass of water.\n\nZhou Ze sat down and instinctively reached a hand to cover his chest. Although it was covered by clothes, it seemed that, for now, that area was empty.\n\n\"Boss, what's wrong?\" Bai Yingying asked, a little strangely.\n\n\"Hm?\" Zhou Ze looked at Bai Yingying.\n\n\"I just feel like something's different about you. You weren't like this when you left this afternoon.\"\n\nUndoubtedly, the female corpse was very sensitive.\n\n\"It's nothing,\" Zhou Ze didn't want to talk right now.\n\n\"You're back, so can I go play games next door?\" Bai Yingying pleaded.\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"Boss is the best.\"\n\nBai Yingying went to the noodle shop next door. Soon, Xu Qinglang walked from the noodle shop into the bookstore, came to the counter, handed Zhou Ze a cigarette, and asked:\n\n\"Is this a tea party?\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head, indicating he didn't know.\n\n\"Heh, sounds like they're telling ghost stories.\" Xu Qinglang became interested and even pulled up a plastic stool to sit with them.\n\nThe person in the middle of the circle was telling a story about a ghost baby seeking revenge. It was full of climaxes, and the storytelling was indeed good; the people around were very engrossed.\n\nSlowly, Zhou Ze understood. This must be a \"club,\" similar to a book club or cycling club, an organization gathered because of a shared hobby.\n\nAfter the last story ended, the leading man took out a large white paper with some drawings on it, then pulled out several pens.\n\nZhou Ze was a bit far and couldn't see clearly. Xu Qinglang turned his head and mouthed to Zhou Ze:\n\n\"Pen spirit.\"\n\nThe pen spirit game is a type of ghost-summoning game, imbued with a mysterious aura. It is said that playing such games easily leads to misfortune and possession by a deceased spirit.\n\nThese people were all very excited. Everyone reached out and jointly held a long pen. A man in a yellow woolen overcoat, wearing black-rimmed glasses, seemed to be the leader. After everyone was ready, he spoke piously:\n\n\"Pen spirit, pen spirit, where are you? Pen spirit, pen spirit, where are you?\"\n\nThe pen still didn't move, but the bookstore suddenly fell silent.\n\nThe man with black-rimmed glasses continued:\n\n\"Pen spirit, pen spirit, will we encounter ghosts tonight?\"\n\nTen seconds after he finished speaking,\n\nThe long pen held by everyone slowly began to move.\n\nEveryone held their breath.\n\nActually, when many people hold one pen, as long as the tip is smooth enough, it's very easy for it to slide. If someone among them subtly misbehaves, it becomes even simpler.\n\n\"Swish!\"\n\nThe pen tip suddenly twitched,\n\nAnd pointed directly towards where Zhou Ze was sitting.\n\nXu Qinglang's mouth slightly opened. Beginner's luck?\n\nZhou Ze remained steadily seated behind the counter, half-closed eyes watching the situation.\n\nDue to the pen's movement, most people's gazes were directed towards Zhou Ze's squatting position.\n\n\"Yes!\"\n\nThe man with black-rimmed glasses pointed to the area where the pen tip was, saying.\n\nThere were \"yes\" and \"no\" areas, and at this moment, the pen tip was precisely in the \"yes\" area.\n\n\"Alright, put your things away. We'll set off together later. Remember, we'll be active for half an hour. Everyone's phones are charged, right? Everyone must record video later, for at least twenty minutes.\"\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\n\"Understood.\"\n\n\"Mm.\"\n\nThe rest of them packed their things and left the bookstore. The black-rimmed man walked up to Zhou Ze's counter and said apologetically:\n\n\"Sorry, Boss, we're from the Horror Story Enthusiasts Association. We explore supernatural events when we have nothing to do. We didn't scare you, did we?\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head.\n\n\"Then you're really brave, Boss. When that young lady was here, I asked her if we could play the pen spirit game, and she agreed. But now that you're back, I was actually worried you'd blame us. This is for the tea and water, Boss, please take it.\"\n\nThe man handed over six hundred yuan.\n\nZhou Ze took the money and asked, \"Where are you going later?\"\n\n\"Just the building above your shop. There haven't been any businesses here for a long time, right? There was also an arson case recently, where several people died. We plan to try our luck there tonight.\"\n\n\"You want to see ghosts that much?\"\n\n\"I don't know, but people are always curious about the unknown, right? Actually, everyone gathers here with a desire for thrills.\n\nIn our usual social circles, it's hard to find like-minded people. Our club also provides an opportunity for everyone to communicate.\n\nAnd, I've already arranged things for tonight. I had someone set up things earlier today in the cinema where the arson happened. Tonight, Mr. Chen from our club will confess to Miss Liu.\"\n\n\"Confess?\"\n\n\"That's right. Actually, the rest of us are aware of tonight's plan; only Miss Liu doesn't know. Our club has been established for five years, and we all have good relationships, so everyone is very willing to help.\"\n\n\"Are you Japanese?\" Zhou Ze asked the black-rimmed man.\n\n\"Yes, I'm considered an overseas Chinese in Japan, returned to the country five years ago. This kind of hobby club is very common in Japan. After returning home, I found everyone too introverted, so I usually organize activities like regular book clubs or haunted house explorations.\"\n\nThe man slapped his forehead and handed over his business card,\n\n\"My Chinese name is Cui Yilang. Please treat me well.\"\n\nZhou Ze took the business card from his hand.\n\n\"Then we'll go organize the activity now. Thank you again, Boss, for your hospitality.\"\n\nCui Yilang walked out of the bookstore. Xu Qinglang, who had been standing by the side without speaking, immediately clutched his stomach and burst out laughing:\n\n\"Hahaha, I was dying trying to hold it in. They really encountered a ghost this time.\"\n\nXu Qinglang laughed and laughed, then noticed Zhou Ze wasn't laughing. He reached out and punched Zhou Ze's chest, asking:\n\n\"Isn't it funny?\"\n\nZhou Ze immediately bent over, one hand covering the spot on his chest that had just been hit.\n\n\"This... are you okay? He didn't use much force, did he?\"\n\nHe just lightly punched your chest, that's all.\n\n\"No,\" Zhou Ze gestured for Xu Qinglang not to come closer, and said at the same time, \"I just laughed so hard my chest hurts.\"\n\n\"That exaggerated?\" Xu Qinglang pouted. \"Are you hungry? I'll go make you... a bowl of egg fried rice?\"\n\n\"Not hungry, I've eaten.\"\n\n\"You ate outside?\" Xu Qinglang asked curiously, \"Don't you usually dislike eating out?\"\n\n\"That thing, it was very tasty.\"\n\n\"What kind of dish was it? If you can eat it, I'll buy some tomorrow and make it for you?\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head,\n\nA person only has one heart.\n\nZhou Ze couldn't just produce a whole basketful for Xu Qinglang to \"fry, deep-fry, boil, steam.\"\n\n\"Then what do you want to eat lately?\" Xu Qinglang asked.\n\n\"Water spinach, I guess.\" Zhou Ze looked at Xu Qinglang and said very seriously, \"I suddenly really want to eat that lately.\"\n\n\"Alright, I'll get some tomorrow.\"\n\nJust then, the lights in the bookstore suddenly went out.\n\n\"Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah!!!!!!!! The final circle, the fated circle!!!!\n\nI was about to get a chicken dinner! My dog's grenade, three-tier armor, three heads, fifteen times scope!\"\n\nBai Yingying rushed out of the noodle shop, wailing loudly outside.\n\nZhou Ze felt that even when she was drowned in a pig cage back then, she probably didn't yell as intensely as she was now.\n\nThe power was out,\n\nZhou Ze and Xu Qinglang also walked outside.\n\nXu Qinglang made a call, then hung up, saying helplessly:\n\n\"Damn it, they said no one will come to fix it until tomorrow. Old Zhou, this place of ours is really going downhill. The power's out and people can't even be bothered to come check. Now it's become a ghost house for hobbyists and ghost hunters.\"\n\nXu Qinglang pointed to the high-rise windows above their heads. \"How could they think of proposing in that cinema where people died?\"\n\n\"It's very romantic. In a horrifying environment, coupled with the suddenness of love, this contrast can be intoxicating for those who enjoy such things.\"\n\n\"Why do you sound so strange today?\" Xu Qinglang looked at Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head.\n\n\"You really look like you've been emptied out. Did you take that step with your wife today?\" Xu Qinglang asked cautiously.\n\n\"You're overthinking it.\"\n\nBut the word \"emptied out\" made Zhou Ze's eyelids twitch slightly, a detail Xu Qinglang caught.\n\nZhou Ze looked up, at the sky above.\n\n\"Hey,\n\nLooking at the sky won't help.\n\nAre you feeling guilty?\n\nDid I really guess right?\"\n\nSeeing Zhou Ze didn't answer, Xu Qinglang also looked up,\n\nAt the sky.\n\nThen,\n\nThey saw what looked like a person in white standing at the fifth-floor glass window.\n\nBecause of the power outage, there was no light around, but the moon was bright tonight, and the color of the person's clothes was easy to distinguish in the night.\n\n\"Could they have even found someone to dress up as a ghost to set the mood?\" Xu Qinglang exhaled a puff of smoke. \"They're really going to extre...\"\n\nXu Qinglang stopped speaking,\n\nBecause he saw the white figure above fall,\n\nVery fast,\n\nAnd landed less than ten meters from him and Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Thud!\"\n\nA heavy thud sounded,\n\nA person fell face up onto the ground, unmoving. Blood slowly spread out from beneath her.\n\nZhou Ze felt a chill on his face,\n\nA little blood spattered onto his cheek.\n\nXu Qinglang immediately ran over to check the condition of the fallen person,\n\nWhile Zhou Ze reached into his pocket for a tissue, intending to wipe the blood from his face first.\n\nSomeone died... I need to save them... I need to check the situation...\n\nZhou Ze's eyes showed a struggle,\n\nBut his hand still trembled as he pulled out the tissue,\n\nSlowly and carefully wiping away those few drops of blood.\n\n\"Hey, come here quickly and see if there's any chance of saving her!\" Xu Qinglang looked up and shouted at Zhou Ze. Then, when he saw Zhou Ze standing there, not moving a step, just wiping his face, he roared:\n\n\"Do you have any conscience? Wiping your face at a time like this!\"\n\nZhou Ze froze for a moment,\n\nThat's right,\n\nHis heart,\n\nWas gone...",

    "content": "\"Alright, the statement is done. You're free to go.\"\n\nA young police officer closed his notebook and smiled at Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze nodded, stood up, and prepared to leave.\n\nJust then, the middle-aged police officer, who had been sitting beside the young officer, accompanying the statement, suddenly asked,\n\n\"Mr. Xu, your bookstore is located there, is business good?\"\n\n\"Not very good,\" Zhou Ze answered honestly.\n\nMany people had asked him this question; they were asking about business for the living, so Zhou Ze naturally answered in terms of business for the living.\n\n\"Then why do you continue to choose to keep that shop open there?\" the middle-aged officer asked.\n\n\"I'm a live-in son-in-law. My in-laws are very rich, they don't lack money. I'm just passing the time.\"\n\nThe middle-aged officer was stunned for a moment, then nodded, and motioned with his hand, \"You may leave. If there's anything else we need to consult you about, we'll notify you.\"\n\n\"My pleasure.\"\n\nZhou Ze left the interrogation room.\n\nThe young officer twirled the pen in his hand and said, \"Captain Sun, this guy is quite interesting.\"\n\nYes, openly admitting to being a live-in son-in-law and to freeloading, just passing the time, indeed required a lot of courage.\n\n\"Let's go see the interrogations in other places,\" the middle-aged officer stood up, glancing again at Zhou Ze's retreating back. He always felt that the young man who had just sat before him gave him a feeling of being pricked by thorns.\n\nDuring interrogation, the police should be the cobra, and the interrogated person the prey. The venomous snake should break through the opponent's defenses in the quickest, most precise, and ruthless way to get to the truth of the matter.\n\nBut just now, he had the illusion that his cobra, in the other's eyes, was like an ornamental snake dancing to the sound of a flute in an Indian street performer's basket.\n\nThe other party, it seemed, didn't care at all.\n\n…………\n\n\"Out already?\" Xu Qinglang had also just finished his statement and walked out. \"Such bad luck, having to run to the police station in the middle of the night for a statement.\n\nAlso, that young officer was so annoying, he asked my gender three times. Is there something wrong with his brain? Can't he tell what my gender is?\"\n\nZhou Ze glanced at Xu Qinglang,\n\nThinking: Don't you have any self-awareness about what you look like?\n\nZhou Ze and Xu Qinglang were both shop owners, and they had witnessed the fall firsthand, so they needed to give a statement. However, there was basically nothing else. The other members of the Horror Story Enthusiasts Association were all considered key suspects by the police, which was to be expected.\n\n\"Oh right, who do you think the killer is?\" Xu Qinglang asked, smoking.\n\nAt this time, the sun was about to rise; it was already morning.\n\n\"That's not our concern. The police will investigate and solve the case,\" Zhou Ze said calmly.\n\n\"Hey, don't be so negative, alright?\n\nDidn't you read Sherlock Holmes or Detective Conan when you were little?\"\n\nEveryone, more or less, has a little detective dream or detective complex in their hearts.\n\nThat feeling of peeling back layers of mist to find the truth, and then, like magician Lu Chen,* extravagantly spreading one's hands and dramatically shouting, \"Next is the moment to witness the miracle!\"\n\nThat would definitely hit a lot of people's G-spot.\n\n\"I'm not interested in people.\"\n\n\"Still obsessed with ghosts,\" Xu Qinglang said sarcastically.\n\n\"Yes, with ghosts.\" Zhou Ze took out his phone to call a taxi, and at the same time said, \"Do you still remember what color clothes the female victim was wearing when she jumped?\"\n\n\"White.\"\n\n\"And after she fell?\"\n\n\"Red, of course.\" Xu Qinglang shrugged. \"It looked like it was stained red with blood. Sigh, how pitiful.\"\n\n\"After she landed, she was wearing a red skirt to begin with,\" Zhou Ze reminded him. \"Don't delude yourself with the 'stained with blood' trope.\"\n\nXu Qinglang nodded silently, then reached up to touch the tip of his nose, and said, \"You mean, there's some secret behind this incident, it's not simply an accident or murder?\"\n\n\"I don't know, but I really hope it's for that reason. Previously, the ghosts I've encountered that could cause a cold were already extremely powerful characters. If I could really encounter one that could cause an accidental death, it would be a huge harvest.\"\n\nThis kind of ghost, one could be worth dozens, right?\n\nThe achievement of sending it to hell could also be counted as ten or even more, right?\n\n\"You're overthinking it, aren't you? Oh, speaking of which, I forgot to mention to the police that the clothes were white at first.\" Xu Qinglang clapped his hands. \"Maybe the key to solving the case lies in the change of clothing color. The killer must have designed some extremely clever...\"\n\n\"Are you possessed by Agatha Christie or Arthur Conan Doyle?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"No.\" Xu Qinglang looked at Zhou Ze with great resentment. \"Old Zhou, I'm finding you more and more boring. You used to at least play along a bit.\"\n\n\"Not in the mood.\"\n\n\"So, are we just going back now?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Back to catch ghosts?\"\n\n\"To play Ouija board.\"\n\n\"Why are you so childish?\"\n\n\"Ever heard of... entrapment?\"\n\n………………\n\nThe bookstore wasn't sealed off, but there were many police lines set up around its perimeter, and several police officers were wandering around, searching for clues.\n\nThis made the bookstore, which already had little business from the living, even quieter.\n\nZhou Ze had Bai Yingying buy an Ouija board set. He searched for a seller in Tongcheng on Taobao, then had Bai Yingying take a taxi directly to pick up the goods.\n\nPaper was spread out,\n\nA pile of seemingly useless items was placed to one side.\n\nXu Qinglang squatted nearby, watching Zhou Ze busy himself, and said somewhat helplessly, \"Actually, I have a few methods for summoning spirits that I think would work better than this game.\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head and said, \"It's different.\"\n\n\"How is it different?\"\n\n\"Last night, I didn't sense anything coming,\" Zhou Ze looked at Xu Qinglang. \"Did you sense anything?\"\n\n\"Did something come over last night?\"\n\nXu Qinglang's mind recalled the scene of the long pen sliding towards Zhou Ze when that group played Ouija.\n\n\"That must have been a coincidence. Didn't that overseas Chinese say that their activity last night was just a prelude to a confession? So, someone among them must have deliberately exerted force to point at the position behind you, which is that building, not actually at you.\"\n\n\"Excellent analysis.\" Zhou Ze reached out, lifted the paper from the floor, and then ran his fingernail over the tile, saying, \"Was this also deliberate?\"\n\nXu Qinglang's eyes immediately widened.\n\nOn the tiled floor, there was indeed a groove less than half a meter long, which might not be noticeable if one was standing.\n\nZhou Ze took out a pen, placed its tip on the groove, and slid it along the direction. He and Xu Qinglang also slowly turned in that direction.\n\nSubsequently,\n\nThe position his fingertip pointed to,\n\nwas Bai Yingying, who was currently sitting behind the counter playing *King of Glory*.* Zhou Ze had been sitting there last night.\n\nZhou Ze threw the pen down and looked at Xu Qinglang.\n\nMaking a small groove on a tile floor, that difficulty was extraordinary.\n\nXu Qinglang said in disbelief, \"No way, did something really get summoned last night? How come neither you nor I saw it?\"\n\n\"When Director Zhao came over last time, did we realize he was already dead?\n\nWhen the faceless woman disguised herself and came over last time, did we realize her true identity?\"\n\n\"This...\" Xu Qinglang trailed off.\n\nZhou Ze silently unfolded the paper again and picked up the pen. \"You think, given my identity, I might not be able to summon a Ouija spirit?\"\n\nZhou Ze was, strictly speaking, a grim reaper. He was different from the people in the Horror Story Enthusiasts Association last night.\n\n\"I don't know, but what I want to know is, did you notice something was off last night when you were sitting there watching the show?\" Xu Qinglang asked, pointing at Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze nodded,\n\n\"Although I didn't feel any special fluctuations, nor did I see anything I shouldn't have, when they pushed that pen in my direction, I felt a tremor in my heart, like something was staring at me.\"\n\n\"Then why didn't you tell them beforehand!\"\n\nXu Qinglang grabbed Zhou Ze's collar directly.\n\n\"You felt something was off, something that could even make *you* feel a tremor!\n\nWhen they said they were going to play that damn adventure game or confession game in the building behind, why didn't you stop them or warn them!\"\n\nZhou Ze reached out, not pushing away Xu Qinglang's hand that was gripping him, but instead wiped the saliva off his face that Xu Qinglang had sprayed while shouting furiously. Then, he looked at Xu Qinglang:\n\n\"What does it have to do with me?\"\n\nYes,\n\nWhat did it have to do with him?\n\nLetting go of Zhou Ze, Xu Qinglang stumbled back two steps. He suddenly felt that the person in front of him was somewhat unfamiliar.\n\n\"They are customers in my shop. According to commercial regulations, I naturally have an obligation to ensure their safety while they are reading books or having tea parties in my shop.\n\nBut since they have already left my shop, what happens next, what does it have to do with me?\"\n\n\"You weren't like this before,\" Xu Qinglang murmured.\n\n\"What needs to be done now is not to lament the past, nor to sigh about how things have changed, but to find that hidden thing and send it to hell.\"\n\n\"You're keen on this?\"\n\n\"This is performance. Didn't you always mock me for not having goals in life?\"\n\n\"You...\" Xu Qinglang licked his lips. \"Alright, you can investigate slowly. I'm done serving you.\"\n\nXu Qinglang waved his hand and stormed out of the bookstore.\n\nBai Yingying came out with tea at this moment, looking somewhat surprised.\n\n\"Boss, did you and Mr. Xu have a fight?\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't answer. Instead, he silently squatted down, continuing to look at the groove and the Ouija board diagram in front of him.\n\n\"Boss, I'm going to play games then,\" Bai Yingying placed the tea next to Zhou Ze, stuck out her tongue, and ran to the next door.\n\nShe didn't notice that Zhou Ze, squatting on the ground and looking at the Ouija board diagram, was constantly sweating on his forehead, while one hand was clutching his left chest tightly.\n\nDamn it,\n\nI must find that guy as soon as possible,\n\nOtherwise, more people will die,\n\nDamn it,\n\nWhy does it hurt so much!\n\nWhen Bai Yingying entered the noodle shop, Xu Qinglang was sitting there smoking. Seeing her come in, Xu Qinglang directly said,\n\n\"Is something wrong with your boss these past two days?\"\n\n\"I actually think he's become normal,\" Bai Yingying sat down and opened her computer.\n\n\"Become normal?\" Xu Qinglang scoffed twice. \"You didn't see someone fall to their death right in front of us yesterday, and he just stood there wiping his face with a tissue!\"\n\n\"That person fell to his death instantly, right? Could wiping his face have saved him?\"\n\nBai Yingying disdainfully entered the game. \"He was an experienced doctor in his previous life. He could tell if someone could be saved at a glance. Instead of running over and making useless noise, it's better to wipe your face clean first.\"\n\n\"Hey, I'm saying, you're on his side? Are you even human!\"\n\n\"Neither of us are human, actually.\"\n\n\"Smack!\"\n\nJust then,\n\nThe computer screen suddenly flickered, then went black.\n\nAnother power outage.\n\n\"Clang clang clang clang!\"\n\nBai Yingying furiously hammered the keyboard. \"I had a 98K upon landing, you know!\"\n\nXu Qinglang, who had been sitting there smoking, immediately ran out of the shop,\n\nLooked up,\n\nAt the sky,\n\nAt this moment,\n\nBy the window on the fifth floor,\n\nStood a man in white.\n\nMany police officers around were frantically making calls and using walkie-talkies to urge their colleagues inside the building to stop him, while a middle-aged police chief roared,\n\n\"How did someone get into the crime scene? What are you all doing!\"\n\n\"Thud!\"\n\nA dull, familiar landing sound,\n\nXu Qinglang stood rooted to the spot,\n\nStaring blankly as the person fell from the air.\n\nEverything,\n\nSeemed exactly the same as last night.\n\nHe instinctively closed his eyes.\n\nAt this moment,\n\nLives were falling like dumplings,\n\nOne after another,\n\nWorthless.\n\n---\n*Lu Chen is a famous Taiwanese magician.\n*King of Glory is a popular mobile multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game.",

    "content": "Hearing the clamor outside, Zhou Ze, who had been squatting, slumped onto the floor. The tiled floor was cold, but colder still was his heart.\n\nOh, he forgot. He had no heart.\n\nLifting his shirt, Zhou Ze saw that the place where his heart had been excavated was now restored. It had fully recovered in just one night. This made Zhou Ze wonder if he had fallen under some illusion, and perhaps, his heart was still there.\n\nBecause he could feel his heartbeat, his body still maintained vitality, and there seemed to be nothing wrong with it.\n\nBut it seemed that some emotion had been extracted. Some of his primal reactions had been marked with a forbidden symbol, as if an invisible wall had trapped him.\n\nLast night, he should have rushed to the deceased's side, like Xu Qinglang, even if his first reaction was that the deceased was definitely dead. But the original him would have reacted that way.\n\nJust like a moment ago, when Xu Qinglang reprimanded him, he retorted, \"What does it have to do with me?\"\n\nActually, given his state last night—after fighting that monkey and then being inexplicably pulled to a dining table by that strange old man to savor a unique meal—he was already a bit dazed. Even if he sensed something while that group played the Ouija board game, he couldn't have made any clear reactions.\n\nLast night, he was a startled bird, seeing enemies everywhere, and any so-called \"stirring\" was rather vague.\n\nOf course, these were all excuses. Zhou Ze now clearly felt like he was undergoing \"orthodontic treatment\": he could still eat and drink, but he was always restricted and just felt uncomfortable.\n\nPeople are like this: no matter how great the misfortune or oppression you face, as long as there's still hope before you, you'll always cling to it desperately and continue to move forward.\n\nZhou Ze in the orphanage was like this, Zhou Ze in the hospital was like this, and even now, he was like this.\n\nTo put it nicely, it's resilience; to put it bluntly, it's that a bad life is better than a good death.\n\nSupporting himself with both hands, he looked up and let out a long sigh.\n\nHe hadn't made it in time.\n\nHe had been telling himself he needed to find that thing soon, catch it, throw it into hell, and earn a good performance bonus. This was definitely a lucrative one.\n\nBut he also clearly knew that until that thing was found, if one person died, there would surely be a second and a third.\n\nOnce a ghost really kills, it only becomes more insane. For a ghost, repentance means vanishing into thin air. And because of this, people would continue to mysteriously end their lives in this manner.\n\nBut Zhou Ze couldn't think that way, couldn't make that his goal to worry about, otherwise, the agonizing pain in his chest would make him wish he were dead.\n\nJust as the old man said at the dining table: a person, once without a conscience, can't be good for anything.\n\nJust then, his gaze fixed on the ceiling, where he saw a faint black line.\n\nSuddenly, Zhou Ze's body trembled.\n\nHe found it. He found that thing.\n\nIt hadn't entered at all. It wasn't in this bookstore last night.\n\nIt was above. Its gaze was looking down, watching everything here!\n\nAnd its extended hand even influenced the pen tip, little by little, joining the game in this manner.\n\nThis was an inconceivable method, a method beyond Zhou Ze's comprehension.\n\n\"Now, finally, no one else has to die!\"\n\n\"Hiss... so painful...\"\n\nZhou Ze, who had just stood up, had to bend down and squat again.\n\n\"Now, the performance bonus can finally be earned.\"\n\nAlright, it doesn't hurt anymore.\n\nDamn it!\n\n...\n\n\"The deceased is Chen Yinong,\" Xu Qinglang said to Zhou Ze, who had just walked out, chewing betel nut.\n\n\"The guy who was going to confess last night?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Yes, that's him. I just overheard some police officers. He must have just finished giving his statement. Who knew he'd appear here right after leaving the police station, and then jump down.\"\n\nThe police hadn't identified any specific suspects, so after Zhou Ze and Xu Qinglang gave their statements, the others were also allowed to leave after their investigations were concluded. The only restriction was that they were not allowed to leave Tongcheng during this period.\n\n\"So he returned from the police station and committed suicide for love?\" Zhou Ze sighed. \"What a terrifying wedding.\"\n\n\"Hey, can you be more considerate with your words? The person is dead,\" Xu Qinglang told Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Considerate? Do you need to be considerate? I still have some冥鈔 (underworld money)<sup>1</sup>; if you need them, you can burn some,\" Zhou Ze shrugged.\n\n\"This idiotic method of accumulating virtue by burning underworld money, I wonder who invented it. Do you think burning underworld money can make you accumulate virtue and solve all problems?\"\n\n\"That sounds like saying money is the root of all evil. Then why don't you sell all your twenty-something apartments and donate them to Project Hope<sup>2</sup>?\"\n\n\"............\" Xu Qinglang.\n\n\"Accompany me somewhere,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Where?\"\n\nZhou Ze pointed to the tall building on the west side and said, \"There.\"\n\n...\n\nThis commercial center has several tall buildings, all connected by passages. Of course, with the decline of this commercial center, the businesses in these tall buildings had long since moved out. This is one manifestation of urban overdevelopment, where the construction of high-rises exceeds people's daily needs, often resulting in these massive, 'ghost' buildings, also a waste of resources.\n\nThe elevators were out of service, so Zhou Ze and Xu Qinglang had to take the stairs.\n\n\"Hey, those two jumped from across the street,\" Xu Qinglang reminded him. \"It was across the street, directly above your shop and mine. Why are you coming here?\"\n\nTheir current location was west of Zhou Ze and Xu Qinglang's shops, nearly a hundred meters away from where the suicides occurred.\n\n\"You're also a玄修 (mystic cultivator)<sup>3</sup>, so what makes even you, an insider, mistakenly believe that a ghost killing someone requires it to stand in front of them and stab them with a knife, just like a living person?\" Zhou Ze retorted.\n\n\"Then what makes you so sure that thing would be here?\"\n\n\"The groove on the tile.\"\n\nThe two had already reached the fourth floor. Zhou Ze chose a spot that was directly aligned with his shop and shortest in distance, then gently slid his index finger across the floor.\n\n\"What does this mean?\" Xu Qinglang asked.\n\n\"If you're just going to be a curious baby asking 'why' next to me, I suggest you go act in a suspense TV show, because they always need a clueless assistant standing next to the protagonist, constantly asking 'why' to set up the protagonist to show off.\"\n\n\"Damn it, you're getting more and more sarcastic,\" Xu Qinglang grumbled.\n\n\"Because I've always treated you like a brother, not a woman,\" Zhou Ze said, patting Xu Qinglang's shoulder.\n\n\"But you don't seem particularly gentle with Bai Yingying either.\"\n\nZhou Ze made another index finger sliding motion, then said, \"Actually, this should be a parallel line, do you understand?\"\n\n\"You mean when that group of people played the Ouija board game last night, they really summoned something, but that thing didn't get close. Instead, it stood roughly where we are now. And then, using its finger, it controlled the movement of the pen tip, pointing at you?\"\n\n\"That's right,\" Zhou Ze said with a slight smile. \"So, that bold entity, when those amateur association members asked if they could see a ghost tonight, the pen tip was controlled to point at me. It didn't mind offending me, and it didn't even mind killing someone right next to me.\"\n\n\"That arrogant?\"\n\n\"No, in my eyes, that means its value is greater, and the performance bonus obtained after taking it in will be even more significant. This is a big fish, a big fish that doesn't even put a鬼差 (soul reaper)<sup>4</sup> in its eyes.\"\n\n\"Then isn't that very dangerous?\" Xu Qinglang muttered somewhat.\n\n\"That's why I called you,\" Zhou Ze looked at Xu Qinglang. \"I said I treat you like a brother, so if the other party is terrifying, we'll die together. Isn't that romantic?\"\n\n\"............\" Xu Qinglang.\n\n\"Romantic my ass, you pervert!\"\n\n\"It's fine, at worst, we go to hell. I've been there, I know the way.\"\n\nZhou Ze gestured again, then took out his phone to look at the line in the photo, continuing to estimate the angle in his mind, and then pointed to the roof, \"On the fifth floor, it shouldn't be too far off.\"\n\n\"Hey, you should have at least told me earlier so I could bring some magic tools!\" Xu Qinglang complained as he followed Zhou Ze up the stairs.\n\n\"Remember that night you subdued Bai Yingying, whether you had magic tools or not, it didn't make much difference.\"\n\nXu Qinglang was momentarily speechless and cursed, \"You heartless bastard.\"\n\nZhou Ze paused in his steps and smiled.\n\nThen, the two walked together to the easternmost window on the fifth floor.\n\nThis place was originally supposed to be an amusement park, but it was now covered in dust. Some unremoved machinery and facilities were still left there, creating a desolate atmosphere.\n\nXu Qinglang was a bit nervous, while Zhou Ze continued to walk unhurriedly.\n\nIt should be around this spot.\n\nSuddenly, Zhou Ze stopped in front of an inflatable toy castle.\n\n\"Oh, long time no see!\"\n\nA familiar voice came from behind the inflatable bed.\n\nZhou Ze looked up and saw an old man in a dirty, stained Taoist robe jumping down from there.\n\n\"Brother, long time no see! I've really missed you. Come, come, let's drink tonight. My treat. I'll repay you for last time!\"\n\nThe old Taoist walked over and greeted Zhou Ze.\n\nAt that moment, Xu Qinglang instinctively formed hand seals:\n\n\"天地無極，玄心正法 (Boundless Heaven and Earth, Profound Heart Orthodox Law)!\"\n\nHe bit his index finger, then touched the old Taoist's glabella. The speed was incredibly fast, without any hesitation.\n\nBut what happened next shocked Xu Qinglang. The old Taoist merely glanced at Xu Qinglang twice as if nothing had happened, annoyed:\n\n\"Is this woman of yours crazy, or is this your family custom? Do you like to smear blood on people's faces when you greet them? This is even cooler than the Dai Water Splashing Festival! Come, come, allow this humble Taoist to teach you our hometown customs.\"\n\nSaying that, the old Taoist reached down to scratch his crotch, as if to return Xu Qinglang's gesture.\n\nBut at that moment, Zhou Ze suddenly reached out, his nails extending, and directly grabbed the old Taoist's neck.\n\nAnd in the old Taoist's hand, which had just been in his crotch, he had somehow pinched a bright yellow talisman, looking at Zhou Ze with surprise:\n\n\"Damn it... you're faster... than me...\"\n\nZhou Ze glanced at the talisman, then exerted force with his nails. The old Taoist felt as if he had been electrocuted. Finally, with a gentle push from Zhou Ze, the old Taoist fell to the ground and rolled several times.\n\nIgnoring the old Taoist who lay on the ground, unconscious, Zhou Ze directly leaped over the inflatable bed.\n\nBehind the inflatable bed, lay a person, covered in injuries.\n\nHe found it. It was indeed here.\n\n***\n<sup>1</sup>冥鈔 (míngchāo): Spirit money or hell money, burned as offerings to the deceased in Chinese traditional religion.\n<sup>2</sup>希望工程 (Xīwàng Gōngchéng): Project Hope, a Chinese public service project that aims to help children in poverty-stricken areas to continue their schooling.\n<sup>3</sup>玄修 (xuánxiū): A term for a practitioner of mystical or esoteric arts, often related to Taoism or other forms of spiritual cultivation.\n<sup>4</sup>鬼差 (guǐchāi): In Chinese folklore, a soul reaper or an emissary from the underworld, responsible for guiding or capturing souls.",

    "content": "This was a woman, covered by a white dress, but beneath the white dress, her body was riddled with injuries, seemingly every inch bearing different wounds, a truly shocking sight.\n\nFrom Zhou Ze’s professional perspective, it was a miracle this woman was still alive.\n\nIn typical gunfight movies, tragic characters, after being shot multiple times, can summon a final surge of inner energy for a lengthy, melodramatic flashback, then repeatedly shout, “You go!” “I’m not going!” “If you don’t go, I won’t either!” before finally grabbing a gun and mowing down a few enemies. This is practically impossible in reality.\n\nHumans are, in fact, very fragile.\n\nThe reason this woman was still alive, still breathing, with a slight rise and fall of her chest, was related to her unique nature.\n\nZhou Ze walked straight over, then tapped his palm with his fingernail, preparing to open the Gates of Hell.\n\n“So direct?” Xu Qinglang asked from behind. “Aren’t you going to ask her anything?”\n\n“Nothing to ask.”\n\nWhile she was still unconscious, pulling her soul out of her body and sending it to Hell would be perfect.\n\nHowever, just then, the old Taoist, whom Zhou Ze had thrown, got back up and rushed towards Zhou Ze.\n\nXu Qinglang stepped forward, extended his arm to block the old Taoist, then flung him aside. The old Taoist had just been “electrocuted” by Zhou Ze’s fingernails, and his body was still weak, so he was no match for Xu Qinglang.\n\n“Don’t… don’t do this, spare her, please spare her.”\n\nThe old Taoist, lying to the side, began to plead.\n\nBut Zhou Ze was unmoved. A string, resembling black syrup, was pulled out, forming a circle.\n\nThen, Zhou Ze reached out, intending to pull her soul from her body. Although this soul was currently very weak, Zhou Ze could already sense its formidable strength.\n\nThis was a big fish, a much plumper prey than the small fry and shrimp he had caught before!\n\n“Buzz!”\n\nAt this moment, a fountain pen suddenly floated up and shot directly towards Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze, quick-witted, leaned back slightly, dodging the pen. But the pen’s true target was not Zhou Ze, but Xu Qinglang. Its tip touched Xu Qinglang’s throat.\n\nThough Xu Qinglang’s Adam’s apple was not very prominent, he now stood with his hands spread, daring not to move.\n\nThe woman on the ground still had her eyes closed. She was still in a coma, but she was controlling all of this.\n\n“Lao Zhou, don’t rush, don’t rush!”\n\nXu Qinglang shouted, fearing Zhou Ze would disregard his life. After all, his life was hanging by a thread, no less than someone pointing a pistol at his temple.\n\nHowever, Zhou Ze truly disregarded his life and reached for the woman’s forehead.\n\nThe pen tip, at that moment, pierced Xu Qinglang’s neck, creating a small cut, and blood began to flow.\n\n“Ugh…” Xu Qinglang felt the pain from his neck but dared not reach for the pen. He had a premonition that if he made any sudden move, the pen would instantly pierce his neck.\n\nThe woman was still unconscious, but to Zhou Ze, it was a silent threat.\n\nShe couldn’t harm Zhou Ze, but she could threaten him with the lives of those around him.\n\n“Those two who jumped to their deaths were very pitiful,” Zhou Ze suddenly said.\n\nXu Qinglang was stunned, unsure what Zhou Ze meant by suddenly bringing that up.\n\n“You cursed me this morning for not warning them last night, and said I had changed,” Zhou Ze continued.\n\n“Huh?” Xu Qinglang.\n\n“So, I think you’re willing to sacrifice yourself to avenge them, right?”\n\n“…………” Xu Qinglang.\n\nZhou Ze suddenly clutched his chest with one hand and pressed the other to the ground. Cold sweat broke out on his face, and he made no further moves.\n\nThe fountain pen also fell weakly to the ground. Xu Qinglang clutched the small wound on his neck, gasping for air, muttering something unintelligible.\n\nThe old Taoist quickly ran to the woman’s side, checking her condition, looking anxious and bewildered.\n\nZhou Ze glared at Xu Qinglang with resentment. If he had known, he wouldn’t have brought him. He had only thought that an extra person could help him find the target faster. Who would have thought Xu Qinglang would become a bargaining chip for the opponent to threaten him?\n\nOriginally, Zhou Ze should have disregarded Xu Qinglang’s life to complete his task, but he forcibly changed his mind. This caused a sharp pain in his chest, almost killing him.\n\nDamn it,\n\nThis is a transaction, isn’t it?\n\nIs this also about conscience?\n\nAnd it hurts me?\n\nBesides, if he dies, who will make me sour plum juice?\n\nI’m just thinking about myself!\n\nThe old Taoist fumbled in his crotch again, pulling out a talisman. This guy’s talismans were truly inexhaustible, and he specifically liked to hide them in that spot. Who knows if there’s some special significance to it.\n\n“Brother, I’m sorry, but I must protect this person. She finally escaped from Rongcheng, and I can’t let her fall into your hands.”\n\nThe old Taoist said to Zhou Ze, holding the talisman, finally apologizing:\n\n“I’m sorry.”\n\nWith that, the old Taoist was about to press the talisman onto Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze abruptly looked up, a black glint flashing in his eyes. However, before Zhou Ze could act, two figures appeared directly behind the old Taoist.\n\nXu Qinglang clutched his neck, but the syllables he uttered began to become clear.\n\nThe old Taoist was lifted up. He turned his head to find that a man and a woman had appeared behind him at some point—two empty human skins, yet possessing strength no less than ordinary people.\n\n“Bang!”\n\n“Crap!”\n\nThe old Taoist was thrown out again, crashing onto the tiled floor.\n\nWrithed his body, clutching his waist, the old Taoist cried:\n\n“My back…!”\n\nZhou Ze slowly calmed the sharp pain in his chest and raised his hand again. He knew the woman before him was very weak; her previous resistance and stalemate were the limits of what she could do.\n\n“Brother, I beg you, spare her, let us go.”\n\n“Let you go?” Xu Qinglang, one hand clutching his neck, the other controlling the two puppet skins, slowly walked towards the old Taoist. “Then who will settle the score for those two who jumped to their deaths?”\n\n“Those two weren’t killed by us! We didn’t touch them! We even wanted to save them! They wanted to die themselves!” the old Taoist explained.\n\n“Do you think we’d believe such words?” Xu Qinglang scoffed.\n\nSeeing Xu Qinglang’s appearance, as if possessed by a “light bringer,” the old Taoist disregarded him and looked at Zhou Ze, pleading:\n\n“Brother, she’s also one of our冥店 (Underworld Shop) people, a friend of our boss. She was injured helping my boss.”\n\nThe old Taoist remembered that when he first met Zhou Ze, Zhou Ze was quite interested in his boss’s affairs. At this point, he could only try to bring up his boss.\n\nZhou Ze’s hand had just touched the woman’s forehead, not yet exerting force, but upon hearing the old Taoist’s words, he immediately stopped.\n\nShe was that man’s companion?\n\nThe man who was struggling to drink porridge behind the Underworld Shop counter in the old Taoist’s live stream video?\n\nThe man who had warned him about the Faceless Woman’s scheme by the pool in his dream?\n\nHe owed him a favor.\n\n“Hiss…”\n\nHis chest began to ache again.\n\nZhou Ze took deep breaths repeatedly, then retreated two steps, staggering to his feet.\n\nFortunately, the pain did not last too long, but every time he made a choice that went against the principle of self-interest, whenever he started to be burdened by personal relationships, it would remind him.\n\nLike a venomous scorpion, always hidden in his chest.\n\nThere was a famous monkey cage electric shock experiment.\n\nPerhaps, the cost and purpose of having no conscience were like this: to make you develop a conditioned fear reflex, and then slowly break your old “bad” habits.\n\n“You didn’t actually believe him, did you?” Xu Qinglang looked at Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze waved his hand.\n\n“Hey, who’d be stupid enough to jump to their death one after another? You even said earlier…”\n\n“I trust that guy.” Zhou Ze glanced at Xu Qinglang, then looked at the old Taoist. “Take the person with you. Don’t appear before me again.”\n\nThe reputation of a man precedes him. Zhou Ze no longer believed that the incident of the two lovers jumping to their deaths on consecutive days was the woman’s doing. This woman might have participated in the Ouija Board game and acted in it, but she was definitely not killing people.\n\nThe little loli once said that the man in Rongcheng had gone too far, acting as a judge, operating outside human law to carry out his so-called righteous judgments, which led to a ban from the Underworld.\n\nTherefore, a friend of such a person could not be a casually murderous evil spirit. Otherwise, with that guy’s personality, he would be the first to kill the woman himself.\n\nThis deduction was truly more credible than any so-called evidence, because even when the little loli spoke of that person, she only mocked his overconfidence but never spoke ill of his personal character.\n\nThe old Taoist immediately got up, clutching his waist, profusely thanking him. But when he reached the woman, he grimaced and said:\n\n“Brother, we have nowhere to go! She told me to bring her here, thinking that by staying close to you, we could hide in plain sight and those who are after her wouldn’t notice us here.\n\nIf I take her away now, wouldn’t it be like walking into a trap?”\n\n“You… are being hunted?” Zhou Ze asked.\n\n“Uh, something like that. Anyway, those guys are elusive; they can pop out anywhere—from mirrors, crowds, even bushes, underground. We were lucky to escape alive.”\n\n“That’s pointless. Her injuries have severely worsened, and she won’t last much longer,” Zhou Ze rubbed his fingers. “Once this physical body is destroyed, if she remains purely in soul form, she’ll either be discovered quickly or fall directly into Hell.”\n\n“We went to a hospital earlier to try and treat the injuries, but as soon as we entered the room, the doctor, who seemed perfectly normal, stripped off his clothes and turned into a hideous creature intent on killing us.”\n\nThe old Taoist said, looking very troubled.\n\n“It was only in these two days, staying near you, that we’ve found some peace.”\n\n“I can’t help you,” Zhou Ze shrugged.\n\nHe admired the man from Rongcheng, and the favor he owed him had been repaid by turning a blind eye this time. He was unwilling to cause any more complications; otherwise, next time, the little loli would come with a group of ghost officers directly to his bookstore.\n\nAt this moment, the fountain pen that had fallen to the ground suddenly stood upright. Xu Qinglang’s face changed, showing alertness.\n\nBut the pen merely wrote a few words on the ground:\n\n“Save me, I’ll give you my heart.”\n\nSeeing these words, Zhou Ze’s gaze suddenly sharpened.\n\n“Shameless hussy!\n\nHow confident is this woman in her looks? Save you and you’ll give your heart to whom?”\n\nXu Qinglang scoffed from the side, “No matter how beautiful you were before, in this monstrous state, what idiot would want your heart?!”\n\n“I would.”\n\n“What?” Xu Qinglang was stunned, looking at Zhou Ze. It was as if, at this moment, Xu Qinglang truly saw Zhou Ze clearly. Doctor Lin was so beautiful, yet he could pass her door three times without entering. It turned out he had this kind of taste.\n\n“Brother, didn’t you just say there was no way?” the old Taoist asked, puzzled.\n\n“Oh, I forgot. I just remembered, in my past life, I was Tongcheng’s best surgeon.”",

    "content": "\"Hey, Zhou Ze, you've changed. Are you still human? You're the one who said she killed those two people before, and now you're the one who wants to save her! One minute you want me to go with you to catch the killer, the next you want me to help you move the killer back.\n\nWhat exactly do you take me for?!\"\n\nBack in the bookstore, Xu Qinglang muttered, directly pointing at Zhou Ze's back.\n\nNo, to be precise, ever since they came down from the building, Xu Qinglang hadn't stopped his verbal assault, rambling on like he was scolding a scumbag husband who had been out fooling around for several nights, not coming home, and not even providing living expenses.\n\nBai Yingying sat behind the counter, playing on her phone. She didn't dare to open the computer to play games now; the occasional power cuts were truly unbearable.\n\nZhou Ze hadn't intended to pay attention to Xu Qinglang; he didn't have the time. But Xu Qinglang seemed to be addicted to running his mouth, so Zhou Ze turned around, pointed a finger directly at the other's nose, and said:\n\n\"What do I take you for? Haven't you heard the saying, 'No investigation, no right to speak'?\n\nI don't know her, but I know her friend. I owe that person a favor. I'm just asking you, is that reason good enough?\"\n\n\"What about those two who died...\"\n\n\"Do I know those two who died?\" Zhou Ze retorted, \"What do they have to do with me? Am I Joan of Arc or Hai Rui? Do I demand the locals build me a temple for my merits and incense?\n\nI'm just an unlucky ghost, bought by an idiot who ran me over and killed me, and then by some twist of fate, I possessed this idiot's body!\n\nI'm not a human; I'm just a ghost. So please, Xu-boss, with your twenty-something apartments, don't use your set of universal values to demand things of me!\n\nYou want me to sacrifice? You want me to pursue truth and reality?\n\nThen please, when that pen was poking your neck just now, yell: 'Fire at me!'\n\nYou can't even do it yourself, and you have the nerve to criticize others?\n\nI'm a ghost. For a long time, I didn't even have a legal identity. Under such circumstances, you still demand that I be 'for all,' but when will 'all' be for me?\"\n\n\"You...\"\n\n\"What 'you'? Didn't you yourself violate the rules to forcibly keep your parents' souls here to enjoy some kind of family reunion atmosphere?\n\nWhen you were doing that, why didn't you think about how many families who lost loved ones in this world don't get that kind of treatment?\n\nI don't care if she killed anyone or not. The favor I owe that person in Rongcheng is enough for me to turn a blind eye!\n\nI don't care if she's the killer or not. She promised to find my heart, so I'm willing to help her heal!\n\nIt's that simple!\n\nSo, please, take your arrogance, your self-righteousness, your high-mindedness, and roll smoothly to the next room!\"\n\nZhou Ze finished these words in one breath, letting out a long sigh. To be honest, he had been very annoyed lately, especially after the Monkey incident. Truly, very, very annoyed.\n\nHe shouldn't have meddled. He could have even covered his eyes and pretended not to see anything, so he wouldn't have to make any choices, and that old hag wouldn't have taken his heart.\n\nLearning from the ostrich, burying his head in the sand, sticking his rear up, waddling around,\n\nShouting, \"This world is so beautiful, so beautiful, so beautiful!\"\n\nHow good would that be,\n\nHow comfortable.\n\nXu Qinglang swallowed hard. Faced with Zhou Ze's verbal counterattack, he was somewhat at a loss.\n\nThe atmosphere suddenly turned cold.\n\nBai Yingying had been watching for a long time, not daring to interject.\n\nXu Qinglang pointed a finger at Zhou Ze, his despair greater than a broken heart, truly like a gale-torn begonia, somewhat disheveled. Then he flicked his sleeve and turned to walk towards the door, but stopped when he pushed open the glass door and said:\n\n\"What do you want for lunch?\"\n\n\"Tomato beef rice bowl with strawberry juice, please,\" Zhou Ze replied without hesitation.\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\nXu Qinglang left to go make food.\n\nBai Yingying stuck out her tongue, then covered her nose.\n\nZhou Ze looked at her, \"If you want to say you smell something sour again, then the toilet is clogged again. Brush the toilet three more times.\"\n\nBai Yingying immediately shook her head, \"It smells sweet.\"\n\nJust then, a van stopped in front of the bookstore.\n\n\"Go move the things.\"\n\nUnder Zhou Ze's command, Bai Yingying went out and carried two boxes in. The van dropped the things off and left.\n\n\"What's in here?\" Bai Yingying asked.\n\n\"Simple surgical instruments.\" Zhou Ze opened one of the boxes and took out a pair of gloves, putting them on.\n\n\"Boss, how did you get these delivered?\"\n\n\"I was a doctor in my last life.\"\n\n\"Uh, and then?\"\n\n\"Then, of course, I know which director smuggles medical equipment, takes kickbacks, and enriches himself. It's quite simple to make a call and threaten him, making him send over some inexpensive instruments.\"\n\n\"You can do that?\" Bai Yingying was stunned, taking a while to react.\n\n\"Bring the things upstairs.\" Zhou Ze said, then went upstairs first.\n\nOn the mat on the second floor, the woman lay there, and the old Daoist priest squatted beside her, a cigarette in his mouth. When Zhou Ze came over, the old Daoist priest said somewhat worriedly:\n\n\"Brother, do you have a plan?\"\n\n\"Then you can send her to the hospital and be discovered by those ghost officers.\"\n\nThe old Daoist priest said nothing more.\n\nBai Yingying carried one box in each hand, not bothered at all. Sometimes Zhou Ze would feel he was losing out; if he had opened a construction team instead of a bookstore, having Bai Yingying as an employee would definitely be a profit, saving on excavators and bulldozers and the like.\n\nEverything was ready. After sterilizing the instruments, Zhou Ze began to prepare for the surgery.\n\n\"Brother, no anesthesia?\" the old Daoist priest reminded from the side.\n\n\"She doesn't need anesthesia. Her mental fortitude is terrifying.\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head and directly used scissors to cut open the wound that had been hastily bandaged after the woman's injury.\n\nThese wounds were not poorly treated, but the injuries themselves were unusual; ordinary bandaging would have no effect.\n\n\"That's true. They say she once went half a year without sleep and still pulled through,\" the old Daoist priest mumbled beside them.\n\nZhou Ze propped open a wound on her left arm, then poked inside with forceps. The woman remained unresponsive; she seemed to be in a deep sleep.\n\nImmediately after, Zhou Ze used the forceps to pull out a black feather from inside the wound and dropped it onto the metal tray Bai Yingying was holding.\n\n\"Clink...\"\n\nThe feather was very soft, but it made a crisp sound when it fell.\n\n\"This humble Daoist remembers that this feather should come from a black feather duster. A pale-faced guy in black clothes chased us with it.\"\n\n\"Black Wuchang?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Don't know, a bit like it,\" the old Daoist priest replied.\n\nZhou Ze was noncommittal and continued to clean the wound.\n\nGood heavens,\n\nWho knows how many strange things were embedded in this woman's body?\n\nIn the following time, Zhou Ze successively extracted broken talismans, dart blades carved with runes, and let out silver mercury fluid. It was like opening a general store; there was everything.\n\nBai Yingying and the old Daoist priest on the side watched, their eyes wide with amazement.\n\nDuring the process, although the remaining debris inside the wounds was cleaned out one by one, for this body, it was no less than a secondary injury. Therefore, Zhou Ze was also constantly monitoring the woman's condition.\n\nFinally, when Zhou Ze removed two pieces of red broken glass from the wound on the woman's lower abdomen, he noticed a faint black mist rising from her body, and a shadow seemed to be floating out.\n\nOnly Zhou Ze could see this phenomenon.\n\nThis was a sign that the body was almost collapsing and unable to sustain the soul. Interpreted from a scientific perspective, it meant that the patient was about to die from ineffective rescue.\n\nZhou Ze's right fingernail grew longer, and he directly grabbed the black shadow, pushing it back into her body.\n\n\"Mm...\"\n\nA faint sound, almost imperceptible, was heard.\n\n\"Just hold on a little longer. There are a few more wounds that need to be treated, and then apply some medicine. If you get through this, your body will slowly recover.\"\n\nThis was the most unique surgery Zhou Ze had ever performed in his medical career. Not to mention the complexity of the patient's injuries, just the fact that he was simultaneously treating and pushing the patient's nearly-departing soul back into her body, if publicized, would shock the entire medical community.\n\nThis was almost like cheating, like playing an arcade game where you have countless coins to continuously revive yourself.\n\nOf course, Zhou Ze also knew that this was also because the woman's soul was inherently strong. An ordinary person's soul might withstand one such ordeal, but repeated instances would likely lead to immediate collapse.\n\nFrom this perspective, the woman's resilience was indeed terrifying.\n\nZhou Ze even felt a bit curious: if a woman beside him was so resilient and terrifying, what kind of person was that fellow stirring up trouble in Rongcheng himself?\n\nBirds of a feather flock together, after all.\n\nAfter treating the last wound and applying the medicine, Zhou Ze let out a long sigh.\n\nNext, it would be up to her own willpower to endure. Once her body slowly recovered, the problem shouldn't be too big.\n\nIn fact, if that old geezer who had dug out his heart was still around, getting some medicine from him would be best. Zhou Ze's own chest wound had already healed, without even a scar.\n\nOf course, Zhou Ze sometimes wondered if the other party had truly cut him open and dug out his heart.\n\nOr perhaps, he had just been under some kind of illusion, but then where did that feeling of pain come from whenever he tried to go against his own interests and do something else?\n\nThe woman was settled upstairs. The old Daoist priest went to the restaurant next door for a meal, and Bai Yingying went to play games. Only Zhou Ze remained, checking on the woman's condition.\n\nAbout a few hours later, Zhou Ze, who was sitting by the side reading a book, suddenly noticed the woman's eyelids move, and then he saw her open her eyes.\n\nThe woman was looking at him,\n\nHe was also looking at the woman.\n\n\"How do you feel?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nThe woman nodded slightly, indicating that her body was recovering.\n\n\"Heh, what's your name?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nThe woman was silent for a long time. Just as Zhou Ze was wondering if her physical condition didn't allow her to speak, the woman opened her mouth:\n\n\"Tang... Shi...\"\n\n\"My name is...\" Zhou Ze paused, then asked with a bit of curiosity:\n\n\"When you introduce yourself to others, do you often encounter jokers who reply that their name is Song Ci?\"",

    "content": "The days passed unhurriedly, neither quickly nor slowly, for three more days.\n\nDuring these three days, Xu Qinglang was busy looking for a new shop. This long-abandoned commercial center had already seen two deaths. Setting up a shop here again would simply be asking for trouble. He had consulted Zhou Ze about whether he would be willing to move with him, and he could help Zhou Ze find a new storefront as well. Zhou Ze's response to this was noncommittal.\n\nOn one hand, Zhou Ze didn't really care much about the living human traffic around the bookstore. But on the other hand, without the juices prepared by Xu Qinglang, eating would become a problem again.\n\nAnother thing happened during these three days: the police found suicide notes at both Mr. Chen and Ms. Liu's homes, along with their wedding photos.\n\nHowever, the wedding photos were black and white, and the contents of the suicide notes were even harder for ordinary people to comprehend.\n\nThey had agreed to commit suicide together, in a terrifying manner, to end their lives. In their suicide notes, they apologized for the trouble and investigation caused to other members of the Horror Story Enthusiasts Association, stating at the same time that this was the true horror story.\n\nThey had met because of their love for \"horror,\" so naturally, they had to prove their love in the most \"horrifying\" way.\n\nThese messages also spread online, causing a public outcry and reigniting debate. Many prominent online personalities once again wielded their whips to criticize horror and suspense films and novels, saying, \"Look, this is misleading; these things should be banned.\"\n\nBut in reality, what should be banned are ancient love stories like \"Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai,\" because these stories glorified the theme of suicide, leading to continuous emulation of suicide in later generations.\n\nThe woman named Tang Shi had stayed upstairs. After her injuries were treated, she waited for three days. Zhou Ze finally came to her and said that he had done what he promised, and now it was her turn to fulfill her part of the agreement.\n\n\"Those two, they really committed suicide, right?\"\n\nTang Shi was still lying there, bandaged in many places, looking like a female mummy. There was no way to consider aesthetics, simply because her original injuries were too severe and too numerous.\n\n\"Yes,\" Zhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"When they were playing the Ouija board game, I sensed it,\" Tang Shi looked at Zhou Ze. \"At the time, I found it very interesting. They wanted to see a ghost but didn't realize that the owner of the bookstore they were in was a ghost, and a ghost messenger at that.\n\nIn fact, on the first night, when that woman was about to jump, I tried to control the white dress on me to stop her, but her mind was made up, and I was very weak, so I couldn't stop her. She still jumped.\"\n\nZhou Ze said nothing.\n\n\"Ignorant men and women always think death is a beautiful thing, but I guess they must be regretting it bitterly in hell now. Hell is a very terrifying place, enough to make most suicide victims regret their past foolish selves.\"\n\nSaying that, Tang Shi paused, then continued, \"You are much luckier than us; you haven't experienced the true horror of hell.\"\n\n\"It's time to get down to business,\" Zhou Ze reminded her.\n\n\"Your heart, is that it?\" Tang Shi asked.\n\n\"Otherwise?\"\n\n\"Don't you think your heart is gone?\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"But it can't be gone. There are many incredible things in this world, but generally, there's a line that balances things out.\n\nFor example, my injuries, as you've seen, those ghost messengers who escaped from the underworld, they left behind black feathers, mercury, talismans, and such on me. Their image appears mysterious and noble to ordinary people;\n\nBut in reality, just like even a goddess eventually needs to use the restroom, setting aside their mysterious ability to enter and exit hell, they are actually very ordinary.\n\nEven, they are far from having the ability to move mountains and fill oceans as described in so-called superhero movies or cultivation fantasy novels.\n\nOf course, I'm not saying no one has this ability, but I'm certain that any being with such an ability cannot leave hell.\"\n\n\"So, what exactly are you trying to say?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Regarding the matter of you losing your heart, you told me that you shouldn't be able to eat, just like us. These past few days, I've seen you eat only with extremely sweet and sour drinks, barely swallowing.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"But you said that when you ate your own heart, you didn't feel the slightest discomfort; you even found it a bit delicious.\"\n\n\"Are you saying that what I ate wasn't actually my heart? No, that I wasn't eating anything substantial at all.\"\n\nZhou Ze quickly understood and continued, \"The meal, the table, the knife and fork, in fact, were all fake, all an illusion.\"\n\nTang Shi nodded slightly. She seemed a bit tired, but still spoke:\n\n\"No matter how mysterious or terrifying an existence is, they don't have the ability to bring flesh to dry bones, much less to turn decay into wonder and extract a heart from a body while keeping its physical form as vital as before.\n\nSo, you must have been hypnotized, a very profound hypnosis, one from which you couldn't extricate yourself.\"\n\n\"Hypnosis?\"\n\n\"Yes, hypnosis. The dining environment, every word, every action of the other person, all of it was giving you psychological suggestions. Otherwise, why wouldn't he just pick up some firewood by the roadside and have a barbecue with you?\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded. In fact, Tang Shi's words largely coincided with his own previous suspicions.\n\nFor example, every time he made a choice that went against his immediate interests, his chest would ache. But as long as he endured it for a while, he could still continue with his original choice.\n\nBecause he subconsciously believed that he had no conscience, every time he did something based on \"conscience,\" he would remind himself:\n\nOh, I shouldn't do this, and then it would hurt.\n\nIt was like someone who had suffered hardship in childhood and had psychological trauma; when they encountered similar situations or scenes again, it would still cause physical and mental discomfort.\n\n\"So, I should see a psychologist?\"\n\n\"I know a very skilled psychologist who can help you solve your problem,\" Tang Shi said.\n\n\"That one?\" Zhou Ze naturally thought of who it was.\n\n\"As long as he can come back alive, he can solve your problem.\"\n\n\"Who knows where he's run off to now?\"\n\n\"He didn't run,\" Tang Shi corrected him, \"He went to find them.\"\n\nThe conversation ended there. As Zhou Ze prepared to go downstairs, Tang Shi said again, \"Can you call that female zombie up?\"\n\n\"What for?\"\n\n\"To let her sleep with me.\"\n\n\"I'll ask her if she agrees.\"\n\nDownstairs, Bai Yingying was playing a mobile game behind the counter. Zhou Ze ignored her, and he didn't ask Bai Yingying for the woman upstairs's opinion. He just walked out of the store and hailed a cab.\n\nA psychologist, he really did know a very good one.\n\nLast time, Wang Ke had told him that he wouldn't seek Zhou Ze out again, but if Zhou Ze needed anything, he could come to him.\n\nHe was right, after all.\n\nIt was already eleven in the morning when the cab reached the entrance of Wang Ke's villa. Zhou Ze pressed the doorbell.\n\nThe door opened, and Wang Ke, dressed in pajamas, appeared at the doorway. He was surprised to see Zhou Ze, then motioned for Zhou Ze to come in.\n\nThe smell of meat wafted from inside the house; something was simmering in the kitchen.\n\n\"Want to eat something?\" Wang Ke suggested. \"Just bought some big bones, been simmering for a long time. I remember when we were kids at the orphanage, it wasn't easy to get a meal with meat.\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. \"I don't have much of an appetite.\"\n\n\"It's okay, then just have some soup. By the way, you came to see me for something, didn't you?\"\n\n\"I was hypnotized. The hypnotist told me I had no conscience. Now, I want to get my conscience back,\" Zhou Ze said straightforwardly.\n\nWang Ke frowned, looking somewhat awkward and uneasy, and said,\n\n\"I tried last time, but I couldn't hypnotize you. You said you couldn't sleep under normal circumstances, so the most direct and effective method, I can't use on you. I'll have to try a roundabout approach to see if it works.\"\n\n\"Give it a try.\"\n\nThe two went to Wang Ke's study.\n\nWang Ke changed into a formal suit and sat behind his desk, then handed Zhou Ze a pocket watch.\n\n\"You use this to swing in front of me to try and hypnotize me. Then we can establish a reverse psychological connection.\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't hesitate, immediately holding the pocket watch and swinging it in front of Wang Ke.\n\nWang Ke watched very intently. As he watched, he closed his eyes.\n\nAt the same time, Zhou Ze also felt a little tired, as if Wang Ke's \"sleep\" at this moment had more or less affected him.\n\n\"Are you asleep?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nWang Ke didn't answer.\n\n\"What's your name?\"\n\n\"Wang Ke.\"\n\nIt was a very novel feeling. Zhou Ze didn't have much experience in this area, but at this moment, he seemed not to need any experience.\n\n\"You...\"\n\nSuddenly, Zhou Ze felt his vision blur. Vaguely, he seemed to hear a man asking him:\n\n\"Do you think you need a conscience?\"\n\nZhou Ze was a bit confused, but still said, \"Doing good things might not lead to good outcomes.\"\n\n\"So, deep down, you're actually very resistant to the behaviors you've always upheld,\" the man's voice came again.\n\nNext, there was a long conversation. Zhou Ze himself felt somewhat bewildered, as if the dialogue and questions had nothing to do with him.\n\nIn front of him, there was a pot, with soup simmering inside, boiling big bones. The aroma of the soup was rich.\n\n*Thump!*\n\nThe pocket watch fell from Zhou Ze's hand onto the floor.\n\nZhou Ze slowly opened his eyes.\n\nWang Ke, behind the desk, also opened his eyes, which were bloodshot and looked very tired.\n\n\"Was it successful?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nWang Ke nodded, then shook his head, apologizing:\n\n\"Your problem is a bit complex. Actually, the one truly struggling with whether or not to have a conscience is yourself. Perhaps some recent events have shaken your original beliefs, and with external forces pushing, it formed a knot in your heart.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded at the words, lost in thought.\n\n\"By the way, did you ask me anything?\" Wang Ke suddenly asked.\n\nThis kind of hypnosis was inherently reciprocal. In fact, Wang Ke was performing a shallow hypnosis on Zhou Ze, while Wang Ke, on the other hand, had completely bared his soul to Zhou Ze.\n\n\"I didn't ask, because I only saw a pot of meat soup. Are you very hungry?\"\n\n\"Yes, hungry,\" Wang Ke nodded.\n\nImmediately, Wang Ke pulled Zhou Ze into the kitchen and opened the pressure cooker, where spare ribs were stewing.\n\n\"Come, let's eat a little together, just like reliving childhood.\"\n\nZhou Ze suddenly felt a bit unreal.\n\nA wealthy psychologist happily stewing a pot of spare ribs for himself at home; this scene always felt a bit off.\n\nIn fact, Zhou Ze even felt a slight nausea and revulsion in his chest.\n\n\"I'm not eating.\"\n\nZhou Ze subconsciously stepped back a few paces, retreating from the kitchen.\n\nWang Ke, meanwhile, was meticulously preparing the dipping sauce, saying, \"Accompany your brother and eat a little.\"\n\n\"You eat it yourself,\" Zhou Ze still refused, his gaze occasionally sweeping towards the pressure cooker and the spare ribs tumbling within it.\n\n\"Don't be shy, this is meat I carefully selected; it's definitely going to taste good,\" Wang Ke continued to invite.\n\n\"Where's sister-in-law?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nWang Ke's hand, holding the plate, suddenly trembled, and his expression became somewhat unnatural,\n\nbut he still said, \"She went to get her hair done.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Zhou Ze said noncommittally.\n\nThen, Zhou Ze looked at the pressure cooker again.\n\nThe nausea and revulsion in his chest seemed to be intensifying.\n\n\"Honey, are you cooking meat soup again?\" At this moment, a woman's voice came from the entryway.\n\nZhou Ze turned his head and saw her. A feeling of a great weight being lifted off his shoulders suddenly came over him.\n\nI was overthinking it.\n\n\"Yeah, this is my only hobby,\" Wang Ke said with a cheerful laugh.\n\nThe woman walked beside Zhou Ze, saying somewhat helplessly, \"Isn't it incredible? A master psychologist's hobby is finding free time to simmer a pot of meat soup for himself, even if he can't actually eat it, he still enjoys the sense of satisfaction.\"\n\n\"It's alright,\" Zhou Ze pursed his lips. \"Conditions weren't good when we were little, so we're fulfilling a dream now that we're grown.\"\n\n\"Here, have a bowl.\"\n\nWang Ke scooped a bowl of soup, sprinkled it with minced garlic and chopped green onions, added two drops of sesame oil, and some white pepper.\n\nZhou Ze picked up the bowl of soup, hesitating whether to force himself to drink some,\n\nbut then he suddenly noticed,\n\nthe woman standing beside him,\n\nshe was walking on her tiptoes,\n\none step, two steps, three steps,\n\nshe walked to the pressure cooker, helped Wang Ke scoop more soup, and at the same time, admonished him:\n\n\"Eat more, don't waste it.\"",

    "content": "Should I drink this soup?\n\nZhou Ze furrowed his brow slightly, then put the bowl down and looked at Wang Ke, and at Wang Ke’s wife.\n\nWang Ke’s wife pulled up a chair and sat down, then massaged her heel, complaining:\n\n“Hubby, my heel still isn’t better.”\n\n“Who told you to be so careless? It’s a blessing your bone is fine.”\n\nWang Ke carefully examined his wife’s heel, smiled, and said:\n\n“You should go back to your room and rest. Don’t run around outside these days. It really looks tiring for you to be walking on tiptoe all the time, especially in high heels.”\n\n“Alright, alright, wasn’t I just trying to make myself look better so you’d enjoy looking at me at home?”\n\nThe woman rolled her eyes at her husband, then smiled slightly at Zhou Ze, “You two chat, I’m going up now.”\n\nAfter the woman left, Wang Ke pointed to the bowl Zhou Ze had just put down, reminding him:\n\n“The soup’s getting cold.”\n\nZhou Ze, however, took out a cigarette, lit it, and paid no mind to being in someone else’s home, smoking leisurely.\n\nAfter a while, Zhou Ze asked:\n\n“What do you mean?”\n\n“Just on a whim.” Wang Ke shook his head, then pointed to the pot of meat soup, saying: “Did you previously think that this pot of meat soup contained human flesh?”\n\nZhou Ze didn’t speak.\n\nWang Ke also took out a cigarette, lit it using the stove flame, and said:\n\n“This is psychological suggestion. Everyone encounters situations of psychological suggestion to varying degrees in their daily lives. For example, you just left home, and suddenly an auntie next to you tells her child to lock the door after people leave, or the house will be stolen.\n\nYou will subconsciously reflect on whether you actually locked the door, then repeatedly recall and agonize, and finally run back to personally check if the door is indeed locked.\n\nThis is relatively common and simple. A slightly more advanced form operates continuously through repeated psychological suggestion behaviors and consciousness, thereby achieving this effect.\n\nFor instance, you believe that I, of all people, cooked a pot of human flesh soup in my own kitchen, and you dare not drink it.”\n\nWang Ke shrugged,\n\n“Is it absurd? Yes, it’s very absurd, but you believed it. That’s the most absurd part, yet it’s also the most normal thing.”\n\nZhou Ze asked, “Is this also part of the treatment?”\n\nWang Ke shook his head, “No, this isn’t an illness. We psychologists rarely refer to psychological problems as ‘illnesses.’ This is your own inner knot.\n\nJust like why you would think I would cook human flesh, this psychological suggestion has actually been going on for a long time. For example, my wife here, who always likes to go out to get her hair done but her hairstyle never really changes when she comes back.\n\nYou think I have a motive to kill her. What’s the reason?\n\nI was cheated on. She found another man outside, giving me a cute green hat.”\n\n“Cute…”\n\n“Alright, we can ignore the adjective ‘cute’ for now, but undeniably, this was the biggest suggestion that led you to mistakenly believe I was cooking my wife’s flesh at home.\n\nBecause you thought I already knew about it, and in fact, I did know about it long ago. Then you naturally assumed I would be angry. Well, I was indeed very angry.\n\nAfter that, you believed I had a motive to kill her and eat her flesh, because I should vent my anger in that way.\n\nOf course, there were also some auxiliary suggestions, such as my identity. My greatest hobby is cooking a large pot of meat soup that I, alone, cannot possibly finish, simply to satisfy a childhood regret of not being able to eat enough meat when conditions were poor in the orphanage.\n\nThis contrast made it difficult for you to accept, and your brain naturally began to form your own line of thought, a line of thought that you felt could be explained.\n\nThat is what we often call your perceived ‘truth,’ just like many online bystanders. A very simple event can often be exploited and amplified by those with ulterior motives, based on this very reason.\n\nEveryone has a Shakespeare and a Sherlock Holmes living inside them.”\n\nWang Ke picked up a piece of meat with his chopsticks, dipped it in the sauce, then put it into his mouth and chewed with his eyes closed.\n\n“Are you really not going to eat? It’s very delicious. I remember you used to fight with me over meat when we were in the orphanage.”\n\n“In the end, you always left your drumstick for me,” Zhou Ze said.\n\n“Haha, who told you you were younger than me, who told you to call me big brother?” Wang Ke waved his hand indifferently, “Actually, at that time, I really loved eating meat too, but I always couldn’t get enough.\n\nNow I have the means to eat as much as I want, but every time I excitedly and wholeheartedly prepare a large pot, I get full after only a little.\n\nMy body isn’t as good as it used to be. I’m not the young man I once was, and ever since I started working, my living conditions have also gradually improved.\n\nNow, instead, I feel that watching you eat my share of the drumstick at the orphanage when we were kids was the most delicious.”\n\nWang Ke picked up another piece of meat, put it into his mouth, and after eating it, let out a sigh.\n\nZhou Ze exhaled a smoke ring, saying nothing, just leaning silently against the kitchen wall, watching the white smoke billowing inside, watching the middle-aged man’s vicissitudes and sighs.\n\n“Let’s talk about your problem. Actually, the problem still lies with you. Honestly, wasn’t it most comfortable when you were a doctor before?\n\nNo matter what problems you encountered at work, no matter the infighting, no matter the exclusion and suppression,\n\nWhen a patient was sent to you, treating and saving lives was always the right thing to do.\n\nIt aligned with the nature of your work and with the moral ethics of human society.\n\nThe phrase ‘doctors have a parent’s heart’ allowed you to disregard the patient’s identity, their personality, what they had done before, whether they were good or bad, rich or poor.\n\nAs long as they were sent to you, the only thing you had to do was cure them.\n\nBut now, you’ve encountered decision-making paralysis. In some choices, you need to consider more situations, and you have to gauge the appropriate extent yourself, which makes you very uncomfortable and troubled.\n\nYou want to stubbornly be yourself, like a character in a Wuxia novel, free and unrestrained, but you are also inevitably bound by the immediate struggles.\n\nActually, this is the normal state for most people, Ah Ze. You used to live a bit too self-centeredly. You and I both grew up in an orphanage. We both suffered childhood misfortunes and endured the pressure and low self-esteem of missing family in our youth.\n\nIn fact, both of us have some psychological issues to varying degrees. These were seeds, and now they have blossomed in you.\n\nYou say your conscience is gone, but it is actually still there. You are instinctively rejecting it, instinctively disliking it, but you can’t let go of it.\n\nSo your subconscious created this situation: your conscience was eaten by you, and thus you can perfectly ignore it.”\n\n“How do I solve it?” Zhou Ze asked.\n\n“Unless a master psychologist emerges who can completely transcend your consciousness and break the shackles in your mind, allowing you to be hypnotized without resistance.\n\nOtherwise, you can only slowly wear it down yourself. Perhaps you wear it down, or it wears you down.”\n\nWang Ke took another sip of soup. It must have been delicious, as a look of satisfaction appeared on his face. “Big brother’s skill isn’t enough, or rather, I might have some ways with ordinary people’s psychological problems, but you’re not ordinary.”\n\nZhou Ze nodded, “So, all of this can only take its natural course?”\n\n“You don’t have to resist it. Instead, you can accept it, even treat it as a person, as your other side.” Wang Ke tried to offer his solution, “What I’m saying is a bit abstract. It’s best if you can understand it, but it’s fine if you can’t. Letting nature take its course is also an option.”\n\nPutting down his bowl and chopsticks, Wang Ke and Zhou Ze walked into the living room. Wang Ke brewed another pot of tea.\n\nThe local news of Tongcheng was playing on the TV. Coincidentally, a face somewhat familiar to Zhou Ze appeared in the news—a simple, honest face. He was crying, he was raging.\n\nHowever, most of the news had already been broadcast; this was the end.\n\nWang Ke saw Zhou Ze watching the news and explained: “This matter has been widely discussed recently. His son got leukemia, and he wanted to find his second daughter, who he gave away years ago. After mobilizing the media, he finally found her.\n\nBut the second daughter and her adoptive parents refused to donate. He and his wife went to confront them, blocking them at their community gate and yelling at their daughter for being heartless. Then they even went to the second daughter’s high school to put up big-character posters, listing her faults and forcing her to come out and donate.”\n\n“Oh.”\n\nZhou Ze picked up his tea and took a sip.\n\n“These days, all sorts of strange things are happening,” Wang Ke lamented.\n\nZhou Ze looked at Wang Ke and said, “Actually, they happened before too, but there wasn’t such a developed information network back then.”\n\n“Are you implying something?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Don’t look down on your big brother,” Wang Ke suddenly said seriously.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head.\n\n“Everyone has their own difficulties. I don’t want to, but I can see the bigger picture.”\n\n“I’m leaving. Thank you for your diagnosis today.”\n\n“Don’t mention it. I told you, I won’t look for you again, but you can always come to me if you need anything.”\n\nAccompanied by Wang Ke, Zhou Ze walked out of his house and looked back at his second-floor balcony. The little loli wasn’t there.\n\nYes,\n\nThe little loli couldn’t be there. She must have already gone to Rongcheng with the Faceless Woman and the other ghost messengers.\n\nHe hailed a taxi, got in, and the driver turned around: “Buddy, where to?”\n\n“Take me to the unholiest place you know.”\n\nZhou Ze felt he should proactively go out and do something, get some performance.\n\n“Oh, are you a writer, buddy? Looking for inspiration?”\n\n“Something like that.”\n\n“Alright, I actually know a place.”\n\nThe driver guaranteed to find a good spot for Zhou Ze, a place that had been eerie lately, so much so that most people wouldn’t dare to pass by at night.\n\nAnd then,\n\nThe driver dropped Zhou Ze off at the entrance of “Midnight Bookstore.”\n\nThat damn crow appeared again, cawing as it slowly flew through the air. It seemed very adept at appearing when it was most needed.\n\nA gentle breeze stirred fallen leaves, making them swirl at Zhou Ze’s feet with a rustling sound.\n\nZhou Ze looked back at the taxi that had already driven away,\n\nSuddenly feeling he should talk to Xu Qinglang about moving.\n\n…\n\nPushing open the bedroom door, Wang Ke walked into the bedroom. His wife was lying on the bed playing with her phone. Seeing her husband approach, she changed into a graceful posture.\n\n“He left?”\n\n“Yes, he left.” Wang Ke smiled and sat down by the bed, reaching out to caress his wife’s cheek, saying:\n\n“You’ve lost weight, too thin. You’re not as delicious.”\n\n“Oh, you men are all the same. You want your wife to have a good figure to save face when you take her out, and you want her to have a little flesh in bed to make you comfortable.”\n\n“Getting old, lean meat gets stuck in your teeth.”\n\nAs he spoke,\n\nWang Ke used his finger to pick out some meat threads from between his teeth,\n\n“Don’t diet anymore.”",

    "content": "Xu Qinglang's shop was currently closed, but not entirely; the rolling shutter was halfway down, and Bai Yingying was inside playing a game.\n\nZhou Ze had heard that the game called \"PUBG\" seemed to have many cheats, where cheats were referred to as \"Immortals.\" Because of the rampant cheats, the game also earned the nickname \"War of Exterminating Immortals\" (a pun on \"War of Many Immortals\").\n\nBut looking at Bai Yingying, who was completely engrossed, Zhou Ze suddenly felt very sorry for the players of this game, because they might not know that in this game, their opponents weren't just cheat-using \"Immortals,\" but also real zombies!\n\nXu Qinglang should be looking for a new shop location, and Zhou Ze decided to do the same. If money was short, he could borrow from Xu Qinglang for now. Besides, the girl who had given him her business card last time had also mentioned the idea of investing.\n\nIn short, if he let go of his so-called high-mindedness, money would be easy to raise.\n\nThis place was truly unlivable. Perhaps in a while, it wouldn't just be taxi drivers; Zhou Ze might look out from the shop and see a large bus pulling up.\n\nA director would lead a group of tourists off the bus, and the tour guide would wave a small flag and explain with a megaphone:\n\n\"Travelers, friends, travelers, friends, we have arrived at our next scenic spot.\n\nTongcheng has Langshan, known as one of the Ten Lesser Buddhist Mountains, but Tongcheng also has 'The Midnight Bookstore,' known as one of the ten most haunted tourist destinations in the country.\n\nThis place is very dangerous; people often die inexplicably here, and people often see dead people appearing. Everyone, do not get too close. You can take photos from outside.\n\nAbsolutely do not include yourselves in the photos, just like you shouldn't take photos with the terracotta warriors at the Mausoleum of Qin Shi Huang. Those are funerary objects, things for the dead, and taking photos with them is bad luck!\"\n\nZhou Ze felt that this day might not be far off. The last group of horror story enthusiasts who came here to commit suicide had heard whispers about this place, and then, the suicide pact of two of them added a special atmosphere to it.\n\nPushing open the bookstore door and stepping inside, Zhou Ze saw the old Daoist dozing off. The old Daoist's live stream hadn't been on for a long time.\n\nJust as you can't be sure whether the person playing a game with you is a cute girl with a *diao* or a zombie,\n\nYou also can't be sure if everyone watching a live stream is alive.\n\nIn fact, among the online viewership numbers of major live streaming platforms, the number of living people accounts for only a very small portion.\n\nThe old Daoist had been quiet for a long time. Now, he simply guarded the woman named Tang Shi. He wasn't inseparable, but he was very responsible.\n\n\"Boss, you're back.\"\n\nZhou Ze's footsteps woke the old Daoist, who wiped the drool from the corner of his mouth.\n\nZhou Ze nodded and walked directly to the second floor.\n\nTang Shi was still in her mummy-like state, but her recovery was truly good. When Zhou Ze came up, she was awake, seemingly looking at the ceiling. Beside her were water and White Rabbit candy.\n\nShe didn't need anyone to serve her food and clothes; she could manage it herself with her \"telekinetic\" ability.\n\nWhen Zhou Ze approached, a White Rabbit candy unwrapped itself and flew to Zhou Ze's mouth. Zhou Ze opened his mouth and took the candy.\n\nThen, Zhou Ze sat down next to Tang Shi.\n\nNeither of them spoke. There was nothing to say. They spent half an hour in quiet like this. Zhou Ze stood up, preparing to go downstairs.\n\nTang Shi spoke, \"Did you go to see a psychologist?\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"Was it useless?\"\n\n\"It was still somewhat useful,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\nHowever, he still refused to eat Wang Ke's family's meat soup.\n\n\"Mmm.\" Tang Shi closed her eyes, as if tired, but still managed to say, \"Help me call that zombie up here.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded, preparing to go downstairs.\n\n\"Are you going to trick me again?\" Tang Shi asked.\n\n\"You found out.\" Zhou Ze didn't feel embarrassed. \"I don't really like lending out the pillow I'm used to sleeping on.\"\n\n\"But not being able to rest greatly affects my recovery.\"\n\n\"And what does that have to do with me? I've done what I should. If you want to get more from me, you'll have to offer more valuable things in exchange.\"\n\n\"I can tell you the location of another Ghost Catcher in Tongcheng.\" Tang Shi looked at Zhou Ze. \"When the old Daoist took me to escape before, I had intended to hide there, but unfortunately, he seemed to have some problems, which is why I eventually chose to come to you.\"\n\n\"That doesn't seem to be of much value to me.\" Zhou Ze shrugged.\n\n\"According to common speculation, Tongcheng is just a small city. It should only have one Ghost Catcher; it's impossible for there to be two. So, the other one must have been replaced. You can go there and see; perhaps you can inherit some assets.\"\n\nZhou Ze remained unmoved. \"I'm still not interested.\"\n\nIf she could inherit it, wouldn't the little loli have done it herself?\n\nZhou Ze wouldn't believe that the little loli was sentimental, especially since the driver she scared into a fatal car accident still hadn't been settled.\n\n\"Then I have nothing else to give you.\"\n\n\"Let's leave it at that for now.\"\n\nZhou Ze went downstairs. He didn't call Bai Yingying. As he said, he would feel uncomfortable lending out the pillow he was used to sleeping on.\n\n\"Boss, what should we eat tonight?\" The old Daoist pointed to next door. \"The boss next door doesn't seem to be back yet.\"\n\n\"You figure it out. Can you cook?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then go to his kitchen and find ingredients to cook.\"\n\nAfter saying that, Zhou Ze sat down behind the counter.\n\nThe old Daoist went next door to cook, and the bookstore suddenly became quiet.\n\nHowever, not long after, a figure appeared at the bookstore entrance. It was a girl, wearing a black jacket and a scarf, wrapped tightly.\n\nAlthough Tongcheng had cooled down recently, it wasn't cold enough to dress like that.\n\nThe girl looked at Zhou Ze through the glass door. Zhou Ze ignored her.\n\nFinally, the girl pushed open the door and walked in. She came to Zhou Ze, stopped, removed her scarf, and pleaded:\n\n\"Help me.\"\n\nZhou Ze picked up his teacup, took a sip of water, and still ignored her.\n\n\"Please, help me.\" The girl knelt down in front of Zhou Ze, her hands on Zhou Ze's thighs. \"As long as you're willing to help me, I'll do anything you want.\"\n\nAs she spoke, the girl's nimble, pale hands tried to flirt with the man in front of her.\n\nZhou Ze reached out and grabbed the girl's wrist, pushing her back slightly with force. The girl sat on the ground, looking somewhat bewildered.\n\nPutting down his book, Zhou Ze said with some surprise, \"I thought you would have been taken in.\"\n\nYes, Zhou Ze had originally thought this girl would face some repercussions after her false accusation against the teacher was exposed, but it seemed she truly hadn't.\n\nThinking about it, Zhou Ze understood. The girl was a minor, and the teacher had committed suicide. Even if she were charged with false accusation, in the end, it would be settled leniently because of her minor status.\n\n\"Did you see the news? My biological parents found me, so I could save my so-called younger brother.\"\n\nWhen the girl said this, a malicious glint flashed in her eyes.\n\nShe wasn't a good person to begin with. Even though her middle school teacher committed suicide because of her false accusation, she still lived happily.\n\nTherefore, the sudden appearance of so-called biological parents, if they were rich, with a mansion, a villa, or a huge inheritance for her to inherit, would have been fine. But they were just ordinary biological parents, so it wasn't very interesting.\n\nMoreover, the purpose of her biological parents finding her was to ask her to donate to save her younger brother.\n\nWhat a joke!\n\nWere they out of their minds!\n\n\"You're quite familiar with Lin Yi, so you should know that I'm just a live-in son-in-law, with no money or ability, only able to run this unprofitable bookstore. I can't help.\"\n\n\"I'd like to ask you, like last time you came to my house, to go to my biological parents' house.\"\n\nThe girl bit her lip. As she said these words, the scene from that night seemed to resurface in her mind. She had been terrified, truly so scared that she hadn't recovered for several days.\n\n\"Oh, just that?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Yes, that's all. Just to make them stop bothering me, stop annoying me,\" the girl affirmed.\n\n\"To be honest, when I saw the news before, I felt that second daughter was very pitiful, truly very pitiful. Those biological parents are really not good people.\"\n\n\"Yes, they are jackals, they are beasts, they are bastards!\" The girl gritted her teeth.\n\nZhou Ze lowered his head, looking at the girl still sitting on the ground. \"But when I found out that pitiful girl was actually you, I suddenly felt great.\"\n\n\"...\" the girl.\n\nBut the girl had seen storms, after all. She could endure the unbearable and bizarre fetishes of those old men in bed, which showed her resilience.\n\nIn fact, she was like a flower blooming among the wild grass outside the window, constantly enduring wind and rain, and the constant moistening of her pistils by dew.\n\nShe was indeed much stronger than a flower in a greenhouse.\n\n\"I can make you feel even better.\"\n\nThe girl looked at Zhou Ze. \"As long as you can help me, just like you did at my house last time.\"\n\n\"Do you think Lin Yi is pretty?\" Zhou Ze suddenly asked.\n\n\"Well... she's very pretty.\"\n\n\"Compared to you?\"\n\n\"She's a bit prettier than me,\" the girl replied.\n\n\"Then I can tell you, her elder sister is even prettier and more elegant, and she can wear a white lab coat, and also... she's a gentle woman. So, please tell me, why would I fancy you?\"\n\nZhou Ze had originally intended to say that Dr. Lin was also a virgin, but suddenly felt that saying so seemed a bit off, so he changed his words.\n\n\"Help me, or I'll die in your bookstore!\"\n\nA small knife suddenly appeared in the girl's hand, aimed at her neck.\n\n\"Heh, please do. I couldn't be more pleased. I just need more karma...\"\n\n\"Pffft!\"\n\nThe small knife directly stabbed into the girl's neck,\n\nVery abruptly,\n\nVery decisively,\n\nEven too abruptly, and too decisively!\n\nBlood splattered onto Zhou Ze's face, leaving him momentarily stunned.\n\nThe girl's eyes were wide open, a look of disbelief on her face, and then her body slowly fell backward.\n\nZhou Ze suddenly stood up and roared upstairs:\n\n\"What the f*** are you doing!\"",

    "content": "\"What the hell do you think you're doing!\"\n\nZhou Ze was asking Tang Shi.\n\nClearly, the girl's previous threat, \"Ah, if you don't help me, I'll die right in front of you!\" was just an empty one, like a homeroom teacher always telling their students, \"You're the worst class I've ever taught!\" The truth is, they say that to every class, so you can't take it seriously.\n\nZhou Ze hadn't expected her to actually commit suicide. And a woman like her, she wouldn't kill herself. She valued herself too much; how could she? But she suddenly, even without a second threat, without even having time to fake tears, plunged a small knife into her own neck.\n\nHer astonished expression at that moment further indicated that even she, the one doing it, was completely bewildered.\n\nWho am I?\nWhere am I?\nOh my god, I actually committed suicide!\n\nThere was only one explanation left: someone had manipulated her knife, making her \"commit suicide.\" And the person capable of doing that was upstairs.\n\nPerhaps that murderer was still chewing on a White Rabbit candy.\n\n\"What's wrong! What's wrong!\"\n\nOld Tao, cooking next door, immediately rushed back upon hearing Zhou Ze's shout. Seeing the girl on the floor, he was startled.\n\n\"Good heavens, little girl, what's wrong with you!\"\n\nOld Tao quickly went over, preparing to help.\n\nZhou Ze, however, went straight upstairs. He saw Tang Shi still lying on the bamboo mat.\n\n\"What is the meaning of this?\"\n\n\"Calm down.\" Tang Shi smiled. She still couldn't move her body, so all she could do was talk and smile. \"Now, can your maid come up and sleep with me?\"\n\n\"Are you trying to kill me!\" Zhou Ze demanded.\n\nTang Shi was slightly surprised. \"Shouldn't you be thanking me?\"\n\n\"I'll thank you for nothing!\" Zhou Ze kicked over the teacup in front of him. The water spilled everywhere, and the cup flew against the wall and shattered.\n\n\"I don't believe you didn't see it, otherwise how could you not try to save her? You're a doctor; saving people should be your instinct! You didn't directly perform resuscitation but came up here to question me. Are you trying to welch on a deal or play dumb?\"\n\nTang Shi said in a deep voice.\n\n\"It's precisely because I, your father, saw it that I couldn't bother with her. Do you know who gave me the mark on my hand? Do you know whose side that Faceless Woman is truly on now? Do you know who led the other ghost servants to specifically cause trouble for your family in Chengdu? You think you're so capable, don't you? You think you're so smart, don't you?\n\nYou think everyone else is drunk and only you are sober, don't you?!\n\nAs soon as you act, aren't you just telling her you're here with me?\"\n\nTang Shi fell silent. She suddenly felt a bit awkward and embarrassed.\n\nIt seemed Zhou Ze had already seen through it. He was deliberately playing along, while she, in her self-proclaimed cleverness, had intervened and pushed things into an unpredictable abyss.\n\n\"Oh, momma, don't cling to me, don't cling to me! I can't breathe!!!\"\n\nOld Tao's shouts came from downstairs.\n\nZhou Ze gave a deep look at Tang Shi, who was still lying there motionless, and shook his head.\n\n\"Stupid woman.\"\n\nThen, Zhou Ze went downstairs and saw Old Tao in the bookstore, wrapped in clumps of hair, like a large black *zongzi*, while the girl who had fallen was gone without a trace.\n\nZhou Ze's fingernails grew long, and he walked over, directly clawing at the hair.\n\n\"Whoosh! Whoosh!\"\n\nThe hair snapped instantly and floated away.\n\nBut the remaining hair on the ground twisted into a human face, like a traditional Chinese ink painting—very beautiful and classic, but upon closer inspection, one could see that the features of this face were not clearly defined.\n\n\"Object control, is that your new ability?\"\n\nA woman's voice echoed from around the bookstore, empty, as if a chant from hell.\n\n\"Or perhaps, I've made a new discovery? A very, very unexpected discovery?\"\n\nThe Faceless Woman seemed to be talking to herself, but in reality, she was demonstrating, a show of catching her enemy in a vulnerable position.\n\nZhou Ze had always been unclear why the Faceless Woman hated him so much. Was it merely because he had scratched her in the Hellish Pond? Or did she have other intentions for him, like her hysterical, unwilling roar when he left Hell?\n\nBut any normal person would be enraged by such unprovoked, sudden attacks.\n\nZhou Ze had actually seen through it earlier because everything was too smooth, too natural.\n\nThe clues all connected to this girl, who appeared before him in the most appropriate way and for the most appropriate reason, almost seamlessly fitting into his previous life and trajectory.\n\nThere was no abruptness at all, yet it was the greatest abruptness; she pursued perfection too much, and it was too deliberate. With her previous disguise as Doctor Lin as a precedent, it would be difficult for Zhou Ze to fall for another inexplicable trick.\n\nOf course, most importantly, Zhou Ze didn't believe that girl would dare to appear before him, flirt with him, or ask for his help after seeing him in that state last time.\n\nLast time, she had actually tried to seduce him, but he had coldly rejected her. Did she think she was Yang Guifei, to try again?\n\nIn hindsight, if he had calmly thought about it, the Faceless Woman had actually shown many flaws when she pretended to be Doctor Lin last time. But at that time, Zhou Ze had just learned about Xu Le's attempt to hire a killer, and he was in a state of mental confusion, which allowed her to seize the opportunity.\n\nOverall, the Faceless Woman was an anomaly formed by the convergence of countless resentful souls on the Road to the Underworld; she was not human.\n\nHow many tricks can beasts play? They only invite ridicule.\n\n\"You're finished. I'll let her know what you're doing. Don't forget, your current status was given to you by her.\"\n\nThe Faceless Woman's voice carried clear schadenfreude, like a kindergarten child who had caught a classmate's secret and was going to tell the teacher.\n\nAnd just then, Zhou Ze suddenly noticed the water droplets on the ground floating up and sticking to the glass door frame.\n\n\"This is just her clone puppet. If you leave her, what happened here won't be known.\"\n\nThis was Tang Shi's reminder, perhaps her way of paying for her impulsive self-righteousness. In an instant, the surrounding water droplets began to surge, shooting directly at the hair on the ground.\n\nThe Faceless Woman also saw the words. She let out a sharp shriek, her hair gathered together, and a cold wind swept in, directly rushing towards the door.\n\nHowever, the mist condensed by Tang Shi acted like a barrier, slowing the movement of the hair.\n\nBai Yingying also sensed something was wrong at this moment and ran over from next door. Seeing the scene in the bookstore, she slightly parted her lips, somewhat confused.\n\n\"Trying to stop me?\" The Faceless Woman let out a disdainful cry. \"Let's see how you stop me!\"\n\n\"Buzz!\"\n\nThe hair that had gathered together suddenly exploded, and for a moment, the bookstore became like a barbershop, with numerous strands of hair darting in all directions.\n\nSome attempted to go through the vents, some tried to go upstairs, and others tried to go into the bathroom to escape through the sewer.\n\nEven if just one strand of hair got out, it could transmit the news of what happened here to the main body, exposing Zhou Ze's act of harboring a \"wanted criminal.\"\n\nZhou Ze's fingernails ceaselessly slashed through the air. Each strand of hair he caught turned to ash and vanished.\n\nOld Tao, once again reaching into his trousers, pulled out two talismans and wildly waved them in the air. Any hair that touched the talismans was stuck, like on a fly trap, proving very effective.\n\nA practice workbook disintegrated, its pages flying out like curved blades, sweeping through the air. Strands of hair were severed, falling to the ground and withering.\n\nTang Shi, lying upstairs, coughed, blood spilling from the corner of her mouth. She was already injured, but she knew that at this moment, she absolutely couldn't hold back.\n\nBai Yingying, quick-witted, kept extending her hands, each time grabbing a strand of hair and immediately tearing it apart.\n\nThe usually quiet and almost business-less bookstore was now undergoing a vigorous and bustling spring cleaning, as if a leader was about to inspect it.\n\nFinally, everything seemed to settle. The Faceless Woman let out a final, unwilling roar, and not a single strand of hair could be seen.\n\nZhou Ze sat down on a plastic stool. The bloodstains on his face had long disappeared, because everything, except for the hair, hadn't been real.\n\n\"Boss, done working. I'm exhausted.\" Old Tao collapsed onto the floor, panting heavily.\n\nBai Yingying, however, poured Zhou Ze a cup of tea. She didn't seem tired. \"Boss, was that the same one from last time?\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded, took the tea, and took a sip.\n\n\"She's fallen for you, huh? She's really persistent.\" Bai Yingying stuck out her tongue.\n\nZhou Ze didn't say anything, but his mood was heavy. The Faceless Woman wasn't a huge problem, but she made you restless. No one wanted to be targeted by such an opponent.\n\nAccording to her, her main body had gone to Chengdu with the little loli, leaving a few strands of hair as a puppet to target him.\n\nEven if the targeting wasn't successful, it would still disgust him!\n\nSuch a low-brow enemy was truly maddening.\n\nNow, Zhou Ze's only thought was that the person in Chengdu would best deal with the little loli and the Faceless Woman together, and incidentally flush all his troubles down the toilet, leaving them completely clean.\n\nAlthough that difficulty was quite high, dreams must always be had.\n\nIn a subtle spot that no one noticed, a strand of hair stealthily moved out from a gap in a magazine, then fell to the ground, finally drifting towards the crack under the door.\n\n\"Creak!\"\n\nThe glass door was pushed open,\n\nAnd the hair happened to be stepped on by a leather shoe.\n\nXu Qinglang bent down, picked up the strand of hair, and then snapped it directly.\n\nIn the void, a woman's final, frustrated roar seemed to echo, as if her efforts had been in vain!\n\nXu Qinglang froze for a moment, as if he heard someone cursing him.\n\nBut then, he angrily pointed at Zhou Ze, who was sitting inside, and yelled:\n\n\"Alright, I'm out here running around in this cold weather, looking for a new shop location, and what are you doing? Look at this hair!\n\nDid another beautiful female reader come into the shop to chat with you?\"\n\nThe implication was,\n\nI'm out here working hard for our future,\n\nAnd you're hiding in the shop, enjoying the air conditioning and flirting with long-haired girls!\n\nAre you worthy of me?!",

    "content": "\"Are you asleep?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Didn't you call me to sleep with you?\"\n\n\"Can't sleep.\"\n\n\"Oh.\"\n\n\"How long have you lived?\"\n\n\"Two hundred years, but I've spent most of that time lying in a coffin. Actually, if you do the math, I've only truly lived out in the world for less than twenty years.\"\n\n\"What do you think of your boss?\"\n\n\"Not much, he's very petty.\"\n\n\"I think so too.\"\n\n\"Did he scold you today?\"\n\n\"I made a mistake.\"\n\n\"Oh.\"\n\n\"Actually, I've always been curious, what kind of person is your boss and that one you often talk about?\"\n\n\"What kind of person?\"\n\n\"Mm.\"\n\n\"Let me put it this way, if yesterday's situation, he and your boss had switched places, he wouldn't have needed me to act. He would've killed that puppet himself, wouldn't have been afraid of exposing anything, and certainly wouldn't have come up to ask me about meddling.\"\n\n\"Oh, I see.\" Bai Yingying mused for a moment, then said, \"Someone like that wouldn't live long, would they?\"\n\nTang Shi fell silent.\n\n\"Actually, the boss has many flaws. Sometimes he's not manly enough, and he's always indecisive, and even after doing something, he keeps fretting over it. But all in all, he's actually fine. Everyone has their own different life, and naturally, their own different personality.\n\nHe likes to be cautious, like a squirrel. He enjoys bringing things home, savors that feeling of accumulation, and protects it, because he came out of an orphanage before; he originally had nothing.\"\n\n\"You understand him?\"\n\n\"I wouldn't say understand, but honestly, I don't want to become like you are now. I like playing on my phone every day, playing games, watching movies, enjoying my current life, making up for the two hundred years I spent in a coffin. In that regard, the boss is quite indulgent and satisfies me.\"\n\n\"Is a life without pursuits or ripples interesting?\"\n\n\"Not everyone yearns for ripples and passion. Everyone should have their own way of life, as long as they like it.\n\nTo be honest, sometimes I can see the boss holding himself back, and I'm very worried that he won't be able to, and will become like you and the one you talk about.\"\n\n\"Scared?\"\n\n\"Yes, scared.\"\n\n\"You've died once already, what more is there to be scared of, what more is there to fear? He's not to my taste. He looks very peaceful and cultured, but deep down he's filled with petty male chauvinistic self-interest, only considering himself. To put it plainly, he's selfish.\"\n\n\"The boss is alright.\"\n\n\"You disagree?\"\n\n\"I disagree. I know when my lady achieved enlightenment and went to hell, she must have told the boss to dispose of me, but he never did.\n\nAnd, I also know that because I'm in the shop, fewer ghosts come to visit, but the boss hasn't driven me away.\"\n\n\"That's because he uses you as a pillow; he wants to sleep soundly at night.\"\n\n\"Isn't someone who's willing to sacrifice performance for sleep quality good?\"\n\nHearing that,\n\nTang Shi was stunned.\n\nFor some reason,\n\nThe image of that person who liked to sit on a chair by the entrance of the Underworld shop, basking in the sun, appeared in her mind.\n\nSunlight fell on him,\n\nLike an old grandfather.\n\n………………\n\nThe Faceless Woman's problem, no matter what, was at least temporarily resolved. Now, they just needed to wait for the final outcome from Chengdu.\n\nOf course, this matter could wait, but moving couldn't. Xu Qinglang had found a new location, near South Street in the center of Tongcheng City, which was considered the commercial hub by the old Tongcheng residents, with a high flow of people.\n\nZhou Ze received an invitation yesterday to attend Miss Liu's memorial service. Zhou Ze wasn't sure why he was invited and originally didn't plan to go, but after seeing the sender's name, Xu Qinglang strongly insisted that Zhou Ze must go, because the shop he was eyeing belonged to Miss Liu's family.\n\nDiscussing business at someone's funeral with their family seemed a bit inappropriate, but in the spirit of saving as much as possible, Zhou Ze still agreed.\n\nDriving according to the address on the invitation, Zhou Ze realized they weren't going to a funeral home, but driving into a more rural area, to a villa built amidst fields.\n\nIt was the season for rapeseed flowers to bloom, and the villa was nestled within a sea of flowers, giving it a very desolate feeling.\n\nNot many people had come; there were only four or five cars parked at the entrance.\n\nWhen Zhou Ze got out of the car and walked in, he saw Cui Yilang and several other members of the Horror Story Enthusiasts Association standing in the courtyard, chatting in low voices.\n\nNo one greeted Zhou Ze, nor did anyone come to collect condolence money. A few scattered groups were there, as if on an outing.\n\nThe house looked no different from a typical three-story rural house built in the Tongcheng area from the outside, but once inside, it was clearly decorated in a Western European style.\n\nFrom the ceiling beams to the coffee table and cups, it made one feel as if they had walked onto the set of a British drama.\n\nMusic started playing at this moment, not the usual \"funeral music,\" but Chopin's \"Farewell Waltz.\" Although it spoke of parting, the melody was much lighter than domestic funeral music.\n\nSeveral women in black veils came down from upstairs; these were the hosts.\n\nA man dressed as a priest, holding a Bible, walked to the center.\n\nEveryone gathered around, sharing their grief.\n\nZhou Ze poured himself a cup of coffee at the self-service counter and sipped it slowly.\n\nDomestic funeral customs have undergone several reforms in modern times, one could even say several upheavals, and most regions have long prohibited burial.\n\nIn the countryside, funerals are usually held by setting up a tent in front of one's own courtyard and carrying out the rites, while in cities, some do it in their own community or simply rent a venue at a funeral home.\n\nThis kind of Western-style funeral was the first Zhou Ze had encountered.\n\nZhou Ze remembered hearing someone say before that in some Western countries, many families had \"funeral workshops,\" where the first floor of their own house was used for normal living while also being rented out as a memorial service venue, along with services like body retrieval and corpse beautification.\n\nLooking at this place now, it seemed to be along those lines, but in China, most people still found it unacceptable.\n\nWhen it was time to pay respects to the deceased, everyone queued up one by one. If you were close, you could hold the coffin lid and talk. If you weren't close, you'd walk by, sigh, and pretend.\n\nWhen it was Zhou Ze's turn, he glanced into the coffin and saw Miss Liu lying neatly dressed in a black gown, truly looking as if she were asleep.\n\nWhat surprised Zhou Ze was that Miss Liu had fallen from upstairs in front of him. No matter how you embellished it with words, you couldn't hide the fact that she had died a tragic death, yet Miss Liu's remains looked very exquisite, with an excellent degree of restoration.\n\nThis made Zhou Ze think of when he died, that mortician with the eyebrow pencil, putting on makeup forcefully with an impatient expression. He had never received such treatment.\n\nThe deceased can't leave bad reviews, how unfair.\n\nAfter paying respects to the deceased, everyone went to the side hall for a meal. It was a buffet, but there wasn't much food, just some pastries and sausages, serving as afternoon tea to stave off hunger. It wasn't meant for a lavish meal or heavy drinking.\n\nZhou Ze poured himself a glass of wine, drank some, then walked out of the side hall. He intended to find Miss Liu's family members to discuss the shop rental.\n\nXu Qinglang said he would rent it for a year first, and then Zhou Ze would pay him rent monthly. This was also considering that Zhou Ze couldn't afford so much money all at once, so Zhou Ze also had to reciprocate; if he could help negotiate the price, he would.\n\nBut after searching around, Zhou Ze couldn't find the family members wearing black veils who had appeared earlier. Instead, he saw the priest standing by the staircase, smoking.\n\nWhen Zhou Ze walked over, the priest offered Zhou Ze a cigarette.\n\nThe two men stood together, smoking.\n\nThe priest was not a foreigner; he was also Chinese, about thirty years old, with a rather youthful face.\n\nThey didn't exchange any words. After finishing their cigarettes, the priest walked away. Zhou Ze put out his cigarette and happened to notice another staircase leading downwards, below the main one.\n\nIt must be a basement.\n\nOrdinary Chinese families generally didn't have the habit of building basements. Out of curiosity, Zhou Ze walked down and saw an elevator inside. Beside the elevator, there was also a metal door.\n\nThe door was open. Pushing it open and stepping inside, Zhou Ze immediately felt the temperature drop significantly.\n\nIn front of Zhou Ze were two steel slab beds and a freezer, similar to those found in a hospital morgue, but with some additional equipment.\n\nIt gave one the feeling of a slaughterhouse.\n\nWalking beside the steel slab bed, Zhou Ze reached out and touched it. This place must be where the dead lay. Miss Liu must have also laid here to receive her final beautification.\n\nThis was a beauty salon for the deceased.\n\n\"Sir, this area is not open to the public.\"\n\nA young man in a gray suit stood at the doorway and said.\n\nZhou Ze nodded apologetically; he had been presumptuous.\n\n\"Have we met somewhere before?\" Zhou Ze asked, feeling that the man looked somewhat familiar.\n\n\"Perhaps. Here's my business card. Of course, we hope you won't have the need to use the number on it.\"\n\nThe young man handed Zhou Ze a business card.\n\nThe card read \"Chen Zesheng\" with the note \"Director of Tongcheng Western Funeral Home.\"\n\n\"Is business good?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nFor a long time, it had always been others asking Zhou Ze, \"Is business good?\" Now Zhou Ze finally found a chance to ask someone else.\n\nOf course, Zhou Ze also knew that when others asked him, \"Is business good?\" what they really thought was:\n\nThis idiot opened a rotten bookstore in this broken place; business being good would be a miracle!\n\n\"It's a bit slow. After all, not many people in China accept this kind of funeral custom,\" Chen Zesheng said with a bitter smile.\n\n\"Mm.\"\n\nZhou Ze had asked, and felt satisfied.\n\n\"Oh, the deceased's family is on the second floor,\" Chen Zesheng reminded him.\n\n\"Okay, thank you.\"\n\nZhou Ze left the basement.\n\nHowever, as Zhou Ze had just started up the stairs, the hand holding the business card suddenly trembled. He looked down at the name on the card again:\n\nChen Zesheng.\n\nIt seemed,\n\nThe one who had committed suicide with Miss Liu the next day,\n\nAlso had the surname Chen?\n\n…………\n\nClosing the metal door,\n\nThe young man in the suit and tie lay on the steel slab bed.\n\nHe reached out and gently rubbed his right cheek. His skin was already wrinkled and cracked, with green shaping fluid oozing out.\n\nHe shook his head,\n\nSighed:\n\n\"As soon as I die, those two morticians at home start slacking off.\n\nAt this rate, what will happen to the business?\"",

    "content": "Upon reaching the second floor, Zhou Ze saw Miss Liu's family. What was strange was that he didn't see any men, only three women.\n\nOne with white hair, already in her twilight years; one dignified and poised, in her middle age; and another around Miss Liu's age.\n\nWhen Zhou Ze walked in, he found the priest there too, talking to the elderly woman, seemingly comforting her.\n\nThe old woman listened, the priest spoke, and everyone seemed to be going through the motions, fulfilling their duties. To say there was much sorrow in the room would be false.\n\nOf course, one cannot blame the living for their indifference to the dead, because the living must face the problem of how to continue living.\n\n\"Hello, may I ask if you are Ms. Liu Yanhua?\"\n\nZhou Ze walked up to the middle-aged woman and asked.\n\n\"Hello, I am.\"\n\nMs. Liu took out a handkerchief and wiped the corners of her eyes.\n\nZhou Ze thought she looked more like she was wiping away sleep crusts than tears, as he couldn't see any sign that she had actually cried.\n\nThe woman's collarbones were very distinct, her figure a bit gaunt, and her forehead protruded, giving her a rather uncomfortable appearance.\n\nIn fact, this was a face that *clashed with one's husband's fate*.*\n\nCulture is a carrier, a unified entity. In every era, all aspects, including politics, economics, and even such low-class things as *feng shui* and physiognomy, are influenced by culture.\n\nFor example, in ancient times, there was the saying \"clashing with one's husband's fate.\" This is a typical example of treating women as appendages to a patriarchal society, which is a very unfair and incorrect assertion.\n\nZhou Ze didn't believe in this originally, even though he was a *ghost messenger*.\n\nBut thinking about it,\n\nThree generations of a family,\n\nNot a single male heir,\n\nIt's genuinely hard not to believe it.\n\nZhou Ze explained the purpose of his visit. Xu Qinglang had already communicated with her and reached a preliminary agreement, but they hadn't progressed to discussing the specific price.\n\n\"Mr. Zhou, for coming to my daughter's funeral, I, on behalf of my daughter, express my gratitude. As for that shop, since Mr. Zhou has taken a liking to it, please go back and think of a number for the rent. As long as it's not too outrageous, I won't refuse.\"\n\nSo easy to talk to?\n\nZhou Ze was stunned. In his previous life, he was a doctor and had never done business, so he was a bit rusty at negotiating prices for the first time. But this Ms. Liu seemed very generous.\n\nZhou Ze nodded, said a few comforting platitudes about grief, and then discreetly left. All that remained was to discuss a price with Xu Qinglang and send it over, and the matter would be almost settled.\n\nHe went down the stairs, came to that corner again, and once more arrived at the metal door. He reached out to push it, only to find it locked.\n\nZhou Ze knocked on it,\n\nNo one answered from inside.\n\nIt was frustrating,\n\nAnd quite conflicted,\n\nAs a *ghost messenger*,\n\nTo be stopped by a door or a wall, this *ghost messenger* seemed to be losing too much face.\n\nUnfortunately, Zhou Ze couldn't be like the little loli,\n\n\"Biu,\"\n\nOut she came,\n\n\"Biu,\"\n\nBack in she went.\n\nThis door, Zhou Ze really couldn't open it.\n\nReturning to the main hall, the mourners had mostly left, and the hall was being tidied up. The coffin had also been carried away. As for Miss Liu, she would likely be sent to the crematorium for cremation very soon.\n\nWhen a person dies, it's like a lamp going out, ultimately ending up as a mound of earth.\n\nFunerals always tend to bring about such pessimistic emotions.\n\nZhou Ze stopped a cleaning lady and asked, \"Excuse me, do you know Chen Zesheng?\"\n\n\"Ah, he was the former boss here,\" the cleaning lady replied with some surprise. \"He's already dead. His funeral was yesterday.\"\n\n\"Oh.\" Zhou Ze nodded, then asked, \"May I ask who your current boss is?\"\n\n\"It's the former boss's younger brother. He just went down to the basement,\" the cleaning lady answered. Then, worried that Zhou Ze might not understand, she explained, \"There, by the staircase. It's where they specifically prepare the deceased.\"\n\n\"Thank you.\"\n\n\"You're welcome.\"\n\nZhou Ze walked back to the metal door again.\n\nHe had to go in,\n\nAnd catch that clown who, for some unknown reason, was still lively and handing out business cards to *ghost messengers* after dying.\n\nBut this door,\n\nHow on earth was he supposed to open it?\n\nHe knocked on the door several times with force,\n\nThe door still didn't budge, and there was no response from inside.\n\nThe cleaning lady had just said that their current boss had just gone in, which was clearly not right. Of course, Zhou Ze wasn't concerned about whether the current boss would encounter any accidents inside; he wasn't that compassionate.\n\nJust as Zhou Ze was about to look for a tool to try and pry the door open,\n\nZhou Ze found the door open,\n\nAnd a young man stood inside, dressed in a black suit with a white flower pinned to his chest.\n\n\"Can I help you?\" the young man asked.\n\nThis wasn't the one who had just slipped him the business card. Unless there was a mistake, this should be the current boss, Chen Zesheng's biological younger brother.\n\n\"There's something I'd like to talk to you about, regarding your brother,\" Zhou Ze said, already determined that if this guy couldn't be reasoned with, he'd just knock him out and go in to find Chen Zesheng.\n\n\"Oh, alright, please come in.\"\n\nThe man seemed easy to talk to and immediately gestured for Zhou Ze to enter.\n\nZhou Ze gave the man a deep look, then walked in.\n\nThe two steel slab beds were still in their original positions, and the freezer morgue was also there.\n\n\"Where is your brother's body?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"My brother's funeral was held yesterday, sir. Are you a friend of my brother's?\"\n\n\"You could say that,\" Zhou Ze replied evasively.\n\n\"My brother's body was cremated yesterday.\"\n\nAre you lying to a ghost?\n\nZhou Ze nodded, indicating he understood, then turned and left.\n\nThe man in the suit watched Zhou Ze's retreating back, a hint of deep thought in his eyes.\n\n…………\n\nThe evening breeze was cool, and the rapeseed flowers around the villa, under the moonlight, created a desolate atmosphere, like a grand funeral, with everything here serving as embellishment and prelude.\n\nThe workers had all left. This place didn't provide accommodation, even though it was large and spacious. Of course, the workers didn't want to stay here either.\n\nThe man in the black suit arranged dishes on the round table in the hall. They were all cold dishes, without any warmth.\n\nThen he poured old yellow wine into the wine glasses on the table.\n\nImmediately, he walked to the stairwell and called out upstairs:\n\n\"Dinner is ready.\"\n\nThree women,\n\nFrom young to old, came downstairs in order. They didn't stand on ceremony and took their seats directly.\n\nThe priest hadn't left either and stood by the table.\n\nThe man in the suit went to the basement again and pushed out a stretcher cart from inside, covered with a white sheet. Then came the second, third, and fourth carts.\n\nIn the hall, a strong smell of plastic and disinfectant began to permeate the air.\n\nThe elderly woman started coughing,\n\nThe middle-aged woman's expression was displeased,\n\nThe young woman covered her nose and waved her hand.\n\n\"Why are there so many people?\" Ms. Liu asked unhappily.\n\n\"Since we agreed to hold a *ghost marriage* for my brother and sister-in-law, it's only proper to invite our father and mother to attend for it to be formal.\"\n\n\"Your family, you're truly perverse,\" the elderly woman muttered. \"No wonder your brother incited my granddaughter to jump off a building with him.\"\n\n\"This matter isn't my brother's fault. My brother has always managed the family business; he didn't want to die. It's your family that has a tradition of men committing suicide. My sister-in-law, influenced by her upbringing, then took my brother with her to commit suicide.\"\n\n\"Hmph.\" The elderly woman didn't bother to argue, urging, \"If you're going to do it, hurry up. I'm getting sleepy.\"\n\n\"Alright.\"\n\nThe man in the suit first lifted the white sheet from one stretcher cart, revealing Miss Liu's corpse.\n\nHe picked up Miss Liu and placed her on a chair, then used several plastic ties to secure her there, keeping her in a dignified sitting posture.\n\nAfterward, the man in the suit lifted the white sheet from his brother's body, picked up his brother, and had him sit next to Miss Liu.\n\nHowever, his brother's sitting posture seemed to be very well maintained and didn't require any ties to secure it.\n\nThe man in the suit was a bit surprised but didn't take it to heart.\n\n\"These two poor children, why bother?\"\n\nThe old woman squeezed out a few tears, truly a performance.\n\nMs. Liu comforted her mother,\n\nAnd Ms. Liu's daughter comforted her mother,\n\nThe three women huddled together, crying, comforting, and lamenting.\n\nThe bridal couple sat coldly in their seats,\n\nEyes tightly shut,\n\nThey couldn't see.\n\nThis table of dishes was prepared for them,\n\nBut this table of drama had nothing to do with them.\n\nThe man in the suit tied red flowers on his brother's and sister-in-law's chests, wanting them to look more festive, but it only gave off a colder aesthetic.\n\n\"Don't open their eyes, don't disturb them too much.\"\n\nMs. Liu saw the man in the suit about to use tape to prop open the corpses' eyelids and immediately spoke to stop him.\n\nShe had already overcome a great psychological barrier by agreeing to the *ghost marriage*; now sitting at the same table with two corpses, she felt like she was on pins and needles. If the corpses' eyes were also opened, she really wouldn't be able to sit there anymore.\n\nThe man in the suit froze for a moment but nodded in agreement.\n\nImmediately, the man in the suit called out to another stretcher cart:\n\n\"Mom, it's brother's happy day today, please come and see.\"\n\nWith that, the man in the suit lifted the white sheet, revealing the corpse of a middle-aged woman.\n\nShe was wearing a *qipao*, looking very opulent and dignified, but she must have been dead for many years. No matter how good the embalming, it couldn't fully restore her appearance.\n\nBeneath the skin, a greenish hue had already appeared. This was just a shell, a shell that had undergone too many special treatments to preserve its living appearance as much as possible.\n\nHe settled his mother into a chair, letting her sit next to the old lady.\n\nThe old lady shivered in fear but didn't say anything.\n\nMs. Liu glanced at her \"mother-in-law\" but didn't dare to look a second time.\n\nFinally,\n\nThe man in the suit spoke to the last stretcher cart:\n\n\"Dad, brother's getting married today, please wake up...\"\n\n\"Hey.\"\n\nAn answering sound came from beneath the white sheet.\n\nThe man in the suit's body trembled, and a look of horror appeared on his face.\n\nThe three women at the table also began to shiver with fright. The young girl almost screamed but quickly covered her mouth.\n\nEven the priest looked up suspiciously, truly not understanding what was happening.\n\nThe man in the suit no longer dared to lift the white sheet,\n\nBut the person inside actively lifted the white sheet themselves.\n\nZhou Ze stretched, moved his neck, and a few crisp pops were heard. He said apologetically:\n\n\"Sorry, my pillow was taken over by a silly woman today, so I just borrowed your freezer for a nap.\n\nIt wasn't bad,\n\nIt's just that I've been living too comfortably lately, and sleeping in a freezer makes my body feel a bit stiff.\"\n\n---\n* *clashed with one's husband's fate*: A traditional Chinese physiognomy concept, usually referring to a woman whose appearance is believed to bring misfortune or even death to her husband.

    "content": "\"I'm very sorry to interrupt your family gathering. I'm just here to do my business, and then you can continue,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nWith that, Zhou Ze got off the stretcher and walked to Chen Zesheng's corpse. He reached out and gently patted his shoulder. A black halo appeared, forming Chen Zesheng's shadow.\n\nOnly Zhou Ze could see this shadow; ordinary people couldn't.\n\n\"We haven't gotten married yet,\" Chen Zesheng said to Zhou Ze. He himself seemed calm and composed, seemingly unsurprised by the fact that Zhou Ze was about to take him away.\n\n\"Your wife is waiting for you downstairs.\"\n\nZhou Ze then forcibly grabbed him and walked directly out.\n\n\"Stop right there!\"\n\nThe elder brother didn't argue further, but the younger brother, at this moment, gathered his courage and pointed at Zhou Ze, shouting, \"What exactly do you want to do?!\"\n\n\"I've done what I needed to do. Now, you may continue.\"\n\nWith that, Zhou Ze deliberately glanced at the priest standing silently beside the three women and smiled at him.\n\nThe priest also smiled back at Zhou Ze, lowering his head even more.\n\nZhou Ze remembered the little loli once commenting that he \"knew his limits\"*. Now, it seemed this priest understood them even better.\n\nWithout further words, Zhou Ze turned and left. The younger brother was still pointing at Zhou Ze, but he didn't dare to follow because he clearly understood one thing: he had personally wheeled the stretcher out of the freezer. This meant the person in front of him had been lying in a freezer for a long time.\n\nHe felt that this world must be crazy, truly crazy.\n\nHolding Chen Zesheng, Zhou Ze walked out to the road, flanked by lush rapeseed flowers.\n\nChen Zesheng then spoke, \"My lord, I came to you for help.\"\n\n\"Then why didn't you say so earlier?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Because I found that you, my lord, didn't seem willing to help,\" Chen Zesheng said with a smile. \"My younger brother has some mental issues, and I'm a bit worried about him. Our family business isn't good to begin with, barely breaking even. If I leave, he might not be able to handle it alone.\"\n\n\"I've seen your brother's mental issues.\"\n\nYes, it would be strange if a person who could arrange for a whole family to be together, even in death, had a normal mind.\n\n\"But you say you're worried your brother can't handle it alone, yet you were the one who jumped from the building before?\" Zhou Ze retorted.\n\n\"Heh, actually, I chickened out. At the time, we agreed to jump together, but after she jumped, I got scared,\" Chen Zesheng said honestly.\n\n\"And then?\"\n\n\"And then I felt I owed her. The next day, after finishing my police statement, I jumped too. I thought I'd find her on the Road to the Underworld**, but for some reason, I found myself back home. Perhaps it's because my younger brother repaired my corpse so well; although those two morticians had some issues with quality, at least on the surface, they restored me perfectly.\"\n\nAfter saying this, Chen Zesheng squatted down and pulled out a cigarette, lighting it.\n\nThis was a cigarette burned as an offering; ordinary people couldn't smell the smoke.\n\nZhou Ze also took out a cigarette. To be honest, Zhou Ze actually had a good impression of this guy. He was straightforward in his actions and speech. What a pity that such a person was already dead; otherwise, it would have been comfortable to be friends with him.\n\n\"Am I attracting you with my personal charm?\" Chen Zesheng fluttered his eyelashes at Zhou Ze. \"People who appreciate life and beauty are usually not bad.\"\n\n\"That sounds a bit disgusting coming from you.\"\n\n\"Heh, from the age of ten, my father kept me by his side. My brother didn't want to; he was afraid of corpses, so I had to inherit the craft. At first, I was also afraid of corpses, but then I discovered their beauty, a quiet beauty. This beauty can immerse you in a certain emotion, like listening to a beautiful piano piece. I tend to their last appearance, and they tend to my emotions. I grant them their final dignity, and they grant me a moment of peace. Actually, I still didn't want to die. If she hadn't been so determined to die, and if I hadn't truly loved her, I genuinely wouldn't have wanted to die.\"\n\n\"I also regret that you weren't my mortician when I died.\"\n\nThis was Zhou Ze's true feeling; the woman who did his makeup last time had hurt him so much.\n\n\"Heh, my lord, one more question: If I go down now, can I still find her on the Road to the Underworld? I'm a day late, I'm afraid I won't find her when I get there.\"\n\n\"You probably won't find her; the Road to the Underworld is very crowded.\"\n\nHe didn't say that people on the Road to the Underworld, except for special cases, generally walked forward numbly on tiptoes, like shapeless walking corpses.\n\n\"That's truly a shame,\" Chen Zesheng shook his head. \"I'll try my best to look for her.\"\n\nZhou Ze's fingernail pricked his palm, then drew a square. Black light swirled within the square, and the aura of hell slowly seeped out.\n\n\"Go in, go to where you belong.\"\n\n\"Thank you.\"\n\nChen Zesheng walked to the square, and his form was sucked inside.\n\nDust to dust, ashes to ashes, the underworld in order, the Road to the Underworld passable. This was probably Zhou Ze's most peaceful time sending someone to hell.\n\nQuietly finishing his cigarette, Zhou Ze looked back once more at the villa nestled among the rapeseed flowers, thinking of the expressions on the three women's faces and the bizarre scene of the living and dead sitting together at the dining table.\n\nEven as a dead person, as a Ghost Messenger, Zhou Ze felt a shiver down his spine at the two families' behavior.\n\nDead people like Chen Zesheng could leave with such ease and naturalness, while the living seemed like clowns with heavy makeup on a stage, constantly primping and posing.\n\nThis world, it seemed, had always been this way, and had never changed.\n\n...\n\n\"Ah ha ha ha ha ha!!!!!\"\n\nIt was the middle of the day, and Xu Qinglang's laughter echoed. He laughed exaggeratedly, as if he'd found tens of thousands of yuan; in fact, it was something similar.\n\nZhou Ze had returned late last night and rested late, so he had only napped for a while on Bai Yingying's lap in the morning. He was woken up by Xu Qinglang's laughter shortly after falling asleep.\n\n\"Old Zhou, you really are capable! Just now, the Liu family called me. They're renting that shop to us for fifty thousand yuan a year, fifty thousand yuan a year, on South Street! That's practically giving it away!\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Zhou Ze wasn't too surprised. He had gone to catch a ghost last night, slept on the way, and stumbled upon the two families' ghost marriage ceremony. This was probably their hush money.\n\n\"Come on, let's go check out the shop.\"\n\nAnd so, Zhou Ze was pulled by Xu Qinglang into a taxi to South Street. The shop was across from South Street, opposite Wenfeng Department Store and the Department Store Building.\n\nThe shop was over a hundred square meters, and it used to be a clothing store.\n\n\"Are you still planning to open a noodle shop?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Yes, my noodles are delicious!\" Xu Qinglang replied.\n\n\"Then you see if their noodles are delicious.\"\n\nSaying that, Zhou Ze pointed to the shops on either side of their new place.\n\nXu Qinglang looked over, and his face twitched. On the left side of the shop, there was a \"Chongqing Noodle\" shop and a \"Qishan Saozi Noodles\" shop. On the right side were \"Lanzhou Lamian\" and a \"Wonton Noodle Shop.\"\n\n\"Didn't you notice when you looked at the shop before?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nXu Qinglang shook his head, looking utterly dejected.\n\n\"We'll see then. You move your bookstore over first. If it really doesn't work, I'll just make coffee and sell some snacks in the bookstore,\" Xu Qinglang said.\n\n\"That's what you planned all along, wasn't it?\" Zhou Ze wasn't so easily fooled.\n\n\"As a man with over twenty apartments, letting my hands and skin continue to be ravaged by cooking fumes is a crime!\"\n\n\"Then whose sign will it be?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Let's use your 'Late Night Bookstore'.\"\n\n\"That works.\"\n\n\"Are you hungry?\" Xu Qinglang asked Zhou Ze, while taking out a thermos from his pocket. \"Let's go have a bowl of noodles. I want to see if the noodles here are good. If they're really bad, I'll consider whether or not to challenge them.\"\n\nThe thermos contained plum juice.\n\nZhou Ze didn't refuse. He hadn't eaten since getting up, so he followed Xu Qinglang into the wonton noodle shop. They ordered two bowls of noodles and sat at a small table, waiting for the food.\n\n\"Oh, it's actually a bit exciting to think about moving the business to this bustling area,\" Xu Qinglang said, looking eager.\n\nThen he noticed Zhou Ze didn't seem to be listening attentively. Instead, he was looking up slightly.\n\nThere was a ceiling fan directly overhead, spinning rapidly.\n\nThe temperature had obviously risen recently, and the sun was strong. Moreover, because the noodle shop's kitchen was actually inside the store without a partition, charcoal smoke and steam lingered in the air. If the fan wasn't on, it would be stuffy and unbearably hot.\n\n\"What's so interesting about that?\" Xu Qinglang asked Zhou Ze.\n\n\"When I was a kid in school, I'd often look up at these ceiling fans in the classroom during summer, afraid they'd fall and hit me,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Hey, what a coincidence, I worried about that too when I was little.\"\n\n\"Oh, right, can you read Feng Shui?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Half-baked,\" Xu Qinglang admitted openly, then continued, \"It's actually very simple. If you don't feel particularly comfortable living here, it means the Feng Shui is pretty good.\"\n\n*After all, you're a ghost.*\n\nZhou Ze pondered for a moment and found that Xu Qinglang made a lot of sense; he couldn't find a reason to refute him.\n\nTheir noodles arrived.\n\nXu Qinglang picked up a strand and ate it slowly.\n\nZhou Ze opened his thermos, took a sip of plum juice, then ate a large mouthful of noodles.\n\nLooking at his own wolfing down the food, and then at Xu Qinglang's leisurely strand-by-strand eating, Zhou Ze shook his head and said,\n\n\"Affected.\"\n\n\"What do you know? I'm savoring the taste of my competitor.\"\n\nZhou Ze heard this, pushed away the noodles in front of him, and couldn't eat anymore.\n\n\"...\" Xu Qinglang.\n\nJust then, a young man at the next table answered a call and said into the phone:\n\n\"I'm at the wonton noodle shop. I arrived early, have you?\"\n\nThe young man looked like a college student, very green.\n\nAt that moment, a girl with a satchel ran into the shop entrance. She stood at the doorway holding what looked like a notice, excitedly shouting to the young man:\n\n\"I passed! I passed!\"\n\nThen the girl ran directly towards the young man, opening her arms, asking for a hug.\n\n\"I really envy college students' lives,\" Xu Qinglang said enviously.\n\nThe girl ran towards the young man and jumped directly into his arms. The young man instinctively caught her and lifted her. This was probably how these two young lovers habitually expressed their affection.\n\nThis was the taste of youth, the beauty of being young.\n\nHowever, the ceiling fan was low.\n\nAfter the boy habitually lifted the girl, her head precisely hit the ceiling fan above.\n\n\"Thud...\"\n\nA head landed on the table in front of Zhou Ze and Xu Qinglang.\n\n---\n* The idiom \"很懂逼數\" (hěn dǒng bī shù) literally translates to \"understands the coercive number\" or \"knows the score (in a difficult situation).\" It means being very self-aware, knowing one's place, or understanding the appropriate behavior in a given context, often used with a slight, playful irreverence. Here, \"knew his limits\" or \"understood the situation well\" captures the nuance.\n** \"黄泉路\" (Huángquán Lù) is the \"Road to the Underworld\" or \"Yellow Springs Road\" in Chinese mythology, the path souls take to the afterlife.",

    "content": "The police arrived, and so did the ambulance.\n\nOf course, whether the ambulance came or not was already meaningless.\n\nZhou Ze and Xu Qinglang squatted on the opposite side of the road, surrounded by a throng of onlookers.\n\nXu Qinglang hadn't recovered from the previous scene; his hands were still trembling. He wasn't afraid of ghosts, and he often saw them, but many things couldn't be measured by simple fear. It was the visual impact at the time, whether it truly stimulated you.\n\nFor Xu Qinglang, who had just been savoring the taste of his competitor, the sudden change in style was truly stimulating.\n\n\"That was too scary.\"\n\nA moment later, Xu Qinglang finally came to his senses, lit a cigarette, and then asked:\n\n\"Can that ceiling fan really cut a person's head off?\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. \"Theoretically, it's impossible. At most, it would just cut them.\"\n\n\"So this time it went beyond the theoretical scope?\"\n\n\"I guess so. When I was a doctor, I did treat patients injured by falling ceiling fans, but I never heard of anyone actually having their head cut off by one.\n\nIn fact, even ancient executioners had to practice diligently to behead a condemned prisoner with one stroke. Often, the blade would get stuck in the head without severing it, and they couldn't pull the blade out either.\"\n\n\"Alright, this place's Feng Shui doesn't seem to be very good after all.\"\n\n\"It's quite good,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Heh.\" Xu Qinglang rolled his eyes.\n\n\"Actually, dangers are everywhere in life. This incident, for now, can only be attributed to their bad luck.\n\nFor example, if you rub a book page against your lips, you might accidentally cut a large gash. Or, for instance, tomatine in tomatoes is also a type of alkaloid toxin.\"\n\n\"Then why haven't I died from eating tomatoes all the time?\"\n\n\"If you eat four tons, the toxic dose would be lethal.\"\n\n\"............\" Xu Qinglang.\n\n\"Anything eaten at four tons would be fatal!\" Xu Qinglang hissed in a low voice.\n\n\"Alright, we've seen the shop, and it's time for us to go. If we don't leave, the police uncles will ask us for a statement again.\n\nWe already gave one for the jumping incident a while ago. If we do it again and run into someone familiar, they'll really start treating us like Conan.\"\n\n\"Today is really unlucky. I came here all excited, and who knew something like this would happen?\" Xu Qinglang tossed his cigarette butt and stepped on it.\n\n\"I thought you'd be happy about losing a competitor.\"\n\n\"That's going too far, isn't it? The poor young girl just died not long ago.\"\n\n\"Oh, then tell me, can the soul of someone who just died float out?\"\n\nZhou Ze pointed at the storefront ahead. Standing there was a girl wearing a yellow sweater.\n\nShe was dressed differently from the deceased girl, but this girl had a graceful figure and a slender build, especially her long legs, which were simply mesmerizing to an extreme degree.\n\nOf course, if she had a head, she would be even more beautiful.\n\n\"This...\" Xu Qinglang was stunned.\n\nNo matter how great the injustice, it would take until the seventh day for a ghost to fully form into a malevolent spirit. It was impossible for it to turn into one immediately upon death, and this depended on luck and probability; out of a thousand deaths, perhaps only one soul would linger in the mortal world.\n\n\"I told you, how could a fan directly cut off a head?\" Zhou Ze stood up and began walking in that direction.\n\nThat girl died; justice must be served for her!\n\n\"Hiss...\"\n\nZhou Ze instinctively clutched his chest; it was starting to hurt again.\n\nFor performance, for performance, this is all for performance!\n\nAfter taking Chen Zesheng yesterday, my performance increased from eight percent to ten percent. Catching one ghost only adds one or two percentage points. How long will it take to become a full-time employee at this rate?\n\nThis one is good; she can kill. A ghost who can kill,\n\nValuable!\n\nA change of thought, a different perspective,\n\nHis chest no longer hurt.\n\nXu Qinglang also followed, but as soon as he entered the crowd, Xu Qinglang suddenly felt his vision blur, a little dizzy, and he fell directly to the ground.\n\n\"Damn it...\"\n\nHis palm had a cut from supporting himself during the fall, the skin was broken, and beads of blood emerged.\n\nXu Qinglang immediately got up. There were onlookers everywhere and a police cordon, but he couldn't find Zhou Ze or the headless girl.\n\nHe was a little disoriented.\n\nThe sun seemed to become even more dazzling at this moment, and the surrounding air was very oppressive, making it difficult for him to breathe.\n\nHe was a little flustered, and a little guilty.\n\nAlthough his cultivation wasn't high, he wasn't a novice, so he shouldn't have been this scared by a headless ghost. But the current feeling of agitation in his heart couldn't be suppressed.\n\nHe started searching, weaving through the crowd, looking for Zhou Ze and the headless girl. He felt that if he could find one of them, he would be able to shake off this panicked, clueless feeling he had at the moment.\n\nSearching and searching and searching...\n\nSearching and searching and searching...\n\nDrops of sweat dripped from Xu Qinglang's forehead. He was already breaking out in cold sweat, his lips were dry and cracked. Xu Qinglang looked up at the sun, feeling as though he couldn't even open his eyes.\n\n\"Click...\"\n\nA crisp sound came from his oblique rear. Xu Qinglang instinctively pushed through the crowd and stumbled towards it.\n\nHe walked to the entrance of a noodle shop,\n\nAnd then saw Zhou Ze sitting inside.\n\n\"You're here! I've been looking for you for ages!\"\n\nXu Qinglang was almost crying with joy. The confusion and despair he had just experienced were indescribable, like being banished to his own nightmare.\n\nYou can't sense the beginning,\n\nNor can you experience the end.\n\nXu Qinglang ran towards Zhou Ze, very, very excited.\n\nActually, he wasn't gay, and his sexual orientation had always been normal. It was just that fate had given him the wrong body. Sometimes he would make jokes depending on the situation, but he never took them to heart.\n\nBut it was undeniable that at this moment, upon seeing Zhou Ze,\n\nHe was truly filled with heartfelt joy!\n\nLike seeing an oasis in the desert, or a starving person seeing a piece of bread.\n\nHe pounced forward, he ran forward, he spread his arms.\n\nHe saw Zhou Ze also stand up,\n\nThen he saw the ceiling fan above Zhou Ze's head,\n\nThe fan was spinning,\n\nSpinning very fast,\n\nXu Qinglang's face showed a look of horror. He wanted to shout for Zhou Ze to dodge, wanted to shout no,\n\nBut his body, due to inertia, continued to run forward.\n\nHe seemed to foresee his own end,\n\nZhou Ze would pick him up,\n\nThen lift him up,\n\nAnd then his head,\n\nCrack...\n\nLike a cucumber being snapped.\n\nHowever, he didn't see outstretched arms,\n\nHe saw Zhou Ze raise his leg.\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nOne kick,\n\nA forceful kick to the abdomen.\n\nXu Qinglang fell to the ground, only to find himself lying by the side of the road, a small car having just sped past him,\n\nAnd Zhou Ze was standing by the side of the road.\n\nCovered in cold sweat, Xu Qinglang touched his forehead.\n\n\"Did I fall into a trap?\"\n\n\"You almost ran out and got hit by a car,\" Zhou Ze said calmly, as if saying, \"Oh, the weather's not bad today.\"\n\n\"Is that thing that fierce?\" Xu Qinglang said, still shaken.\n\n\"She must have sensed that we were tracking her, so she struck first. This isn't like a pure ghost; she kills as easily as drinking water. If I hadn't stopped you just now, you would have been hit by a car.\"\n\n\"If it's not a ghost, what is it?\"\n\n\"Have you ever seen a Monkey King who masturbates?\"\n\nXu Qinglang shook his head.\n\n\"I have,\" Zhou Ze sighed. \"She crossed the street and went into the mall opposite. You don't go; I'll go after her alone.\"\n\n\"What a joke! She almost killed me. How could I let her off!\"\n\nXu Qinglang got up from the ground, dusted himself off,\n\n\"I'll go back and cook first. You kill her, and then come back for dinner.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded. Last night, he felt that the priest was very sensible, and now he found his neighbor was quite sensible too.\n\nThe light turned green,\n\nZhou Ze waved his hand and walked directly across the crosswalk. After entering the mall opposite, Zhou Ze continued his search.\n\nActually, sometimes Zhou Ze felt a bit depressed. His abilities seemed very powerful, able to make Bai Yingying scream,\n\nBut sometimes, they seemed quite useless.\n\nHe was now a licensed professional, but his abilities were often not suitable for catching ghosts. For example, now that the headless woman had entered the mall, amidst the crowd, Zhou Ze had indeed lost his way.\n\nAnd one reason Zhou Ze thought the other party wasn't an ordinary ghost was that the demonic aura on her wasn't very strong. To be able to kill in broad daylight and use illusions in a crowd to almost make Xu Qinglang get hit by a car himself.\n\nOrdinary ghosts really didn't have that kind of ability.\n\nAt this moment, Zhou Ze suddenly saw a woman in a yellow sweater emerge from an oblique direction. But she had a head, with some freckles on her face.\n\nZhou Ze instinctively walked over, but then he saw other women in yellow sweaters in another direction. Immediately after, he saw many more.\n\nZhou Ze then realized that yellow sweaters were the theme uniform for the employees of this mall today.\n\nHow was he supposed to find her now!\n\nZhou Ze walked to the freezer, opened it, took out a bottle of mineral water, twisted off the cap, and started drinking it.\n\n\"Sir, our food here must be paid for before it can be opened and consumed,\" a saleswoman in a yellow sweater walked up to Zhou Ze and reminded him.\n\nShe was very young, probably a student working part-time.\n\n\"Sorry.\" Zhou Ze took out a ten-yuan bill and handed it to her. \"Could you pay for it for me?\"\n\nThen, Zhou Ze reached out and pinched her face.\n\nThere was a sensation of touch,\n\nIt should be a real head.\n\nThe girl, however, indignantly pointed at Zhou Ze and shouted, \"What do you mean by that!\"\n\nTaking the ten yuan, with the mineral water costing two yuan, that means she was holding eight yuan,\n\nAnd he wanted to do whatever he pleased!\n\nNever mind that this grandmother isn't that kind of person,\n\nBut to flirt with someone for eight yuan, that's just too much!\n\n\"My apologies,\" Zhou Ze waved his hand and squatted down on the ground.\n\nThe girl was about to call for someone to catch the pervert, but seeing Zhou Ze's action, she didn't make a scene and angrily took the money to the counter to pay.\n\nZhou Ze extended his finger, his black fingernail grew out, and he pressed it against the ground.\n\nI refuse to believe,\n\nI can't find you!\n\nA cloud of black qi permeated the ground from Zhou Ze's fingertip,\n\nAnd then,\n\nZhou Ze saw black footprints appear beside him,\n\nThe footprints began to extend outwards,\n\nAll the way to the back of the young girl who was taking his ten yuan to the counter to pay.",

    "content": "Zhou Ze stood up, preparing to call out to the girl.\n\nBut at that moment, he was astonished to find black footprints everywhere in the mall. Not only the previous girl, but all the other customers, sales assistants, everyone's shoe soles seemed to be smeared with a layer of black grease. Every step left a clear print.\n\nThis was a situation Zhou Ze hadn't anticipated. Could it be that everyone in this mall was a ghost?\n\nEven a ghost market couldn't be this exaggerated.\n\nLast time, Zhou Ze and Xu Qinglang had witnessed Lady Bai's banquet, which was just a few tables of people making merry. It was far from as grand as this. Lady Bai, after all, had cultivated for two hundred years and had even possessed her own temple body in between.\n\nA dizzying sensation suddenly swept over him.\n\nZhou Ze felt as if he were on a carousel in an amusement park.\n\nEverything around him was so unreal, so grotesque.\n\nYou couldn't tell what was fake, nor could you figure out what was real.\n\nYou could only stumble around in a daze.\n\nHe remembered Xu Qinglang had experienced a similar vision not long ago, and then he suddenly rushed into the road. If Zhou Ze hadn't kicked him, he might have been hit by a car.\n\nAnd now, that feeling was assaulting him.\n\nWas that guy planning to attack him?\n\nAs a Soul Messenger, to be counter-attacked by the ghost he was chasing seemed a bit illogical. The most problematic part was that Zhou Ze didn't know how to resist.\n\nHis understanding of ghost-catching had always been stuck in the habitual belief that his fingernails were invincible. But this time, it seemed his fingernails couldn't help him.\n\nStumbling, he sat on the ground. Zhou Ze seemed to see someone handing him some loose change.\n\nHe vaguely heard someone say, \"Here's your eight yuan change.\"\n\nThen,\n\nThe girl's head in front of him began to blur. Everything in his sight seemed to be wrapped in a layer of paste, making him nauseous and dizzy.\n\nIt was as if he had returned to the Yellow Springs Road, mindlessly tiptoeing forward with the masses.\n\nBuddha said, all sentient beings have distinct appearances.\n\nBut on the Yellow Springs Road, there is only one appearance.\n\nZhou Ze felt he couldn't even take a breath. He subconsciously reached out and clutched his own neck. He lowered his head, coughing forcefully, wanting to cry out, but no sound came.\n\nThis was a feeling that made time drag, a torture inflicted on the spirit. Earlier, Xu Qinglang had easily broken down inside it, and Zhou Ze was now trapped within it too.\n\nZhou Ze felt he should do something, but at this moment, he seemed to be able to do nothing but passively endure it all.\n\nPain,\n\nSuppression,\n\nSuffocation,\n\nTorment arrived one after another, incessantly lashing at his soul.\n\n...\n\n\"Sir, sir, what's wrong?\"\n\nThe girl handed Zhou Ze the change, but then suddenly noticed the man in front of her. His eyes began to cloud, and he looked as if he was in great pain.\n\nThe girl's first thought was that this man was faking an injury for compensation, that he had drunk water from her supermarket and immediately felt unwell.\n\nBut after watching him for a while, she didn't think it was that. The man really seemed to be in pain.\n\n\"Sir, do you want me to call 120 for you?\" the girl asked.\n\nWho knew the man in front of her would reach out, push her to the ground, then stagger to his feet and run out of the store.\n\nThe girl had intended to call the police or 120, because she felt the man's condition was very unstable. But in the end, with the mindset of avoiding trouble, she didn't take out her phone.\n\n...\n\nEverything around him was like a mirror made of water, reflecting various colors. A few rays of light shone in, bringing no warmth, but adding a sense of agitation to his heart.\n\nZhou Ze didn't know where he was going, nor what he was doing. He had even prepared himself mentally, thinking he might have already walked onto the road like Xu Qinglang before, waiting for a car to hit him.\n\nHe could only passively resist. He didn't know where he was, nor where he had walked, but he constantly resisted the impulse of self-abandonment that appeared in his mind.\n\n\"Clang...\"\n\nA sound came.\n\nZhou Ze knocked over a trash can in front of him, then fell into the pile of garbage. The pungent, sour smell failed to wake him. In his vision, it was all lush green grass, like a paradise.\n\nEven though the surrounding scenery was beautiful, even though the surrounding colors were vibrant,\n\nIt didn't give him the slightest feeling of comfort.\n\nThis place was more like a cage, making one instinctively reject it and want to escape.\n\nLaughter and joy came from all around. There seemed to be a group of beautiful women dancing, and in the distance, incense smoke curled, as if countless people were worshiping at an altar.\n\nVarious images kept surfacing in Zhou Ze's mind, squeezing his nerves little by little. Any single image could become the last straw to break the camel's back.\n\nFinally, the image froze.\n\nZhou Ze found himself standing at the entrance of a familiar courtyard.\n\nA sign for the orphanage hung above.\n\nAnd in front of him, a couple was leaving a baby carriage there. They seemed to be about to leave.\n\nZhou Ze had asked the director about his birth after he grew up. In fact, the director would not hide it from the children once they grew up. He told Zhou Ze that he had been voluntarily abandoned by his parents.\n\nSince then, Zhou Ze had never thought about finding his biological parents. He simply assumed his parents were dead, and his life would no longer need them.\n\nBut at this moment,\n\nZhou Ze suddenly had a premonition,\n\nThat couple in front should be his parents,\n\nAnd the child in the baby carriage,\n\nShould be him.\n\nHe subconsciously lifted his foot,\n\nWanting to run over,\n\nTo see what his parents looked like, and perhaps even question them about why they abandoned him.\n\nBut that foot only lifted,\n\nIt didn't fall.\n\nZhou Ze's face showed a look of struggle.\n\nHe instinctively sensed something. If that foot landed, it would be an abyss!\n\nEverything beautiful had finally solidified into the scene before him. This was a poisoned pie, a trap set by the hunter, just waiting for the prey to take that step.\n\n...\n\nAt the edge of the skyscraper's rooftop,\n\nZhou Ze, already standing on the parapet, swayed precariously, leaning forward again and again as if to fall, but each time adjusting his center of gravity back.\n\nHe was struggling,\n\nHe was resisting,\n\nAnd, his life hung by a thread.\n\nOn one side of the rooftop stood a headless woman.\n\nThe woman was no longer wearing a yellow sweater, but a green robe, somewhat old and with several damaged areas. But the woman stood there coldly, facing Zhou Ze, who seemed on the verge of falling at any moment.\n\nAnd on the rooftop, there was a third person, a priest.\n\nUnfortunately, Zhou Ze couldn't open his eyes to see at this moment, otherwise he would have recognized this priest, whom he had just met not long ago.\n\nAt Miss Liu's funeral, this priest had remained silent throughout, other than offering him a cigarette.\n\nEven in the face of the two families' strangely cold banquet, the priest just stood by, quietly watching, as if admiring a ukiyo-e painting.\n\nThe priest looked at Zhou Ze for a moment, then at the headless woman in front of him.\n\nHe shook his head,\n\nAnd spoke to the headless woman:\n\n\"Lady Green Robe, he is a Soul Messenger.\"\n\nThis was a reminder,\n\nReminding the headless woman of the man's identity.\n\nBut this reminder was undoubtedly like adding fuel to the fire.\n\nThe priest, without the awareness of adding fuel to the fire, continued, \"If he is killed by you, it will cause a reaction in Hell.\"\n\nThe headless woman suddenly turned around, facing the priest.\n\nThe priest smiled nonchalantly and immediately changed his tone:\n\n\"But he is only a temporary Soul Messenger, a low-ranking one. Even if he's gone, he's gone.\n\nAt this time, anyone who dares to disturb Lady's mood should not have a good end.\n\nMoreover, Lady herself has done nothing wrong.\"\n\nThe headless woman turned back to face Zhou Ze, seeming to spare the somewhat annoying priest.\n\nThe priest stood there, continuing to play the role of a bystander. This seemed to be his favorite role.\n\nHe knew the identity of this headless woman, and was even a little surprised that this Soul Messenger, whom he had met before, hadn't detected the woman's identity immediately.\n\nHow utterly incompetent was this Soul Messenger in his duties?\n\nShe's not a ghost,\n\nShe's simply not someone you have jurisdiction over.\n\nYet you stared at her, chased her,\n\nAnd in the end,\n\nAngered her.\n\nWomen, after all, hold grudges.\n\nEspecially this one,\n\nA woman whose time is running out.\n\nThe priest looked behind him. The building was tall, with a great view, allowing him to see a construction site in the distance, undergoing demolition. Dust was flying there.\n\nThe most direct memory an era leaves people with is truly its architecture. And the current urban renewal and upgrading is undoubtedly a process of gradually erasing many past imprints.\n\nTurning back,\n\nLooking at Zhou Ze, who was still standing at the edge, swaying back and forth,\n\nThe priest was also somewhat surprised,\n\nThis temporary Soul Messenger was really persistent.\n\nEven if it were him, he might not be able to last this long.\n\nBut at this moment,\n\nThe priest suddenly saw Zhou Ze's fingernails slowly melting, but the dripping liquid didn't fall, instead flowing back into his body.\n\nZhou Ze's skin, at this point, began to gradually take on a bronze luster. This wasn't the bronze color created by sunlight and exercise, but a color imbued with\n\nDarkness,\n\nCurses,\n\nColdness,\n\nMany negative existences.\n\nAt the same time, the priest noticed green light slowly emanating from Zhou Ze's tightly closed eyes, like a fierce beast that had been dormant.\n\nNow,\n\nIt was gradually being stimulated to awaken.\n\nAt the corners of Zhou Ze's mouth, two fangs gradually protruded through his lips.\n\nBai Yingying had always been curious about one thing: she was, after all, a zombie who had slept for two hundred years, but why did Zhou Ze's fingernails pound her so badly?\n\nBefore him,\n\nThe priest, with a look of disbelief on his face, gave her the answer.\n\nHis mouth twitched,\n\nAnd he uttered two words:\n\n\"Zombie!\"",

Most of them can only inhabit others’ bodies to walk among the living.\n\nHow did this zombie just appear?”\n\nThe priest muttered to himself, his forehead furrowed with questions.\n\nAs a qualified observer, keen observation and diligent thought are essential virtues for a bystander.\n\nAnd when Zhou Ze turned around, the priest’s previously open lips slowly curved into a smile, as he suddenly realized:\n\n“**So desu ne** [2]!”\n\nUnlike Zhou Ze’s arms, which were beginning to show a bronze hue, the skin on Zhou Ze’s front, though also showing a faint bronze luster, was very light and uneven.\n\nAt the same time, some areas of his skin began to wrinkle and crack, and blood was slowly seeping out, presenting a terrifying sight.\n\n“He inherently carries a small portion of the zombie legacy within his soul. Now, under extreme mental stimulation, the zombie part of his soul has manifested.\n\nBut his body is still that of an ordinary person, simply unable to bear or inherit such a load, leading to this strange, neither-one-nor-the-other situation.\n\nHe’s a zombie, and yet not a zombie.”\n\nThe priest spoke to himself, a hint of excitement in his eyes. His hands under his sleeves slightly parted, and two scalpels appeared in his palms.\n\n“Which part should I cut off and take back for slow research, or perhaps, take the whole thing back?”\n\nHis tongue licked his lips; the priest seemed troubled.\n\nThe other party was a **Ghost Messenger**. While **Madam Qingyi** [3] might disregard his identity as a **Ghost Messenger**, he could not. And if **Madam Qingyi** were to kill him completely, then a corpse he brought back would lose its research value.\n\n“It’s truly vexing.”\n\nThe priest scratched his head, looking very conflicted, but the two scalpels in his hands gleamed in the sunlight, instantly drawing the gazes of both the headless woman and Zhou Ze toward him.\n\n“Oh!”\n\nThe priest’s expression froze,\n\nHe immediately dropped the two scalpels to the ground and took a step back,\n\nBowing slightly,\n\nHe said very sincerely:\n\n“I’m sorry to have disturbed you. Please continue.”\n\nFor a bystander to draw themselves into a battle and then die inexplicably is a great taboo.\n\nZhou Ze’s gaze once again fell upon the headless woman. Honestly, the previous Zhou Ze was purely a “back-killer” [4]; now, the constantly seeping blood and tearing skin on his front truly revealed Zhou Ze’s extremely poor physical condition at this moment.\n\nInstead of saying Zhou Ze was a zombie now, it would be more accurate to say he was Mr. Zombie A, a background extra from a Western zombie film.\n\nThe only difference was,\n\nZhou Ze’s eyes glowed green,\n\nThis made him seem more advanced than the extras in Western zombie films who could be easily killed with an axe.\n\nWell, upgraded from an extra to an extra with fifty cents worth of special effects.\n\n“Ah!”\n\nZhou Ze opened his mouth,\n\nAnd let out a roar,\n\nWithout earth-shattering volume,\n\nNor surging grandeur,\n\nMore like the wail of damaged vocal cords.\n\nThe headless woman continued to stand there, motionless.\n\nAnd then,\n\nZhou Ze moved. His movements were exaggerated, like a sprinter in a hundred-meter race, with huge body swings, directly pouncing on the headless woman.\n\nThere was no collision sound, no dazzling sparks,\n\nJust like a drunken man in a fit of madness tackling a delicate woman.\n\nThere was no beauty whatsoever.\n\n“*Whoosh…*”\n\nZhou Ze, having tackled her, pressed the headless woman beneath him and directly raised his fist to strike.\n\n“*Thud!*”\n\n“*Thud!*”\n\n“*Thud!*”\n\nPunch after punch,\n\nEach landing on the concrete slab of the rooftop,\n\nAll around, there was bloodstains,\n\nNot **Madam Qingyi**’s blood, but Zhou Ze’s.\n\n“Because in this state he’s left with only instinct and no capacity for thought, he is therefore no longer affected by **Madam Qingyi**’s abilities, is that it?\n\nAnd because he carries the aura of a zombie, he can touch spirit entities and thus launch his own attacks.”\n\nThe priest opened his mouth and said, “Oh,”\n\n“How did such a person become a **Ghost Messenger**? Has the Underworld’s review system collapsed to this extent?”\n\nUnder repeated heavy blows, it appeared each time as if Zhou Ze was hitting the concrete slab, but in reality, **Madam Qingyi**’s body was slowly distorting, like a pool of water, constantly rippling.\n\nThe surface of the water,\n\nWas no longer calm.\n\n“It seems **Madam Qingyi** is doomed to lose. Although she doesn’t belong to the ghost sequence, she doesn’t possess any physical offensive abilities apart from mental influence.\n\nNow, she can only passively take the blows.”\n\nSaying this, the priest looked towards the construction site in the distance again,\n\n“But it’ll be soon anyway. Dying there versus dying at the hands of the person in front of me, the outcome is essentially the same, isn’t it?”\n\nHowever,\n\nJust as he finished gloating,\n\nThe priest’s eyes suddenly became cloudy.\n\n**Madam Qingyi**, pressed beneath Zhou Ze, suddenly flipped her left hand towards the priest.\n\n“I made a mistake. I could have watched from a distance with binoculars, enjoying the show,\n\nWhy did I get so close?\n\nNow, I’m going to be controlled and used as a henchman.\n\nHow unlucky…”\n\nThe priest lowered his head, then suddenly raised it, his eyes glowing green. After that, he quickly picked up the scalpels he had just dropped and charged directly at Zhou Ze.\n\n“*Swish!*\n\n*Swish!*”\n\nTwo scalpels,\n\nDirectly pierced Zhou Ze’s back.\n\n“Ah!”\n\nZhou Ze raised his head, letting out a silent roar.\n\nImmediately after, the priest, holding the scalpels, tried to pull them down along the insertion wounds, but the blades seemed to be stuck in Zhou Ze’s bones, unable to move.\n\n“*Crunch!*”\n\nZhou Ze suddenly turned around, his arm sweeping horizontally.\n\nYes,\n\nZhou Ze couldn’t fight, had never learned martial arts, nor had he practiced anything like Sanda or Muay Thai. Therefore, when he was in a frenzy, he could only react according to instinct.\n\nIf a mosquito bites me,\n\nI’ll swat the mosquito dead.\n\nZhou Ze’s arm struck the priest’s face directly.\n\nThe priest’s entire face was almost contorted, and he was struck flying backward, landing just at the edge of the rooftop. If he had been even a little further back, he would have fallen off.\n\nThe left side of his face was badly swollen. He opened his mouth and spat out several broken teeth.\n\nThe gaps between his teeth were stained with blood.\n\n“**Baka** [5]!”\n\nThe priest flipped his hands again, and two talismans appeared. These were **Onmyoji** [6] ghost-taming talismans.\n\nWhen he charged at Zhou Ze again, he dodged Zhou Ze’s punches, then directly slapped the two talismans onto Zhou Ze’s chest.\n\nImmediately, the talismans seemed to burn, leaving two scorched marks on Zhou Ze’s chest, and the scent of cooked meat even began to spread.\n\nHowever, Zhou Ze directly wrapped his arms around the priest, hugging him tightly, then violently slammed him against the rooftop parapet.\n\n“*Bang!*”\n\nThe concrete parapet cracked significantly, and the priest spat out a large mouthful of blood.\n\nTwo grown men,\n\nOn the rooftop,\n\nFighting to the death,\n\nOver a woman.\n\n…………\n\n“Hey, attention over there! Push it down quickly, before those old fogeys get here, hurry up!”\n\nA construction foreman directed a bulldozer forward.\n\nAhead was a dilapidated old temple. The temple enshrined no **Bodhisattvas** [7] nor any Taoist figures. In fact, this temple didn’t even have a plaque.\n\n“*Boom!*”\n\nThe temple wall was pushed down, along with the damaged statue inside, whose head had fallen off who knows how many years ago.\n\nExcavators and bulldozers worked together, finally leveling the temple completely.\n\n“Hey, what kind of temple was this?”\n\nThe excavator operator got down from his machine. Honestly, when demolishing, he was most afraid of encountering such situations. Demolishing someone else’s temple might harm one’s own **yin virtue** [8] and easily invite misfortune.\n\nIn every industry, more or less, there are similar superstitions.\n\n“A small temple. When I was a kid, people still went to worship there. Not anymore. My grandpa even took me to worship it once. It was called **Madam Qingyi**, similar to **Goddess of Child-Giving** [9]. People prayed to her for children.”\n\n“Then why did you make us push it down?”\n\n“If we don’t push it down, how can the project proceed? You don’t know how long those old people who used to live here argued with us over this broken temple. Who still worships this damn **Madam Qingyi** now? There are infertility clinics everywhere; if you can’t have kids, just go to a doctor.\n\nBesides, when I was little, I thought this **Madam Qingyi** was some important figure, but later I grew up and found out there’s no such person in history. It’s just old superstition and feudal traditions. We’re basically breaking down superstitions here.”\n\nThe foreman spat a mouthful of thick phlegm onto the ground and shouted:\n\n“Tell those guys to hurry up! Before sunset, demolish this entire area for me!”\n\n…………\n\nOn the rooftop,\n\n**Madam Qingyi**, who had been tackled by Zhou Ze, slowly began to shatter.\n\nThe priest was right,\n\nShe was not a ghost.\n\nAs **Madam Qingyi** collapsed,\n\nThe priest’s eyes cleared. He stood up, clutching his chest, God knows how many ribs were broken. When he saw Zhou Ze charging at him again, he was so scared that he opened the rooftop door and fled down the stairs, not daring to look back.\n\nMid-charge, Zhou Ze’s body suddenly slowed, swaying unsteadily. The greenish glow in his eyes gradually faded,\n\nAnd the bronze luster on his body also receded,\n\nLeaving only a multitude of horrifying wounds, from top to bottom.\n\nZhou Ze’s body swayed, and he finally stumbled to the edge of the rooftop, unable to control his balance.\n\nHe lost his footing,\n\nAnd fell straight down.\n\nThe back of the building was a garbage disposal area,\n\nBags of household waste were piled up like mountains there. Many stray cats and dogs were scavenging for food.\n\n“*Thud!*”\n\n“*Meow meow meow!!!*”\n\n“*Woof woof woof!!!*”\n\nWhen Zhou Ze crashed into the area,\n\nHe startled the cats and dogs, sending them scattering.\n\nZhou Ze had almost lost most of his consciousness; only his fingers were still instinctively curling.\n\nTwo brave stray dogs came closer, sniffing Zhou Ze’s body with their noses.\n\n“*Squeak squeak squeak!!!*”\n\nAt this moment, a golden snub-nosed monkey with a plastic toy hammer in its hand leaped up in three swift bounds, swinging the plastic toy hammer to chase away the two dogs.\n\nThen it looked at the man, who was covered in wounds and barely breathing.\n\nWhen it saw the man’s face,\n\nThe monkey scratched its head,\n\nFor some reason,\n\nIt felt very uncomfortable seeing this face,\n\nIt couldn’t remember things from before and had been living here lately. These stray dogs and cats had also been tamed by it, and being a lord in a garbage heap was not bad.\n\nBut this face,\n\nIt really made the monkey unhappy! Even though it didn’t know where this feeling of unhappiness came from, it was just unhappy!\n\n“*Pop pop pop!*”\n\nThe monkey used the plastic toy hammer to hit Zhou Ze’s head several times,\n\n“That’s for making this monkey unhappy,\n\nThat’s for looking so unhappy to this monkey!”\n\nAfter hitting him a few times,\n\nZhou Ze’s head slumped to the side,\n\nCompletely unconscious.\n\n“*Whoa!*”\n\nThe monkey was so scared that it immediately dropped the plastic toy hammer,\n\nAnd covered its mouth with both hands,\n\nIt was really worried it had just hammered this guy to death.\n\n***\n[1] **Ghost Messenger (鬼差, Guǐchā)**: A term used in Chinese mythology for an emissary or officer from the underworld responsible for guiding souls to the afterlife or apprehending spirits.\n[2] **So desu ne (所嘚寺內)**: A Japanese phrase meaning “That’s right,” “I see,” or “Indeed.” Used here phonetically in Chinese.\n[3] **Madam Qingyi (青衣娘娘, Qīngyī Niángniáng)**: The name of the headless woman. \"Qingyi\" literally means \"green/blue clothes,\" and \"Niángniáng\" is a respectful title for a goddess or empress.\n[4] **Back-killer (背影杀手, Bèiyǐng Shāshǒu)**: A slang term referring to someone who looks attractive from behind but is disappointing when seen from the front.\n[5] **Baka (八嘎)**: A Japanese word meaning \"idiot\" or \"fool,\" often used as an insult.

    "content": "The small, abandoned shed barely offered shelter from the sun and rain. The surrounding environment was a mess, yet there was no obvious trash; instead, some children's toys were neatly arranged.\n\nOh, and there was a person lying there.\n\nIt was a pity no reporter passed by at that moment, otherwise, if they could have captured dozens of stray dogs and cats dragging a person along, the image would surely have moved many to tears.\n\nThe little monkey was holding a lump of something dark and shapeless, like a ball of mud, but this mud looked very clean.\n\nThen, it took a bit and slowly smeared it on the man's wounds.\n\nThe man had so many wounds: two burns on his chest, a penetrating wound on his back, and countless lacerations all over his body, resulting in more than half of his body being covered in the mud after the application.\n\nHe looked like a \"beggar's chicken\"* about to be unearthed.\n\nThe monkey was sometimes quite frustrated because it truly couldn't stand the man and often felt the urge to strangle him. But after struggling with its frustration, it instinctively found ways to keep him alive, preventing him from dying in front of it in such a muddled way.\n\nHe really should have died. Such severe injuries, even if his fall from the rooftop ended by hitting a dumpster that absorbed most of the force, his original injuries alone were enough to kill an ordinary person several times over.\n\nBut he didn't die. The monkey sometimes pressed its ear to his chest and could hear a strong heartbeat.\n\nFrom the heartbeat, the man seemed very healthy, not weak at all, but overall, it was a miracle that he still had a heartbeat.\n\nIt was as if his heart was a separate part, detached from the rest of him.\n\nEven if his other organs were decaying, his heart continued to bound around boisterously, doing as it pleased.\n\nSeven days passed like this. During these seven days, the man remained unconscious. The monkey tried to feed him some mashed food.\n\nThe food was brought by the stray dogs and cats as offerings to it. It mashed the food and fed it to the man, but each time, the unconscious man quickly spat it out.\n\nThis greatly angered the monkey. It had given him its cleanest and most delicious food, its own rations, and he dared to spit it out!\n\nThe monkey felt its life was lacking. Look, the food it usually thought was great, this guy instinctively refused to eat it even when unconscious.\n\nThis was looking down on this lord!\n\nWith its pride wounded, the monkey found a jar with half a bottle of Lao Gan Ma chili crisp in the shack and directly fed it to him. The monkey had eaten it before and it had made it jump around.\n\nTo the monkey's surprise, the guy actually ate it. The monkey then brought some more food, mashed it, and continued to feed him, and he ate that too.\n\nThe monkey was shocked.\n\nHow strong were this guy's tastes?!\n\nFinally, on the eighth day, Zhou Ze's eyelids fluttered slightly. He slowly opened his eyes, feeling somewhat bewildered about where he was. It wasn't a hospital, nor a bookstore.\n\nIt looked more like a homeless person's makeshift dwelling.\n\nAt the same time, a furry tail swung back and forth in front of him.\n\nA little girl's face was staring at him.\n\nOh, no,\n\nIt was a bright red apple staring at him.\n\nNot quite.\n\nFinally,\n\nZhou Ze saw it clearly.\n\nIt was a monkey's ass facing him.\n\nThe monkey was still smearing mud on his wounds. Zhou Ze could even smell the earthy odor of the mud. He felt a bit anxious, wanting to open his mouth to warn the monkey that this might cause his wounds to become inflamed and fester, but when he opened his mouth, Zhou Ze could only produce \"err err...\" sounds.\n\nHis lips were dry, and his throat was painful; he couldn't make any proper sounds.\n\nThe monkey was startled and finally turned its face, that of a little girl, towards Zhou Ze.\n\nMan and monkey began to stare at each other.\n\nThe monkey suddenly scratched its head and ears. This guy was awake, but the way he opened his eyes seemed even more infuriating!\n\nZhou Ze, meanwhile, found it a bit absurd. He had mostly forgotten his memories of that day on the rooftop, only remembering that he had had a satisfying fight.\n\nIt seemed he had fought a woman, and then a Japanese person. In any case, it was a muddled fight, and the ending was equally muddled.\n\nIt felt like someone who had too much to drink waking up the next day with gaps in their memories of being drunk.\n\nIf he couldn't speak, he wouldn't speak. If he couldn't move, he wouldn't move. If there was a monkey beside him, then there was a monkey.\n\nHis life as a bookstore owner since his \"borrowed corpse resurrection\" had successfully transformed Dr. Zhou, who in his previous life had been diligent and eager to climb the ranks, into a handsome man who knew how to adapt to circumstances.\n\nLike an eighty or ninety-year-old, he had seen through what needed to be seen through. And Zhou Ze, in fact, had already died once.\n\nThe monkey routinely smeared mud on his wounds every day, and fed him Lao Gan Ma, then spicy strips, Wangzai Little Steamed Buns, half a chicken leg, and other such foods.\n\nAnd after taking good care of him each day, it would stand in front of him, holding a plastic toy hammer, repeatedly hitting its own head, looking very displeased.\n\nZhou Ze thought this monkey seemed a bit mentally unstable.\n\nHowever, this monkey was genuinely intelligent, unlike ordinary monkeys. It could even understand the meaning in your eyes. But most of the time, apart from attending to Zhou Ze, it didn't stay by his side for long.\n\nIt would often turn its back, presenting its little girl's face to Zhou Ze, then stare at the sun or moon, lost in thought.\n\nThis was a monkey with a story, one that even knew how to ponder life.\n\nFor the first few days after waking up, Zhou Ze didn't feel anything unusual. But after four or five days, Zhou Ze suddenly thought of something.\n\nThe Great Sage Equal to Heaven was born from a stone, which was extraordinary enough.\n\nFor such \"human-like\" monkeys to appear one after another in the small city of Tongcheng seemed unlikely.\n\nAnd just a few days ago, he seemed to have just met a monkey.\n\nAnd then,\n\nThat monkey had been killed by him.\n\nThat incident ultimately led to a rather messed-up situation: an old man, claiming to be his servant, invited him to a meal, and made his conscience into a dish.\n\nBut that monkey had indeed been killed by him. Even if he couldn't find its soul later, it should have lost its physical body.\n\nOne evening, the monkey returned from outside, holding a rolled-up newspaper. When it unrolled it, there was a fried dough stick inside.\n\nZhou Ze could now barely swallow on his own. The monkey tore off a piece of the dough stick, fed him a bite, then dipped it in Lao Gan Ma and fed him another bite.\n\nThe man and monkey had developed a certain unspoken understanding during this time.\n\nHalfway through the dough stick, the monkey suddenly froze. It was looking at the newspaper.\n\nZhou Ze was a bit surprised. He thought the monkey was intelligent, but he hadn't expected it to be intelligent enough to read a newspaper.\n\nIt was like a pet dog at home; you'd think it was very smart if it could relieve itself in designated spots and sit or lie down on command. But if one day you saw your dog sitting on the toilet and flushing it after using it,\n\nYou wouldn't think it was smart; you'd be horrified.\n\nFortunately,\n\nThe monkey wasn't actually reading the words,\n\nBut looking at the cover image of the newspaper.\n\n\"Three-Legged Boy's Surgery a Success.\"\n\nThe monkey looked at the picture,\n\nAnd froze for a long time.\n\nLike a person, it sighed, then the monkey reached up and wiped its eyes.\n\nZhou Ze watched the monkey. At this moment, he felt no fear. Yes, this monkey was the one he had killed. He was now certain.\n\nAnd yet, this monkey was now returning good for evil.\n\nIt had saved him. Although he didn't know what those mud plasters were, they had at least controlled his injuries.\n\nThe monkey had originally had its cultivation destroyed because it was caught by the lumberjack Zhou Ze had saved, and its brain was taken and its flesh eaten. But it seemed that even if this monkey had lost some of its previous memories, its true nature remained the same.\n\nThe monkey looked a bit melancholic, then continued to share the rest of the dough stick with Zhou Ze. The monkey found a rope and tied one end around Zhou Ze's neck.\n\nZhou Ze didn't react, letting the monkey do as it pleased, until the rope formed a loop around Zhou Ze's neck. The monkey then sat down by Zhou Ze's bedside.\n\nIt looked at Zhou Ze, and Zhou Ze looked at it.\n\nThere were tears in the monkey's eyes, anger, hatred, and unwillingness.\n\nJust as Zhou Ze recognized it, the monkey seemed to have recognized Zhou Ze too.\n\nThe grievances between the two of them were unclear as to who was right or wrong, but if either party said an end was needed, it seemed perfectly reasonable.\n\nThe monkey slowly tightened the rope. It could completely strangle Zhou Ze now, just as Zhou Ze had stabbed himself with his fingernails and killed himself in the hospital.\n\nZhou Ze lay there, appearing utterly defenseless.\n\nAt this moment, several stray dogs appeared outside the shack. Their animal instincts told them that a big meal might be coming soon.\n\nAt their level of intelligence, they naturally didn't understand why their monkey brother would save this person only to kill him later. Perhaps they thought the meat would taste better if the person was well-fed?\n\nBut the monkey suddenly turned around and bared its teeth at the stray dogs outside.\n\nThe stray dogs scurried away in fright.\n\nThe monkey then slumped and looked at Zhou Ze, then reached out and untied the rope from Zhou Ze's neck.\n\n\"Slap!\"\n\nThe monkey slapped itself, a very loud slap.\n\nThen it jumped off the bed, rummaged through a pile of trash, and found a phone with a broken screen. Then it jumped back in front of Zhou Ze.\n\nThe phone was turned on. This was something the monkey had brought back yesterday, and Zhou Ze saw that the broken screen had a signal display, which meant there was a working SIM card inside.\n\nThe monkey knew what a phone was. It extended its paw and pointed at the buttons on the phone, signaling Zhou Ze to tell it what to press.\n\nZhou Ze reached out and took the phone from the monkey's hand.\n\nThe monkey was startled by Zhou Ze's movement. It hadn't expected that he could already move.\n\nIf his hand could move, then his fingernails could move too.\n\nA moment later,\n\nZhou Ze smiled.\n\nThen the monkey picked up its plastic toy hammer again,\n\nThis time aiming for Zhou Ze's head:\n\n\"Pop! Pop! Pop!!!\"\n\nServes you right for faking it!\n\nServes you right for faking it!\n\nServes you right for faking it!\n\nAfter hammering for a while,\n\nThe monkey dropped the plastic toy hammer,\n\nAnd sat there,\n\nAnd smiled too.\n\n---\n*Beggar's chicken: A traditional Chinese dish involving a chicken wrapped in clay and lotus leaves and slow-cooked.",

    "content": "Holding the phone, Zhou Ze struggled to sit up against the wallboard. In fact, he could move a little now; he might not be able to get out of bed and walk around, but in other aspects, he really wasn't as weak as he had previously appeared.\n\nHe stretched out a hand and pointed to a spot under the bed.\n\nThe little monkey turned its head and saw half a pack of opened Xiaosuyan cigarettes.\n\nIt jumped down, picked up the cigarettes, and brought them to Zhou Ze's hand.\n\nZhou Ze then mimed lighting a cigarette.\n\nThe little monkey was startled and felt indignant, wishing it could pull out its big stick and hit Zhou Ze!\n\n\"Haven't smoked in a long time, want one.\"\n\nThe little monkey jumped off the bed again, rummaged through the pile of miscellaneous items, and indeed found a lighter, which it threw over.\n\nHe lit a cigarette, took a puff, and exhaled a smoke ring. Although his body was still weak, like a canvas patched countless times and ready to fall apart at any moment, this first cigarette in over ten days allowed Zhou Ze to experience a sense of comfort.\n\nHe had deliberately pretended to be immobile. As for his purpose, Zhou Ze couldn't quite explain it.\n\nGuilt?\n\nDebt?\n\nPerhaps there was, perhaps there wasn't. Even now, Zhou Ze didn't feel that he had made the wrong choice back then.\n\nBut at least for now, this monkey had indeed saved his life, and he owed it a lot.\n\nHolding his phone, Zhou Ze thought for a moment and realized he couldn't remember Bai Yingying or Xu Qinglang's phone numbers. This era wasn't like the past when you'd go to a small shop to use a public phone; few people bothered to memorize numbers anymore; they were all stored directly in contacts.\n\nHelpless, Zhou Ze could only dial \"110\".\n\nXu Qinglang and the others had indeed reported his disappearance. Zhou Ze told the operator on the phone that he was fine and asked them to help contact the reporting party to pick him up, so as not to trouble the police uncles with a deployment.\n\nAbout half an hour later, Xu Qinglang arrived in a Nissan, with Bai Yingying also in the car.\n\nXu Qinglang walked into the shack, pinching his nose. Upon seeing Zhou Ze lying on the bed, his eyes immediately welled up, but he quickly controlled himself.\n\nPerhaps,\n\nThe cruelest thing in this world,\n\nIs saying you'll come home to cook,\n\nBut you never make it back to eat.\n\nBai Yingying lifted Zhou Ze off the bed. Her strength was immense; carrying Zhou Ze was like child's play for her.\n\nZhou Ze said to Xu Qinglang, who was to one side, \"Bring that monkey along too.\"\n\nThe little monkey squatted by the bed, watching Zhou Ze being carried away, holding its plastic toy hammer.\n\nIt waved it,\n\nAs if saying goodbye.\n\nHowever, when Xu Qinglang walked towards it, the little monkey immediately jumped onto the wallboard. It clearly didn't want to leave.\n\nBeing a local king here, with a host of cat soldiers and dog generals as subordinates, and so many subordinates bringing offerings every day, how comfortable it was! It simply didn't want to leave.\n\nMoreover, it found this guy it had saved a bit of an eyesore.\n\nXu Qinglang looked at Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze repeated, \"Take it away.\"\n\nNo room for negotiation,\n\nThe pet I've taken a fancy to,\n\nMust be taken.\n\nXu Qinglang tried to grab the monkey, but the monkey was very agile, and Xu Qinglang couldn't catch it at all.\n\nBai Yingying settled Zhou Ze in the car, then dashed forward. The monkey hadn't expected this woman to be so fast; it was a step too slow in jumping and was caught by the tail.\n\n\"Squeak squeak squeak!!!\"\n\nThe monkey bared its teeth at Bai Yingying, its face fierce!\n\nYou stinking hag,\n\nHow dare you grab me!\n\n\"Roar!\"\n\nBai Yingying also opened her mouth at the monkey, revealing her zombie fangs.\n\nThe sight of her green face and fangs,\n\nCompletely stunned the monkey.\n\nDare to be naughty again,\n\nBelieve it or not, I'll eat you!\n\n\"Good boy, come with Grandma.\"\n\nBai Yingying held the monkey by its rear with one hand and its tail with the other, putting it into the car, then closed the car doors and windows.\n\nZhou Ze sat in the back seat, half-reclining.\n\nThe monkey sat next to Zhou Ze,\n\nArms crossed, clearly sulking.\n\nIt felt that it had saved Zhou Ze, but Zhou Ze was now trying to deprive it of its freedom. This was very bad!\n\nI treated you as a patient, but you want to torture me in a secret room!\n\n\"I'm taking you because I'm afraid you'll save someone again and be harmed by them instead,\" Zhou Ze explained weakly. \"Let's consider the grievances of the previous life settled. This life, I owe you first. Stay with me for a while, and if you still want to leave later, then go.\"\n\nThe monkey didn't know if it understood or not, but it did become a bit more obedient than before.\n\nXu Qinglang tossed over a pack of biscuits. The monkey caught them, tore open the bag itself, and ate with its hands, not forgetting to put one in Zhou Ze's mouth.\n\nThe man and the monkey had developed this kind of daily tacit understanding during this period.\n\n\"Oh, it seems I worried for nothing. You two have been living quite comfortably lately.\"\n\nXu Qinglang teased, driving the car.\n\n\"Are you jealous of a monkey?\"\n\nBai Yingying suddenly interjected.\n\nXu Qinglang was choked up and said nothing more.\n\nThe bookstore hadn't moved yet. Zhou Ze, the boss, had suddenly disappeared for half a month, so no one was in the mood to relocate. Thus, Xu Qinglang drove back to the old place.\n\nGetting out of the car,\n\nIt was still Bai Yingying who carried Zhou Ze into the bookstore. Zhou Ze, too, accepted his situation; if he had a choice between Xu Qinglang and Bai Yingying,\n\nZhou Ze still felt more comfortable with Bai Yingying carrying him.\n\nThe monkey didn't run away but followed closely into the bookstore.\n\n\"You're back?\"\n\nThe old Taoist was cleaning the bookstore. Seeing Zhou Ze return, he immediately came over to flatter him, then said,\n\n\"A good man is always blessed.\"\n\nThen, the old Taoist saw the monkey behind him and immediately brightened, \"Did you bring a pet back with you?\"\n\nSaying that,\n\nThe old Taoist struck a pose like the Monkey King, shouting,\n\n\"What use is this iron rod to me!\"<sup>1</sup>\n\nUnexpectedly, the little monkey actually cooperated, also striking a pose of scratching its ears and cheeks, pointing a finger at the old Taoist with one hand and scratching itself with the other.\n\n\"Hey, this monkey is smart, like me.\"\n\nAfter saying that, the old Taoist felt as if something he said wasn't quite right.\n\nJust as they entered the shop, a woman came down the stairs.\n\nFirst to appear were a pair of flesh-colored stockings, long legs, an exquisite high school girl's uniform, and long flowing hair.\n\nTang Shi had mostly recovered and was able to walk.\n\nWomen are all about beauty, and the first thing she did after regaining mobility was to doll herself up.\n\nOn this point, Zhou Ze felt Bai Yingying was much more simple. This big simpleton, besides loving video games, didn't pay much attention to dressing up.\n\n\"If you didn't come back, we'd all have to leave,\" Tang Shi said with a smile. \"The dog's gone, so the doghouse smell has faded, and we can't hide anymore.\"\n\n\"I just got back, can't you say something nice?\" Zhou Ze was truly speechless about this woman.\n\n\"Alright, I'll say something nice. The noodle shop owner next door told me about what happened that day. Do you know what kind of thing you provoked?\"\n\n\"Something called Empress Qingyi, I think,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\n\"A temple deity, a temple deity that was about to be completely overthrown. You actually took the initiative to provoke her. Do you know that her time was almost up, and she herself knew it was almost up?\"\n\n\"She was killing people.\"\n\n\"Do you know what kind of people she was killing?\"\n\nZhou Ze glanced at the monkey, who was still roughhousing with the old Taoist, and shook his head, saying,\n\n\"I'm not interested in knowing.\"\n\nTang Shi walked to Zhou Ze's side, then covered her nose, disdainfully saying,\n\n\"You stink.\"\n\n\"That's why they call me a stinking man.\"\n\n\"Were you always so flirty?\" Tang Shi didn't get angry.\n\n\"Before, you were lying there like a mummy, who would be interested in flirting with you?\" Zhou Ze pointed to the bathroom and said to Bai Yingying, \"Help me take a bath.\"\n\nBai Yingying was startled,\n\nBut the simpleton girl immediately said, \"Oh, okay.\"\n\nIn Zhou Ze's current condition, bathing himself was impossible, but he was covered in layers of mud, and it would be uncomfortable not to bathe.\n\nLet Xu Qinglang help him bathe?\n\nJust thinking about it was unbearable.\n\nLet the old Taoist help him bathe?\n\nThe thought of the old Taoist scrubbing his back while singing \"Xintianyou,\"<sup>2</sup> and seeing the old Taoist's bony body, it just wasn't appealing.\n\nAs for Tang Shi, forget it. If he asked her to help him bathe, she'd probably \"whoosh\" control a pen to give him a quick, clean end.\n\nOnly the simple and kind Bai Yingying remained.\n\nEntering the bathroom, Zhou Ze sat on a stool. Bai Yingying helped him take off his clothes. She herself didn't take off her clothes, so the bathing scene wasn't as sensual as one might imagine.\n\nHolding the showerhead, she slowly rinsed off the mud from Zhou Ze's body. Seeing the scars covering Zhou Ze's entire body, Bai Yingying gasped in surprise, asking,\n\n\"Boss, your injuries are too terrifying. That Empress Qingyi is truly a scoundrel. I heard her temple has been demolished, serves her right.\"\n\n\"She didn't do it,\" Zhou Ze said. \"Actually, most of the injuries on my body I inflicted myself.\"\n\nZhou Ze found it difficult to understand that state, and he wasn't even sure if he could voluntarily enter that state again. But one thing was certain: if he were to repeat the incident on the rooftop, he would still end up with a body full of injuries.\n\nHis body, to be honest, was a bit too weak.\n\nBai Yingying began to apply shower gel to Zhou Ze, her hands gliding over his body.\n\nUnconsciously, a look of intoxication appeared on her face, and she said,\n\n\"Boss, I don't know why, but when I touch your body, I really like this feeling. It's a very intimate feeling.\"\n\nAs a zombie, Bai Yingying sensed a kinship with Zhou Ze's current body. And although this kinsman appeared very weak, the suppression and disparity in their ranks instinctively gave her an urge to submit.\n\nBai Yingying had felt this way when she first hugged Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Just focus on washing, don't mess around.\"\n\nZhou Ze reminded her.\n\nJust then, Xu Qinglang coughed outside the bathroom.\n\nBai Yingying's body stiffened, and her fingertips began to rub rapidly back and forth on two raised nubs on Zhou Ze's chest.\n\n\"What are you doing?\"\n\n\"I made a bet with Miss Xu, I want to see if Boss can get hard.\"\n\nSaying that,\n\nBai Yingying also lowered her head,\n\nDeliberately looking down,\n\nThen she suddenly opened her mouth wide and let out an exclamation:\n\n\"Boss, you actually...\"\n\n---\n<sup>1</sup> This is a famous line from the Chinese classic novel Journey to the West, spoken by the Monkey King. It implies a sense of feeling powerless or without purpose, ironically given that he possesses immense power.\n<sup>2</sup> \"Xintianyou\" is a style of folk song from Northwest China, characterized by its high-pitched, robust, and sometimes melancholic or expressive melodies, often associated with the hardships and simple joys of rural life.",

    "content": "After bathing, Zhou Ze, dressed in a white shirt and casual trousers, was carried out by Bai Yingying and placed on a bamboo mat on the second floor. When Bai Yingying came down, Xu Qinglang immediately approached and asked:\n\n\"What's the situation?\"\n\nSneaky,\nCautious,\nThis feeling was very much like the trepidation of operating an underground casino, as if the police would burst in at any moment to bust the gambling.\n\nBai Yingying hesitated, her face flushed.\n\nXu Qinglang frowned.\nYou're a zombie, what are you blushing about?\n\n\"So, what happened?\" Xu Qinglang pressed, eager for an answer.\n\n\"Uh...\" Bai Yingying.\n\n\"Spit it out, did it get hard?\" Xu Qinglang asked impatiently.\n\n\"This...\" Bai Yingying.\n\n\"Could it be that he has a slit down there?\"\n\n\"Uh...\" Bai Yingying.\n\n\"Or is his smaller than yours when he takes it out?\"\n\n\"What...\" Bai Yingying.\n\n\"Hey, don't keep me in suspense. Do you still want the latest graphics card or not?\"\n\n\"The boss said he'd get me a brand new, top-spec host after the shop moves,\" Bai Yingying said shyly.\n\n\"You've been bought off?\" Xu Qinglang's face darkened.\n\n\"Yeah.\" Bai Yingying was very honest.\n\n\"No, he only has just over ten thousand *yuan* at most. He still needs to move and renovate, and I'm covering the rent for now. He doesn't have that much money.\"\n\n\"The boss asked me for two jade hairpins and pawned them for five hundred thousand *yuan*. He said he'd return seven hundred and fifty thousand in half a year.\"\n\n\"He tricked you into pawning funerary objects?\" Xu Qinglang looked at her as if she were an idiot. \"Are you stupid?! Those are your burial items.\"\n\n\"The boss said he'd give them back,\" Bai Yingying mumbled.\n\n\"You believe everything he says. If he said he was your zombie ancestor, would you believe that too?\"\n\n\"I do,\" Bai Yingying whispered.\nBecause she really felt the aura of a zombie from the boss.\n\n\"You're hopeless, you silly girl,\" Xu Qinglang said, looking disappointed. \"Oh right, let me ask you something. Do you have any other sisters?\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"I also want to find a female zombie to be a maid. It's a profitable business.\"\n\n\"Oh.\"\n\nBai Yingying straightened up.\nA chilling aura suddenly emanated from her.\nThe silly girl instantly transformed into an ice-cold goddess.\nXu Qinglang, who was still wallowing in self-pity, suddenly trembled.\nThat familiar thrill from their first meeting returned, and almost instinctively, Xu Qinglang became a little quail again.\n\n\"Who did you say you wanted to take as a maid?\" the female corpse asked.\n\n\"Nothing, I said I'd go buy a new graphics card this afternoon and install it for you, so you can play *PUBG* with max settings.\"\n\n...\n\n\"Here, this is the information on Lady Qingyi.\"\nTang Shi handed a tablet to Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze's hair was still damp. He leaned against the wall, sitting on the bamboo mat, looking like a disheveled but handsome guy who had just finished playing basketball and showering in college.\n\nXu Le had all sorts of flaws and was a useless person in many ways,\nBut you couldn't deny that Xu Le was indeed very good-looking.\nOtherwise, he wouldn't have been chosen as a live-in son-in-law by the Lin family parents.\n\n\"For having children?\" Zhou Ze glanced at Lady Qingyi's information and said.\n\nLady Qingyi was a small temple in Tongcheng. She didn't exist in historical records, nor did she have a place in the mainstream mythological system. Even in Tongcheng, she wasn't a household name.\nHer popularity wasn't widespread, and stories about her were mostly fabricated by later generations.\nJust as many scenic spots in Yangzhou's Slender West Lake are related to Emperor Qianlong's travels to the south, it's as if Emperor Qianlong did nothing else but constantly create various stories in the Slender West Lake to name these attractions during his southern tours.\n\nThe story of Lady Qingyi was also a bit far-fetched. There's a town in Tongcheng called Lüsi, rumored to be named after Lü Dongbin's four visits there. This Lady Qingyi was a widow whom Lü Dongbin met during his visit to Tongcheng.\nThe widow had no children, did not remarry, remained chaste for her deceased husband, and, being fond of children and kind-hearted, took in many orphans, essentially serving as an ancient orphanage or daycare. After Lü Dongbin discovered her, he gave her a blue robe as encouragement.\nAfter she died, the local people erected a temple to commemorate her merits, calling it Lady Qingyi.\n\nMost people who came to this temple to offer incense were seeking children or continuity for their family line, similar to the effect of the \"Child-Giving Guanyin.\"\n\nHowever, it was mentioned at the bottom that due to urban renewal, the Lady Qingyi Temple had been demolished.\nAs for rebuilding, it would be difficult. Firstly, she wasn't as famous as Mazu, and secondly, the difficulty of building new temples was genuinely high. Developers wouldn't add extra work for themselves. Although some local elders objected, the temple was eventually torn down.\n\nThe information included a photo from a few years ago. In the photo, the Lady Qingyi Temple was already dilapidated, and the head of the deity statue had fallen off years ago, leaving only a headless sculpture standing there.\nThis matched the image of the headless woman.\n\n\"So-called temple gods are soul forms created by faith and incense, just like the Faceless Woman who came to test you; she was formed from the grievances of the deceased on the Yellow Springs Road,\" Tang Shi explained.\n\n\"Is she killing people out of anger because she knew her temple was about to be torn down and she was about to disappear?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Temple gods have their own code of conduct; even in their final frenzy, they would never act without purpose.\"\n\n\"I know this, I've checked.\" Xu Qinglang came up the stairs at this moment. \"The girl whose head was cut off by the ceiling fan had three abortions at the hospital. Lady Qingyi was deliberately imposing her final punishment according to her own code of conduct.\"\n\n\"Punishment?\" Zhou Ze asked back. \"Who gave her the authority to do that?\"\n\nXu Qinglang shrugged. \"Everyone has a different perspective, so their stance naturally differs. In her eyes, a child is a life. Carelessly or irresponsibly getting an abortion is, in itself, a blasphemy against life.\"\n\n\"So, if I hadn't happened to run into her, she would have continued to find such people and cause their accidental deaths?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"That should be it,\" Tang Shi nodded. \"She was already mad and obsessed. Anyone, when pushed to a dead end, will go crazy, even if she is a temple god.\"\n\n\"I've always wondered about one thing: why did she only let the women die? Old Zhou, do you remember the boyfriend of that girl in the noodle shop? Why was he fine?\nDid Lady Qingyi also favor boys over girls?\"\n\n\"So the most pitiful one was still the student boyfriend.\"\nZhou Ze gave the answer.\n\nXu Qinglang was startled by the answer,\nThen a look of sudden understanding appeared on his face, and he said:\n\"When will my thinking be as excellent as yours?\"\n\n\"Anyway, next time you do something, you can slow down a bit,\" Tang Shi reminded him. \"A desperate person, especially a temple god like that, don't touch them next time. Whatever she does, her past merits will offset it; it's not your fault.\"\n\n\"It's not about whether I want to get involved, it's that I happened to run into it, so...\"\nHe thought for a moment,\nZhou Ze then thought of the monkey from back then,\nAnd suddenly lost the desire to explain, just waved his hand and said: \"Forget it, let's not talk about it.\"\n\nTang Shi, however, smiled sweetly at this moment and said, \"I originally thought you were different from him. Now I suddenly realize that, in essence, you are still the same.\"\n\n\"I don't want to follow his path. By the way, are your injuries healed?\"\n\n\"Almost healed.\"\n\n\"Then what are you still doing here? Aren't you going to help your friend? I can book your flight to Rongcheng.\"\n\n\"Whether I go or not, it doesn't make much difference. The outcome won't change just because I go. Besides, I believe he can come back.\"\n\nXu Qinglang was about to leave when he suddenly remembered something and said, \"Oh, by the way, the matters with the new shop are all handled. We can move anytime.\"\n\n\"Let me recover a bit more,\" Zhou Ze said.\nHe didn't want to manage the shop from a wheelchair.\n\n\"Alright, take good care of yourself and be careful not to get wet.\"\nXu Qinglang went downstairs.\n\nTang Shi still stood there, flicking a finger, and a White Rabbit candy unwrapped itself and flew into her mouth.\nThen, chewing, she asked Zhou Ze:\n\"Something seems to have changed about you.\"\n\n\"Perhaps.\"\n\n\"But I still need to remind you to take good care of this body, because for us, returning from hell and choosing a body is a one-time opportunity. Once this body is ruined, you'll become a wandering ghost.\"\n\n\"No exceptions?\" Zhou Ze frowned. He wasn't very fond of this body; although he had gotten used to it, there were always some unspeakable difficulties.\nEspecially when facing Dr. Lin.\n\nTang Shi thought for a moment and said, \"That person seems to have the ability to change bodies, but he is a special case. For us, it's a unique and singular opportunity.\"\n\n\"You seem to be in a good mood today.\" Zhou Ze noticed Tang Shi was talking a bit more today.\nZhou Ze wasn't so narcissistic as to think this woman was overjoyed because he came back safely, which made her talk more.\n\n\"He sent a message. There will be a result by the end of the month.\"\n\n\"Oh, the 'Husband-Watching Stone' received news, so she's so happy she can't contain herself.\"\n\nZhou Ze stretched, \"I hope he has a burst of power over there, kills all those ghost messengers and faceless women, and even if he self-destructs, he drags them down with him, so I can continue to live my peaceful little life.\"\nThe little loli and the Faceless Woman were like the Sword of Damocles hanging over his head.\n\n\"Once things over there are handled, he might come here too. Then, perhaps you two can even become neighbors.\"\n\n*Heh*, women.\nTo be honest, Zhou Ze didn't have much confidence that he could return safely from Rongcheng, but he also knew that for Tang Shi, she wouldn't listen to any rational words now.\nZhou Ze could only follow her lead and continue:\n\"Alright then, we can even form a group. Marvel has something called the *Avengers*, right? We can have one too,\n*League of Hell-Comers*?\n*Hell-Bound League*?\"\n\n\"Too obvious a rip-off, and tacky,\" Tang Shi was clearly dissatisfied with the name.\n\n\"Heh, then you suggest one.\"\n\n\"*Anorexic League*, how about that?\"",

    "content": "A week later, Xu Qinglang’s noodle shop and Zhou Ze’s bookstore were both set to move tomorrow. However, Xu Qinglang still opened his noodle shop tonight, saying he planned to do business there for the last day.\n\nIt's hard to leave one's homeland; this noodle shop also carried a long period of Xu Qinglang's life, and even his last moments with his parents.\n\nIf it weren't for the little loli's intervention, perhaps Xu Qinglang could still \"dine\" with his parents every night, enjoying the warmth of a family together.\n\nZhou Ze's bookstore, on the other hand, was already closed. All the books inside were packed into boxes, just waiting for the truck to come and transport them tomorrow.\n\nWith Bai Yingying, a strong laborer, and Tang Shi, a \"controller of objects,\" the packing efficiency was indeed very fast. Boss Zhou, whose injuries were mostly healed but not completely, only needed to sit in the adjacent noodle shop, sipping tea, looking much like an old landlord from the old society.\n\nThe old Daoist and the monkey were playing in the deserted shopping mall behind. The monkey and the old Daoist were very close; one person and one monkey could certainly play together.\n\nThere was no forest here, but the empty commercial center behind was enough for the monkey to run wild and have fun.\n\nSipping tea, watching the sun gradually set outside, Xu Qinglang sat there looking at his phone, showing little sadness, and certainly not much joy.\n\nFortunately, at this moment, a customer finally arrived.\n\nThis was today's first customer.\n\nAnd, as expected,\n\nThis would also be today's last customer.\n\nAfter the last time Zhou Ze took a taxi and asked the driver to find him an 'unclean' place, and the driver ended up driving here, whatever little popularity this place originally had dried up completely.\n\nPeople who used to pass by here on their way to or from work also chose to take a detour.\n\nThis was also Zhou Ze's reason for deciding to move.\n\nThe newcomer was dressed in a suit, but his hair was disheveled, and the suit was a bit dirty. He didn't look like an office worker, more like an unemployed wanderer, but the suit itself was quite expensive.\n\n\"What would you like to eat?\" Xu Qinglang asked, standing up.\n\n\"Stir-fry a few of your best dishes, and a bottle of Snow beer, chilled.\"\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\nXu Qinglang first got him the beer and then went to the kitchen to stir-fry dishes.\n\nThe man sat opposite Zhou Ze, across an aisle.\n\nHe glanced at the noodle shop and said,\n\n\"Moving, are we?\"\n\n\"You can tell?\" Zhou Ze was a little surprised.\n\n\"I can tell. It's just been cleaned. Who would bother cleaning so meticulously in this godforsaken place? This clearly means you're preparing to move.\"\n\nThe man took out a cigarette, lit it, and then directly flicked the ash onto the dining table.\n\nA moment later, Xu Qinglang brought out the first dish. The man looked at the dish and shook his head, saying:\n\n\"Boss, your cooking really isn't as good-looking as you are.\"\n\n\"Eat your food,\" Xu Qinglang replied indifferently.\n\nA man with over twenty apartments doing business usually had this kind of temper.\n\nThe man picked up his chopsticks, took a bite, and then spit it out, \"This dish is made without care, it's not authentic.\"\n\nXu Qinglang had already gone back to the kitchen to stir-fry the next dish, so he didn't hear the man's soliloquy.\n\n\"I think his cooking is pretty good,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Pretty good?\" The man reached out and gently tapped the table, \"Cooking and making meals as a hobby, can that be called 'pretty good'?\"\n\nHe then bit open the beer cap with his teeth, gulped down a large mouthful, and said, \"I can taste it. It's clear he's not short on money, just doing it to experience life. This cooking has no sincerity at all.\"\n\n\"It's hard to find a sincere restaurant nowadays.\"\n\n\"Oh, what's your relationship? I said his food wasn't good, why are you suddenly targeting me?\"\n\nThe man pointed at Zhou Ze, then at the kitchen, and smiled silently,\n\n\"Oh, something fishy, something fishy here.\"\n\nZhou Ze couldn't be bothered to deal with this guy. The reason he struck up a conversation earlier was that this guy looked a bit familiar, as if he had seen him somewhere before.\n\nOf course, it must have been in his previous life.\n\n\"Disgusted? Do you feel I'm disgusting? Disgusting people live more comfortably. I just feel your life must not be that comfortable. You sit there sipping tea, looking very cultivated, but you're also someone who likes to meddle.\n\nPeople, as long as they like to meddle, their lives won't be comfortable.\"\n\nThe man took another drink of beer and looked at Zhou Ze with a smile.\n\n\"By the way, the bookstore next door, that should be yours, right? Is it closing too?\" The man pointed to the next door, \"When I just came over, I saw that everything inside the glass door was packed.\"\n\n\"Yes, we're moving.\"\n\n\"Did you sue?\" the man asked, narrowing his eyes.\n\n\"Sue for what?\"\n\n\"Sue the developer here, sue the management here. I heard that things have been happening one after another here, clearly it's the management's negligence.\n\nFirst a cinema fire,\n\nThen someone jumping to their death,\n\nThis led to your business failing. Sue them, make them compensate your losses.\"\n\n\"Sue for what? Business was already bad before.\" Xu Qinglang brought out the last dish, then placed the rice on the table and said to the man, \"Eighty yuan.\"\n\n\"Tsk, you're asking me for eighty yuan, and I'm telling you about a big deal. That cinema fire, you can sue the cinema, make them compensate your losses.\"\n\n\"Someone committed arson, and the arsonist is a pauper, can't pay for anything,\" Xu Qinglang retorted.\n\n\"Nonsense, did the cinema have no responsibility for the fire?\n\nDid the management here have no responsibility?\n\nSue, sue them to compensate your losses. Also, those two who jumped, I heard their families are quite rich. Sue them! Them jumping here affected your normal business operations, make them compensate for the losses!\"\n\n\"Your theory is quite novel,\" Zhou Ze said, somewhat amused.\n\nNot to mention that he and Xu Qinglang, due to their special identities, had no intention of claiming any losses from here. Even if they were normal people, it would probably be difficult for them to think of demanding compensation from this.\n\n\"What's novel about it? If there's a law to follow, follow it! Chinese people just don't like to file lawsuits, but I'm telling you, this lawsuit can be fought, and you can get compensation.\n\nEven if we pull out a single hair from that cinema company, it's thicker than our waists.\n\nI can help you fight this lawsuit. I happen to be short on money, so I won't charge you a lawyer's fee. We'll split the compensation fifty-fifty. Don't worry, it won't be a small amount; if it were small, I wouldn't take this case.\"\n\n\"Go away, who has time to fight this lawsuit with you? Besides, someone's family died, and we go demanding compensation from them? Is that appropriate?\"\n\nXu Qinglang was getting annoyed with this guy.\n\n\"Is 'appropriate' useful? Can 'appropriate' get you money? You were 'appropriate' and your business still couldn't continue and you're preparing to move, weren't you?\"\n\nThe man took another drink. The bottle of beer was almost empty.\n\n\"Why not take the money? Are you two idiots?!\"\n\n\"Are you surnamed Du?\" Zhou Ze suddenly asked.\n\nThe man was startled, then looked at Zhou Ze, \"Oh, you actually recognize me.\"\n\n\"Old Zhou, do you know him?\" Xu Qinglang asked Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze nodded, \"A great lawyer.\"\n\n\"Him? A great lawyer?\" Xu Qinglang laughed so hard tears almost came out. \"This is clearly a shyster.\"\n\n\"He really is a great lawyer,\" Zhou Ze repeated.\n\nZhou Ze remembered that his hospital had two medical accidents caused by new drugs in the past. Patients sued the hospital, and the hospital then hired this Great Lawyer Du, who perfectly won the lawsuits.\n\nHe was from Tongcheng, but he used to have his own law firm in Shanghai, considered a very famous professional lawyer in the industry, with a very high winning rate.\n\nHowever, back then, his fees were also very expensive; only wealthy tycoons and large corporations could afford his legal fees, not ordinary people.\n\n\"Since you recognize me, you should know how good I am at lawsuits. Come on, hire me for this case. You'll have money to open a new store, and I'm short on cash.\"\n\nGreat Lawyer Du looked at Zhou Ze, with a look that seemed to say, \"Hurry up and beg me.\"\n\n\"Sorry, we're not interested,\" Zhou Ze still refused.\n\n\"Not interested in RMB? Are you perhaps interested in冥币?\"<sup>1</sup>\n\nGreat Lawyer Du clutched his stomach and laughed,\n\nThen stood up,\n\nPointed at Zhou Ze and Xu Qinglang,\n\n\"Don't want money, two big idiots.\"\n\nWith that, he felt in his pocket, took out a hundred-yuan note, and placed it on the table,\n\n\"The food was really bad, keep the change.\"\n\nThen, holding the remaining half bottle of beer, he staggered out of the shop.\n\n\"This guy's crazy, isn't he?\" Xu Qinglang said while clearing the table. \"Never mind, we're closing. From now on, it's just coffee and pastries.\"\n\n\"He's quite formidable, he used to be,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"You speak so highly of him?\"\n\n\"Not highly. In any industry, to reach the top in a region, especially in a place like Shanghai, one must truly be capable.\n\nDo you know what his most famous case was?\"\n\n\"Tell me about it.\"\n\n\"A juvenile home invasion murder case. Despite the prosecution having a lot of evidence, because the suspect's family spent a large sum of money to hire him as a defense lawyer,\n\nHe actually managed to win the case, and the suspect was acquitted.\"\n\n\"So, did that child actually commit murder?\" Xu Qinglang asked.\n\nZhou Ze hesitated, then nodded, \"He probably did.\"\n\n\"Someone so money-grubbing, could he still get by in the industry?\"\n\n\"He'd only do better, because what tycoons and big corporations need are lawyers who can help them win lawsuits and protect their interests, not just lawyers who talk about conscience.\"\n\n\"I understand that principle.\" Xu Qinglang stretched, then pointed with some curiosity at the figure staggering away outside, drinking and acting drunk:\n\n\"So why did this guy end up in such a sorry state, even bothering to come here and incite us to let him fight a lawsuit?\"\n\nZhou Ze took a sip of tea,\n\nAnd slowly said:\n\n\"Later, the juvenile who was acquitted committed another home invasion murder.\n\nBy a twist of fate,\n\nHe broke into\n\nGreat Lawyer Du's house.\n\nHis wife and daughter, on that day,\n\nWere killed.\"\n\n***\n<sup>1</sup>冥币 (míngbì): spirit money or joss paper, burnt as offerings to the deceased in Chinese traditional religion.

    "content": "The new store opened, filled with a festive atmosphere.\n\nFor Zhou Ze, the store's renovation, rent, and all other imaginable expenses weren't actually paid by him.\n\nXu Qinglang covered half, and the remaining half came from Bai Yingying's funeral dowry.\n\nOf course, Xu Qinglang was preparing for \"semi-retirement\" now, intending to just sell coffee and make small desserts at the bookstore, living a healthy life.\n\nEarning money would be up to Zhou Ze.\n\nFortunately, everyone wasn't too doubtful of Zhou Ze's money-making ability. The new store's location on South Street had heavy foot traffic, and likely quite a bit of ghost traffic too.\n\nAs long as Boss Zhou upheld the professional spirit of not fearing hardship or staying up late, continuously sending the incoming ghosts to Hell for re-education and a chance at being human again, earning piles of Hell Bank Notes shouldn't be a problem.\n\nThen everyone could just squat at the bookstore entrance burning paper money and waiting for people to drop their wallets, even skipping bank transaction fees.\n\nThe bookstore's overall color scheme was soft and dark. The bookshelves weren't densely packed. Fast-changing newspapers and magazines had their own row, novels had another, and more serious books were in a separate area.\n\nAs for teaching aids and similar items, Zhou Ze didn't bother stocking them.\n\nThe bookstore had a second floor, which was divided into three rooms and a bathroom, serving as everyone's living quarters.\n\nOn the first day of business, there were no firecrackers, no flower baskets or salute cannons. Everything was simple and peaceful.\n\nThe old Taoist priest was tactful, cleaning with Bai Yingying, while Zhou Ze sat behind the bar, savoring the cocktail Xu Qinglang had just prepared.\n\nAfter taking a sip, he set the glass down. The little monkey picked it up, secretly took a sip, and then found it extremely unpalatable, sticking out its tongue repeatedly.\n\nTang Shi was alone in her upstairs bedroom. She was a homebody; if she had nothing to do, she could stay in her room all day without feeling bored.\n\nOnce everything was tidied up and ready for customers, it was already after dusk, and the sky had grown dark.\n\nBai Yingying held the signboard with one hand, hanging up the \"Midnight Bookstore\" sign. She then jumped down, clapped her hands, and after confirming it was perfectly straight, smiled contentedly.\n\nAfterward, she followed her boss's instructions and hung up and secured the two couplet signboards, \"Listen with a Grain of Salt\" and \"Thus I Have Heard,\" on the left and right sides respectively.\n\nThese were the signs brought from the old store.\n\nBai Yingying had asked Zhou Ze about the meaning of \"Listen with a Grain of Salt\" and \"Thus I Have Heard.\" Zhou Ze explained that they simply meant stories he had heard and was telling everyone.\n\nThey didn't represent his personal views, and people should just listen for entertainment, not taking them seriously.\n\nThe bookstore still primarily dealt with the business of the dead; the living's business was merely a bonus. After all, not far from South Street was \"Tongcheng Bookstore,\" a large bookstore specializing in physical books. Competing with it would be incredibly difficult and utterly unnecessary.\n\nZhou Ze remembered that when he was a child, \"Tongcheng Bookstore\" was considered the most influential bookstore in the hearts of Tongcheng people. However, in recent years, with the continuous compression and downturn of the physical book market, Tongcheng Bookstore had already reduced its operating area, appearing much shabbier than in its heyday.\n\nOne could only say that the widespread adoption of smartphones and screen reading had gradually made most people forget the habit of reading the scent of ink on paper.\n\nWith everything complete and in order, it was time to wait for business.\n\nIn fact, business came quickly. From its official opening at 7 PM until now, several groups of customers had already arrived, but they had all just ordered coffee or other drinks, resting and chatting. They were all living people.\n\nWhen living people came, Zhou Ze didn't move at all. Instead, Xu Qinglang was constantly busy greeting them and preparing drinks, swamped with work.\n\nAfter sending off these groups of customers, it was already 9:30 PM. Xu Qinglang took a sip of water, looked at Zhou Ze swaying in the rocking chair, and felt an immediate imbalance in his heart!\n\n\"Old Zhou, I think we should hang a sign that says, 'No Living People Allowed.' What do you think?\"\n\n\"Then the Industrial and Commercial Bureau will be knocking on our door the next day,\" Zhou Ze unhesitatingly rejected Xu Qinglang's suggestion.\n\n\"But I feel like this is more tiring than running my noodle shop,\" Xu Qinglang complained with a mournful expression.\n\nWhen he ran his noodle shop before, not many people actually ate in the store; most orders were for takeout. If he wanted to rest, he could simply turn off the takeout app. But now that customers had come in, he couldn't exactly kick them out, could he?\n\n\"Look, here they come.\"\n\nZhou Ze looked outside the door.\n\nIt seemed that due to the location, the real business for today was also arriving quickly.\n\nEntering was an old woman, leaning on a cane, her figure thin and somewhat shriveled. Her eyes were wide open, as if she had died with her eyes still open.\n\nThe old woman had a faint trace of resentment, which meant she still had some lingering obsessions, so she hadn't gone to Hell or entered reincarnation.\n\nBut her slight resentment was still far from turning into a malevolent ghost, remaining a \"harmless\" type of ghost.\n\n\"Prepare the dishes,\" Zhou Ze told Xu Qinglang.\n\nThis time, Xu Qinglang didn't complain or whine. In fact, preparing food for those about to be sent to Hell was his own suggestion.\n\nHe felt that Zhou Ze's previous method of directly sending ghosts to Hell was too simple and crude, without any foreplay, too dry and lacking in service quality.\n\nTherefore, he suggested preparing some food before sending people to Hell, giving them a send-off. That way, they would leave more Hell Bank Notes.\n\nIt was the same principle as how movie theaters had significant income from selling cola and popcorn, besides the main income from movie tickets.\n\nThe dishes were simple: a plate of dried radishes, a plate of peanuts, a bowl of rice with chopsticks stuck upright in it, and a cup of aged yellow wine.\n\nThese were all pre-prepared items, just needed to be plated, so it wasn't troublesome.\n\nThe old Taoist priest set up the small table and stools, and pulled the curtain to block the view from outside. Otherwise, if other customers came in and saw this, they would probably be startled.\n\nThis was a small private room, specifically for ghosts.\n\nZhou Ze walked over, holding his teacup, and said to the old woman, \"Please.\"\n\nThe old woman hesitated. It was clear she was afraid, but she feared Zhou Ze even more. At once, she could only sit down tremblingly.\n\nXu Qinglang handed the old Taoist priest a bottle of cow's tears mixed with talisman water. The old Taoist priest rubbed it on his eyes and also saw the old woman.\n\nHonestly, the old Taoist priest hadn't encountered such an open-door ghost business since leaving the netherworld store. For a moment, he felt a bit nostalgic and couldn't help but think of his boss, who was still in Rongcheng.\n\nHowever, it would be soon.\n\nThe old Taoist priest had already sent a notification to his followers in his live-streaming room, which had been dormant for several months. He would restart his live stream on April 1st, at midnight, roughly after 00:20 on March 31st.\n\nThat day was when his boss said he would return.\n\nBai Yingying also brought a small stool and sat down. The old woman seemed a bit shy. A zombie, a ghost messenger, a Xuanxiu, plus an old Taoist priest whose crotch seemed to be steaming with heat…\n\nThe old woman felt immense pressure.\n\nHer slight resentment felt truly insignificant surrounded by this pack of wolves.\n\n\"Eat up. After you eat, you can be on your way.\"\n\nZhou Ze urged.\n\nThe old woman smiled, lowered her head, and began to eat.\n\nJust as a tiger, though formidable, behaves like a little kitten when facing its zookeeper in the zoo, the old woman, who could have scared people sick or unconscious with a fleeting glimpse outside, now obediently ate her meal.\n\n\"Ma'am, how did you die?\" the old Taoist priest began to ask at this point.\n\nThe old Taoist priest was an active person. Even at his age, the older he got, the more he talked.\n\nHe often chatted with the little monkey, telling stories of how he subdued demons five hundred years ago and suppressed a great mischievous monkey under Five Finger Mountain, and so on.\n\nThe monkey was also supportive. As long as the old Taoist priest bought some snacks, the monkey would sit there listening to the old Taoist priest brag for an entire afternoon, occasionally waving its hand in approval:\n\n\"That's a great story!\"\n\n\"Sānpengsī lǐ.\" (Meaning: \"Died of illness.\")\n\nThe old Taoist priest was confused. He knew the old woman was speaking in dialect, so he looked at Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Died of illness,\" Zhou Ze translated.\n\nThe Tongcheng dialect was very different from Mandarin.\n\n\"Ma'am, this won't do. Even if you're a ghost, you can't forget to learn. You have to learn Mandarin well, otherwise, when you get to Hell...\n\nThink about it, there are so many people on the Yellow Springs Road. It'll be hard to find someone who speaks Tongcheng dialect. You won't even have anyone to chat with on the road, how boring would that be?\"\n\nThe old Taoist priest kindly reminded her.\n\nThe old woman was a bit embarrassed and could only lower her head to eat.\n\n\"Do you have children?\" the old Taoist priest asked again.\n\n\"Yú guǒ ó tēi.\" (Meaning: \"I have a daughter.\")\n\nThe old Taoist priest looked at Zhou Ze again, meaning, \"Translate quickly.\"\n\n\"She has a daughter,\" Xu Qinglang translated.\n\n\"Then your daughter must have burned a lot of paper money for you, right?\" The old Taoist priest rubbed his hands.\n\nThe old woman was startled at his words, then smiled bitterly, \"Our family's financial situation isn't good.\" (Translated by Xu Qinglang)\n\n\"Family's financial situation isn't good?\" The old Taoist priest didn't get discouraged and continued, \"It's alright, paper money isn't expensive anyway. As long as your child cares about you, there can be more paper money.\"\n\n\"Lying in bed, no money to treat the illness,\" (Translated by Xu Qinglang) the old woman said, putting down her chopsticks and wiping her tears.\n\n\"How pitiful,\" the old Taoist priest wiped his own tears along with her.\n\nBai Yingying also pouted, feeling a bit upset herself.\n\n\"My daughter in the hospital bed asked me if I wanted to continue spending money on treatment. I was lying in bed, unable to speak or move. She cried and told me that if I didn't want to continue treatment, I should blink. If I didn't blink, she would even sell everything we owned to pay for my treatment.\"\n\n\"That's a good daughter,\" the old Taoist priest said. \"What did you do?\"\n\n\"I blinked, and then I went home from the hospital, and then I died,\" the old woman continued to wipe her tears.\n\n\"It's not easy, you're also thinking of your children. Truly great, it's not easy for anyone, children need to live too,\" the old Taoist priest lamented along with her.\n\nIn reality, such things are common, especially when facing terminal illnesses, which means continuously pouring money into treatment. Many families simply cannot afford such an expensive way of treating illnesses.\n\n\"Ma'am, you are very great,\" Bai Yingying said.\n\n\"Let me pour you another drink,\" Xu Qinglang offered.\n\nMeanwhile, watching everyone around him with tear-filled eyes, Zhou Ze couldn't help but feel a little amused.\n\nHe pointed to the old woman's eyes, which had been wide open since she entered, and asked:\n\n\"How did you blink?\"\n\nAt his words, the old woman…\n\nstopped crying.\n\nShe immediately said fiercely:\n\n\"She asked me,\n\n'Mom, I'm asking you, if you don't want to continue treatment, just blink. If you don't blink, I'll even sell everything we own to pay for your treatment.'\n\nAnd then,\n\nafter waiting for five minutes,\n\nI couldn't stand it anymore,\n\nso I blinked.\n\nShe immediately started wiping her tears and said:\n\n'Okay,\n\nMom,\n\nI understand what you mean.\n\nWe won't treat it anymore.'\"",

    "content": "After Xu Qinglang translated the old woman’s last words, the previously deeply moved crowd looked bewildered.\n\nWhat the hell,\n\nWhere’s the heartwarming story of \"I for my children, my children for me,\" and filial piety?\n\nWhy this twist?\n\nZhou Ze clapped his hands and asked, \"Are you done eating?\"\n\nThe implication was,\n\nIf you’re done eating, it’s time to go.\n\nThe old woman shyly put down her chopsticks and said,\n\n\"I don't know how I ended up here. I didn't want to go down. I still wanted to...\"\n\nZhou Ze silently watched her,\n\nA smile appeared at the corner of his mouth,\n\nCustomer first,\n\nCustomer requests must be listened to with a smile.\n\nThe old woman’s body stiffened, startled into a shiver,\n\nAnd immediately said,\n\n\"I think it's better for me to go down early.\"\n\nZhou Ze thought he should put up some slogans in this small private room:\n\nConfess and be lenient, resist and be strict.\n\nThat seemed a bit too serious, or perhaps:\n\nReform diligently, become a new person.\n\nThese thoughts in his mind only amused him. Zhou Ze stood up, opened the Gate of Hell, and the old woman was still hesitating, but Zhou Ze directly grabbed her shoulder with one hand and tossed her in.\n\nAnd just like that,\n\nThe new store's first order was complete.\n\nNext, Zhou Ze bent down and looked under the small table, seeing a small stack of Hell Bank Notes.\n\n\"Count them, are there more than before?\" Xu Qinglang urged.\n\n\"It seems there are more,\" Zhou Ze confirmed.\n\n\"That means this method works! I told you, the profit margin for extra services is the largest. Should we offer other services?\"\n\nDespite owning more than twenty apartments, Xu Qinglang’s desire to make money remained as strong as ever.\n\nNo one would complain about having too much money.\n\n\"How about a massage? Or a spa?\" Zhou Ze chuckled.\n\n\"That's a bit too much,\" Xu Qinglang frowned.\n\n\"Some funeral homes now offer such services, like hydrotherapy massages for the deceased. I saw it once, in a glass cubicle, where family members stood outside watching while the technician showered and massaged the corpse, and even did nail trimming, a whole package.\"\n\n\"You're disgusting.\" Xu Qinglang, looking as if he couldn't stand it, turned to start clearing the dishes from the table.\n\nActually, the dishes hadn't been touched at all, at least they looked untouched, but they still had to be thrown away.\n\nIf it were offerings for one's own ancestors at home, after the ceremony, people could still eat the dishes or fruits. After all, it was food that their own ancestors had eaten, so there was no big deal in everyone sharing a meal.\n\nBut Xu Qinglang and the old woman were not related, so he certainly wouldn't eat her leftovers.\n\nPutting the Hell Bank Notes into the cabinet, Zhou Ze settled back into his armchair,\n\nRocking forward,\n\nRocking backward,\n\nHe liked this ease and enjoyed this leisure.\n\nBai Yingying went upstairs to play on the computer, the old Taoist priest took the monkey upstairs to watch TV, and Xu Qinglang also went up to rest.\n\nThus, only Zhou Ze, the boss, was left on the first floor of the bookstore.\n\nHolding his phone, he casually browsed, checking the news and such. Outside, it began to rain without him noticing, and the rain was quite heavy, changing from a sparse drizzle to a downpour.\n\nThis season, it really could rain at any moment.\n\nHe picked up his water glass, took a sip, and when Zhou Ze stretched and looked up again, he found a dense line of people standing at his bookstore's entrance.\n\nOh,\n\nBusiness is this good today?\n\nThis was only the first night the new store opened. If it continued like this, Zhou Ze felt he could not only quickly repay the money he owed his maid but also immediately buy a good car.\n\nHmm, it's just that Xu Le, that useless fellow, doesn't even have a driver's license, so he'd have to get one himself.\n\nWalking to the storefront, Zhou Ze paused, realizing that those standing outside were not people, but rows of clothes.\n\nIt was just that the people who usually sold clothes on stalls outside had moved their stalls to his shop entrance to take shelter from the rain because of some preconceived notions, which made Zhou Ze mistakenly think there were ghostly figures outside.\n\nHe opened the shop door.\n\nOutside stood two young women, around twenty years old, with wallets clipped to their waists and ponytails, looking fresh and capable.\n\n\"Boss, sorry, we're blocking your business. We'll leave as soon as the rain lessens. So sorry, so sorry.\" One girl bowed and apologized to Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Boss, do you have coffee? We'll buy two cups of coffee.\" The other girl was more resourceful. If they bought coffee, the owner might not be so quick to shoo them away.\n\n\"It's fine, wait until the rain stops before you go.\"\n\nZhou Ze wasn't that heartless, plus his business could still get customers even with an iron plate blocking the entrance.\n\n\"Thank you, boss.\"\n\n\"Thank you, boss.\"\n\nThe two girls thanked Zhou Ze again.\n\nZhou Ze returned to his spot behind the bar. The upgraded bar area was indeed much more sophisticated and comfortable than the previous counter, with surround sound playing soft music.\n\nAbout fifteen minutes passed, and the rain showed no signs of letting up. One of the girls from the clothes stall pushed open the bookstore door and walked in.\n\nShe went to the bookshelf, picked out a few fashion magazines, and then came over to Zhou Ze, ready to pay.\n\n\"Forty-eight.\" Zhou Ze glanced at the price and casually said, \"Make it fifty, keep the change.\"\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\nThe girl responded and handed Zhou Ze a fifty-yuan bill.\n\nZhou Ze accepted the money.\n\nA moment later,\n\nThe girl paused,\n\nIt seemed,\n\nSomething wasn't quite right.\n\nZhou Ze continued to lean back in his chair, and the girl, no longer fussing about the two yuan, took her books and sat down on the small sofa in the shop.\n\nHer companion was outside watching the stall, while she held a blank notebook and began sketching designs from the magazines.\n\nZhou Ze got up, poured a glass of orange juice, and brought it over to her.\n\n\"It's free,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Oh, thank you, boss.\"\n\n\"Studying design?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Yes, we're students from Tongcheng University.\"\n\n\"University students coming out to set up a stall, that's really good.\"\n\nZhou Ze praised them a couple of times. He wasn't a perverted uncle with ulterior motives, so he didn't prolong the conversation. However, just as he reached the shop entrance, Zhou Ze suddenly saw the girl who was outside watching the clothes talking to a man dressed in black.\n\nSeveral other people stood behind the man in black. They seemed a bit cold, shivering in the rain, but even so, they didn't move closer to take shelter under the eaves.\n\nZhou Ze pushed open the shop door and walked over.\n\nThe man in black looked up, saw Zhou Ze, and then immediately looked down again.\n\nThe few scantily clad people behind him suddenly became timid, not daring to make eye contact with Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze walked up to the man in black, who was wearing a hat that obscured half his face. Then, Zhou Ze turned his head and saw that the girl who was handing out clothes had a blank, hazy look in her eyes, and the money she had just collected was a stack of old Hell Bank Notes.\n\n\"Isn't that going too far?\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"We are all lonely souls, on our way back to our hometowns, but it's raining, and my brothers have no clothes, so we are really cold. We beg for your mercy, Lord Envoy.\"\n\n\"Lonely souls, then hurry up and go to hell.\"\n\nZhou Ze's attitude was very stiff; clearly, he had no intention of negotiating.\n\nWhat a joke,\n\nLonely souls are also performance!\n\nBoss Zhou was currently aiming for performance, and even a mosquito's leg is meat; he wouldn't let it go.\n\nIt seemed that changing shops was the right choice. Look how lively it was tonight.\n\nThe man in black slowly raised his head, revealing his scarred face, and said in a deep voice:\n\n\"Is Lord Envoy not planning to discuss this properly?\"\n\n\"What is there to discuss between you and me?\"\n\nZhou Ze reached out, first grabbing the girl's shoulder and pulling her back slightly, then he took a step forward, standing in front of the man in black,\n\nHe extended his hand,\n\nAnd gently poked the man in black's chest,\n\n\"You can try to fabricate a pitiful story to make me soft-hearted,\n\nOh no,\n\nMy apologies, I forgot,\n\nMy conscience was temporarily eaten by myself and hasn't been found yet.\"\n\n\"After I take them back to our homeland, I will bring them back to hell. You can rest assured about that, Lord Envoy!\"\n\nAlthough the man in black had a face full of scars, he spoke with conviction, clearly in command of this group of minor ghosts.\n\n\"Do I have to buy a plane ticket and go to your hometown for a visit? Sorry, brother, I don't have time.\"\n\nZhou Ze's fingernails grew long,\n\nBlack smoke slowly began to swirl out,\n\nAt this moment, the girl sitting inside the shop looked outside and only saw her companion and the boss seemingly chatting, completely unaware of anything else she shouldn't see.\n\n\"I can't hand them over to you now. I must take them back first!\"\n\nThe man in black charged at Zhou Ze, full of aggression!\n\nBut the next second,\n\nZhou Ze merely flicked his arm,\n\nThe man in black was sent flying directly, the sharpness of the fingernails making his soul unstable.\n\n\"Heh heh.\"\n\nZhou Ze chuckled twice.\n\nAn ordinary ghost,\n\nDared to attack him, a Ghost Messenger.\n\nThe man in black charged again, but without exception, he was sent flying by Zhou Ze once more.\n\nAt this, the few ghosts who had been standing there timidly immediately showed signs of instability.\n\nZhou Ze had initially thought they would all rush forward to help their boss fight, which would be a show of loyalty.\n\nOr,\n\nThese few ghosts would quickly kneel down and beg him for mercy,\n\nThough begging wouldn't have much effect.\n\nBut instead, they directly turned around and pounced on the black figure, whose soul was starting to blur after being repeatedly sent flying by Zhou Ze.\n\nThey were furious, beginning to gnaw and tear at the black figure.\n\nZhou Ze stood aside, watching the spectacle with a smile, and said,\n\n\"It seems your subordinates have been squeezed pretty hard by you.\"\n\nEven though the man in black was being torn at, he still didn't utter any screams, and at the same time, he sternly retorted:\n\n\"They are the criminals I was pursuing. My car and their car collided in an accident during the pursuit, and we all died.\n\nBut even in death,\n\nI will drag them to the public security bureau at the scene of the crime to be turned in!\"",

    "content": "Zhou Ze reached out, his fingertips continuously swirling out black mist to disperse the gang of guys gnawing around the man in black, but the wisps of black mist still enveloped the little ghosts, preventing them from escaping.\n\nSince the battle on the rooftop, Zhou Ze found that his mastery of this power seemed to have reached a new level.\n\n\"Are you a police officer?\"\n\nZhou Ze lowered his head, looking at the man in black lying on the ground, his soul nearly shattered.\n\n\"What do you think?\"\n\nThe man in black stood up, his soul fragmented, looking quite miserable.\n\nBut his gaze was firm, bright and piercing.\n\n\"Just didn't expect it.\"\n\nZhou Ze remembered the last time he saw Bureau Chief Zhao, who, on the day of his funeral, entered his bookstore, and neither he nor Xu Qinglang could tell if he was alive or dead.\n\nThinking about it, he was relieved.\n\nBureau Chief Zhao was nearing retirement age, having diligently worked his entire life, much like Madam Bai, who had gone to hell earlier; her merits were fulfilled.\n\nSuch a person was an anomaly among anomalies.\n\nIt was like learning from Lei Feng and doing good deeds; it's precisely because Lei Feng is an anomaly in this society that we need to learn from him. If everyone were a living Lei Feng, what would be the point of learning?\n\n\"Come inside with me.\"\n\n…………\n\nIt was still raining outside. The girl who had been sitting in the bookstore sketching from a magazine went out to check on her companion and found her asleep leaning against a clothes rack. She draped a coat over her and stayed outside with her instead of going back in.\n\nTwo university students out selling wares to earn money, like delicate wildflowers in this city, stubborn and strong.\n\nFor them, it was an ordinary day: setting up their stall, encountering rain, seeking shelter.\n\nThey couldn't possibly know what kind of business the bookstore they were sheltering in conducted, nor did they remember that one of them had just nearly made a deal with a ghost.\n\nInside the bookstore, Zhou Ze set out some peanuts and orchid beans. The man in black sat opposite him, while the little ghosts stood shivering at the side.\n\n\"Thank you for the hospitality.\"\n\nThe man in black said in a deep voice.\n\n\"Once you're done eating, it's time to go.\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nThe man looked up at Zhou Ze; clearly, he was unwilling.\n\n\"They are already dead, and you have sacrificed yourself. Your responsibilities have been fulfilled. There's no need to stubbornly cling to your obsession, dragging them along with you.\n\nIf something goes wrong along the way and their souls escape your control, this world will gain several more wandering ghosts, and perhaps cause other troubles.\"\n\nZhou Ze patiently explained.\n\nIn fact, the central idea was just one.\n\nI respect you, but respect is respect, and work is work.\n\nYou have your obsession, but I also have my responsibility.\n\nLiving people are your concern.\n\nDead people are my concern.\n\n\"Then can I ask you a favor?\"\n\n\"You first.\"\n\n\"Help me investigate the cause of my death.\" The man in black lifted his scarred face, which now looked especially fierce. \"I was an undercover agent, and someone betrayed me. Otherwise, I could have arrested them and brought them to justice alive.\"\n\nThe man in black recalled that in the car, one of the individuals suddenly answered a phone call, and the atmosphere immediately shifted. He realized that his identity had been exposed, and a struggle ensued in the car, ultimately leading to the vehicle plunging into a ravine, resulting in the tragic accident that destroyed the car and killed everyone inside.\n\n\"This sounds like a plot from a crime drama.\"\n\nZhou Ze sighed after hearing the man's narration.\n\nBeing an undercover agent is truly not easy.\n\n\"Come, a toast to you.\"\n\nZhou Ze raised his wine glass, clinking it virtually with him.\n\nThen, he put down his glass.\n\n\"You agreed?\" the other party asked.\n\n\"No, just stalling for time to formulate a polite refusal, so we don't feel awkward.\"\n\n\"…………\" the man in black.\n\n\"I'm sorry, I can't do that. This is just a bookstore, actually a waystation, for sending souls that shouldn't linger in the human world to be reincarnated in hell.\n\nMatters concerning living people in the human world are not my business, nor can I interfere. The only thing I can do is write an anonymous letter for you and send it up. Anything more, I cannot and will not do.\"\n\nThe man in black was somewhat disappointed. He wanted to say something more, but it turned into a sigh, and then he drank the wine.\n\nGhosts drinking only absorb the essence of the wine; the liquid in the glass doesn't seem to change at all. Zhou Ze poured out the wine from his original glass and refilled it.\n\n\"Drink two more, then I'll send you on your way. Wish you a safe journey.\"\n\nWhen a man is about to die, his words are kind.\n\nWhat's more, the ghost before him was about to be sent to hell by him. At this point, there was no need for him to make up stories to deceive himself.\n\nThis was a good police officer, worthy of three drinks.\n\nZhou Ze pointed to the wine glass.\n\nThis was all he could do.\n\nIn this world, turmoil, various injustices, and tragedies are happening every moment. Zhou Ze couldn't manage so much, nor was he willing to.\n\nManaging this bookstore well and getting his second life on the right track was what he was thinking about now.\n\n\"Is there judgment in Hell?\"\n\nThe man in black asked Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze was startled by the question.\n\nHe suddenly thought of the teacher wearing the tall hat, on which was written \"beast in human clothing.\"\n\nZhou Ze had tried to help him remove that hat, but couldn't; the hat was very solid and hard, completely unmovable.\n\nThis also meant that the Yama's Palace in Hell didn't seem to be the place of clear judgment as rumored, nor were all the Judges all-seeing and all-knowing.\n\nMost of them were probably muddled through, muddling along day by day.\n\nPeople always hold an inexplicable hope for things they don't understand, like Heaven, like Hell.\n\nPeople always believe that in places they haven't been, there will be more beautiful fragrances.\n\nThis is a spiritual anesthesia, a form of self-hypnosis.\n\nAt least for now, Hell, it seems, isn't much different from the human world.\n\nBut Zhou Ze still nodded.\n\n\"Yes, everything will come to light in Hell.\"\n\nThe man in black stood up, looked at Zhou Ze, and said, \"I don't need you to send an anonymous letter for me, just help me find my body. If you consider yourself a ghost messenger, I beg you. If you consider yourself a living person, as a citizen, you have an obligation to cooperate with our police actions.\"\n\nThe man spoke a place name:\n\nQiming Road, Huangjia Town section.\n\n\"Your bodies haven't been discovered yet?\" Zhou Ze was a bit surprised.\n\n\"No, not yet. So I haven't been identified. Besides my superior who knows my identity, everyone else thinks I've absconded with this group.\"\n\n\"I'll try.\"\n\nZhou Ze rubbed his brow.\n\nTrouble, it's really troublesome.\n\nAs a newly-minted homebody, all he wanted was to open a shop, do some business, and then lie on Bai Yingying's lap at night, eating grapes she peeled for him.\n\nNow, having to go on a long trip, it truly made him feel very annoyed.\n\n\"Please send us down. Send us all down together. On the road to the Underworld, I also want to escort them to see the Judges. I want to personally see them brought to justice.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded, opened the gate to Hell, and at the same time asked, \"Are they drug traffickers?\"\n\nThe man in black shook his head.\n\n\"Then smugglers?\"\n\n\"It was gambling,\" the man in black said in a deep voice.\n\n\"Oh.\" Zhou Ze was a bit puzzled. Was catching gamblers worth all this trouble?\n\n\"Gambling with human lives as stakes.\"\n\nThe man in black looked at Zhou Ze but didn't continue, knowing Zhou Ze wasn't very interested in the matter.\n\nHe grabbed the three little ghosts and walked into the gate of Hell.\n\nA moment later, the smoke dissipated.\n\nZhou Ze clapped his hands, took out his notebook, and checked. The performance chart showed 20%.\n\nThere was still 80% completion, but judging by the business of the new shop, it shouldn't take too long to become a regular.\n\nHe picked up his teacup, preparing to walk to his bar counter to continue being his leisurely Old Man Zhou, but found that at some point, someone was standing behind him.\n\nIt was Tang Shi.\n\nShe was still chewing on White Rabbit milk candy.\n\n\"Why didn't you agree to investigate? It would be so interesting?\" Tang Shi asked.\n\n\"I don't have that much free time.\" Zhou Ze walked back to the bar counter and sat down.\n\n\"Gambling with lives as stakes, it sounds quite interesting,\" Tang Shi continued. \"If he were here, he would go and take a look.\"\n\n\"He is him, I am me.\"\n\n\"Oh, business seems to be going well today. It really seems like a change of scenery is good for people.\" Tang Shi walked to the doorway, looking at the two female university students still sheltering from the rain outside.\n\n\"The rain hasn't stopped.\"\n\n\"You're not staying upstairs, coming down here to play the sentimental type?\" Zhou Ze asked, somewhat surprised.\n\nTang Shi shook her head, then she spread out her hand.\n\nA paper crane folded from paper fluttered gracefully, exquisitely lifelike.\n\n\"Zhou Ze, you know, sometimes it's not about actively avoiding trouble; trouble won't just avoid you.\"\n\n\"But at least it can reduce the amount of trouble.\" Zhou Ze lit a cigarette.\n\n\"I haven't had much to do these past two days, so I investigated you.\"\n\nSaid as if you usually have something to do.\n\nIn Zhou Ze's opinion, if one disregarded her special abilities and her identity as a reincarnated being, Tang Shi was merely a pretty face, incapable of doing anything and unwilling to do anything.\n\nExcept her legs looked good, could play with them for a year.\n\n\"Where are your eyes looking?\"\n\nThe ballpoint pen on Zhou Ze's counter floated up, dangling in front of his eyes, seemingly ready to poke them out at any moment.\n\n\"You look much better in black stockings than in nude ones.\"\n\nZhou Ze commented.\n\nTang Shi tossed out her phone, which floated in front of Zhou Ze.\n\nOn it was a news screenshot.\n\nA prison in Subei had a riot, resulting in one inmate dead and over ten injured.\n\n\"What does this mean?\" Zhou Ze asked, looking at the screen.\n\n\"How afraid of trouble are you?\" Tang Shi shook her head helplessly. \"You don't even recognize the person who drove the big truck that killed you?\"\n\nZhou Ze's pupils immediately constricted.\n\n\"It wasn't me,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"I know it wasn't you,\" Tang Shi said, \"but he's dead.\"\n\n\"Accident, perhaps? What if they also like to play hide-and-seek?\"\n\nZhou Ze shrugged.\n\nJust then, Xu Qinglang came down. He patted his forehead and said to Zhou Ze:\n\n\"Old Zhou, sorry, I forgot something a few days ago. Your uncle was looking for you when you went missing. He said his son, your cousin, died in a car accident and he wanted you to attend the funeral.\n\nI figured since you're Zhou Ze, Xu Le's relatives have nothing to do with you, plus you weren't around then, so I forgot. Just remembered now, so I'm telling you. The funeral was probably half a month ago, it's long over.\"\n\nUpon hearing this, Zhou Ze's expression finally became serious.\n\nFor some reason, it seemed as if a whirlpool had already, unbeknownst to him, begun to stir.",

    "content": "Zhou Ze was very afraid of trouble, genuinely afraid, but this didn't mean that when something was pointedly directed at him, he would foolishly cover his eyes with two leaves and pretend not to see anything.\n\nXu Qinglang, seeing Zhou Ze's face turn so serious after he finished speaking, was also startled and subconsciously asked,\n\n\"Is something wrong?\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head, \"Nothing.\"\n\n\"Then I'll head up first?\"\n\n\"Mm.\"\n\nXu Qinglang went up, looking back three times with each step. Instinctively, he felt something was amiss, but since Zhou Ze wasn't willing to share, he didn't press him. Everyone had their little secrets and their own calculations.\n\n\"You're serious now?\"\n\nTang Shi looked at Zhou Ze, a half-smile on her face.\n\nZhou Ze also looked at Tang Shi, flicking the ash from his cigarette. He said,\n\n\"Why are you investigating me?\"\n\n\"I told you, it's out of curiosity.\" Tang Shi voluntarily walked to the bar counter, closing the distance between herself and Zhou Ze. At the same time, her fingertips glided across the counter. \"You know, you're different from us, truly different.\"\n\n\"You said that before, that I haven't truly experienced hell, while you all have been tortured.\"\n\n\"No, this matter isn't that simple. I, and that person, barely escaped after experiencing the great horror of hell, while you just started on the Yellow Springs Road and managed to escape alive.\n\nYou know,\n\nOne event, one experience,\n\nIs enough to completely change a person.\n\nFor example, whenever I and that person talk about the word 'hell,' we instinctively tremble a little, because those two words 'hell' and all its associated images are a great horror branded in our hearts.\n\nEven if we've both 'lived' again, our personalities and ways of handling things have been greatly altered because of it.\n\nYou're different. You just went on a picnic to hell and came back.\n\nSo, you can sit at a small table with that police officer and chat about hell with a laugh, quite cheerfully.\"\n\n\"So, what exactly do you mean? What else have you found?\"\n\nThe driver of the large truck that ran him over died.\n\nXu Le's cousin, who helped Xu Le hire a killer, also died.\n\nTwo people, dying in a short period of time;\n\nAn ordinary person might not connect the deaths of these two people, but for Zhou Ze, this matter was very unusual.\n\nXu Le died, his body given to him.\n\nThe driver died.\n\nHis cousin also died.\n\nEveryone who was involved in that incident before had died.\n\nCould there really be such coincidences?\n\n\"We are anomalies in this world. We are even different from the ghost messengers; we are stowaways, and you are an anomaly among anomalies.\n\nWe are different.\"\n\n\"Get to the point.\" Zhou Ze tapped the blackboard (bar counter).\n\n\"Have you never suspected that your death and your rebirth were not an accident?\"\n\nTang Shi lowered her voice and asked slowly,\n\n\"Think carefully, are there any details you overlooked before?\"\n\n…………\n\n\"They're chasing me, they've found me…\"\n\nThe old man's nails dug into his arm, and his final relieved smile.\n\nAt the traffic light, his car had just pulled out.\n\nA large truck ran a red light and drove out,\n\nHeading straight for him.\n\nThe fire and scorching heat of the crematorium;\n\nThe numbness and desolation on the Yellow Springs Road to hell.\n\nThe faceless woman's roar and resentment,\n\nThe black fingernails that grew on his fingertips.\n\nHimself swaying dizzily by the roadside,\n\nA man in a hoodie ran out of the bookstore,\n\nHe bludgeoned Xu Le to death with a baseball bat,\n\nThen he entered Xu Le's body.\n\n…………\n\nZhou Ze slowly raised his head, opening his eyes.\n\nWhat happened to the person who killed Xu Le,\n\nAfter he reported the incident that time?\n\nZhou Ze had always overlooked this matter.\n\nHe had been going in circles between the bookstore and Dr. Lin's matters, largely attributing Xu Le's death and his own \"cuckoo's nest\" to a karmic cycle and just retribution.\n\nIt was also another kind of \"heaven has eyes.\"\n\nBut since the old man, who was taken to the hospital for resuscitation, intentionally dug his nails into his arm,\n\nThe truck driver who ran a red light and killed him was intentional,\n\nSo many people, all intentional,\n\nThen,\n\nThat man who had previously explained his actions as a temporary fit of madness, intending to rob some money and bludgeon Xu Le with a baseball bat,\n\nCould he,\n\nAlso have been intentional?\n\nIf he was intentional,\n\nThat would mean his death leading to his rebirth,\n\nThis entire sequence,\n\nWas all deliberately planned, and he was like a toy car on a race track, appearing to be speeding, but in reality, merely following a predetermined path.\n\n\"It seems you've thought of something.\"\n\nTang Shi put another White Rabbit milk candy into her mouth.\n\nZhou Ze picked up his phone, preparing to call the police station. The last time he reported the case, he also gave a statement at the police station. His first meeting with Dr. Lin was also at the police station.\n\nThe female police officer led Dr. Lin to him and said, \"Your wife is here to pick you up.\"\n\nZhou Ze was in a daze for quite a while.\n\nHowever, before dialing, Zhou Ze looked at Tang Shi and asked,\n\n\"How did you find out?\"\n\n\"You know, compared to us,\n\nYou're like a cute husky,\n\nWho snuck into a wolf pack.\"\n\n………………\n\nThe rain continued to fall, showing no sign of stopping. Tongcheng, located in the Yangtze River Delta region, naturally had abundant rainfall this season.\n\nThere were no earthquakes here, nor tsunamis. The only recurring issue that might cause some impact was internal flooding.\n\nDressed in a raincoat, Zhou Ze walked beneath the old apartment building. The trash cans were soaked with rainwater, and some trash had floated out.\n\nTang Shi wore rain boots and a black raincoat, her legs vaguely visible in the rainwater, but Zhou Ze had no leisure to admire such a scene.\n\nAfter calling to inquire, the person he sent to the police station was only detained for half a month, charged with violating public order regulations. After all, although he \"assaulted\" Zhou Ze in his shop, he was ultimately subdued by Zhou Ze, making it difficult to press a major charge.\n\nAnd Zhou Ze couldn't possibly say:\n\nOfficer,\n\nHe's a murderer,\n\nHe killed me,\n\nAnd I'm not me,\n\nI'm borrowing a corpse to return to life!!!\n\nIf he said that,\n\nHe'd probably end up being forcibly sent to a mental hospital instead of the other guy going to jail.\n\nHowever, Zhou Ze still managed to get the person's address from there, which was in this area.\n\n\"This is the one.\"\n\nUp on the second floor, Zhou Ze stopped in front of a door.\n\nMost of the apartments in this community were rented to migrant workers in Tongcheng. The facilities were quite poor, and they used shared bathrooms.\n\n\"Are you sure?\" Tang Shi asked.\n\n\"The house number should be correct.\"\n\nZhou Ze tried to peer through the window, but a screen and old curtains blocked the view, making it impossible to see inside from the outside.\n\n\"I'll go find something to pry the door open first...\"\n\n\"Click...\"\n\nThe door lock opened automatically.\n\nTang Shi made a \"please\" gesture to Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze was stunned for a moment,\n\nThen smiled,\n\nAnd walked in.\n\nHe thought to himself that it was a pity he wasn't doing this kind of \"thievery\" with her all the time.\n\nThe room was actually a one-bedroom apartment,\n\nOne room,\n\nContaining a bed, a wardrobe, and a small cooking area with an induction cooker.\n\nThe room was tidily kept, but some areas had accumulated dust, indicating that no one had lived there for a long time.\n\n\"How long has he been out?\"\n\n\"Several months. I sent him to the police station the day after I was reborn, and he was released half a month later.\"\n\nZhou Ze looked around, examining the details.\n\n\"Did he move?\" Tang Shi asked.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head, \"Not sure.\"\n\nThe guy who bludgeoned Xu Le to death with a baseball bat,\n\nHad he disappeared?\n\nZhou Ze suddenly noticed an unusual area on the wall behind the bed. He stepped onto the bed, reached out to feel that section of the wall, and then said,\n\n\"This wall looks like it was painted over recently.\"\n\n\"Is there something hidden inside?\" Tang Shi asked.\n\nZhou Ze put his ear to the wall and tapped it with his hand. \"It doesn't sound hollow.\"\n\nActually, in this type of housing, hollow spots in walls are very common. When decorating a new apartment, the construction team usually sends an experienced foreman to tap on the walls and floors with a ruler. If they find problems, they ask the developer for rectification before starting the renovation.\n\n\"Just open it up and see,\" Tang Shi said.\n\nZhou Ze nodded, about to say he would go find tools, then glanced at Tang Shi and instinctively stepped back a few paces.\n\nTang Shi's gaze fell upon the kitchen knife and other hard objects near the induction cooker. Then these objects flew out, continuously hitting and chiseling at the wall, in a repetitive motion.\n\nThe idea of starting a construction company once again flashed through Zhou Ze's mind.\n\nBai Yingying alone could match the labor of a construction team,\n\nTang Shi could match a batch of engineering equipment,\n\nHe would just need to sit there and count money.\n\nHowever, as the wall continuously cracked, Zhou Ze immediately discarded those random thoughts from his mind.\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nA section of the wall shattered and fell,\n\nA human face was revealed,\n\nThis face still maintained a horrified expression, seemingly perfectly preserving its emotional state before death.\n\nIt was that person,\n\nThe one who bludgeoned Xu Le to death with a baseball bat!\n\nIn the air,\n\nA sour smell permeated.\n\nZhou Ze reached out, examined the corpse inside, frowned, and said,\n\n\"The body looks like it died less than a week ago.\"\n\n\"You're not a forensic doctor, are you?\" Tang Shi reminded him.\n\n\"It's common knowledge for a surgeon; you can roughly estimate the time of death based on the body's post-mortem state,\" Zhou Ze explained.\n\n\"Then I can tell you, the wall I just broke open was definitely not sealed up less than a week ago; at least three months ago.\"\n\nTang Shi unwrapped a piece of milk candy, put it in her mouth, and continued,\n\n\"Unless you think he was killed a week ago and then moved into a wall sealed three months ago.\"\n\nZhou Ze immediately realized something was wrong.\n\nObviously, the corpse couldn't have been \"teleported\" into the wall later, and the wall was perfectly intact before Tang Shi started to break it open.\n\nHe sniffed,\n\nThat sour smell,\n\nHe had previously thought it was just the scent of the corpse,\n\nBut now,\n\nZhou Ze suddenly realized something, pushed aside the hair on the corpse's head,\n\nIndeed,\n\nHe found a small hole, an injection site.\n\n\"Yes, the body died a long time ago, but he was injected with formaldehyde, which is why the body is so well-preserved.\n\nFurthermore,\n\nThe formaldehyde was likely slowly injected into him while he was still alive,\n\nBecause the effect would be better if it diffused throughout the body via blood circulation.\"",

    "content": "Outdoors, Zhou Ze smoked a cigarette while Tang Shi stood beside him, chewing on a milk candy.\n\nInside the house, the corpse on the wall hung limply, its face frozen in an expression of horror and shock, as if the murder and body concealment had just taken place.\n\nThey were all dead.\nNot a single one left.\n\nXu Le was dead.\nThe person who killed Xu Le was dead.\nThe hit-and-run driver was dead.\nThe younger cousin was dead.\n\nAll the points on that line were dead.\nEven Zhou Ze, in fact, was dead.\n\nAs Tang Shi had said, sometimes it’s not that you intentionally avoid trouble; trouble simply won’t come looking for you.\n\nA pocket had opened long ago, and whether you wanted it or not, liked it or not, you were already inside that pocket.\n\n\"They're all dead, so the clues are probably gone,\" Tang Shi said, looking at Zhou Ze with a smile. She seemed to enjoy seeing Zhou Ze in this emotional state.\n\nIn a pack of wolves, each one looked grim and sullen all day, but then a husky appeared, only wanting to lie there looking cute.\nIt was really an annoying sight.\nWhy should we all be burdened with heavy thoughts,\nWhile only you are innocent and carefree?\nIt's not about scarcity but about unfairness, and this isn't just true in financial distribution.\n\n\"Currently, that seems to be the case.\" Zhou Ze reached up and rubbed his temples. \"Also, I have to worry about one thing: whether the police will eventually investigate me.\"\n\nThe mastermind, the one who paid, was Xu Le.\nThe driver was dead, and the intermediary, the cousin, was also dead.\nThe reason Zhou Ze had held back from seeking revenge before was precisely this: he didn't want to expose himself, as it would destroy his current life.\n\nModern society is vastly different from ancient times; even if there were household registration systems in ancient times, it wasn't hard for someone without an identity to hide and live as a recluse.\nIn modern society, however, a person's identity information and labels are crucial. Of course, Zhou Ze could hide if he wanted to, but the cost would be a rapid decline in his quality of life, constantly living on the run.\n\nNow, although Zhou Ze didn't kill anyone, he would naturally have to bear the potential repercussions of their deaths.\nHe didn't get to enjoy the satisfaction of revenge,\nAnd now he had to take the blame.\nSo frustrating!\n\nTaking out his phone, Zhou Ze dialed the police station.\n\"Hello, I'd like to report a crime.\"\n\nTang Shi didn't accompany Zhou Ze to the police station. Instead, she returned to the bookstore. Walking through the mud in a raincoat to inspect a murder scene with Zhou Ze on a rainy day was the most she could do. She couldn't possibly accompany Zhou Ze to face the complex interrogations and investigations at the police station.\n\nAs for Zhou Ze, he had no choice; he had to do it. After all, he had just called the police station to inquire about the deceased's residence. If he didn't report it now, his suspicion would only increase when the bodies were discovered later.\nAs for secretly disposing of the bodies, Zhou Ze was unwilling to do so. Until he could figure out who was manipulating everything behind the scenes, Zhou Ze didn't want to be clever and clean up someone else's mess.\nHe might accidentally dig a pit and bury himself in it.\n\n…………\n\nThe investigation and questioning lasted until past eight in the evening. Several waves of police officers rotated, making it clear that they were treating Zhou Ze as the murderer.\n\nDon't assume that a murderer wouldn't voluntarily report a crime.\nIn fact,\nAccording to police big data statistics, more than 80% of murderers in homicide cases will disguise themselves as \"bystanders\" and return to the crime scene to observe.\nMost murderers' mindsets are to disguise themselves and gather information, while a smaller portion harbors a perverse desire to admire their \"artwork\" after committing a killing.\nIf the victim's body remains undiscovered for too long, it's like a pearl hidden in the dark for the murderer, or the Mona Lisa's smile covered by a black cloth—it gnaws at them. So, they simply report the crime themselves to have that cover lifted.\n\nFinally, a grey-haired old detective sat in front of Zhou Ze, closed his notebook, and said, \"Mr. Zhou, you may leave, but please do not leave Tongcheng for the next month. We may need to speak with you again for further information.\"\n\n\"Alright.\"\nZhou Ze stood up and left the interrogation room, walking to the police station entrance.\nHe turned back, looking at the police officers coming and going and the row of police cars parked inside. A pressure weighed on him for some reason.\nPerhaps, before long, the truth of the staged car accident would also surface. At that time, what he would face might be a real storm.\nThe victim was himself, but the true murderer,\nwas also himself.\n\nZhou Ze was preparing to return to the bookstore; he was tired and wanted to rest. His phone rang at that moment—his sister-in-law was calling.\n\"Hello, Xu Le, your uncle is here again. He's sitting by the stairwell. I asked him to come in, but he refused, saying he just wanted to wait for you to come back.\"\n\nUncle?\n\"Just tell him I won't be back, and don't tell him the address of my new shop either.\" Zhou Ze didn't want to deal with irrelevant people right now.\n\n*Bang!*\nA sound of banging on the door came from the other end of the phone.\nZhou Ze frowned slightly and asked, \"What's wrong?\"\n\"Uh, your uncle is banging on the door. He said if you don't come back today, he'll make sure you go to jail.\"\n\nUpon hearing this,\nZhou Ze looked up, gritted his teeth, and said, \"Tell him I'll be right back.\"\n\n…………\n\nNo one wants to live like a punching bag, no one wants their life to be constrained. Everyone wants to be spontaneous, but that's just how life is.\nWhen you're a few months old, you can pee anywhere, wet the bed freely, and your elders and relatives will still smile at you, flicking your little dick.\nBut when you're in your teens or twenties, it's impossible to pee freely or have your dick flicked anymore.\nIt's hard to imagine a forty-five-year-old elder flicking a twenty-something young man's dick:\n\"You peed again, how naughty.\"\nThat image is too much to bear.\n\nAnd so, when Zhou Ze appeared before Xu Dachuan,\nXu Dachuan's face was grim,\nand Zhou Ze's face was equally gloomy.\nNo one was happy,\nNo one was joyful,\nBut they still had to meet.\n\nXu Dachuan hadn't harmed anyone inside the house. When Zhou Ze arrived, he was squatting there, smoking his dry tobacco pipe. Seeing Zhou Ze approach, he stood up, patted his trousers, and said, \"Come for a walk with me.\"\nThis time, Xu Dachuan didn't bring any local specialties; he came empty-handed.\nZhou Ze and Xu Dachuan walked out together. He didn't bother to greet his sister-in-law or Dr. Lin peering through the door crack.\nThe two walked out of the residential complex.\nIt was already completely dark.\nUnder the streetlights, there weren't many people.\nXu Dachuan walked a distance, then squatted down again, puffing on his dry tobacco pipe.\nZhou Ze stopped beside him.\n\n\"Xiao Chuanzi has already been cremated,\" Xu Dachuan said.\nXiao Chuanzi was likely the cousin's nickname.\n\"Mmm,\" Zhou Ze responded. \"I wasn't in Tongcheng at the time.\"\n\"It's fine.\"\nXu Dachuan tapped his tobacco pipe, then looked up. His face was full of wrinkles and the marks of age. He was an honest, simple old man who had worked hard to support his family; Xu Le, the university student, had actually been put through school by him.\n\"Ah Le, you not coming to Xiao Chuanzi's funeral was really a bit heartless.\"\nXu Dachuan's eyes welled up. He squatted there, wiping tears from the corners of his eyes with his chapped hands.\n\"I said, I wasn't in Tongcheng at the time.\"\n\nXu Dachuan suddenly stood up, grabbed Zhou Ze's collar with one hand, pushed him back, and pinned him against a utility pole.\n\"Ah Le, tell your uncle the truth, did you kill Xiao Chuanzi?\"\nZhou Ze's eyes narrowed slightly. The information in Xu Dachuan's question was extensive.\nBefore this, Zhou Ze had had some goodwill towards Xu Dachuan;\nRight and wrong, good and bad, had nothing to do with him, and besides, Xu Dachuan was the first stranger who had truly cared about him since his rebirth.\nHe could endure the Lin family's disdain and bring local specialties to visit him,\nEven on his sickbed, he would smile amiably at Dr. Lin, his niece-in-law, clearly pleased,\nAnd he even said that if being a live-in son-in-law didn't work out, he could just come back and farm with him.\nIn Zhou Ze's view, he should have been simple, kind, and a clean slate.\nBut now, it seemed this clean slate was not as pure as he had imagined.\n\n\"It wasn't me.\" Zhou Ze reached out and gripped Xu Dachuan's wrist.\n\n\"Don't think I don't know about Xiao Chuanzi and your business. I also know that Xiao Chuanzi has been coming to you often recently to ask for money. He's insensible, he's a failure, he has a thousand faults.\nBut he's still your brother!\"\nXu Dachuan's eyes began to show bloodshot veins; he was on the verge of going crazy.\n\"I don't know what you're talking about.\" Zhou Ze suddenly felt a great dislike for the man in front of him,\nThis honest, simple man.\n\n\"Don't know what I'm talking about?\"\nXu Dachuan leaned his face close to Zhou Ze's, articulating each word:\n\"That driver, is he dead? He's from the village next to mine. Do you think Xiao Chuanzi could know anyone, could know anyone who keeps their mouth shut?\nHe's just a nobody; what right does he have to negotiate with anyone?\nThat driver, I went and found him, went and negotiated with him.\nYour uncle wanted you to have a good life; your wife fell for someone else, and you were living a stifled life, so your uncle helped you kill that mistress!\nYour uncle wants all the children in our family to live comfortably, not to be bullied, not to be looked down upon.\nBut,\nAh Le,\nYou can't kill Xiao Chuanzi to silence him,\nYour father died young; it was your uncle who supported your schooling. Your uncle has always treated you like his own child!\nTell your uncle the truth, from the bottom of your heart,\nWas Xiao Chuanzi intentionally run over by someone you hired, like last time?\nWere you trying to silence him?\"\n\nZhou Ze took a deep breath.\nXu Dachuan had asked the wrong person.\nIn fact,\nEvery question he asked was like adding fuel to the fire.\nOne must remember that the person standing before him,\nwas not his nephew Xu Le,\nbut the true victim and aggrieved party in that incident!\n\n*Bang!*\nZhou Ze kicked out, sending Xu Dachuan sprawling to the ground.\nAt this moment, Zhou Ze felt an uncontrollable urge to expose everything;\nHe regretted it, deeply regretted it. If he had known it would come to this, he should have voluntarily surrendered to the police when he first reincarnated.\nXu Le's cousin,\nXu Dachuan,\nThat driver,\nLet them all face justice under the law, even if he were implicated as Xu Le—he wouldn't care.\nTo use this second life he gained to avenge his first life seemed like a satisfying revenge.\nAt least,\nIt would be far better than his current predicament.\n\nBut now,\nThe cousin and the driver were dead, and the person who killed Xu Le was also dead. They died decisively, leaving Zhou Ze's revenge nowhere to begin.\nYou have strength, you have power, but hitting a cotton ball is always frustrating.\n\nXu Dachuan, who had been kicked to the ground, immediately scrambled up and yelled at Zhou Ze,\n\"Ah Le, you're the one who turned your back on us,\nI'm going to report you to the Public Security Bureau,\nYou're a murderer,\nA murderer!\nI want you to be buried with Xiao Chuanzi, buried with him!!!\"\n\nZhou Ze looked at Xu Dachuan,\nLooking at this old man, who still appeared weathered and honest despite everything,\nHis left hand, held behind his back,\nSlowly grew black fingernails.\nZhou Ze curved his lips into a smile,\nAs if savoring the word:\n\"Buried with him?\"",

    "content": "Xu Dachuan was screaming, going insane. This man had been under immense psychological pressure and torment since the death of his son.\n\nHe felt wronged.\n\nHe felt pain.\n\nHe felt his life had been difficult and full of hardships.\n\nIf it had been anyone else standing in Zhou Ze’s place, they might have felt some sympathy and pity for him.\n\nBut unfortunately,\n\nStanding before him was Zhou Ze.\n\nAnyone could sympathize with him,\n\nBut not Zhou Ze.\n\nHe was dead.\n\nThis rough man, now crying, insane, and hysterical,\n\nWas also one of the accomplices in his own murder.\n\nWhy do you all think you’re pitiful?\n\nWhy do you all think you’re wronged?\n\nWhat about me?\n\nWho will pity me?\n\nWho will spare a thought for me?\n\nZhou Ze naturally walked up to Xu Dachuan. He raised his chin. At that moment, countless emotions were wildly urging him to kill the man in front of him.\n\nTo tear him to shreds,\n\nNot just his body,\n\nBut his soul!\n\nHe had to make him endure the greatest pain and torment to quell the rage in his heart!\n\nLife, it seemed, always had many coincidences. A police car drove over from a distance.\n\nZhou Ze watched the flashing lights on the police car. At this moment, he felt no fear or dread; instead, he felt a sense of carefree abandon, as if he had nothing left to lose.\n\nIf all of this truly was just a trap,\n\nThen,\n\nHe might as well go crazy with it.\n\nInstead of suffering and feeling wronged alone,\n\nIt would be better if everyone,\n\nHurt each other!\n\nXu Dachuan was still shouting and jumping. The police car stopped nearby, and two police officers got out. They might have been on patrol or just passing by, but they got out to understand the situation.\n\nThe police walked over. Xu Dachuan suddenly quieted down. He looked at Zhou Ze with hateful eyes, then at the police.\n\nHe began to walk towards the police of his own accord.\n\nMeanwhile, Zhou Ze’s hands, clasped behind his back, had completely grown out their fingernails, and wisps of black energy continuously swirled around his ten fingers.\n\nHe closed his eyes.\n\nIn the depths of his pupils,\n\nA black torrent seemed to be flowing.\n\nAt this moment, Zhou Ze seemed to gradually rediscover the feeling he had on the rooftop that day, as if he had been completely abandoned by society and by life itself.\n\nThat loneliness, that helplessness,\n\nContinuously released the suppressed emotions accumulated deep within him.\n\nI am a psychopomp.\n\nI died once.\n\nI cultivated my mind and body,\n\nBut I don’t like to swallow my anger.\n\nIf an upcoming storm is truly upon me,\n\nThen in this downpour,\n\nI shall indulge myself one last time.\n\nBefore, Zhou Ze had always been very wary; he feared becoming an example of someone suppressed, like that person in Rongcheng.\n\nBut sometimes, it’s truly difficult to control yourself.\n\nOf course, what’s even harder to control is the vortex around you; it actively pushes you, tempts you, and forces you,\n\nStep by step,\n\nTowards the abyss.\n\n“What’s going on?” one police officer asked Xu Dachuan, while the other middle-aged officer looked at Zhou Ze.\n\nInstinctively, the middle-aged officer sensed a dangerous aura from Zhou Ze. This was his sixth sense, honed by years of police experience.\n\nAlthough the young man in front of him was somewhat thin, looked a bit frail, and had his eyes closed, the middle-aged officer’s lips felt dry.\n\nIt was a bit embarrassing to admit, but at this moment, he actually felt a little nervous.\n\n“Damn it, what am I nervous about?”\n\n“It’s nothing, I had a bit to drink, just lecturing my junior. He’s disobedient and wants to divorce his wife; he needs a good talking-to!”\n\nXu Dachuan said, his eyes bloodshot.\n\nThe two police officers exchanged glances. Since it was a family matter, they didn’t interfere. They immediately got back in their car, and the police car drove away.\n\nThe middle-aged officer turned his head again to look behind.\n\n“Brother Cui, what are you looking at?”\n\n“Nothing.”\n\nThe middle-aged officer sat upright and shook his head.\n\nBy the roadside,\n\nXu Dachuan turned his head and looked at Zhou Ze again.\n\n“Hmph… Bah!”\n\nHe spat a glob of thick phlegm heavily on the ground.\n\nXu Dachuan, who had just been yelling about calling the police and reporting Zhou Ze, did not report him to the police.\n\nAs a father who had lost his son, he wasn’t worried about getting involved and therefore didn’t dare to report; it could only be said that at that critical moment, he softened.\n\n“You’d best find someone to kill me too, so no one will ever know what you did before!”\n\nXu Dachuan growled.\n\nHis son was dead, and he was unwilling to send his nephew to the execution ground as well, otherwise, his family would be cut off.\n\nHis thoughts were very simple,\n\nTruly, very, very simple.\n\nHis nephew’s wife had found someone else she liked,\n\nSo he helped kill that guy!\n\nNow that his son was dead, he couldn’t let his Xu family line die out.\n\nVery noble?\n\nYes,\n\nVery noble.\n\nBut in Zhou Ze’s eyes,\n\nIt was utterly disgusting.\n\nXu Dachuan bent down to pick up his dry tobacco pipe. He was ready to leave, ready to go home. He had thought about it for a long time and had been angry for a long time, but at this moment, he still didn’t have the courage to truly drag Xu Le to his son’s grave.\n\nHowever, Xu Dachuan’s dry tobacco pipe was stepped on by Zhou Ze.\n\nXu Dachuan looked up, a bit stunned.\n\nZhou Ze slowly bent down and picked up the dry tobacco pipe.\n\n*Bang!*\n\nThe dry tobacco pipe struck Xu Dachuan heavily.\n\nXu Dachuan let out a muffled groan, looking at Zhou Ze with disbelief.\n\n“You dare…”\n\n*Bang!*\n\nAnother fierce blow landed. Xu Dachuan was knocked to the ground. His leg had been operated on recently and wasn’t fully recovered, so at this sudden outburst from Zhou Ze, he could only curl up on the ground.\n\nThe police had already driven far away, naturally unable to see the scene unfolding.\n\n“I’ll teach you about being noble!”\n\n*Bang!*\n\nAnother blow landed.\n\n“I’ll teach you about being soft-hearted!”\n\n*Bang!*\n\nAnother blow landed.\n\n“I’ll teach you about feeling wronged!”\n\n*Bang!*\n\n“I’ll teach you about feeling life is tough!”\n\n*Bang!*\n\n“I’ll teach you about feeling life is difficult!”\n\n*Bang!*\n\n“I’ll teach you about feeling pitiful!”\n\n*Bang!*\n\n…\n\nZhou Ze, who had suppressed his emotions for so long, unleashed a furious barrage of blows on Xu Dachuan, making him tremble on the ground.\n\nFinally,\n\nHe dropped the tobacco pipe,\n\nZhou Ze stumbled back a few steps,\n\nAnd leaned against the utility pole.\n\n“Cough, cough… cough, cough…”\n\nHeavy coughing sounds came from his mouth.\n\nHe looked up,\n\nAt the dim night sky.\n\nSome of the anger in his heart had been vented,\n\nBut deep down, he didn’t feel much better.\n\nThese people,\n\nThey were filial sons to their fathers,\n\nThey were harmonious brothers,\n\nThey helped each other, they cared for each other,\n\nBut the more they were like this, the more disgusted Zhou Ze felt.\n\nTurning around, leaving Xu Dachuan bruised and curled up there, Zhou Ze walked away slowly by himself.\n\nHe lit a cigarette, took a deep drag,\n\nThen pinched out the flame with his fingernail, crumbled the remaining tobacco, put it in his mouth, and slowly chewed it.\n\nHe took out his phone to call a taxi, but there were none nearby.\n\nLeft with no choice,\n\nZhou Ze dialed Xu Qinglang’s number:\n\n“Hello, Old Zhou, what are you doing? Not opening for business today, huh?”\n\n“Come pick me up.”\n\nZhou Ze gave the address.\n\n“Hold on, I’ll call Old Dao. He just took my car to buy candy for that woman. I’ll have him pick you up on his way back.”\n\nHanging up the phone,\n\nZhou Ze spit out the tobacco bits from his mouth and leaned against the utility pole, lost in thought for a long time.\n\nHe didn’t kill Xu Dachuan.\n\nUnder this trap,\n\nNo one was truly innocent,\n\nBut everyone seemed to be a puppet on a string, doing what they were supposed to do at predetermined junctures,\n\nUntil the end,\n\nUsed and discarded.\n\nSomeone was guiding all of this, like a catalyst, accelerating its operation.\n\nThat person,\n\nWas the true instigator, the culprit who caused his death in a car accident in his previous life.\n\nAfter about twenty minutes, a black Nissan pulled up beside Zhou Ze. The window rolled down, revealing Old Dao.\n\n“Boss, I found you.”\n\nOld Dao eagerly got out first and opened the car door for Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze got in. Old Dao then eagerly took out a piece of milk candy from a large bag and handed it to Zhou Ze:\n\n“Boss, have some.”\n\nZhou Ze pushed Old Dao’s hand away, indicating he wasn’t in the mood.\n\nOld Dao gave an awkward smile, unconcerned.\n\nOne had to know, compared to Zhou Ze, his previous boss at the Underworld Shop was much harder to get along with.\n\nZhou Ze was actually much more peaceful and amiable than the previous one. Of course, it wasn’t to say the previous one had a bad temper, but as soon as he sat behind the counter, Old Dao naturally didn’t even dare to speak too loudly.\n\n“No candy, have a cigarette instead.”\n\nOld Dao handed Zhou Ze a cigarette and lit it for him, then returned to the driver’s seat.\n\nThe car started, and Old Dao made a turn, heading back.\n\nAt the next intersection, Old Dao turned right. As he passed the entrance of a residential complex, he instinctively slowed down and peered inside.\n\nThis was the residential complex where the Lin family lived.\n\nEarlier, Zhou Ze had come here and picked up Xu Dachuan. The two had walked for a while, but they couldn’t have gone too far.\n\n“What are you looking at?” Zhou Ze asked.\n\n“Boss, this is the place, didn’t you know?”\n\n“What?”\n\n“Didn’t Miss Tang tell you before that when she was injured, she could only choose a blind spot to hide? There are only two blind spots in Tongcheng.\n\nOne is your bookstore,\n\nAnd the other is this residential complex.\n\nBut Miss Tang said the lights in this place seemed to have a problem, so we ultimately chose to hide near your place to escape the pursuit.”\n\nOld Dao chattered on,\n\nNot noticing,\n\nZhou Ze’s hand holding the cigarette,\n\nWas slightly trembling…",

    "content": "\"Old Taoist.\"\n\n\"Yes, Boss, what is it?\"\n\n\"Stop the car.\"\n\n\"Oh, okay.\"\n\nGetting out of the car, Zhou Ze flicked his cigarette butt to the ground and stomped on it with his shoe.\n\n\"You go back first.\"\n\n\"Huh?\" The Old Taoist was stunned. \"Boss, I can wait for you to come out.\"\n\n\"Go back.\"\n\n\"It's fine, Boss, I'm not afraid of waiting...\"\n\n\"Go back.\"\n\nZhou Ze turned his head and looked at the Old Taoist.\n\nThe Old Taoist shivered in fright.\n\nTsk, tsk, tsk,\n\nIndeed, these guys who climbed out of hell are essentially the same. This one, who seemed quite approachable before, was all a disguise.\n\nA disguise!\n\nThe Old Taoist immediately saluted, \"Alright, Boss, call me when you need a car.\"\n\nThe Old Taoist drove away.\n\nZhou Ze lingered at the entrance of the residential complex for about fifteen minutes.\n\nTang Shi had told him before that, after the little loli left Tongcheng, besides his bookstore, there was another \"light under the lamp\" place.\n\nHowever, there might have been a problem with that lamp, which was why Tang Shi didn't choose to hide there but went to his bookstore instead.\n\nTang Shi hinted that he could go there and see, perhaps there would be unexpected discoveries and gains. \"Strike while the iron is hot,\" or at least, he could take some advantage.\n\nZhou Ze was afraid of trouble at the time, so he didn't go, nor did he ask for details.\n\nAnd so, it wasn't until just now, from the Old Taoist's mouth, that Zhou Ze learned that this \"light under the lamp\" place was actually the residential complex where Doctor Lin lived.\n\nOne by one, the dots formed a circle.\n\nEven if those dots were gone, the circle was still ultimately formed.\n\nHis changing perception of Doctor Lin before and after.\n\nDoctor Lin keeping her house from before her death, buying it, and meticulously maintaining it.\n\nXu Le's identity.\n\nSleeping in separate beds.\n\nThe true murder disguised as an accidental car crash.\n\nKilling people one by one to eliminate evidence.\n\nIn fact, many, many details had long pointed the way.\n\nIncluding that day when he pretended to be a doctor at the hospital, performed surgery, and then confessed to Doctor Lin,\n\nDoctor Lin actively embraced him.\n\nAt the time, he just thought it was all beautiful, perhaps not noticing the slight curve that might have appeared at the corner of the mouth on the face in his arms.\n\nA hand,\n\nIt stirred the water, making the fish in it churn, until finally, the fishing net dropped, and the catch was brought in.\n\nPeople cast nets to catch fish, and they catch fish to eat them;\n\nHouse renovations are for aesthetics, and aesthetics are for livability.\n\nEverything, in the end, has a purpose. Even sitting there doing nothing but staring blankly, that is to enjoy the leisurely state of emptying one's mind.\n\nHis previous death, his subsequent resurrection.\n\nHis new identity, his new family relationships.\n\nIn the end,\n\nWho benefited the most?\n\nThe woman who had always secretly loved him had a husband she didn't like. She adhered to the constraints of decorum, the rules of family.\n\nShe didn't violate them, nor did she break them, but within those rules, she successfully replaced her original disliked husband with another person.\n\nSomeone completely unknown to outsiders, completely unaware, completely impossible to discover.\n\nShe lay comfortably by the bed, continuing to be the gentlewoman she was, living the life her parents expected her to live, but still doing things for her own ideas and pursuits.\n\nMany thoughts, chaotic and noisy,\n\nKept swirling in Zhou Ze's mind, making him feel disoriented. At this moment, his mind was so chaotic that he couldn't even grasp himself.\n\nIf all of this was truly as he suspected, if she was truly the one manipulating the entire course of events, then how should he face her?\n\nShould it be anger, resentment, that she killed him and destroyed his original life?\n\nShould it be emotional, helpless, after all, the more she did, the more it proved her feelings for him?\n\nBefore, Zhou Ze could easily take his dry tobacco pipe and furiously beat Xu Dachuan without any psychological burden. But now, Zhou Ze didn't have the heart to pick up a tree branch from the ground and rush into the Lin family's house.\n\nHumans are such complex creatures; they are not robots that simply follow the directives of a program, making their choices naturally based on a series of trigger codes.\n\nFifteen minutes of hesitation, fifteen minutes of wavering,\n\nFinally,\n\nZhou Ze still took steps and entered the residential complex.\n\nSome things needed to be made clear, some words had to be said.\n\nThis was him,\n\nGiving himself an explanation,\n\nGiving his past life an explanation.\n\n\"Ignorance is bliss\"\n\nDid not apply here.\n\n\"Knock, knock, knock...\"\n\nHe knocked on the door.\n\nActually, Zhou Ze had the house keys, but they weren't on him. He hadn't been back to the Lin family's house in a long time.\n\n\"Coming!\"\n\nHis sister-in-law's voice came from inside. She opened the door, saw Zhou Ze, and asked,\n\n\"Xu Le, your elder uncle left?\"\n\n\"Yeah, he left.\"\n\nI beat him away.\n\n\"Oh.\" His sister-in-law hadn't fully opened the door yet.\n\nSeeing Zhou Ze not leaving, she was a little surprised and said,\n\n\"Do you want to come in?\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't move.\n\nHis sister-in-law stuck out her tongue. Zhou Ze hadn't been home in a long time, and his sudden return caught her off guard. But Zhou Ze was her brother-in-law after all, so she opened the door.\n\nZhou Ze walked in and sat on the sofa in the living room.\n\nHis sister-in-law brought Zhou Ze a bottle of orange juice and an ashtray. Her relationship with Zhou Ze had been good lately, as Zhou Ze often helped her cover for her when she went out to play, so her attitude towards Zhou Ze at home had changed significantly compared to the beginning.\n\n\"Where's your sister?\"\n\n\"She just went out to buy groceries. My parents were discharged from the hospital yesterday; an old friend from out of province has a child getting married, so they went to attend. By the way, your elder uncle sitting at our doorstep just now really scared me.\n\nEspecially when he said he wanted to send you to prison. Tsk tsk, Xu Le, why are your relatives so strange?\"\n\nHis sister-in-law sat on the opposite sofa, turned on the TV, and propped her bare feet on the coffee table, a completely unrefined posture.\n\nCompared to Doctor Lin's graceful and proper demeanor, they really didn't seem like sisters.\n\nTruly,\n\nThey don't.\n\n\"Hey, Xu Le, you haven't answered me yet. Do you have some leverage over your elder uncle? Did he come to ask you for money?\"\n\nXu Le was the live-in son-in-law of the Lin family. The Lin family naturally didn't have a good impression of Xu Le's relatives who liked to freeload, as Xu Le's money in the past actually came from the Lin family.\n\n\"It's nothing.\"\n\nZhou Ze lit another cigarette, waiting for Doctor Lin to return.\n\n\"Are you sure it's nothing?\" His sister-in-law looked at Zhou Ze.\n\n\"You're so annoying.\"\n\nUpon hearing this, his sister-in-law's cheeks puffed out, and she let out a displeased哼.\n\nShe felt that Xu Le was becoming more and more presumptuous, but considering she would still need him to cover for her when she went out to play, she decided not to argue with him.\n\nA cigarette lay on the ashtray, and Zhou Ze watched it slowly burn down.\n\nThe smoke curled upwards, gathering and dispersing.\n\nJust then,\n\nThe sound of the door opening came from the entrance, and Zhou Ze instinctively stood up.\n\nDoctor Lin returned with some groceries. Her hair was in a braid, and since she was on holiday today, she looked very refreshed.\n\nZhou Ze being home surprised her a little.\n\n\"Sis, you're cooking today, huh?\" His sister-in-law, holding a cushion, watched TV and playfully pointed at Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Have you eaten?\" Doctor Lin asked Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head, \"No.\"\n\n\"Then wait a moment, I'll go cook.\" Doctor Lin seemed to be deliberately maintaining a calm relationship, then she walked into the kitchen.\n\nZhou Ze stood still, somewhat unsure of what to do next.\n\nHis heart was in turmoil right now.\n\n\"Hey, why are you just standing there? Go help!\"\n\nHis sister-in-law lightly kicked Zhou Ze's leg with her foot.\n\nSuch a good opportunity to strengthen their relationship, and he was just standing there dumbfounded, truly lacking in emotional intelligence.\n\nHis sister-in-law felt that her brother-in-law was much worse than the boys who pursued her at school, simply a blockhead.\n\nZhou Ze finally walked into the kitchen.\n\nIn the kitchen, Doctor Lin had already put on an apron and was chopping vegetables.\n\n\"It's fine, I can do it myself. You go keep Xiao Yi company and watch TV,\" Doctor Lin told Zhou Ze.\n\n\"There's something I want to ask you,\" Zhou Ze said, looking at Doctor Lin.\n\n\"Hmm?\" Doctor Lin looked up in surprise. \"How about you ask after I've finished cooking this meal? I don't want to be distracted. I actually rarely cook, so I'm afraid it won't be to your taste.\"\n\nWatching her meticulously chop vegetables, methodically and precisely, Zhou Ze suddenly found some words very difficult to say.\n\n\"I'll go back to the room first. You come up later.\"\n\n\"Okay, once I've finished the dishes, I'll come up and call you down for dinner.\"\n\nZhou Ze walked out of the kitchen and, under his sister-in-law's surprised gaze, went upstairs.\n\nPushing open the bedroom door, Zhou Ze saw the large bed. He had slept on that bed before, while Doctor Lin slept on the floor beside it.\n\nHe didn't have much attachment to this place.\n\nHe looked up and saw the wedding photo hanging on the wall above the headboard.\n\nIn the wedding photo,\n\nThe two people in wedding attire were a bit far apart. The woman was dignified and serene, the man shy and reserved. It was the wedding photo of Doctor Lin and Xu Le.\n\nA wedding photo, in fact, could reveal many problems.\n\nAnd now,\n\nThe one with the face of the man in the wedding photo,\n\nWas himself.\n\nZhou Ze kept staring at the wedding photo.\n\nIf this entire matter, including the murder process, was orchestrated by Doctor Lin behind the scenes, watching from above, completely aware of everything.\n\nThen,\n\nThe former Xu Le,\n\nThe former Xu Le, who slept alone on this large bed every night,\n\nWhat kind of role, exactly, did he play?\n\nLike a piece of dough, and this piece of dough finally mustered the rare madness and courage of a lifetime,\n\nBut in the end,\n\nAll of his actions were actually seen by his wife, who treated him like a puppet on strings,\n\nWatching him walk forward step by step.\n\nEven, in the end, she personally cleaned up the traces,\n\nThose who should have died, all died,\n\nXu Le also died,\n\nAnd,\n\nEven his body was cleaned out and vacated,\n\nJust to welcome the arrival of a soul she favored.\n\nHis vision, at this moment, seemed to blur.\n\nZhou Ze seemed to see,\n\nIn the wedding photo above the bed,\n\nIn Xu Le's eyes,\n\nTwo lines of bloody tears,\n\nSlowly trickling down...",

    "content": "\"Hey, Xu Le, dinner's ready!\"\n\nThe sister-in-law shouted from the top of the stairs.\n\nThis shout startled Zhou Ze out of his recent daze.\n\nThe bedroom was still that bedroom.\n\nThe bed was still that bed.\n\nThe wedding photo on the wall was as usual, without the slightest change.\n\nReaching out, Zhou Ze rubbed his eyes, turned around, pushed open the bedroom door, and walked downstairs.\n\nOn the dining table in the living room, there were three dishes and one soup.\n\nStir-fried celery with beef, Kung Pao chicken, stir-fried cabbage with glass noodles, and a bowl of vegetable and tofu soup.\n\nDr. Lin was standing by the table dishing out rice, while the sister-in-law was already seated, impatient.\n\n\"Some people, really, are heartless. Their wife is cooking in the kitchen, and they're leisurely upstairs.\"\n\nThe sister-in-law swayed her body while eating.\n\nZhou Ze also sat down, and Dr. Lin handed him a pair of chopsticks.\n\n\"From now on, come home for dinner.\"\n\nDr. Lin suddenly said.\n\nLike a gentle wife advising her husband, everything seemed normal and as it should be, like spring rain nourishing the earth.\n\n\"Huh?\" The sister-in-law's eyes widened.\n\nXu Le was coming back?\n\nAnd her sister personally asked him to?\n\nZhou Ze didn't answer.\n\nThe sister-in-law couldn't hold back and kicked Zhou Ze under the table.\n\nYou fool, why aren't you responding?\n\nMy sister just told you to come home for dinner!\n\nShe's willing to cook for you,\n\nAren't you going to be more proactive?\n\n\"We'll see,\" Zhou Ze replied perfunctorily.\n\n\"Would it be alright to live in that apartment complex?\"\n\nDr. Lin spoke again.\n\nThat apartment complex, of course, referred to the one Zhou Ze lived in during his previous life.\n\nEvidently, Dr. Lin also knew that Zhou Ze living with her parents was unpleasant, so she was willing to go to that home with Zhou Ze,\n\nA place,\n\nWith only her and him.\n\nThe chopsticks in Zhou Ze's hand trembled slightly. He could sense that this woman hadn't fully overcome the psychological barrier she mentioned before, but she was trying hard to look forward.\n\nIf life was already muddled, then let it continue to be muddled, and even better.\n\nMany people have always yearned for a refined life, but a truly refined life doesn't exist, just as some glittering actresses might have worked at a bar when they were young.\n\nUpon closer inspection, any perfect thing will always have its flaws at some point.\n\nSeizing the present is the true meaning of life.\n\nAt this moment, Zhou Ze hesitated.\n\nHe didn't ask some questions, because Dr. Lin sent her sister-in-law to call him down, instead of coming up herself. But undeniably, Zhou Ze himself was also somewhat afraid to ask that question.\n\nOnce the pretense was completely broken,\n\nWhat he had seen as a gift from heaven,\n\nStripped of all its disguises,\n\nMight become something he couldn't bear to look at.\n\nZhou Ze admitted that he, like most men, liked beautiful women, but this time, he was a little scared.\n\nIn his mind, he couldn't imagine the scene of living with Dr. Lin and eating at the dining table together in his own home.\n\nThis feeling,\n\nWas like being a pet cat, favored by its owner. All of your actions, including resistance, would seem more like coquetry.\n\n\"No need.\"\n\nZhou Ze replied.\n\nThen he picked up a mouthful of food and put it in his mouth, his expression serious, swallowing it with great difficulty.\n\n\"Is it not good?\" Dr. Lin asked.\n\nShe saw Zhou Ze eating with difficulty.\n\n\"Hey, Xu Le, you're putting on airs now, you old man!\"\n\nThe sister-in-law couldn't stand it.\n\nIn her opinion, Xu Le was bullying her sister.\n\nZhou Ze put down his chopsticks, deciding not to force himself to eat, and turned to Dr. Lin, saying:\n\n\"Come with me, I have some things to discuss.\"\n\nDr. Lin nodded and put down her chopsticks.\n\n\"Hey, what can't you two say in front of me!\"\n\nThe sister-in-law said indignantly, feeling like she was a big lightbulb, yet unaware that she had become one.\n\nZhou Ze went upstairs, and Dr. Lin followed him.\n\nThe two stood at the bedroom door on the second floor. Zhou Ze didn't push the door open; he didn't want to see that wedding photo again, always feeling as if the Xu Le in the photo was looking at him.\n\nAnd Xu Le,\n\nActually, was no different from himself.\n\nEveryone was a tool,\n\nOne was a high-level tool, the other a low-level tool,\n\nNo need for the pot to call the kettle black.\n\n\"You speak,\" Dr. Lin looked at Zhou Ze, bowing her head slightly.\n\nZhou Ze hesitated for a long time, the words on his lips, but he didn't know how to speak them,\n\nWas it an accusation?\n\nWas it seeking confirmation?\n\nWas it a reprimand?\n\nWas it a curse?\n\nOr perhaps, a mutual outpouring?\n\nIn the end, the deed had already been done.\n\nAll those who should have died, had died,\n\nThe emptied body had been entered by him.\n\nThe matter, in fact, had entered its final stage.\n\n\"Let's just end this.\"\n\nZhou Ze said.\n\nAs he spoke these words, Zhou Ze kept staring at the woman in front of him.\n\nAs if this gentle and upright woman would, in the next moment, tear off all her disguises, pin him against the wall, and mock his overestimation of himself.\n\nYou are merely my doll,\n\nMy favorite toy,\n\nTo get you,\n\nI spent so much effort,\n\nAs a toy,\n\nDo you have the right to say it's over?\n\nHuman overthinking,\n\nIs the most terrifying kind of instinct.\n\nIt contained too many psychological hints, just like the last time Zhou Ze was at Wang Ke's house.\n\nWhat kind of meat did Wang Ke eat?\n\nWho knew?\n\nEven if he clearly analyzed the matter of psychological suggestion for you, was it frankness or a cover-up?\n\nIt was hard to say.\n\nJust like the scene in front of Zhou Ze,\n\nAfter listening to Zhou Ze's words,\n\nDr. Lin just smiled and nodded. Zhou Ze saw her eyes redden, as if with a kind of heartbreak. She had spent a lot of time adjusting her emotions and trying to comfort herself.\n\nAt the dinner table just now, she decided to cast aside her past burdens and try to get along with Zhou Ze, but Zhou Ze refused. Immediately after, she heard Zhou Ze's actual words of breakup.\n\nShe lost her legal husband, even though her husband was still alive. She lost the person she liked, because the person she liked said he no longer wanted to continue this bond.\n\nShe was like a small boat, constantly floating and sinking in the waves.\n\nListening to her parents, listening to her family, listening to Zhou Ze, listening to her mentor, she lived strongly, and lived very strongly.\n\nFate played a trick on her,\n\nSome things, once pursued, once overcome, but ultimately, they would still be missed.\n\n\"The divorce agreement, I'll bring it tomorrow. Do you agree?\" Zhou Ze looked at Dr. Lin.\n\nLike a tourist looking at a tiger in a zoo through a fence.\n\nA very complex emotion,\n\nAs long as she didn't truly reveal her true colors,\n\nThis complexity would continue to linger in Zhou Ze's heart.\n\nAfter all,\n\nThis was a society that valued appearances,\n\nAnd she was so beautiful.\n\nRight,\n\nWhen hitting Xu Dachuan, since his face was full of wrinkles anyway, there was no psychological pressure whatsoever.\n\nBut if you asked Zhou Ze to take something now and hit Dr. Lin,\n\nHe really couldn't bring himself to do it.\n\n\"Okay, let's get divorced.\" Dr. Lin looked up at Zhou Ze. \"You can also start your new life.\"\n\nYou agreed?\n\nYou really agreed?\n\nYou really, really agreed?\n\nZhou Ze looked at Dr. Lin,\n\nFearing that in the next instant, Dr. Lin would simply flip out and attack him, telling him that a toy should know its place!\n\nBut Dr. Lin's every expression seemed so natural, so natural that Zhou Ze even found it somewhat unreal.\n\nWas she the director,\n\nAnd at the same time,\n\nAlso the actor?\n\n\"Xu Le is dead.\" Zhou Ze said, \"Is it related to you?\"\n\nWhat needed to be asked, ultimately had to be asked.\n\nDr. Lin nodded.\n\nIn her view, fate seemed to be a game that teased people; it was her obsession that caused this tragedy.\n\n\"Actually, all of this might be my fault. It was my fanciful thinking that caused fate to play such a trick.\n\nYou're right,\n\nNow is the time for the joke to end.\"\n\n\"Sister, are you crying?\"\n\nThe sister-in-law walked up the stairs at this moment and saw her sister crying.\n\n\"It's nothing, just dust in my eyes.\"\n\nDr. Lin didn't want her sister to see her like this and directly pushed open the bedroom door and entered the bedroom. The sister-in-law glared at Zhou Ze and also followed her sister into the bedroom.\n\nZhou Ze let out a long sigh,\n\nAt this moment,\n\nHe felt somewhat relieved,\n\nLike a heavy burden had been lifted.\n\nShe admitted it,\n\nAnd she agreed to end it,\n\nIf it's over, it's over.\n\nHe couldn't go back to his previous life anyway, and everyone who should have died was dead, except this woman.\n\nBut if he searched his conscience,\n\nIf he were truly given the chance to kill her, could he really bring himself to do it?\n\nAnd was the purpose of killing her merely to vent anger?\n\nHe walked into the bathroom,\n\nZhou Ze cupped a handful of water and splashed it on his face,\n\nThe coolness washed over him, making his mind clearer.\n\nIt's over,\n\nIt's over,\n\nIt's finally over,\n\nHe would go back to the bookstore later and no longer concern himself with any disturbances brought by this \"Xu Le\" identity, preparing to live his own life.\n\nTo be a ghost runner,\n\nTo become a regular,\n\nIn his previous life, he could climb the ranks as a doctor step by step,\n\nIn this life,\n\nHe had merely changed environments,\n\nBut it was the same workplace.\n\nHe looked up,\n\nZhou Ze saw someone standing behind him in the mirror,\n\nIt was the sister-in-law.\n\n\"You made my sister cry, she's very upset.\"\n\n\"The situation here is very complicated, not something a child like you can understand.\"\n\nZhou Ze picked up a towel and wiped his face.\n\nBut at this moment,\n\nZhou Ze froze,\n\nStopping all his current movements,\n\nHe saw the sister-in-law in the mirror,\n\nHer head was tilted to the left at an extremely exaggerated angle, an angle a normal person simply couldn't achieve.\n\nHer face was pressed tightly against her left shoulder, her entire face tilted a perfect ninety degrees, but her body remained perfectly straight.\n\n\"I know my sister likes you,\n\nI know my sister doesn't like Xu Le,\n\nI know my sister doesn't want to make Mom and Dad sad and doesn't want to ruin this marriage,\n\nTo make my sister happy,\n\nI made Xu Le die,\n\nMade you die and come back,\n\nMade you become Xu Le.\n\nI did all of this, and my sister should have been happy,\n\nBut you,\n\nYou made her sad again,\n\nHehe...\"",

    "content": "The night was hazy. In the bedroom, Doctor Lin, who had just been crying alone, was now lying sideways on the bed, her delicate eyebrows slightly furrowed, already asleep. However, between her brows, a black halo seemed to envelop her.\n\nShe didn't want to sleep, but she had to.\n\nHer sister didn't want the upcoming events to disturb her.\n\nIn the bathroom, just a wall away, Zhou Ze continued to hold the towel;\n\nHis sister-in-law tilted her head, standing ramrod straight, still staring at him.\n\nThe scene,\n\nat this moment, seemed to freeze, heavy as if the ink on an ink painting was so dense it was about to drip.\n\nZhou Ze had never thought it would be her, truly never.\n\nIn Zhou Ze's view, she was just an innocent child, a little arrogant, but also a little naive and playful. Plus, she had previously been in this very bathroom, opening the door and seeing him during a backlash he suffered from saving someone in the hospital, which scared her so much she wet herself.\n\nIf this was also a form of acting,\n\nit was too dedicated.\n\nMoreover, the reason she gave, while seemingly valid, was actually quite far-fetched. Of course, some people's thought processes might just be this peculiar and unique.\n\nShe had her own individual worldview, only cared about her own feelings, and only understood right and wrong as she perceived them.\n\nThis world,\n\nwhether it contained seven billion people or just one, made no difference to her.\n\nThe sister-in-law began to move forward.\n\nZhou Ze was a gift she had given to her sister, a gift to amuse her sister. But now, this gift had made her sister even sadder.\n\nAs a gift, he was unqualified.\n\nUnqualified things,\n\nhad to be discarded,\n\nhad to be destroyed,\n\nand thus, he had no reason to continue existing.\n\nZhou Ze put down the towel. Black claws slowly grew from between his fingers.\n\n\"Buzz!\"\n\nA vibrating sound came,\n\nZhou Ze felt a sharp pain in his eardrums and his vision blurred. Then, that tilted face appeared directly in front of him.\n\nShe tilted her head, looking at him, with the innocent playfulness of a young girl, retaining the cute purity of immaturity.\n\n\"Slap!\"\n\nHis shirt ripped open, and Zhou Ze flew backward, smashing the mirror behind him. A bloody wound appeared on his chest, blood gushing out.\n\n\"Why couldn't you just live well?\"\n\nThe sister-in-law murmured,\n\nThen,\n\nanother sharp crack echoed from Zhou Ze's body. If Zhou Ze hadn't instinctively turned aside, his neck might have been severed. But even so, a clear bloody gash appeared on his neck.\n\n\"Why couldn't you just be together well?\"\n\nThe sister-in-law smiled,\n\nShe seemed to be asking Zhou Ze,\n\nand also asking herself,\n\nbut the essence was the same:\n\nshe had no intention of receiving any answer.\n\n\"You're a Ghost Messenger?\" Zhou Ze was somewhat confused. \"If you're a Ghost Messenger, how can you kill so many people indiscriminately?\"\n\nThe sister-in-law ignored him, her smile only growing wider.\n\nZhou Ze's pupils constricted, and he rolled forward. The sink and all the glass in the bathroom behind him collectively shattered at that moment.\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nGlass fragments shot out everywhere, making the narrow bathroom suddenly beautiful.\n\nBlood streaked,\n\nglass glittered,\n\nthis was a perfect spot for wedding photos,\n\nas long as the bride wasn't afraid of being disfigured.\n\n\"You people, why are you so troublesome?\"\n\nThe sister-in-law raised her hand,\n\nAnd at this moment,\n\nZhou Ze's hand also reached out,\n\nHis sharp black claws directly aimed for the sister-in-law's palm.\n\nHowever, the once sharp claws instantly became \"as pliant as silk.\" The sister-in-law's palm skin was delicate and flawless, but Zhou Ze's claws simply couldn't pierce it.\n\n\"Can't you just make things easy for me?\"\n\nThe sister-in-law grabbed with her fingers. To an outsider, it looked like she was tightly intertwining her fingers with Zhou Ze's.\n\nThen,\n\nZhou Ze felt a piercing pain,\n\nAs if his ten fingers were connected to his heart,\n\nAnd now, Zhou Ze's fingernails were slowly peeling off, as if someone was using pliers to pull out his nails. That kind of pain, stemming from the depths of his soul, was even more despairing, completely transcending the boundaries of physical torture.\n\nUntil now, his claws, which had been invincible, completely lost their former might in front of the sister-in-law.\n\nThe sister-in-law's smile grew even wider,\n\n\"You're using what I gave you to deal with me?\"\n\nThe next moment,\n\nthe sister-in-law's fingertips also grew long black claws, which directly pierced into Zhou Ze's palm.\n\nFirst, the pain of his fingernails peeling from his body, followed by the torture of being pierced by claws.\n\nThis punishment, which he had previously inflicted on others, now fell upon Zhou Ze himself for the first time.\n\n\"I'm not wrong; you are.\"\n\nThe sister-in-law continued to murmur, then pushed Zhou Ze forward.\n\n\"Why don't you live a good life?\"\n\n\"Buzz!\"\n\nZhou Ze was thrown backward, crashing into the wall. Blood flowed from his right hand, flesh mangled, with five shocking nail holes.\n\n\"I put so much effort into this, why can't you just... live well?\"\n\nThe sister-in-law kept asking herself,\n\nlike a curious child,\n\nbut her current appearance was truly not cute at all.\n\n\"Crack...\"\n\nThe sister-in-law raised her arm,\n\nShe was still half a meter from Zhou Ze,\n\nBut Zhou Ze felt as if a hand had already clutched his neck, lifting him up. The piercing and burning pain in his neck was so clear, and he could no longer breathe.\n\nHis feet were off the ground, he was like a prisoner on a pyre, awaiting judgment from the destiny before him.\n\nTilted head,\n\nsmiling,\n\n\"Who gave you the courage to question me, even after knowing the shadow behind these events?\n\nYou are just a puppet controlled in the palm of my hand.\n\nWho gave you the illusion that you could resist?\"\n\n\"Uh... uh...\"\n\nZhou Ze wanted to make a sound, wanted to speak, but because his neck was clamped so tightly, Zhou Ze couldn't form any clear syllables.\n\nAs a death-row prisoner,\n\neven the right to a final word had been stripped from him.\n\nThe sister-in-law was asking questions, but she didn't give him the right to answer.\n\n\"Lin Yi, I tried my best, but this game really isn't that fun.\"\n\nThe sister-in-law murmured to herself,\n\nThen,\n\nshe turned her head in another direction,\n\nstill,\n\ntilted.\n\n\"Your sister is still unhappy, your sister is so annoying.\"\n\nImmediately after,\n\nshe tilted her head in yet another direction,\n\n\"After we kill him, we'll kill your sister too, and then we'll have no more worries.\n\nRight?\"\n\nZhou Ze felt the force on his neck suddenly intensify.\n\nThat terrifying suffocating sensation overwhelmed him,\n\nHis lungs burned, almost exploding.\n\nHis eyes began to roll back, and his body's convulsions were uncontrollable. This was a sign of impending death, a prelude to his body's complete demise.\n\nIn front, the sister-in-law kept tilting her head ninety degrees in different directions, muttering to herself, as if conversing with someone else.\n\nJust like two little girls with Peppa Pig backpacks standing in front of a claw machine,\n\ndiscussing which doll to grab,\n\nwhich doll was easy to get,\n\nwhich doll looked cuter,\n\n\"Cough... cough...\"\n\nA coughing sound came,\n\nThe sister-in-law looked up at Zhou Ze, somewhat surprised,\n\nShe was a little surprised,\n\nNot dead yet?\n\nThen,\n\nthe smile on her face slowly became serious,\n\n\"What's wrong with you?\"\n\nYes,\n\nwhat's wrong with you?\n\nZhou Ze's eyes began to glow green, and a bronze luster slowly spread across his body. The fingernails on his right hand, which had been broken off earlier, actually grew back.\n\nThis time, they weren't as black as before, but showed a mottled color of ancient vicissitude.\n\nZhou Ze's lips parted,\n\nTwo fangs slowly emerged,\n\nWith a green face and fangs,\n\nhe was ominous and terrifying, exuding a repulsive aura.\n\nThe force that had been binding Zhou Ze's neck suddenly dissipated. Zhou Ze slowly landed, crouched down, one hand on the broken tiles, and then slowly raised his head.\n\nThose eerie green eyes stared intently at the sister-in-law who was tilting her head.\n\n\"What does this mean?\"\n\n\"What's going on now?\"\n\nShe was confused,\n\nBecause the toy she had created, or rather, the gift she had personally chosen and wrapped for her sister, had undergone an unexpected change.\n\nA change she had not foreseen.\n\n\"Ah...\"\n\nA hoarse sound emanated from Zhou Ze's throat. He slowly spread his arms and slowly stood up,\n\nVery slowly,\n\nbut very steadily.\n\nJust like last time,\n\nHalf of Zhou Ze's skin appeared bronze, while the other half began to crack and bleed slowly.\n\nThe head-tilted sister-in-law watched Zhou Ze walk towards her step by step.\n\nShe was somewhat confused,\n\nand helpless,\n\n\"Are you Zhou Ze?\"\n\nThis time, the sister-in-law needed Zhou Ze to answer.\n\nBut now, Zhou Ze couldn't be bothered to give her any answer.\n\nThe sister-in-law reached out her hand, but this time Zhou Ze was not thrown back. He still walked steadily, step by step,\n\nJust like that,\n\nhe walked up to her.\n\nThe sister-in-law's claws pierced into Zhou Ze's body.\n\n\"Pfft!\"\n\nThe claws pierced in,\n\nHowever,\n\nas soon as the claws penetrated the skin, the muscles at the wound instantly contracted, firmly holding the sister-in-law's claws inside.\n\nShe tried to pull them out,\n\nbut couldn't move them at all,\n\nas if countless small mouths inside were sucking on her claws,\n\nvery tight,\n\nvery suppressed.\n\nThe sister-in-law looked at Zhou Ze, at those green eyes. A look of realization appeared on her face as she murmured,\n\n\"You... you were already a dead person before...\"\n\nAnd Zhou Ze reached out,\n\nand grabbed the sister-in-law's head.\n\nThe sister-in-law wanted to resist, but couldn't.\n\n\"Creak, creak...\"\n\nLike the sound of bones slowly shifting,\n\nZhou Ze's hand held the sister-in-law's head,\n\nHe didn't crush it,\n\nhe didn't pierce it,\n\nbut slowly turned her tilted face,\n\nback to straight.\n\nPhew,\n\nher face was straight,\n\nand it looked,\n\nmuch more comfortable.",

    "content": "Two faces,\n\nstaring at each other.\n\nThe sister-in-law desperately wanted to resist, but with her face held in Zhou Ze's palm, she had no room to fight back.\n\nAt this moment,\n\nshe understood how Madam Qingyi must have felt on the rooftop.\n\nNo matter how many transformations you possess, there's no place to bite.\n\nA zombie is a being born from death; it is despised by gods and ghosts because it exists outside the original rules of the game, an anomaly.\n\nIt's like when everyone else has cut their queues, but you haven't,\n\nor when everyone else has kept their queues, but you've cut yours.\n\nBeing different from others naturally leads to being disliked and rejected.\n\nZhou Ze slowly opened his mouth,\n\nrevealing two fangs, bringing a chilling pressure.\n\nThe sister-in-law furrowed her brows, her body trembling, filled with dread.\n\nA game that was originally hers had taken an uncontrollable turn, even dragging her into it. Now, pulling the plug to shut down the game was impossible.\n\nShe didn't know what kind of monster she had unleashed, and she was even certain that Zhou Ze himself probably didn't realize he was a monster.\n\nThis was a beautiful misunderstanding, and a sudden, unexpected landmine.\n\nUnfortunately,\n\nshe had stepped on it,\n\nand even danced a Latin dance on top of it.\n\nThe fangs slowly pressed down, already touching the skin of the sister-in-law's neck.\n\nThat smooth skin,\n\nthat tender epidermis,\n\nwith a maiden's vivacity,\n\npregnant with the essence of youth.\n\nHow many young men yearned to taste its sweetness there,\n\nhow many young men longed to leave their teeth marks there.\n\n\"I am her, and she is me.\"\n\nThe sister-in-law spoke,\n\n\"If you bite me to death, she dies too.\"\n\nThis was a threat,\n\na desperate threat.\n\nIf the situation hadn't been so dire and urgent, the sister-in-law wouldn't have resorted to such a threat.\n\nBecause this meant she was bowing to a toy, begging a toy for mercy.\n\nShe had her pride,\n\nbut at a moment when her life was threatened, pride suddenly became worthless.\n\nZhou Ze paused, his green eyes scanning the sister-in-law's face with an eerie glow, as if hesitating, contemplating, or perhaps circling.\n\nThen,\n\nhe lifted his head, pulling his fangs a little further from her skin. The intense, suffocating pressure from before instantly faded.\n\nThe sister-in-law let out a long sigh of relief, a feeling of having escaped death washing over her, making her dizzy.\n\nThen,\n\nZhou Ze suddenly lowered his head again!\n\n\"Pfft!\"\n\nWithout any foreplay,\n\nand without giving you much psychological preparation,\n\njust like that, dryly, sharply, thickly,\n\nfirmly,\n\nstraight in!\n\nThe previous upward movement seemed more like a playful tease, a jest, a deliberate concealment, a... flirtation.\n\nAs if to say:\n\nI'm just rubbing outside, not going in, don't worry.\n\nThen,\n\na fierce, direct thrust!\n\nWithout any tenderness,\n\nand not understanding what tenderness even meant.\n\nAs the fangs pierced,\n\nblood and bodily fluids began to spurt.\n\nAt such a moment, the human body appeared incredibly fragile.\n\nThe sister-in-law's head was still pressed down by Zhou Ze's hand. Her face showed an expression of extreme pain, and in the depths of her eyes, panic and struggle appeared.\n\nHer previous composure was long gone.\n\nEarlier, in the bathroom,\n\nshe had questioned and answered herself,\n\nwhile pushing Zhou Ze to a dead end.\n\nNow,\n\nwhat goes around, comes around.\n\nZombies actually don't eat people or drink human blood.\n\nEarly ancient Chinese novels and supernatural records rarely mentioned zombies eating people or blood. Modern understanding of zombies largely comes from Hong Kong zombie films of the era, which were influenced by Western zombie movies and incorporated these settings.\n\nZhou Ze did not suck the other's blood; he simply enjoyed the feeling of injecting his will into the other's body through his fangs.\n\nThis was a declaration of sovereignty, the most direct form of revenge.\n\nTo assert his aura, to dominate her,\n\nto torment her,\n\nto bite her,\n\nto return everything she had just inflicted upon him!\n\n\"Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah!!!!!!!!!!\"\n\nA wisp of black mist suddenly rose from the sister-in-law's body. These black mists slowly solidified into the form of a woman in black.\n\nAs soon as the woman appeared, the surrounding temperature began to drop, and even white frost appeared.\n\nOne might say this was the special effect and grand entrance for a major boss,\n\nbut in reality, it was a sign that the woman's soul power was uncontrollably dissipating. She was like a block of ice removed from the freezer; though still exuding coldness, she couldn't last much longer.\n\n\"Roar!\"\n\nZhou Ze retracted his fangs. The wound on the sister-in-law's neck instantly scabbed over, not a single drop of blood flowing out.\n\nHis hand released,\n\nand the sister-in-law's body fell directly to the ground,\n\nlanding with a \"thud.\"\n\nThere was no pity, no concern,\n\neven if the girl were to fall and become mentally disabled,\n\nit would have nothing to do with Zhou Ze.\n\nThe woman's soul was slowly wilting. She seemed to desperately want to re-enter the body, but with Zhou Ze standing below, she dared not descend.\n\nAt the same time, beside the woman, a booklet was flying. It was identical to the one Zhou Ze possessed, and this booklet signified the woman's identity.\n\nShe was also a Soul Ferryman.\n\nHowever, the woman's booklet was almost white and severely damaged; as it flew, bits of it continuously flaked off, clearly unable to bear the burden any longer.\n\n\"I'm also a Soul Ferryman, you can't kill me.\"\n\nThe woman said tremblingly. She wasn't afraid of Zhou Ze to this extent, but she felt incredibly cold.\n\nSeparated from her physical body,\n\nshe was like an ordinary person standing naked on an Antarctic glacier.\n\nThat feeling truly couldn't be resisted by sheer mental willpower.\n\nZhou Ze raised his head,\n\nlooking at her,\n\nhis mouth slightly open,\n\nas if smiling.\n\nThen,\n\nZhou Ze slowly,\n\ntilted his head.\n\nHis joints continuously made crisp cracking sounds,\n\nbut his head still tilted down.\n\nMockery,\n\nthe most direct mockery.\n\nA faint blue flame slowly began to emerge on the woman's body. Her soul was being frozen, gradually losing vitality. She was very cold, desperately needing a warm haven.\n\nShe couldn't wait any longer, had no way to wait any longer.\n\nBiu!\n\nHer form moved downwards, attempting to re-enter the sister-in-law's body.\n\n\"Roar!\"\n\nZhou Ze swung his arm. His nails, which were less transparent than before but appeared more ancient, directly struck the woman. The woman let out a sharp shriek and was forcefully seized by Zhou Ze, held captive before him.\n\nThe woman's waist truly could be grasped with one hand, not because of her exceptionally good or exaggerated figure, but meaning that the woman's soul body was continuously being tormented and twisted under the restraint of Zhou Ze's palm.\n\n\"Let me go, I'm a Soul Ferryman!\"\n\nThe woman roared.\n\nZhou Ze opened his mouth wide,\n\nthen began to bring his hand towards his mouth.\n\nThe woman's struggles and roars intensified. She already sensed what was about to happen. At the same time, she realized one thing: the man before her had lost all sanity. Now, he was acting purely on instinct.\n\nHe was hungry,\n\nhis body was in great pain,\n\nhis physique was worn out,\n\njust like a person who is sick and needs nourishment to recover from injuries.\n\nHe, too, now needed nourishment.\n\nThis body simply couldn't withstand his current form.\n\n\"I am a Soul Ferryman, and no matter what I've done, only the Underworld can judge me. You cannot, you cannot!\n\nHave you thought about bearing the cost of this?\n\nWake up,\n\nwake up!\"\n\nThis was like the monsters in \"Journey to the West\" who, cornered, would declare their lineage to their Bodhisattva or Immortal Venerable to be taken back home; it was revealing one's backing.\n\nHowever,\n\nbefore that,\n\nZhou Ze was also a Soul Ferryman, albeit a temporary one.\n\nBut the woman was still preparing to kill him.\n\nKill him, then kill Doctor Lin,\n\nand the other will in her body would no longer interfere with her.\n\nZhou Ze's hand stopped.\n\nHe didn't continue to put the other's soul into his mouth.\n\nThe woman looked at Zhou Ze, still very tense. After the previous lesson, she no longer harbored any illusions of escaping.\n\nZhou Ze, holding the woman, began to move.\n\nEach time his foot landed, it left a lingering black mark on the floor. He walked downstairs, into the kitchen.\n\nHis green eyes roamed the kitchen,\n\nthen,\n\nhe found it,\n\na jar of Laoganma.\n\nHe crushed the jar, spilling the chili sauce into his hand.\n\nFirst, he put the chili sauce into his mouth,\n\nand then,\n\nZhou Ze raised the hand holding the woman again,\n\nopened his mouth,\n\nand put the woman's soul into his mouth.\n\nThe woman's final screams and curses,\n\nwere like a soothing melody playing from speakers during a meal, giving the dining experience a strange charm.\n\nAfter swallowing her,\n\nZhou Ze spread his arms,\n\n\"Burp………………\"\n\nA deep burp echoed,\n\ncomfortable,\n\nsatisfied,\n\nfull,\n\nbut oh, how he wished for another.\n\n………………\n\n\"Why didn't you say so earlier!\"\n\nBai Yingying cursed from the car.\n\nTang Shi ignored the almost raging female zombie, continuing to unwrap a White Rabbit candy and put it in her mouth.\n\n\"He didn't ask in detail before, wasn't interested.\n\nBesides,\n\nhow was I supposed to know that the other Soul Ferryman in Tongcheng was actually in his wife's house?\"\n\n\"Alright, grandmas, we're here, we're here!\"\n\nOld Dao was still the driver.\n\nHe returned to the bookstore and spoke of Zhou Ze's whereabouts,\n\nwhich Tang Shi overheard.\n\nThen this not-so-secret secret was revealed, and subsequently, Zhou Ze's phone couldn't be reached, so everyone rushed over.\n\nXu Qinglang sat in the passenger seat, his face gloomy.\n\nThe car stopped,\n\neveryone got out and walked inside.\n\nBai Yingying walked first.\n\nAs she reached the stairwell,\n\nBai Yingying suddenly stopped,\n\nshe sensed a familiar aura not far ahead, as if the evil energy within her was being pulled and began to tremble.\n\n\"What's wrong?\"\n\nTang Shi asked when Bai Yingying stopped moving.\n\nBai Yingying bit her lip tightly.\n\nThe resonating aura inside became increasingly apparent, and it seemed to have reached a peak, clearer and more stimulating than before.\n\nThis connection of bloodline and racial bond, like currents, continuously surged through her body.\n\nShe instinctively clamped her legs together,\n\nand said tremblingly,\n\n\"Down there, I suddenly feel,\n\nso itchy!\"",

    "content": "Ding dong...\n\nLike a stone falling into water, the sound was crisp and melodious, and the original tranquility was disturbed by ripples.\n\nZhou Ze found himself lying on a pond, beneath him, the water surface, which was like glass, supporting his body.\n\nEverything around him was blurry at first, but slowly began to clear, and after clearing, it became familiar.\n\nIn the distance,\n\nThe Yellow Springs Road is always bustling, because even without world wars or plagues, people are dying every moment in this world.\n\nMany TV shows often have a line: \"I'm afraid you'll be too lonely on the Yellow Springs Road, so I'll (or send someone) go down to accompany you.\"\n\nActually, there's no need to worry about that at all.\n\nWhen you go down, you'll find the Yellow Springs Road very crowded, and there will be many white brothers, black brothers, men, women, old, and young around you.\n\nPlump or slender, handsome or ugly—these external appearances cannot prevent the established rule that you will die.\n\nPrinces, marquises, generals, and prime ministers may have their moments of glory, but in the end, they all become a mound of earth.\n\nHowever, most people don't perceive loneliness after descending to the Yellow Springs; everyone is like a shapeless zombie, slowly moving forward, following the crowd.\n\nIf the human world were a factory workshop, then hell would be the subsequent factory for waste collection and raw material transformation. Compared to the dazzling human world, hell emphasizes a kind of rule and order,\n\nAn order that makes you despair and feel helpless, yet exists as if forged from iron.\n\nZhou Ze slowly stood up.\n\nThis must be a dream, he thought.\n\nHe,\n\nShouldn't be dead.\n\nHe didn't have many memories in his mind, only remembering that he almost died in front of his sister-in-law, and then, like being drunk, he blacked out again.\n\nIt was just like the last time on the rooftop, as if he had given up his body, given up everything.\n\nZhou Ze didn't want to die, especially at this moment. If he could choose, Zhou Ze would rather choose to walk on numbly like those \"walking dead,\" to the next end or beginning.\n\nBut now, he wasn't numb, nor was he in a daze. If he died, he would have to endure the torment of all this loneliness in full consciousness.\n\nIt would be like undergoing a protracted major surgery,\n\nAnd the doctor tells you,\n\n\"I'm sorry, we're out of anesthetic.\"\n\nHis palm rested on the pond.\n\nThe pond was empty; he could see straight through to the bottom, and everything around was crystal clear.\n\nThe faceless woman hadn't returned yet, but things over there were nearing a conclusion.\n\nThe little loli, the faceless woman, Rongcheng—there had to be a resolution eventually.\n\nLooking around,\n\nZhou Ze didn't see the man with the cat whom he had seen the last time he dreamt of this place. In fact, Zhou Ze was rather looking forward to seeing him again.\n\nHe didn't know why, but that man seemed to possess a special magic; being with him made one feel at ease.\n\nPerhaps, this was charismatic charm?\n\nWalking on the water, a mist began to rise around him, a hazy feeling slowly enveloping everything, gradually covering it all.\n\nReturning to an old place, there was no surprise, no unexpected turn; everything seemed unchanged, but Zhou Ze knew that something had changed: himself.\n\nFor example, this time, when he dreamed of this place again, he seemed much more composed.\n\nWhen the thick fog completely enveloped everything,\n\nZhou Ze felt a sting in his eyes, and then he smelled the earthy scent of mud.\n\nDamn it,\n\nIt's that earthy smell again.\n\nOpening his eyes, Zhou Ze saw himself lying in the bedroom on the second floor of the bookstore. The old Taoist and that monkey were sitting there playing with mud, and then started smearing it on him.\n\n\"Hehe, this is the way to knead it! Watch, I'll sculpt him some big pecs!\"\n\nThe old Taoist bragged to the monkey while kneading a bun of mud, then prepared to stick it on Zhou Ze.\n\nOnly the old Taoist could turn a healing session into a vulgar game.\n\nHowever, just as the old Taoist was about to stick it on, he saw Zhou Ze on the bed open his eyes. He immediately froze in shock, then held the mud bun in his hands, at a loss.\n\n\"Is it tasty?\"\n\nZhou Ze asked.\n\nFor some reason,\n\nThis injury should be much lighter than the last time. Although he didn't know how long he had been unconscious, at least he could speak directly after waking up.\n\n\"Is it tasty?\"\n\nThe old Taoist remained frozen.\n\n\"Is it tasty?\" Zhou Ze asked again.\n\nThe old Taoist pulled a long face, lowered his head, took a bite of the mud bun, and then nodded, tears in his eyes.\n\n\"Fragrant, truly fragrant.\"\n\nZhou Ze looked away, no longer watching him.\n\nThe old Taoist quickly spat out the mud from his mouth, then offered solicitously, \"Boss, you're awake! You scared me to death, you were unconscious for three days.\"\n\nOnly three days?\n\nHow long was he unconscious last time?\n\nBut why did they always smear mud on him every time?\n\nZhou Ze looked at the dirty stains on the bed and his own grimy body. For someone with a洁癖 (cleanliness obsession), it was truly unbearable:\n\n\"Call Bai Yingying.\"\n\n\"Boss, are you hungry?\" the old Taoist asked.\n\n\"I want to take a bath.\"\n\n\"Let me help you, Boss. In the past, when I went to bathhouses to catch ghosts and save the common people, I used to scrub backs. My skills are top-notch!\"\n\nThe old Taoist patted his chest.\n\n\"......\" Zhou Ze.\n\nThe monkey on the side covered its mouth, giggling \"吱吱吱\" (squeaking sound).\n\nZhou Ze really wanted to say, \"Look, even the monkey is laughing at you.\n\nWhy do you have no self-awareness at all right now?\"\n\n\"Call Bai Yingying.\"\n\n\"No need, Boss, come on, I'll carry you to the bathroom. This humble Taoist guarantees to scrub you squeaky clean.\"\n\nSaying this, the old Taoist eagerly prepared to pick Zhou Ze up from the bed.\n\nIf Zhou Ze still had strength now, his nails would probably have grown out,\n\nAnd he would have opened several new air holes in the old Taoist's body.\n\nUnfortunately, Zhou Ze was just a weak patient right now.\n\nFortunately, Bai Yingying happened to push open the door at this moment, holding a cup of tea. Seeing Zhou Ze awake, Bai Yingying happily put down the tea and walked to the bedside.\n\nZhou Ze let out a long sigh of relief.\n\n...\n\nHaving had the experience before, Bai Yingying was quite natural this time helping Zhou Ze bathe.\n\n\"How are things with the Lin family?\"\n\nZhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Boss, when we got there, you were already unconscious on the floor. The Lin sisters were fine, but their house was a mess, especially the bathroom—the glass and tiles were all broken.\n\nWe brought you out, and afterward, no one from the Lin family came to ask anything. I know what you want to ask, the younger Lin sister is back to school normally, and Doctor Lin is also back at work.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded, looking in the mirror. His hair seemed a bit long. He said to Bai Yingying, \"Help me trim my hair, make it shorter.\"\n\n\"Alrighty.\"\n\nBai Yingying went out to get scissors and came back to cut Zhou Ze's hair.\n\nAfter everything was neatly tidied up, Zhou Ze was placed in a wheelchair. The wheelchair was new, shiny, and electric, with a joystick, like a bumper car at an amusement park.\n\n\"Who bought this?\" Zhou Ze's face darkened.\n\n\"Boss, do you like it? This was specially prepared for you by this humble Taoist. I thought you'd probably need it often in the future,\n\nSo I just got you one.\n\nBoss, look here, this button can be pressed!\"\n\nThe old Taoist pressed the button for Zhou Ze as if presenting a treasure,\n\nAnd then the whole wheelchair started glowing, multi-colored lights,\n\n\"Woo woo woo woo woo\"\n\nAnd a train whistle sound effect.\n\nThe old Taoist thought Zhou Ze would be very satisfied,\n\nLittle did he know that if Zhou Ze wasn't so weak right now,\n\nHe would have died twice today.\n\nInstead of sitting in the wheelchair, Zhou Ze chose a soft sofa seat by the window in the bookstore.\n\nXu Qinglang wasn't in the shop; it seemed he had some family matters and had gone back, but he left a lot of juices,\n\nSaying that if Zhou Ze woke up, he could drink them.\n\nLife seemed to have returned to its familiar rhythm.\n\nAfter all that fuss, in the end, nothing had changed.\n\nThe truth was laughable, yet it had truly happened.\n\nPerhaps,\n\nTo truly understand the matter of the Ghost Messenger's spirit on his sister-in-law, they would have to wait for the little loli to return. As a Ghost Messenger who had originally been in the same city, it was unlikely that the little loli knew nothing about that Ghost Messenger.\n\nOf course, that's assuming the little loli could even come back.\n\nZhou Ze, the boss, leaned on the sofa, basking in the sun through the glass, while Bai Yingying was busy attending to customers. Although Xu Qinglang wasn't there, Bai Yingying had learned how to prepare ordinary pastries and drinks.\n\nAt the table next to Zhou Ze, sat two long-haired women, but their voices were a bit hoarse and somewhat affected. The two women were flipping through fashion magazines while chatting, and they grew more and more animated.\n\n\"I'm telling you, I recently discovered something that really worries me.\"\n\n\"Tell me, quickly tell me.\"\n\n\"Last week, I noticed that the stockings and bras I had left on the washing machine in the bathroom, waiting to be washed, had been touched.\"\n\n\"Ah, who touched them? Did someone get into your house? Could it be a thief?\"\n\n\"But nothing was stolen from the house. At first, I thought it was a thief too, but then I found out it wasn't.\"\n\n\"Then who touched them?\"\n\n\"It was Xiao Wen. I noticed it that time. Xiao Wen went into the bathroom after I finished showering, and when I went back in, I found that my stockings, bras, and other underwear had been rummaged through, and there were wet marks on them.\"\n\n\"Ah.\"\n\nThe other woman covered her mouth,\n\n\"How could Xiao Wen do something like that?\"\n\n\"I'm really distressed too.\"\n\n\"It's nothing, maybe Xiao Wen is just growing up and developing a bit of curiosity about women's things. Most boys go through that phase.\"\n\n\"I looked it up online, if it was just these issues, then fine.\"\n\n\"Just these issues? No, it's not fine. You need to try to guide him and help him establish correct values.\"\n\n\"I originally planned to talk to him frankly, but then I discovered something else. One weekend, I came home early from work and saw Xiao Wen in my bedroom, wearing my usual stockings, bra, and skirt, standing in front of the mirror, looking at himself.\"\n\n\"This...\"\n\n\"If it were just the previous things, I think I could still guide him, but now things have become very serious. He's actually wearing my clothes and looking in the mirror. This is clearly not a typical issue of a boy in his youth.\"\n\n\"Oh, my son's call, I'll take it.\"\n\nThe woman answered the phone, then said to her best friend, \"Sorry, my son says he's hungry, I need to go back and feed him.\"\n\n\"Mmm, you go back quickly.\"\n\n\"Waiter, check please.\"\n\nBai Yingying walked over and settled the bill.\n\nZhou Ze watched the two long-haired women walk out of the shop, deep in thought.\n\n\"Boss, do you want some more hot water?\" Bai Yingying asked.\n\n\"No need.\" Zhou Ze shook his head and picked up his teacup.\n\nBai Yingying stood with one hand on her hip, the other holding the money, and said helplessly:\n\n\"Those two guys just now were really sick, weren't they? Clearly men, but dressed up as women. Good thing I have sharp eyes.\"\n\n\"Cough, cough...\"\n\nZhou Ze, who was drinking water, suddenly choked.",

    "content": "In life, what one fears most is acceptance of fate.\n\nBecause accepting one's fate implies no more struggle, and thus your life will follow its existing predetermined path, smoothly continuing without too many ripples or surprises.\n\nYou can see what you’ll be like in five years, and you can guess what you’ll be doing in ten years.\n\nHowever, what life needs most, in fact, is also the acceptance of fate.\n\nTo be down-to-earth, stable, free from miscellaneous thoughts, living your own life; plainness leads to lasting peace.\n\nWhether to accept one’s fate or not is purely a matter of personal choice.\n\nZhou Ze sat on the sofa in the bookstore, staring blankly for an entire afternoon, seemingly thinking a lot, yet also thinking of nothing at all.\n\nIn the glass, a blurry reflection of himself appeared; unknowingly, he no longer felt awkward when looking in the mirror.\n\nHuman adaptability is indeed strong; even if it's your appearance, even if it's your life's trajectory, once you get used to it, you no longer feel anything particular about it.\n\nThis is his bookstore, this is his future life.\n\nHe reached out and touched his short, cropped hair, which Bai Yingying had just trimmed for him.\n\nIt was crisp and neat.\n\nZhou Ze saw Tang Shi standing at the door. She had been standing there for three hours, from noon until the afternoon, barely moving.\n\nZhou Ze didn’t ask her what she was doing standing there; everyone needs time alone to clear their mind, and at such times, they don't need anyone else's comfort.\n\nHe took out his phone, logged into his WeChat; there were no messages, no replies.\n\nClinging to his past life, clinging to Xu Le in this life,\n\nZhou Ze truly felt tired.\n\nActually, it would be better to just live this life, as his new self, in a down-to-earth manner.\n\nWhether he saw things clearly or not, it made no difference,\n\nAfter all, the past is past,\n\nAnd the future has not yet arrived.\n\nHe took out his small booklet, flipping through it, feeling its texture.\n\nZhou Ze felt that his future life would be entangled with it, at least, for a very long time.\n\nIt seemed that the female ghost messenger also had a booklet, but when Zhou Ze asked, Bai Yingying said they hadn't found it. Perhaps the booklet had vanished with the wind; after all, at that time, the booklet already showed signs of collapse, and with the female ghost messenger's demise, its final meaning of existence would also disappear.\n\nTang Shi finally moved. She slowly squatted down, hands supporting her knees. Perhaps she had been standing too long, so her legs were numb or cramped.\n\nZhou Ze smiled,\n\nThen Tang Shi turned her head, looked at Zhou Ze, who was gloating through the glass, and a smile also appeared at the corner of her mouth, but this smile seemed somewhat reserved.\n\nIt was as if she had transformed into a different person at that moment.\n\nThe old her was not this serious.\n\nThe little monkey jumped in front of Zhou Ze, waving a toy hammer. Zhou Ze reached out and patted its head.\n\nAll along, Zhou Ze never understood what was going on with the mud the little monkey brought, but it seemed to work very well. He thought that if opening a bookstore didn't make enough money in the future, he could still open a medicine shop.\n\n\"Ancestral Five Finger Mountain Black Jade Mending Plaster Set\"?\n\nThat’s not a bad idea.\n\n\"Squeak, squeak, squeak, squeak...\"\n\nThe little monkey held a mobile phone in its hand, waving it at Zhou Ze.\n\nThe monkey’s phone was bought by the old Taoist, which clearly showed the old Taoist’s doting on the monkey.\n\n\"What are you doing?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nThe monkey pointed to the speaker on the bookstore wall, then pointed to the phone.\n\n\"Connecting to the Bluetooth speaker?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nThe monkey looked bewildered,\n\nBut it seemed likely, so it nodded.\n\nTaking the monkey's phone, Zhou Ze helped it connect to Bluetooth. The monkey tried it, played a song from \"Monkey King: Hero is Back,\" and the speaker immediately made a sound.\n\nThe monkey was very happy.\n\nImmediately after, the bookstore's background music kept changing in the monkey's hands. Fortunately, there weren't many customers in the bookstore at the moment, so Zhou Ze let the monkey play around.\n\nActually, the background music in many large shopping malls is quite particular.\n\nFor example, if Li Yugang's \"A Thousand Miles of Rivers and Mountains\" is played at first, if a security guard or an internal staff member of the mall sees a familiar habitual thief entering the mall, they will immediately notify the communication room, and the person there will immediately change the background music.\n\nNext, perhaps Michael Jackson's \"Beat It\" or \"You Are So Poisonous\" might be played, and then vendors will remind their customers that a thief is around and to be careful.\n\nShopping malls everywhere basically have this kind of unwritten rule; sometimes even on a bus, if the driver sees a habitual thief they recognize getting on, they will press a button to send a warning.\n\nSo, sometimes when you hear \"Passengers, please take care of your belongings...\" on the bus, don't take it as a perfunctory voice message.\n\nAnd these thieves,\n\nBasically, they come with their own background music,\n\nWhen they walk in,\n\nTheir unique BGM plays.\n\nAbove the bookstore counter was a hanging television playing \"Shaolin Soccer.\"\n\nAt this moment, Zhou Ze realized he hadn’t seen the old Taoist all afternoon. However, soon, three \"drip\" sounds came from inside.\n\nThe little monkey understood and adjusted the music. Soon, the Bluetooth speaker played:\n\n\"The waves rush… the waves flow… the endless river flows on and on…\"\n\nAccompanied by the theme song of \"The Bund,\" the old Taoist, dressed in a brand-new Taoist robe, a stark contrast to his previous disheveled appearance, slowly emerged from the staircase.\n\nA fan was likely placed in the hallway behind him, blowing his long robe, giving him a truly ethereal and immortal aura.\n\nHolding a peach wood sword,\n\nHe performed a sword flourish,\n\nThe old Taoist strode in the Big Dipper steps, majestic and awe-inspiring!\n\nZhou Ze rubbed his chin. It was fortunate it was the old Taoist; if it had been another Taoist or monk daring to show off like this in a bookstore run by a ghost, they would have died countless times over.\n\nThe little monkey held its phone, the camera pointing at the old Taoist, looking for an angle. Zhou Ze glanced over and saw that the little monkey was live-streaming for the old Taoist.\n\nAlright,\n\nThis monkey was indeed smart,\n\nA little too smart.\n\nOn the live-stream screen, a bunch of bullet comments scrolled by:\n\n\"First floor is mine, hope no one saw me eat poop?\"\n\n\"Holy cow, Old Taoist, good afternoon, you son of a gun!\"\n\n\"Old Taoist, it’s been almost half a year, you’re finally back!\"\n\n\"Taoist Priest, I miss you so much, you’ve been gone for so long, I really miss you!\"\n\n\"Taoist Priest, you're naughty, hiding for so long, *ying ying ying*, gonna stroke your little pipe, *ying ying ying*.\"\n\n\"Are you still selling冥钞 [ghost money]? It’s out of stock!\"\n\n\"Did you guys see that, a tuft of yellow fur on the left side of the camera, what is that, could it be a monkey?\"\n\n\"Hahaha, are you suggesting a monkey is filming him? The upstairs commenter must be an idiot, right?\"\n\n\"Agreed, upstairs is an idiot.\"\n\n\"First floor is right!\"\n\n\"First floor is absolutely freaking right!\"\n\n\"First floor is sooooooo right right right!\"\n\n\"Damn it, are the guys upstream trolling the first floor, forcing OCD to flare up!\"\n\nAs the old Taoist resumed streaming, the popularity of the live broadcast room began to soar.\n\nThe old Taoist, big or small, was an internet celebrity, somewhat famous in the outdoor live-streaming field, and had a loyal fan base that stuck with him.\n\nAfter all, those who were willing to spend more than the equivalent in RMB to buy ghost money from the old Taoist,\n\nThose were absolute die-hard fans!\n\nThe old Taoist performed a display of sword dancing and martial arts,\n\nWarming up the crowd,\n\nHaving not practiced for a long time, he seemed a bit out of breath, but in the next moment, he still scattered a handful of paper money into the air:\n\n\"Immeasurable Heavenly Venerable!\"\n\nHe raised the peach wood sword upwards,\n\n\"Wind, rain, thunder, lightning, obey my command!\"\n\nThe paper money pieces began to automatically swirl around the old Taoist, perfectly aligned, continuously flying into various shapes, cooperating with the old Taoist's commands, complementing each other beautifully.\n\n\"Damn, this special effect is awesome, definitely not the cheap 50-cent kind!\"\n\n\"First floor is right!\"\n\n\"This time, the first floor is really right.\"\n\n\"This time, the first floor didn't eat poop.\"\n\n\"Is this a live broadcast or a pre-recorded video, hey!\"\n\n\"Yeah, someone with a big dick confirm, is this a post-processed video?\"\n\n\"This is live, doesn't look like a video!\"\n\n\"Old Taoist, I'm going to change my opinion of you. I used to think you were just a joker, but now I realize you're a joker who can do magic tricks!\"\n\n\"*Ying ying ying*, teasing the upstairs idiot, *ying ying ying*.\"\n\n\"Damn, upstairs is a pervert!\"\n\n\"One punch will kill an *ying ying* monster!\"\n\nZhou Ze looked at the doorway,\n\nTang Shi was standing there,\n\nClearly, the old Taoist's flying ghost money was a result of Tang Shi's manipulation.\n\nZhou Ze was curious what, given Tang Shi's nature, made her willing to cooperate with the old Taoist in this live-streaming trick.\n\nThe ghost money fell neatly, stacking in the old Taoist’s hand. The old Taoist took the phone from the monkey, checked the system notifications, and his wrinkled face immediately crinkled into a smile, like an old, tender chrysanthemum.\n\n\"Thank you, Typhoon Hotel Bro, for the super rocket!\n\nThank you, Old Qiu Bro, for the super rocket!\n\nThank you, Miss Lan Xue, for the air-drop supply crate!\n\nThank you, Book Friend 160107110901124, for the... the... the big airplane!\n\nOld Taoist, I’m back on stream today,\n\nWater friends,\n\nAre you still there?!\n\nDear audience,\n\nI’ve missed you all so much!\"\n\nOn the TV above the counter, the movie \"Shaolin Soccer\" was playing, and it had just reached the middle segment where Stephen Chow shouted to his martial arts brothers:\n\n\"I feel it,\n\nIt's back,\n\nEveryone,\n\nEveryone is back...\"",

    "content": "April 1, 2018,\n\n00:20 AM,\n\nRongcheng,\n\nLight rain,\n\nGentle breeze, 3 knots.\n\nThe underworld shop on the old street had been closed for a long time. Even the neighbors didn't actually know when it had opened.\n\nBecause it wasn't like a breakfast shop where many people went every day, nor like a clothing store where you could browse after work, even if you didn't buy anything.\n\nMost people would rather never step into an underworld shop to buy things in their entire lives.\n\nNaturally, in their daily lives, they deliberately ignored this underworld shop.\n\nOf course,\n\nWhen it closed,\n\nNaturally, not many people cared, only occasionally passing by and finding the shop door closed, which was slightly surprising.\n\nA胖子 (Fatty) would drive a police car and park in front of the door every few days. He would look at the closed shop, smoke a few cigarettes, and then leave.\n\nThe小姐姐s (young women) at the hair salons on the old street, who conducted the oldest and most enthusiastic business, were truly bothered by this. Every time, they would be so scared that they would usher out the customers they had just invited into their rooms for a drink,\n\nThey didn't even dare to ask for the water fee.\n\nThe massage parlor next to the underworld shop had also been closed for a long time. It was said that the owner was involved in a murder case before the New Year. Although she was later cleared, she had too many family matters and hadn't returned to Rongcheng for a long time.\n\nOccasionally, old customers would come by, reminiscing about the owner's skills. Little did they know that if they frequently sought her massages, while comfortable, they would probably be getting closer and closer to the day they'd walk into the underworld shop next door to pick out a shroud.\n\nLife remained as it was,\n\nThe teahouses and mahjong parlors in the streets and alleys of Rongcheng were filled with ease and leisure.\n\nThis was a relaxed city, and also a city that knew how to enjoy itself. With the cold winter just past and summer yet to arrive, the entire city was immersed in its own slumber,\n\nComfortable,\n\nContent,\n\nOccasionally turning over,\n\nWrapped in a thin blanket,\n\nHmm,\n\nContinue sleeping.\n\nThe old street in the early morning was naturally deserted, except for a few late-night food stalls still waiting for scarce business.\n\nThat underworld shop,\n\nHowever, it was lit.\n\nThe light was very dim, only faintly visible. Ordinary people couldn't even see it.\n\nInside the underworld shop, two rows of chairs were arranged. In the center, on two chairs, sat a long-bearded man on one side and a small girl on the other, pink and cute, a little loli.\n\nAnd on either side of the lower seats,\n\nSome wore hempen clothes, with long sleeves fluttering;\n\nSome wore tall hats, swaying;\n\nSome had their eyeballs aligned, occasionally rotating;\n\nSome had large bellies, fat and greasy.\n\nThe rouge on their faces was much heavier, even appearing somewhat unreal.\n\nWhether they were laughing, picking their ears, or making noise, they always gave off an eerie sense of oppression, like the one hundred and eight Arhats in a temple—no matter how endearing their expressions,\n\nAs an adult, one wouldn't dare to truly laugh at them.\n\nIt was as if, in the unseen, a pair of eyes were watching you from above.\n\nIf one looked closer, they would find that the style of clothing worn by these people was actually very similar to the paper figures displayed in a corner of the underworld shop, as if the clothes had been truly stripped from the paper figures and put on themselves.\n\nVery comical,\n\nVery ridiculous?\n\nBut that was truly the feeling.\n\nOn everyone's lips was a strange, vivid crimson, like rouge deliberately applied to the lips, very exaggerated and very garish.\n\nJia Baoyu said he loved to eat the rouge from his sisters' lips, but if he saw the rouge here, he would probably be scared out of his wits.\n\nIn the air,\n\nThe scent of ashes permeated,\n\nIn the middle of the seated figures, there was a small brazier with charcoal fire. At the same time, stacks of hell money on a rack would automatically fly over, falling into the charcoal fire to burn.\n\nAt the door stood a woman, a long-haired woman.\n\nShe had her head slightly bowed, her long hair obscuring her face.\n\nHer figure was graceful, her physique alluring...\n\nFor ordinary people seeing her, they would probably hope she'd let down her hair to see her true face; everyone has curiosity and a desire for beauty.\n\nHowever, no one present had such thoughts, because they knew this woman... had no face.\n\n\"Not here yet.\"\n\nThe long-bearded man sitting next to the little loli said in a deep voice, frowning slightly.\n\n\"Let everyone wait a bit longer.\"\n\nThe little loli said.\n\nThe long-bearded man nodded, then said, \"Protect your vitality, and try to prolong our stay in the human world.\"\n\nBlack talismans flew out from the long-bearded man's sleeve, scattering around.\n\nEveryone present reached out and took a talisman, sticking it on their forehead. Even the long-bearded man himself applied one.\n\nImmediately,\n\nThe entire shop became silent. Those with talismans on their foreheads stopped moving, as if under a spell of paralysis.\n\nThis made them look no different from the paper figures already in the underworld shop.\n\nThe little loli got up. She also held a talisman in her hand and walked over to the faceless woman.\n\nThe faceless woman slowly raised her head,\n\n\"My doppelgänger is destroyed.\"\n\n\"Just a doppelgänger,\" the little loli said indifferently.\n\n\"She was meant to monitor him,\" the faceless woman reminded.\n\n\"You say, after I return, will there still be a place for him?\"\n\nThe little loli smiled slightly,\n\n\"He's just temporarily covering for me, helping me manage the keys to hell. A single Tongcheng cannot accommodate a third ghost messenger.\"\n\n\"What about me then?\"\n\nThe faceless woman asked sharply,\n\n\"Without me, you wouldn't be able to lure him over.\"\n\n\"Tongcheng already has two ghost messengers, including myself, and one of them is on the verge of collapse. This is the position I reserved for you.\" The little loli reached out and grasped the tip of the faceless woman's hair. \"Once things here are settled, I will arrange an identity for you to stay in the human world.\"\n\nThe faceless woman lowered her head again.\n\n\"I'm curious about one thing, why are you so fixated on that guy? He's just a plaything created by the other one in Tongcheng, oh no, a gift.\"\n\n\"A gift?\"\n\nThe faceless woman's head, hidden beneath her long hair, chuckled twice,\n\n\"In my opinion, this gift is more important than the person you are waiting for.\"\n\nThe little loli's eyes narrowed slightly. She could hear the hidden meaning in the faceless woman's words. This woman, born by the side of the Yellow Springs, in a pool of resentment, had existed for a very long time and naturally knew more untold things.\n\n\"Oh, in that case, it seems I'll have to thoroughly interrogate him after I return.\"\n\nThe hair on the faceless woman's face suddenly spread apart. Her faceless visage began to coalesce into a girl's face, her expression one of great pain, as if she were struggling.\n\n\"Her, you still haven't managed to control her?\" The little loli was somewhat surprised.\n\n\"She's struggling very hard,\" the faceless woman replied. \"Her will is firm, no worse than you ghost messengers.\"\n\nThe little loli smiled faintly, reaching out to toss the talisman in her hand into the charcoal fire,\n\n\"After all... it's just a meaningless struggle.\"\n\nThe firelight flickered dimly,\n\nThe night was dim,\n\nSparks flew from the brazier:\n\n\"Plop\"\n\n………………\n\n\"Plop!\"\n\n\"Plop!\"\n\n\"Plop!\"\n\nThe old street in the light rain carried a hint of chill, with small puddles visible everywhere on the uneven road.\n\nA man in a hoodie walked slowly along the slightly muddy path,\n\nHis head was hidden beneath the hood of his hoodie, and his figure seemed to completely merge with the darkness behind him.\n\n\"Meow.\"\n\nBeside him,\n\nA pure white cat, with elegant steps, followed him closely.\n\nOne man, one cat,\n\nUnder the dim streetlights, they cast two long shadows.\n\nOccasionally, the sound of wind could be heard,\n\nEmpty and eerie, it swirled above the old street, lingering.\n\nThe man's build wasn't burly, but he exuded a sharp aura. He was like a silent blade, capable of splitting the dark curtain once drawn.\n\nAhead was a late-night food stall, run by a husband and wife.\n\nBusiness wasn't good tonight; the husband sat nearby, coughing incessantly, clearly having a cold.\n\nThe man walked to the stall,\n\nThe proprietress looked up, saw the man, and smiled, saying:\n\n\"Long time no see.\"\n\n\"Mm,\" the man replied.\n\n\"Meow,\" the white cat also replied.\n\nThe proprietress began to make soup, fish paste soup; she knew he only ate that.\n\nDrinking a bowl of fresh, tender fish paste soup late at night was a pleasure, a serene moment, nothing less.\n\nThe owner was still coughing. Seeing the customer frown while eating, he thought the customer was disgusted and could only apologize with a smile, turning away.\n\nThe man was startled; he knew the owner had misunderstood. His expression while eating was always like that.\n\nIt was just a bit cold tonight,\n\nOtherwise, regarding eating, he would save as much as possible, ignoring it if he could.\n\nPutting down his bowl and chopsticks, he paid and turned, walking deeper into the old street. The white cat still followed him, inseparable.\n\nNo matter how deep the night,\n\nPeople can always find their way home.\n\nThe man walked to the door of the underworld shop and stopped.\n\nThe white cat darted onto the steps, finding its familiar spot.\n\nYes,\n\nA familiar spot.\n\nOnce upon a time,\n\nHis favorite thing to do was to pull out a chair and sit on the steps, basking in the sun motionless.\n\nThe owner of the massage parlor next door would even tease him, saying he looked like an old man.\n\nHe glanced sideways at the next door. She hadn't returned yet.\n\nSome people leave and never come back, but there are also those who, after walking far away, are still watching you.\n\nHe thought he had always been alone,\n\nEven if he suddenly disappeared from this world, no one would notice. People who love solitude always like to imbue themselves with a lonely color to gain more security.\n\nIt was precisely because someone was watching him,\n\nIt was precisely because someone cared about him,\n\nThat he came back,\n\nHe needed an explanation,\n\nAn explanation for those who cared about him,\n\nAnd an explanation for himself.\n\nHe walked up the steps,\n\nCame to the door,\n\nHe didn't knock,\n\nThis was his home, he had the key.\n\nThe moment the key entered the lock,\n\nThe faceless woman's long hair behind the door suddenly floated up,\n\nThe little loli straightened her back like a miniature adult,\n\nThe talismans on the foreheads of all the underworld officials in the two rows of chairs instantly dissipated,\n\nEveryone collectively opened their eyes,\n\nLooking towards the door!\n\n\"Creak...\"\n\nThe door was pushed open from the outside.\n\nThe little loli looked at the person outside and smiled:\n\n\"Finally caught you.\"\n\nThe man slightly shook his head, indicating the other party was mistaken,\n\nHe corrected:\n\n\"No,\n\nIt's me,\n\nI've returned.\"",

Sweat dripped from his temples, and his clothes were nearly soaked through.\n\nWhen he first appeared, he had an air of a Daoist immortal, with every gesture exuding an authentic touch of immortality.\n\nBut now, he looked like an elderly rock enthusiast. He had already sung over a dozen songs, all of them belted out with all his might, so loudly that it seemed he might cough up blood at any moment.\n\n\"Daoist priest, we're all on the same side, just us folks, please stop singing!\"\n\n\"Daoist priest, Mom asked me why I'm watching the live stream on my knees.

That's why you're happy.\"\n\n\"Actually, he's just feeling down,\" Tang Shi said, her expression gradually turning cold. \"Do you know? The old Daoist gave that monkey a name.\"\n\n\"Oh? What is it?\"\n\n\"Xiaoqiang.\"\n\nZhou Ze wouldn't be so gauche as to point out that it sounded like a certain cockroach's name.\n\n\"Xiaoqiang was the old Daoist's former roommate. They met in Rongcheng.\"\n\n\"Where is he now?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Dead.\"\n\nZhou Ze pursed his lips.\n\n\"He died helping us escape.\"\n\nAt this point, Tang Shi paused, then continued:\n\n\"So, this isn't just a celebration of his return.\n\nActually,\n\nThis is a revenge.\n\nToday,\n\nIs not a joyful day for an old friend's return,\n\nIt's a day for revenge.\n\nBlood debt,\n\nMust be paid in blood.\"\n\nTang Shi waved a hand, and the red ink on the counter immediately splashed out, coiling around her wrist like a blood-red bracelet, dazzlingly eerie.\n\n\"I don't understand.\" Zhou Ze shrugged. \"Since you've already escaped, and someone sacrificed themselves for it, why would he voluntarily go back?\"\n\n\"Before I answer that, can I ask you a question first?\"\n\n\"Go ahead.\"\n\n\"Why couldn't that temple god last time, and that problematic senior ghost messenger from Tongcheng recently, kill you?\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't know how to answer.\n\nHe couldn't say that he wasn't entirely sure himself, like getting drunk, falling asleep, and waking up to find:\n\nOh,\n\nThe person who wanted to kill me,\n\nIs dead.\n\nHahahaha,\n\nThat idiot actually died just like that,\n\nAnd I don't remember anything,\n\nHahahaha!\n\nTang Shi answered for him:\n\n\"Because, you're not the only one,\n\nwho can improve.\"\n\n\"Are you that confident? Then I really should have more expectations.\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't hope for the little loli to return safe and sound.\n\nHe wouldn't be fooled by the little loli's appearance; he knew that if she returned unharmed, and even completed her mission, then it would be her turn to settle accounts with him.\n\nThe identification booklet in his hand, the key to the gates of Hell that he controlled, which originally belonged to the little loli, might all have to be surrendered.\n\nThe driver's death incident hasn't been resolved yet, but it at least shows that the little loli isn't a kind-hearted person.\n\nWhat everyone wants is nothing but profit. Living people are busy all day for profit, and even after death, it's still the same.\n\nBefore Madam Bai's merits were complete and she was about to descend into Hell, she specifically instructed him to dispose of her corpse, Bai Yingying. She worried that her body remaining in the mortal realm might cause uncontrollable events and affect her in Hell, so she instructed Zhou Ze to burn Bai Yingying with bamboo during the next Cold Clothing Festival.\n\nIn many myths, even the immortals in Heaven have their own selfish motives and schemes, so there's no need to expect those ghost messengers to truly care about the country or its people.\n\nTang Shi flipped her wrist, and the red ink spilled onto the ground, creating a gruesome effect of flowing blood. Under Tang Shi's deliberate control, it became extremely eerie and horrifying, with a dripping blood effect.\n\n\"One more thing, why didn't you go back?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nRevenge, after all, is like a gang fight.\n\nYou call your people, I call mine, we pick a spot, and we fight.\n\nThe little loli called a lot of ghost messengers, and also brought the Faceless Woman, but on this side, it seemed there was only that one guy.\n\n\"I asked him if he needed me to go back. My injuries are almost healed, and he said no.\"\n\n\"Is he comforting you and worried about you getting into danger again, or does he have enough confidence?\"\n\nTang Shi smiled,\n\nHer smile was as beautiful as a flower.\n\nZhou Ze had never seen Tang Shi like this.\n\nShe bent over,\n\nClutching her stomach,\n\nAs if laughing so hard her stomach hurt, glistening tears slowly dripped from the corners of her eyes,\n\nShe choked out:\n\n\"He said, 'Airfare isn't cheap!'\"\n\n...\n\nInside the underworld shop,\n\nTwo rows of ghost messengers stood. When they fully awakened, the area around the shop was immediately covered in frost, forming ice crystals.\n\nIt was as if this was an ice chamber.\n\nThe immense Yin energy seemed so dense it was almost dripping, suffocating.\n\nIf a living person accidentally wandered in here, they would likely fall seriously ill upon returning.\n\nGhost messengers,\n\nAre still ghosts, after all.\n\nLiang Chuan frowned slightly,\n\nHe was a little unhappy,\n\nBecause his house was getting dirty. Later, the frost would melt into water, what a shame for the shop's fine redwood furniture.\n\nThe most uncomfortable part was,\n\nThe people dirtying his house,\n\nWere all uninvited guests, not welcomed by him.\n\n\"We've been looking for you for a long time.\"\n\nThe long-bearded man, who had been sitting next to the little loli, now stood up and walked over.\n\nThe situation was set.\n\nThis long and extensive capture operation, involving ghost messengers from all over, was finally coming to an end.\n\nA stowaway who escaped from Hell to the human world without gaining an identity was inherently an anomaly to be eradicated, not to mention this fellow actually killed people in the mortal realm, acting as a judge without the official title.\n\nUtterly arrogant,\n\nSeeking his own death!\n\nThe Faceless Woman stood beside Liang Chuan, looking at him. She remembered several times when she almost caught him, preventing him from leaving Hell, but he always managed to escape.\n\nThis time,\n\nShe would no longer be the one filled with reluctance and anger.\n\nLiang Chuan's gaze swept over everyone, his expression blank. Behind him, the white cat idly wagged its tail, even occasionally licking its paws to groom its fur.\n\n\"I can give you a choice.\"\n\nThe little loli took a step forward, standing before Liang Chuan.\n\n\"Docilely let your soul leave your body, and we'll take you directly back to Hell. You secretly escaped from there; now, returning is your rightful path.\"\n\nThe long-bearded man pondered, \"If we are forced to act, you must understand that this time you will absolutely not escape. If your soul returns, at most you'll suffer some punishment and enter the animal realm, which is better than complete annihilation.\"\n\n\"Oh.\"\n\nLiang Chuan responded.\n\nHe understood.\n\nThese ghost messengers wanted to save effort, to subdue him without a fight. Their activities in the human world were difficult. Unless they chose to inhabit a physical body, which carried significant risks and uncertainties, they remained very low-key in the human world and dared not act too openly.\n\nThen, Liang Chuan looked at the Faceless Woman beside him and said:\n\n\"You captured her?\"\n\nThe Faceless Woman lifted her head, her hair fanning out. On her flat face, a woman's features began to emerge. She was in pain, she was struggling, she was roaring, and simultaneously howling.\n\nShe had died,\n\nAnd her soul had been taken by the Faceless Woman.\n\nLiang Chuan licked his lips,\n\nSlowly lowered his head,\n\n\"The second one.\"\n\nThey used his friends' lives to force him to show himself.\n\nThey,\n\nHad succeeded.\n\n\"Killing living people harms our Yin virtue; we are also unwilling to do so. This is your own fault for being obstinate.\"\n\nThe little loli continued:\n\n\"If you had obediently not resisted back then, those two wouldn't have died. And, we also know you have a few other close acquaintances.\"\n\n\"Is this... another threat?\"\n\nLiang Chuan asked, still looking down.\n\n\"I'm merely stating a fact. We are ghost messengers, guardians of the order between Yin and Yang. You cannot resist us.\"\n\n\"Heh heh...\"\n\nLiang Chuan slowly raised his head,\n\nHis eyes,\n\nWere blood red!\n\nThe little loli's heart suddenly palpitated. She braced herself, anticipating the young man's sudden outburst.\n\nHowever,\n\nHer body suddenly trembled.\n\nA skeletal hand had, at this moment, pierced her soul body. She froze almost completely in place, then, she turned her head in disbelief, looking behind her.\n\nThe long-bearded man,\n\nHis eyes blood-red,\n\nHis face showing struggle,\n\nHe was clearly being controlled!\n\nBut,\n\nHow could this be!\n\nIn a single instant,\n\nDirectly controlling one of the most senior ghost messengers present!\n\nWhy was this happening?\n\nWhy was this happening?\n\nLiang Chuan raised his head,\n\nOpened his mouth,\n\nTilting his neck slightly,\n\nHis ten fingers began to tap in the air before him, as if playing a piano:\n\n\"Hush,\n\nThis melody,\n\nDo you hear it?\n\nThis is,\n\nThe 'Funeral Song' I play for you.\"",

    "content": "Without too much preamble,\n\nNo lengthy self-introductions,\n\nAnd no idiotic back-and-forth exchanges of moves;\n\nThis slaughter, taking place in a冥店 and not meant for the living,\nbegan abruptly in this manner.\n\n\"Funeral Song\"\n\nFor whom does it sound?\n\nThe roles of prey and hunter swung back and forth. The side that had been utterly confident and poised suddenly had a misconception: perhaps they wouldn't be the ones to laugh last.\n\nThe skeletal hand, radiating cold flame, pierced through the loli's soul, leaving a large, burning hole. The loli could only retreat, her face dark as she looked at the injury to her soul.\n\nThey wanted to conserve their strength because they knew that the guy who had escaped their last encirclement wasn't an easy opponent.\n\nBut they had also firmly believed that this second encirclement, with so many ghost messengers gathered, would surely result in victory, especially since the opponent had no choice but to walk into their trap.\n\nHowever,\n\nDoes this current situation look like a sure victory?\n\nThe twisting and stinging pain from deep within her soul continuously assailed the loli.\n\nShe dared not move carelessly. This flame came from the long-bearded man; it was his signature technique, and she had been caught off guard, truly without any defense.\n\nShe even worried,\n\nIf she couldn't suppress this injury, she might just vanish into thin air.\n\nThe soul, seemingly more ethereal and elusive than the body, free from the worries of birth, aging, sickness, and death, was, in reality, far too fragile, at least in this mortal realm.\n\nAnd her physical body wasn't with her; now, she regretted it.\n\nIf the physical body she temporarily inhabited had been here, she wouldn't have been so passive.\n\n\"Ugh...\"\n\nHer mouth opened,\n\nAnd the loli's tongue began to extend, growing very, very long, trying to extinguish the flames still flickering at her abdomen.\n\nHer tongue continuously melted,\n\nBut it also continuously regenerated,\n\nThis was a method of healing using her own vital energy. Normally, she wouldn't dare, but at this moment, she had no choice.\n\nBecause,\n\nThe throbbing deep within her heart,\n\nWas becoming clearer and clearer!\n\nFor the first time,\n\nShe began to ponder,\n\nTonight,\n\nWould she be able to leave this place alive?\n\nAnd the long-bearded man was visibly struggling to resist. He was the most senior ghost messenger present, with a good chance of becoming a Ghost Captain.\n\nOne must know that in the mortal realm, Yama Kings rarely appear, and Ghost Captains mostly operate in the Underworld. Those who can move more freely between the human world and Hell are the ghost messengers.\n\nBut such an experienced ghost messenger, in the short time after that person opened the door,\n\nWas controlled and became a puppet!\n\nRewind half an hour,\n\nThis scene,\n\nWho among them would have expected it?\n\nResistance and struggle were for dignity and for their own existence,\n\nBut in the next moment, when Liang Chuan spoke, he also spoke in unison,\n\nPerfectly synchronized:\n\n\"This funeral song.\"\n\n\"This funeral song.\"\n\n\"Is for everyone.\"\n\n\"Is for everyone.\"\n\n\"Listen well, then be on your way.\"\n\n\"Listen well, then be on your way.\"\n\nThe long-bearded man extended his withered arms; both arms were almost just skin covering bones. At his palms, there were even exposed white bones, without even that layer of skin for embellishment.\n\nFor so many years,\n\nCountless souls had been captured by his hands, sent to Hell, entered the cycle of reincarnation, and became his own merits and achievements. And now, he was like a marionette, controlled by another,\n\nControlled by his original prey.\n\nYou take me as your prey?\n\nFine,\n\nThen I'll be your master.\n\nThe faceless woman let out a sharp shriek, her long hair flying out, wrapping around Liang Chuan. She knew that if she failed tonight, she would gain nothing.\n\nLeaving Hell, leaving the water pool, even with the ghost messengers' assistance, was a huge drain on her. If she returned empty-handed, she wouldn't even be able to leave Hell next time.\n\nThe water pool would become her eternal confinement, and she'd even have to worry if her weakened self would be influenced by the reincarnated souls on the Yellow Springs Road, eventually falling completely and merging into their group, moving from one end to another.\n\nShe refused to lose,\n\nAnd she couldn't lose,\n\nShe didn't want to be like before, standing in the water pool, watching these people leave while she could only rage!\n\nLiang Chuan turned his head, looking at the faceless woman. His deep red eyes seemed to hide two blood-red moons. At the same time, two lines of blood tears flowed from his eyes, showing that he wasn't as carefree as he appeared.\n\nHowever, Liang Chuan's finger tapping became lighter than before.\n\nThere was no piano in front of him, so naturally, no sound could be made,\n\nBut that urgent rhythm,\n\nFelt like it was tapping deep in everyone's hearts,\n\nStriking their heartstrings again and again!\n\nThey were ghost messengers, guardians of the order between the Yin and Yang realms. From ancient times, they had always escorted deceased souls to Hell,\n\nAnd today,\n\nSomeone was beginning to send them off!\n\nThe faceless woman's facial expression twisted. She had no expression initially, but now, her face began to undulate unevenly. Even her long hair, imbued with special abilities, turned into venomous snakes on Medusa's head, not attacking others, but retaliating against herself.\n\nThe silent piano music, omnipresent.\n\nThis was a vortex,\n\nNo one could escape!\n\nAn unusual sound came from the faceless woman's body, as if calling out to something, creating a resonance with Liang Chuan.\n\n\"You said you wanted to be an envoy of Hell.\n\nI,\n\nGrant you that wish.\"\n\nThis sentence wasn't spoken for the faceless woman, but for the soul she had swallowed.\n\nA lone wolf, it's not easy to have friends, and this time, he lost two.\n\nHe had found Xiao Qiang's soul; although it was in slumber, it would awaken one day.\n\nYuecheng's soul was right before him; he would send her to her desired destination.\n\nYou say I am the Yama King,\n\nThen I shall be this Yama King,\n\nSo what?\n\nLiang Chuan raised his hand, then sharply pressed it down.\n\nThe faceless woman suddenly looked up, her body beginning to twist. The soul she had suppressed, deliberately not fully devouring, now, with external help, began to counterattack her.\n\nThat girl's soul, which she had originally used to threaten him, had now become a bomb hidden within her own body, seemingly capable of blowing her up.\n\nTwo different kinds of shrill cries and screams erupted from the faceless woman's body; two women were biting, fighting, and devouring each other.\n\nLiang Chuan provided the arena,\n\nSet the stage,\n\nThe rest,\n\nWas their own struggle.\n\nHe had confidence in her; she was even more suited for the identity of Hell than himself.\n\nThe surrounding ghost messengers naturally didn't stand by and watch but attacked in unison. At this point, they no longer cared whether it would deplete their vital energy or affect their stay in the mortal realm;\n\nThey knew the situation had already begun to spiral out of control,\n\nNow, they had to forcefully bring everything back to their desired rhythm.\n\nImmediately, pacification sticks, soul-suppressing banners, soul-snatching bells, and other implements surged towards Liang Chuan. However, the long-bearded man, in an almost selfless manner, stood in front of Liang Chuan.\n\nHe was powerless to counterattack, but he steadfastly bore all the blows, his soul quickly beginning to shatter.\n\nClearly the hunter,\n\nYet now sacrificing himself to protect his prey,\n\nEven more selfless than the most loyal servant!\n\nThe faceless woman knelt on the ground, emitting continuous sharp shrieks. Ordinary people couldn't hear them; the nearby residents continued to sleep, but the cats and dogs on the old street sensed the sensitive anomaly, yet dared not stir, only curling up in their nests, trembling.\n\nThis was a struggle that living beings could not participate in,\n\nA battle among death gods in the human world,\n\nThe outcome of the battle,\n\nFor the losing side,\n\nWas not even being a ghost!\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nThe black pacification stick pierced the long-bearded man's chest. At the same time, Liang Chuan swayed slightly, feeling a bit dizzy, and the crimson color in the long-bearded man's eyes had vanished.\n\nHe lowered his head, looking at the black pacification stick that had already pierced his soul, and then at his shattered soul body, which seemed as if a gust of wind could blow it away.\n\nIn his eyes,\n\nThere was nothing but disbelief,\n\nWhy was this happening,\n\nWhy did it become like this!\n\n\"Kill him, refine his soul!\"\n\nFrom a distance, the loli, still suppressing her severe injury, shrieked:\n\n\"He's finished, completely exhausted. I want him to suffer worse than death, I want to personally brand his soul for ten years!\"\n\nStrike while the iron is hot,\n\nThe long-bearded man collapsed to his knees,\n\nThe ghost messengers in front bypassed him and continued to rush towards Liang Chuan,\n\nThe order of the Underworld cannot be desecrated. If today's events spread, they would become the laughingstock of the Underworld, so this man must be dealt with!\n\nLiang Chuan's body swayed as he leaned against the door panel,\n\nHis fingers had already fallen limply, and his body was soaked in sweat.\n\nHis vision,\n\nSeemed a little blurry too.\n\nIn a daze,\n\nHe saw ferocious ghost messengers pouncing on him, and now, he was so tired. What he really wanted to do was just lean against this doorframe,\n\nLean there forever,\n\nWaiting for tomorrow's sun to rise,\n\nWaiting for the golden sunlight to warm him,\n\nWaiting for that warm and lazy comfort to envelop him.\n\nTwo thousand kilometers away, an old Taoist priest was live-streaming to cheer him on,\n\nBut he never used a smartphone, so he couldn't watch the broadcast.\n\nThere was a cold girl, biting her lip, smiling and crying, crying and smiling for him.\n\nLiang Chuan looked up,\n\nHe didn't regret what he had done, not one bit,\n\nBut,\n\nHe had people he was bound to, people he had wronged,\n\nTaking responsibility for one's own actions is often just a simple, beautiful fantasy.\n\nAs the pacification stick was about to smash onto his head,\n\nHe raised his hand,\n\nLooking at the white cat below, still grooming its fur,\n\nHe called out:\n\n\"Pu'er!\"\n\nInstantly,\n\nUnder the dim streetlights,\n\nThe cat's shadow began to stretch,\n\nLonger and longer,\n\nSo long,\n\nThat it seemed to engulf the entire old street...\n\n————\n\nLong has no drafts, this is known to everyone. These two chapters were written in the first half of the night. Long will continue to write immediately,\n\nToday, at least five updates!\n\nLong will publish each chapter as soon as it's written.\n\nWithin two months,\n\nWe went live twice,\n\nTwo months is not too long, but some people have already forgotten the achievements and position we gained when we went live on February 1st.\n\nIt's time,\n\nTo remind them,\n\nWe're back!",

    "content": "A white cat, its fur like snow, appeared as the most exquisite and pure white in this world, carrying a rare spiritual vitality and clarity.\n\nBut its shadow was black, a despairing black, like a demonic tentacle extending from underground, continuously spreading, continuously covering.\n\nAccompanying it,\n\nWere curses and despair!\n\nIn the cat's eyes shimmered the exact same look that Liang Chuan's eyes had held deep within them earlier; that crimson depth, like swirling magma, oppressively suffocating!\n\nIf one looked closely,\n\nOne could still faintly discern countless wailing spirits and grieving ghosts, and mountains of piled bones in the cat's eyes.\n\nA pair of cat's eyes,\n\nEtched with the deepest and most terrifying imagery of hell,\n\nThat was Purgatory,\n\nThat was Asura,\n\nThat was the place where all beings found rest and their final madness,\n\nIt was the origin of life,\n\nIt was the destination of all!\n\nAnd that place,\n\nWas somewhere even ordinary Hell Guards weren't qualified to approach.\n\nBecause there, Hell Guards and ordinary vengeful spirits were fundamentally indistinguishable.\n\n\"Meow!\"\n\nThe cat's meow,\n\nResounded throughout the entire old street,\n\nInstantly causing the swarming Hell Guards to tremble, their hearts shaking.\n\nAt this moment, they seemed to forget that they were currently in the Human Realm, as if they had returned to Hell, to that dark and sunless place.\n\nIn the Human Realm,\n\nThey were mysterious beings existing beyond human sight, existing in tales of the strange and myths, not much different from the old immortals on high mountains. In fact, they were more down-to-earth, and people feared them like tigers!\n\nBut in the Underworld, in Hell, they were merely the lowest-ranking civil servants.\n\nAt the same time as the cat's meow,\n\nThe red in Liang Chuan's eyes, which had previously dimmed, gradually returned. No more blood flowed from his eye sockets; what needed to flow had already dried up, but that deep crimson still re-condensed,\n\nEven,\n\nMore intensely than before!\n\nTonight's theme,\n\nWas revenge,\n\nPreviously,\n\nThat was the prelude!\n\nNow,\n\nIs the true movement!\n\nMy departed friends,\n\nI will carry your souls,\n\nTo witness everything tonight!\n\nMy blood has run dry,\n\nNow,\n\nIt's your turn to bleed…\n\nHis ten fingers twitched again, pale, slender knuckles twisting and dancing. He was playing, he was performing, in the dead of midnight, he was unleashing his own musical notes.\n\nAll the listeners,\n\nMust die!\n\nAmong the Hell Guards, three more suddenly had their eyes turn crimson, and then, without hesitation, they attacked their comrades beside them.\n\nYou arrested me,\n\nYou threatened the lives of those around me, forcing me,\n\nYou thought you stood on the side of justice,\n\nYou were arrogant,\n\nYou looked down on a lowly ant like me who returned as a smuggler,\n\nYou thought yourselves to be superior,\n\nYou thought yourselves incomparably noble,\n\nYou thought your will was correct,\n\nThen today,\n\nI'd like to see,\n\nJust how noble,\n\nYou,\n\nCan truly be!\n\nI want to see,\n\nWill you cry?\n\nWill you feel pain?\n\nWill you panic?\n\nAre you,\n\nAfter all, just like ordinary people,\n\nAnd after stripping away your glamorous facade and status,\n\nDo you,\n\nAlso possess fear!\n\nHis ten fingers interlaced, the frequency of their trembling doubled from before, and the notes of death poured out. Inside the Underworld Shop, the Hell Guards descended into chaos, beginning to slaughter each other.\n\nOne person, a second ago, was controlled and struck a blow at their comrade,\n\nBut in the very next second,\n\nThey broke free of the control, and while still disoriented, the comrade who had just been attacked retaliated.\n\nOne after another, the Hell Guards at this moment seemed to have become puppets on strings before Liang Chuan.\n\nHe could move whichever he wanted,\n\nHe could play with whichever he wanted,\n\nHe could mess with whichever he wanted,\n\nTo mock you,\n\nTo toy with you,\n\nTo watch you kill each other in fear and bewilderment,\n\nThis is my,\n\nGift to you!\n\nYou said I wanted to become a Judge of the Underworld, committing a great taboo,\n\nThen today,\n\nAs you wished,\n\nI will judge your lives and deaths!\n\nIn the corner of the Underworld Shop, the little girl was licking her wounds with her tongue,\n\nWatching all of this with wide eyes,\n\nShe saw her comrades in front of her fiercely slaughtering each other, without mercy,\n\nShe saw the crimson in their eyes flickering constantly,\n\nShe saw the man they were pursuing leaning against the doorframe,\n\nHis gaze crimson,\n\nYet a smile on his lips,\n\nEnjoying it all!\n\nEverything felt so unreal, so utterly despairing,\n\nThis is a dream,\n\nThis must be a dream,\n\nI must be dreaming,\n\nMust be dreaming!\n\nYes,\n\nThis isn't real,\n\nThis definitely isn't real,\n\nHow, could this possibly be real!\n\nIf Zhou Ze were also here at this moment, seeing the little girl completely terrified and stunned, he would probably feel an immense sense of irony. The little girl, who had previously been the biggest threat in his eyes,\n\nWas now truly scared into a common, naive loli,\n\nCowering there,\n\nTrembling.\n\nUnfortunately, she was a soul body, without a physical body,\n\nOtherwise, if Zhou Ze were here, he could even lift her skirt to see if she would be scared to pee herself.\n\nOf course, in Tongcheng, over two thousand kilometers from Rongcheng, Zhou Ze was not entirely without sensation. The mark on his right palm continuously throbbed with a stinging pain, so unbearable that Zhou Ze could only clench his fist.\n\nAlthough he wasn't sure what exactly was happening,\n\nZhou Ze had a premonition,\n\nThat the little girl who would bring him trouble if she returned to Tongcheng was now in immense trouble. The key to the Gate of Hell she had left him was shifting, meaning she was gradually losing control over this key!\n\nOnce she truly couldn't return,\n\nThis key,\n\nWould be his, and completely… entirely his!\n\nWith the ID in hand and the key also in hand,\n\nHe would be a legitimate Hell Guard!\n\n...\n\nRongcheng,\n\nOld Street,\n\nChaos,\n\nChaos,\n\nComplete chaos,\n\nThe entire north of the old street,\n\nWas in utter pandemonium.\n\n\"When I enter Hell,\n\nI will walk on a path paved with white bones;\n\nWhen I enter Hell,\n\nI will pluck the most beautiful Mandala flowers;\"\n\nLooking at the scene of madness before him,\n\nLiang Chuan smiled very happily,\n\nHe softly chanted, as if he were the narrator of this insane and tragic farce,\n\nProviding voice-over for this blood-soaked stage play, where the scent of blood was so thick it could almost drip.\n\nHis fingertips were still dancing,\n\nThe melody was still pouring out,\n\nIt wasn't over yet,\n\nIt couldn't stop yet.\n\nThe white cat was already soaked in fresh blood, slowly dyeing its pure white fur red, but the white cat stood there resolutely, beside Liang Chuan.\n\nLiang Chuan's eyes were no longer visible, sunken deep into their sockets, and his entire being had become somewhat emaciated, as if a gust of wind could blow him over.\n\nBut the bloody glow deep within his eye sockets,\n\nStill rippled,\n\nNot enough,\n\nStill not enough,\n\nTruly,\n\nStill not enough!\n\n\"When I enter Hell,\n\nI will drink the most turbid waters of the Yellow Springs;\n\nWhen I enter Hell,\n\nI will traverse endless curses;\n\nWhen I enter Hell,\n\nI will face the void and darkness.\"\n\nThe chanting sounded like a death knell to these Hell Guards, urging them to continually push this internecine battle to a climax, compelling them to more forcefully plunge their weapons into their comrades' bodies.\n\nSouls were shattering,\n\nScreams were echoing,\n\nRoars were bellowing,\n\nThey knew what they were doing,\n\nBut the most painful thing was that they knew what they were doing!!!\n\nThey couldn't stop,\n\nAbsolutely couldn't stop,\n\nThey had lost themselves, and could only, under the man's gaze, complete their actions,\n\nAt this very moment,\n\nThey seemed to truly feel that a Judge of the Underworld stood before them, holding a judgment brush, recounting their sins, sending them to the execution ground!\n\nBut throughout history,\n\nOnly they, the Hell Guards, escorted others into Hell to be fried in oil and collected offerings.\n\nWhen had it ever happened that they themselves were bound and subjected to such cruel torture?\n\nThe slaughter,\n\nContinued,\n\nDespair,\n\nAlso continued to spread.\n\n\"When I enter Hell,\n\nI will be buried in a boundless sea of blood;\n\nWhen I enter Hell,\n\nI will be offered to demons;\n\nWhen I enter Hell,\n\nI will indulge in solitude;\n\nWhen I enter Hell,\n\nI will never look back.\"\n\nThe chanting began to quicken, the rhythm becoming clearer. Liang Chuan became increasingly lost in it, immersed in a non-existent melody, wandering in the atmosphere he had created for himself.\n\nAn ordinary person seeing this would think he had a problem, that he was a mentally ill person amusing himself,\n\nOnly,\n\nThis group of Hell Guards in the Underworld Shop,\n\nTruly experienced this terror and perceived this despair!\n\n\"When I enter Hell,\n\nI will no longer be lost;\n\nWhen I enter Hell,\n\nI will no longer hesitate;\n\nWhen I enter Hell,\n\nI will abandon thought;\n\nWhen I enter Hell,\n\nI will cast aside confusion.\"\n\nThe faceless woman, who had been kneeling in the corner, now slowly began to chant the exact same words as Liang Chuan. She slowly stood up,\n\nShe extended her hand,\n\nPulled back her hair,\n\nHer formerly faceless self,\n\nHer features were slowly emerging.\n\nAt this moment,\n\nThere was no struggle,\n\nNor resistance,\n\nAmidst these chants,\n\nIt seemed many things had already been settled!\n\nHer mouth, split open,\n\nRevealing red lips, a graceful tongue, and pearly teeth, her entire face became clear.\n\nIt was a moving face,\n\nIt was a pretty face,\n\nIt was a young face.\n\nThe woman looked at Liang Chuan, accompanying him in his chanting.\n\nLiang Chuan reached out and patted the woman's head, as if stroking his own younger sister.\n\nHer dream was to become an apostle of Hell; she was devoted to it, consecrated to it,\n\nSo,\n\nHe gave her this opportunity,\n\nThis was her choice, without hesitation, without sorrow, without concern.\n\nThe two looked at each other and continued to chant together:\n\n\"When I enter Hell,\n\nI will bury the past;\n\nWhen I enter Hell,\n\nI will conceal the future,\n\nWhen I enter Hell,\n\nI will no longer exist in the world!\"\n\nAs the chanting reached this point, the white cat had already become a blood-red cat. It had collapsed, unable to support itself, and Liang Chuan slowly sat down, leaning against the doorframe,\n\nUsing his last bit of strength,\n\nHe chanted the final verse:\n\n\"When I enter Hell,\n\nI will ultimately return!\"\n\n\"Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!...\"\n\nThe souls of the Hell Guards,\n\nOne by one, exploded,\n\nOne by one, dissipated into the world,\n\nAs if to draw, for this movement,\n\nIts unique,\n\nRest.",

    "content": "\"Boss, are we doing business today or not?\"\n\nBai Yingying walked up to Zhou Ze, a mournful expression on her face.\n\nZhou Ze smiled, took a sip of water, shook his head, and said, \"They're happy today; let them make a fuss.\"\n\nThen,\n\nZhou Ze saw the hell money and the bloody ink paintings Tang Shi had made on the floor. He looked at Bai Yingying sympathetically and comforted her:\n\n\"Tonight, they'll be responsible for cleaning up.\"\n\n\"Oh, okay!\"\n\nThe silly girl Bai Yingying immediately cheered up.\n\n\"Get me another cup of coffee and a newspaper.\"\n\nZhou Ze rubbed his right palm. The pain was slowly fading, but the sense of belonging to the Key to the Gates of Hell was constantly strengthening. However, this series of stimuli made him feel somewhat mentally fatigued.\n\nHe was already seriously injured and had only recently woken up. His body was still a bit weak and couldn't handle too much exertion.\n\nBai Yingying diligently brought the coffee and newspaper, then scurried upstairs. Since the boss said they weren't opening today, she went back to her room upstairs to play PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds.\n\nShe heard new gun skins had just been released, and she had already decided to pawn another one of her funerary objects to buy them.\n\nIt was a pity that Bluehole didn't know about her existence,\n\nOtherwise, they would really give her an award — a true \"ashes-level\" gamer!\n\nZhou Ze continued to sit by the window, flipping through the newspaper.\n\nThe ruckus on the other side continued. Zhou Ze initially thought no more customers would come, but one actually did.\n\nThis gave Zhou Ze a misconception:\n\nHa,\n\nIs there really someone not afraid of death?\n\nIt was a familiar customer, walking a Corgi. She was Zhou Ze's first client when he opened his old shop. At the time, her beloved dog had gone missing, and with Zhou Ze's help, she found it.\n\nXu Qinglang had originally wanted to show off his twenty-odd apartments to her,\n\nBut she told him her family's resettlement housing was provided by her family's real estate company, which depressed Xu Qinglang for several days. Trying to show off and falling flat on his face naturally didn't feel good.\n\n\"Boss, it's quite lively here, isn't it?\"\n\nThe young woman sat down in front of Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze pushed his coffee towards her. \"Haven't drunk it.\"\n\nThe girl shook her head. \"I don't drink this. What's going on with them?\"\n\nThe girl pointed to Tang Shi and the old Taoist, who were still making a racket.\n\n\"Oh, we just opened, so we hired a circus troupe to liven things up.\"\n\nThe girl smiled, not sure if she believed him or not. She walked over to the counter, poured herself a glass of water, and then walked back, saying:\n\n\"Boss, remember I told you I could invest if you opened a new shop?\"\n\n\"It's a losing business; I'm afraid of implicating you.\"\n\n\"I happened to be passing by today and saw the 'Midnight Bookstore' sign. I hesitated for a moment, but sure enough, you've moved. Alright, this location is pretty good. I just came in to say hello. See you next time.\"\n\nThe girl came and went quickly.\n\nZhou Ze picked up his coffee, took a sip, and continued reading the newspaper, but then he noticed a dark silhouette by his bed.\n\nZhou Ze turned his head and looked out the glass window. An old woman stood there, gaunt and expressionless.\n\nHe reached out and tapped on the window glass. She turned her head and looked over.\n\nStill bewildered.\n\n\"Hey, are you done yet?\"\n\nZhou Ze shouted to Tang Shi and the old Taoist.\n\nThey were nearing the end. The old Taoist was breathless from singing and collapsed on the floor. Tang Shi stopped laughing and crying.\n\nZhou Ze gestured for Tang Shi to look outside his window. Tang Shi understood, went out, and soon, the old woman was forcibly ushered into the shop.\n\n\"Can you send her to hell?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nHe was a bit weak now; the Gates of Hell wouldn't open.\n\n\"The kind where her soul scatters?\"\n\nTang Shi asked.\n\n\"Never mind.\"\n\nZhou Ze looked at the old woman and saw that her eyes were vacant. Except for an initial glance at people, she just stared blankly in one direction.\n\nFollowing her gaze, Zhou Ze found she was staring at the clock hanging on the wall.\n\nA customer had come,\n\nHe wasn't feeling well right now and it was inconvenient to receive her,\n\nBut he couldn't just kick a customer out.\n\n\"Leave her in the shop. Tomorrow, when I've recovered some energy, I'll see if I can open the Gates of Hell and send her down.\"\n\nEvery little bit helps, Zhou Ze wasn't particular and wouldn't let it slip.\n\n\"Who's going to watch her?\"\n\nTang Shi asked.\n\nIn the bookstore, there were only four people who could effectively keep an eye on a ghost.\n\nZhou Ze, Xu Qinglang, Tang Shi, and Bai Yingying. The old Taoist was a half-measure and didn't count.\n\nBut Xu Qinglang had gone back to his hometown today and wasn't here.\n\nZhou Ze was weak and couldn't watch her.\n\nThat left Tang Shi and Bai Yingying. Miss Tang's meaning was for him to call his maid, who was playing games upstairs, down to watch the ghost. She didn't have time to do his odd jobs.\n\nHowever, Bai Yingying had just gone up to play games. Calling her down again now, Zhou Ze felt a little sorry for her.\n\nThis silly girl had even pawned her funerary objects to open a bookstore for him. She was busy with everything, inside and out,\n\nAnd she had to serve him in the bath and sleep with him,\n\nHe really couldn't bear to deprive her of her hobbies.\n\n\"Alright, just leave her here. It doesn't look like she'll run away.\" Zhou Ze could only shrug.\n\n\"Heh heh, the ghosts around will be attracted by you, but they'll quickly realize what kind of place this is, then they'll get scared, start to avoid it, and finally, when you're not paying attention, they'll slip away.\n\nFear of death is human nature, and ghosts are no exception.\"\n\nZhou Ze pointed at the old woman. She was still staring at the clock, saying:\n\n\"I always feel like something's wrong with her brain. Can ghosts get Alzheimer's?\"\n\n\"I haven't done research on that.\"\n\n\"Never mind. If she leaves, she leaves. Since I can't send her directly to hell, I can't just shatter her today, can I? This is a delivery station, not a slaughterhouse.\"\n\n\"Suit yourself.\" Tang Shi prepared to go upstairs.\n\n\"Hey.\" Zhou Ze called out to her.\n\nTang Shi didn't stop, walking faster.\n\nClearly, she knew what Zhou Ze wanted to say, something even more unwilling than watching a ghost!\n\n\"Boss, I feel so good!\"\n\nThe old Taoist got up. He had already turned off his live stream, and the monkey had put down his phone and gone to the counter to find something to eat.\n\n\"Old Taoist, feeling comfortable?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Comfortable, very comfortable. Haven't been this comfortable in a long time.\"\n\nThe old Taoist was so simple that Zhou Ze felt a little sorry for him.\n\nBut Zhou Ze still opened his mouth: \"Clean up the place.\"\n\n\"...\" The old Taoist.\n\nPerhaps it was truly because of Tang Shi and the old Taoist's loud commotion that night, but for the entire latter half of the night, no other customers came, except for the old woman.\n\nZhou Ze leaned on the sofa, playing on his phone for a while, then reading the newspaper. He was currently injured and couldn't move very easily, so he could only obediently rest and recover.\n\nThe old Taoist spent over two hours cleaning the shop, then sat down in front of Zhou Ze, rubbing his back and moaning:\n\n\"Oh, my back, it's gonna break.\"\n\n\"Anyway, you're so old, it doesn't matter if your back isn't good,\" Zhou Ze teased.\n\nThe old Taoist said plaintively, \"I'm old, yes, but just as silkworms spin till death and candles weep till they're naught but ash, at my age, I should help as many fallen women as I can.\n\nPeople, living in this world, need to help each other.\"\n\nZhou Ze couldn't be bothered with the old Taoist's vulgar jokes. He turned his head and craned his neck, only to find the old woman still standing there.\n\nThe old Taoist couldn't see her because he hadn't smeared his eyes with cow's tears, so he didn't know there was an unfamiliar ghost standing in the shop.\n\nAs for Zhou Ze, to be honest, he had been distracted. After experiencing the Temple Goddess Lady Qingyi and the large-scale event with that problematic Ghost Messenger, Zhou Ze honestly didn't pay much attention to these small fry now.\n\nHowever, after a few hours, this old woman was still there.\n\nShe was still standing in her original spot, motionless, just staring at the wall clock.\n\nCould it be that this old lady used to be in the clock business?\n\nBut that's not right,\n\nZhou Ze's wall clock was only a few hundred yuan, a cheap one, not some antique collection. Was it worth looking at for so long?\n\nAt this moment, Bai Yingying came downstairs. She had finished her game and looked very happy, probably because she had gotten a chicken dinner.\n\n\"Boss, should we go upstairs to sleep?\"\n\nThe silly girl was always so straightforward.\n\nThe old Taoist looked at Zhou Ze with some envy,\n\nA strange thought suddenly occurred to him: Do all male ghosts who climb out of hell have such luck with women?\n\nHis previous boss, when he ran a冥店 in Chengdu, also had pretty women coming over punctually every night to sleep with him. At the time, it really made him and Xiaoqiang incredibly envious.\n\nXiaoqiang,\n\nThe old Taoist sighed.\n\n\"Oh, there's someone standing here.\"\n\nBai Yingying saw the old woman, walked up to her, and waved her hand. The old woman remained unmoving, still staring at the time.\n\n\"Hey hey hey, hey hey hey, look at me, if you don't look at me, I'll eat you.\"\n\nBai Yingying poked her head in front of the old woman, but the old woman still didn't react.\n\n\"Boss, did you or that Miss Tang make her stupid?\"\n\n\"She's been like this ever since she came in.\"\n\nZhou Ze forced himself to get up and, with Bai Yingying's support, walked over.\n\nJust then,\n\nThe hour hand reached the six o'clock position,\n\n\"Dong... dong... dong... dong... dong... dong!\"\n\nThe wall clock began to chime,\n\nThe old woman, who had been looking dazed just moments before, suddenly spread her arms and let out a hysterical laugh, which startled Zhou Ze.\n\nNot scared by a ghost,\n\nIt was purely the feeling of someone suddenly shouting behind you when you're walking down the street.\n\n\"Hahahahaha, it's time, it's time!\n\nI can die,\n\nI can die,\n\nI can finally die!\"\n\nThe old woman excitedly jumped up and down on the floor,\n\nAs if she had been freed,\n\nHappy, like a seventy-year-old child.\n\n\"Granny, do you have a screw loose?\" Bai Yingying said, somewhat perplexed. \"You're already dead. Your soul has been out for a long time.\"\n\nThe old woman heard this,\n\nSuddenly paused,\n\nShe looked around incredulously,\n\nShe must have realized that this wasn't her home,\n\nThis was a strange place,\n\nA strange bookstore.\n\nThe old woman pointed to her face, looking at Bai Yingying in confusion:\n\n\"I've been dead for a long time?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Bai Yingying said as a matter of course.\n\nThe old woman suddenly collapsed to the floor,\n\nAnd burst into tears,\n\n\"Dead too soon, it's over, it's over!\n\nDead too soon, dead too soon,\n\nIt's completely over,\n\nIt's all ruined...\"",

    "content": "\"Is there something wrong with her brain?\" Bai Yingying was a little perplexed.\n\nZhou Ze also shook his head. To be honest, he couldn't figure out what was going on. When he was a doctor, he often encountered C-sections scheduled for auspicious dates.\n\nBut he had never heard of someone insisting on dying at a specific time.\n\nShe probably lay in her hospital bed, staring at the clock at home, counting down to when she would breathe her last.\n\nGiven how much the old woman was crying and wailing, it definitely wasn't an act. She was already dead, what was there to pretend about? Who was she being hypocritical for?\n\nHowever, her incessant crying was starting to irritate Zhou Ze. The old Taoist couldn't hear it, but he could. His sleep quality was already poor; how was he supposed to rest later with this noise?\n\nZhou Ze didn't have a compassionate heart, and his conscience had been eaten by himself not long ago.\n\nThe old woman's crying wouldn't elicit any sympathy from Zhou Ze, only annoyance.\n\n\"Scare her a bit, make her shut up,\" Zhou Ze gestured to Bai Yingying.\n\nBai Yingying nodded, revealing her fangs. The aura of a zombie instantly manifested, and the old woman indeed stopped crying. She was terrified.\n\nAt the same time, the old woman's obsession was slowly dissipating.\n\nOrdinary wandering souls linger in the human world solely by a wisp of obsession. Once that obsession dissipates, they naturally return to where they belong.\n\nWhat the Ghost Messengers need to apprehend and send to hell are those souls whose obsessions are difficult to dissipate or who turn into vengeful spirits. These are the \"achievements.\"\n\nIn other words,\n\nIf Zhou Ze had sent the old woman away before, it would have counted as an achievement, albeit a small one, like a mosquito's leg of meat.\n\nBut now, the old woman could return to hell by herself. Even if Zhou Ze risked his wound rupturing or fainting to open a Hell Gate for her, it would be a thankless effort, like giving her an express ride, and he wouldn't gain any benefit himself.\n\nThe old woman's soul was slowly dissipating, gradually sinking into the ground.\n\n\"Boss, why is your hand trembling?\"\n\nBai Yingying, who had been supporting Zhou Ze, sensed his abnormality.\n\n\"It pains me.\"\n\nZhou Ze uttered these two words.\n\nHe finally understood the little loli's warning about the potential consequences of keeping Bai Yingying by his side. Some ghosts attracted to him would get scared by the zombie and immediately enlighten themselves, meekly heading to hell without a fuss.\n\nWhat would be left for him to do then?\n\nOf course, this was something that couldn't be forcibly reversed, and today's surprises had already come: the key to the Hell Gate and the news that the little loli might have had a major accident, which was far more significant than the achievement of one wandering soul.\n\nThis sleep was quite peaceful.\n\nWhen Zhou Ze woke up the next day, he found that some of his strength had returned, and he wasn't as weak as yesterday. Without waiting for Bai Yingying to help him, Zhou Ze propped himself up with his hands and stood.\n\nThough a bit shaky, he was standing nonetheless.\n\n\"Boss, are you alright?\"\n\nBai Yingying was quite worried, fearing Zhou Ze might suddenly fall, especially when he gestured for her not to help him down the stairs.\n\nWith Zhou Ze's current physical condition, he was much like an elderly person with unsteady legs.\n\nBai Yingying was genuinely concerned that if Zhou Ze fell, he might break an arm or a leg, or even more exaggeratedly, become paralyzed. The old Taoist's intellectually-challenged electric \"woo-woo-woo\" wheelchair might actually come in handy then.\n\nEarly in the morning, the female corpse's thoughts were a bit scattered.\n\nShe began to automatically imagine her boss sitting in an electric wheelchair, \"woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-ing\" along,\n\nand even sucking on a pacifier.\n\nIt was truly...\n\n\"Hahahahaha...\"\n\nLaughing,\n\nBai Yingying stopped. She saw Zhou Ze turn his head to look at her.\n\n\"Zombie transformation?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nBai Yingying shook her head.\n\n\"Corpse dementia?\" Zhou Ze asked again.\n\nBai Yingying immediately shook her head again.\n\nShe also didn't dare to voice the scene she had just secretly imagined, otherwise, once the boss recovered, he would surely stab her to death.\n\nMm,\n\nStab with his fingernails.\n\nZhou Ze felt that his maid seemed to have a screw loose this early morning, and said again,\n\n\"Give me two barks.\"\n\n\"Yingyingying.\"\n\nOh, normal again.\n\nSlowly holding onto the stairs to go down, Zhou Ze had a sense of accomplishment akin to learning to walk as a child. To be honest, he never wanted to experience that drunken blackout feeling again.\n\nThe pleasure was temporary, instantaneous, followed by an extremely long period of weakness and lethargy.\n\nIt was like overindulging in \"that stuff\" where you're full of vigor in bed all night, seven times,\n\nOnly to wake up the next day with a weak back and knees, and possibly even a sudden stroke.\n\nThe old Taoist was already up. No matter how late he went to bed, he always rose early. He had a fixed schedule and would even practice a set of martial arts in the morning.\n\nAs a kind-hearted old Taoist dedicated to activities concerning fallen women,\n\nHe understood the importance of maintaining his physical health.\n\nWhen Zhou Ze came down, the old Taoist had already finished his exercises and was chatting with the little monkey.\n\nThe old Taoist held some black mud in his hand, and there was a large bag of it on the ground.\n\nZhou Ze frowned slightly.\n\nThat was the stuff the little monkey had smeared on his wounds when he was injured. It was remarkably effective, no less than the \"Black Jade Ointment\" from martial arts novels.\n\nIt just smelled a bit foul, and for a clean freak like Zhou Ze, having several layers of mud smeared on him was nothing short of torture.\n\nBut then,\n\nAn even more shocking and torturous scene appeared.\n\nThe old Taoist brought the plastic bag filled with mud close to the little monkey.\n\nMore precisely, he brought it close to the little monkey's crotch,\n\nWhile making \"shoo shoo shoo shoo...\" sounds with his mouth.\n\n\"Little ancestor,\n\nQuick, pee,\n\nNow we're counting on this stuff to get rich,\n\nGood boy,\n\nQuick, pee, good boy, shoo shoo shoo shoo...\"\n\nZhou Ze's face turned black.\n\nThe mud smeared on his body,\n\nActually,\n\nActually,\n\nActually came from this!\n\n\"Ouch!\"\n\nBai Yingying was quick, catching Zhou Ze just as he was about to fall.\n\nThe old Taoist heard the commotion and turned his head,\n\nHe flashed Zhou Ze a smile as bright as the big sun outside, waving the black mud in one hand as he greeted,\n\n\"Boss, good morning!\"\n\nHeaven help him,\n\nIf Zhou Ze hadn't been injured coincidentally recently,\n\nThe old Taoist really didn't know how many times he would have already died.\n\n…………\n\nFrom noon to afternoon, the bookstore usually didn't open for business. This bookstore, located in the prime real estate of the South Street city center, was just that whimsical, that high-class!\n\nHowever, if a customer came in, wanting to buy books, read, or have drinks, they wouldn't be turned away.\n\nBut Xu Qinglang had previously hung a sign to reduce his workload:\n\n\"Minimum consumption 100 RMB.\"\n\nThis was enough to deter eighty or ninety percent of potential customers.\n\nZhou Ze let it be; with fewer casual people, everyone's workload would be lighter.\n\nOf course, there were also wealthy patrons who didn't care about money. Just as Zhou Ze finished his meal and was struggling with the nausea in his body, a middle-aged man with a slicked-back hairstyle and a yellow jacket walked in.\n\nHe seemed quite pleased with the store's quietness. After ordering a glass of ice water, he took out his laptop and sat on the sofa to work.\n\nSoon after,\n\nHis laptop seemed to be on public playback,\n\nAnd a voice rang out:\n\n\"Macau's first online casino is now live! Beautiful dealers dealing cards online...\"\n\nThe old Taoist understood the implied meaning of the music,\n\nHis ears twitched, and he immediately moved closer,\n\nAs if he had found a kindred spirit.\n\nBut when he saw the screen, the old Taoist was dumbfounded. Where were the promised Japanese educational action films? What the hell were all these chips on the screen?\n\n\"Do you also play online gambling?\"\n\nThe man asked, looking at the old Taoist who had approached with interest.\n\nWhat kind of person was the old Taoist? He could become sworn brothers with a monkey.\n\nHe could trick adorable viewers in the live stream into buying冥币 (hell money) from him,\n\nAnd he could trick coal bosses from Liaoning into transporting coal to Shanxi to sell.\n\nHe immediately said:\n\n\"Yeah, I play occasionally, but not for big stakes. It's not really that interesting, not exciting.\n\nI usually like to go to Macau to relax.\"\n\nAs the old Taoist spoke, he even picked his ear with his pinky finger,\n\nLooking utterly unconcerned!\n\nAt the same time, the old Taoist also signaled the little monkey to lean forward, and he reached out to stroke it.\n\nThis pretense,\n\nSee that?\n\nA golden snub-nosed monkey, a protected national animal, is my pet.\n\nIsn't that just as good as those Arab tycoons keeping leopards?\n\nThe man was initially taken aback. There was no way to know if what the old Taoist had bragged about was true, but this golden snub-nosed monkey was certainly real.\n\nAnd running a bookstore like this in the city center of South Street meant either being insane or having so much money that one was simply playing a life simulation game.\n\nSuddenly, the man became enthusiastic towards the old Taoist, warmly inviting him to sit next to him and giving him a detailed introduction to how his website worked.\n\nZhou Ze listened from the side, then took out his phone, wondering whether to call the police.\n\nMost online gambling in China were scams, tricking people into depositing money, letting them win some first, then fattening them up like pigs to be slaughtered. It was essentially the same old tricks from ancient gambling houses, but countless people still fell for it.\n\nBecause no matter how the tricks changed, it didn't really matter,\n\nThe key was the human heart's greed; it was passed down through generations and couldn't be changed.\n\nBut the conversation that followed made Zhou Ze temporarily put away his phone and not call the police.\n\nBecause the old Taoist maintained his high-class demeanor,\n\nHe showed disdain for common gambling methods like \"Shi Shi Cai\" (a type of lottery) and others, which made the man, in an effort to hook this eccentric wealthy client, go all out.\n\nFinally, he said:\n\n\"There's a truly exciting project, but I don't know if you, boss, dare to play it?\"\n\n\"Hmph, I even dare to bathe ghosts, so I'm not afraid of your 'exciting project'!\"\n\nThis, someone could attest to,\n\nThe old Taoist wasn't bragging.\n\n\"Tell me, what do you gamble on?\" the old Taoist urged.\n\nThe man hesitated for a moment but then spoke:\n\n\"Lives!\"\n\nSuddenly,\n\nZhou Ze, who was sipping coffee and listening to the conversation, felt his spoon tremble slightly.\n\nIn his mind, he saw the old woman from last night, standing in the shop, staring intently at the clock, unaware she was already dead,\n\nAnd that sacrificing police officer he had personally sent down,\n\nWho, before leaving, told him that the gambling syndicate he was investigating,\n\nDidn't gamble on anything else,\n\nNor played anything else,\n\nBut,\n\nGambled with lives!",

    "content": "\"Gambling with your life?\n\nLike underground boxing, where you sign a waiver of life and death?\"\n\n\"No, not that kind, boss. I can guarantee you've never seen anything like it.\"\n\nThe old Daoist priest grew interested. He had wandered half his life, a seasoned traveler of the Jianghu. Though clad in Daoist robes and hailing from a family of Daoist priests, in his generation, what kind of low-class or unorthodox things hadn't he seen?\n\nEven if he hadn't eaten pork, surely he had seen a pig run?\n\n\"Heh heh, tell me then. I truly don't believe there's anything I haven't seen.\"\n\nThe old Daoist priest, with an air of ethereal grace, hitched up his robes.\n\n\"Just so you know, our minimum investment here is 50,000 yuan.\" The man looked at the old Daoist. \"You don't have to worry about me swindling your money. Our industry is very, very big now, and we only take a commission. So whether you win or lose, our platform is always profitable.\"\n\nThe old Daoist grunted, clearly unwilling to part with that money.\n\nHe had engaged in his fair share of trickery and deceit, so he naturally didn't want to be swindled in his old age. Moreover, he was very fond of his money pouch.\n\n\"I'm interested,\" Zhou Ze suddenly spoke.\n\nYes,\n\nHe was interested.\n\nWhether it was the old woman from last night,\n\nOr the good police officer he had sent to Hell,\n\nBoth had, either indirectly or directly, used the phrase \"gambling with your life.\"\n\nZhou Ze genuinely wanted to see what kind of game this \"gambling with your life\" truly was.\n\nIn his domain, five or six souls had already entered Hell because of this \"life-gambling\" matter.\n\nWhat,\n\nExactly, was this game?\n\nThe man glanced at Zhou Ze, who sat there looking somewhat sickly.\n\nHis disdain was palpable.\n\nHe looked good, quite handsome,\n\nBut clearly, he was just a bookstore clerk.\n\nYou're interested,\n\nHeh heh,\n\nDo you have money?\n\nHe didn't say it outright,\n\nBut his expression and gaze made it abundantly clear.\n\nYou, fellow, are obviously broke.\n\nI've seen countless people; could I be wrong?\n\nZhou Ze licked his lips,\n\nWanting to smile to ease the awkwardness,\n\nThen suddenly felt that smiling at this moment, with Bai Yingying and the old Daoist present, might be even more awkward;\n\nBut this feeling of not knowing whether to smile or not,\n\nWas actually even more awkward...\n\nThen,\n\nSo annoying,\n\nI really want to send you to Hell,\n\nHow dare you make me awkward!\n\nThe old Daoist saw that his boss's expression was starting to change, and his heart immediately skipped a beat.\n\nAs a seasoned Daoist who had served two \"ghost bosses,\" he had ample experience in flattering ghosts!\n\nImmediately,\n\nHe slammed the table,\n\nAnd said directly:\n\n\"Dammit, it's just 50,000 yuan, just pocket change, no problem at all;\n\nDon't you dare look down on people with your dog's eyes. I'll transfer the money to you, and I'm not afraid of you trying to fool me.\n\nAnyone who dares to fool me,\n\nI have ways to send them to Hell!\"\n\nThe old Daoist smiled, revealing his white teeth.\n\n\"Alright, to Hell it is.\" The man took out his phone. \"I'll open an account for you first. Just deposit the money.\"\n\nThe man didn't find the threat of Hell unusual; he thought the old Daoist was using underworld slang, meaning \"if you fool me, I'll have you killed.\"\n\nThe man probably never dreamed that,\n\nIn this bookstore,\n\nHelping people go to Hell,\n\nWas actually a genuine revenue-generating service.\n\n\"Open two accounts. I'll transfer 100,000 to you.\"\n\nThe old Daoist transferred the money without hesitation, then leaned over to Zhou Ze, grinning obsequiously, inviting his boss to see what this life-gambling game was all about.\n\nHe really wasn't afraid of this guy reneging on the deal.\n\nAs the saying goes,\n\nIt's easy to meet the King of Hell, but hard to deal with the little devils.\n\nOf course, these words couldn't be spoken in front of the boss, otherwise, he probably wouldn't even know how he died.\n\nUnfortunately, the old Daoist didn't know that over the past two days, by eagerly volunteering to scrub Zhou Ze's back, then offering an electric wheelchair, and then playing with mud, he had already walked on the edge of death several times.\n\n\"Where did you get so much money?\"\n\nZhou Ze asked.\n\n\"I started streaming again. I got a lot of tips yesterday,\" the old Daoist explained.\n\nThis world is problematic,\n\nTruly very problematic!\n\nEven as calm and steady as Doctor Zhou, he couldn't help but fall into deep thought.\n\nHis neighbor Xu Qinglang was very rich,\n\nHis maid was very rich,\n\nHis wife was very rich,\n\nAnd now,\n\nThe old Daoist he took in could easily produce 100,000 yuan!\n\nThen he looked at himself, still in debt.\n\nThe man was happy to have attracted two more customers. He immediately turned his laptop towards them and began a detailed explanation of the rules and specific gameplay, while saying:\n\n\"Don't worry, this game is absolutely thrilling. This is a high-end game truly for the rich, because in this game, you can gamble with human lives, deciding life and death.\n\nHow about that,\n\nDoesn't it feel like being a Ghost Messenger?\"\n\nThe man made a joke, thinking himself witty and humorous.\n\nThe old Daoist's mouth twitched upon hearing that.\n\n\"Heh.\" Zhou Ze.\n\n..................\n\n\"Boss, we really should have brought Bai Yingying. It would be more convenient for her to serve you.\"\n\nThe old Daoist was very sensible this time. He let Zhou Ze walk with his cane and didn't foolishly volunteer to carry Zhou Ze on his back again.\n\n\"If she came, there'd be no one to watch the bookstore,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\n\"Ah, isn't there Miss Tang?\"\n\n\"Her watching the store?\"\n\nZhou Ze looked at the old Daoist,\n\nThe old Daoist looked at Zhou Ze,\n\nBoth shook their heads in silence,\n\nAlright,\n\nNo need to say more,\n\nEverything was understood without words.\n\nImagine Miss Tang Shi alone watching the store,\n\nIt's likely that if an irritable customer came in demanding coffee or hurrying to buy a book,\n\nA pen might immediately fly over and pierce them into a honeycomb.\n\n\"Boss, be careful ahead, it's a bit bumpy.\"\n\nZhou Ze leaned on his cane, looking around.\n\nThis was a spot in Tongcheng's urban area, not very remote, but a bit far from the city center, and it was in the old district. Here, several small clinics and hospitals operated, along with many inns.\n\nOf course, these small hospitals didn't look very legitimate.\n\nThere weren't many people coming and going on the street. If one had a sensitive nose, they could even smell disinfectant. All in all, the place gave off an uncomfortable feeling.\n\n\"The address is this way, right?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Yes, it should be here.\"\n\nThe two walked into the alley. Inside, the alley was a world of its own, with many doors. Zhou Ze and the old Daoist knocked on a door with a \"203\" sign.\n\nSoon, a middle-aged man opened the door. He had a cigarette in his mouth and eyed Zhou Ze and the old Daoist with scrutiny.\n\n\"Let me see the account,\" the middle-aged man said.\n\n\"Here.\" The old Daoist handed him his phone.\n\nThe man verified it, nodded, and smiled, \"You've already placed your bets, haven't even seen it yet?\"\n\n\"That's why we came to see it,\" the old Daoist explained.\n\n\"Alright, come in.\"\n\nThe middle-aged man stepped aside, coughed, spat a thick gob of phlegm onto the ground, then wiped his snot with the back of his hand.\n\nZhou Ze and the old Daoist entered. It was a cramped space, with a spring bed, and many instruments placed beside it, somewhat resembling a hospital's intensive care unit, though far more rudimentary.\n\nAt the corner of the wall, two cameras were installed, monitoring every corner of the room in all directions.\n\nAn old man lay there, extremely emaciated, like a mummy in a pyramid. Even his skin had turned dark brown.\n\nA bed,\n\nAn old man,\n\nProfoundly exemplified an idiom— \"oil runs out, lamp goes out\" (meaning on the verge of death).\n\nOn the bedside table sat half a bowl of thin gruel.\n\nThe old man squinted, opening his eyes occasionally, but paid no attention to Zhou Ze and the old Daoist who had entered. He seemed used to it; people probably came in to see him often.\n\nTo see him,\n\nWhen he would finally die.\n\nHe was the subject of many people's bets.\n\nMany had already bet online on how much longer this old man would live.\n\nA month? Two months? Three months?\n\nThe odds changed periodically, just like betting on football matches.\n\nDuring this period, the old man was not allowed to receive any treatment. The instruments here were only for monitoring his physical condition, generating data reports that were uploaded daily to the platform for those who had bet and those who were about to bet to review and analyze.\n\nAt the same time, those who had placed bets had the right to come and see the old man's condition in person,\n\nAfter all, what is learned from books is superficial; one must practice to truly know.\n\nIs it absurd?\n\nNo,\n\nIt's not absurd.\n\nThe old man was looking at the clock.\n\nOn the wall, where he could see it as soon as he opened his eyes, there was a digital clock displaying the date and time.\n\nOn him,\n\nZhou Ze saw a trace of the old woman's expression from last night.\n\n\"Boss, what disease does he have?\" The old Daoist knew Zhou Ze used to be a doctor and should be able to tell accurately.\n\n\"Cancer, late stage,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\n\"Oh, an incurable disease.\"\n\n\"It's incurable, but with proper treatment, his life could be prolonged, and at the very least, his suffering could be reduced.\"\n\nClearly, this old man would not receive any treatment, because the platform's detailed rules stated that any treatment would constitute a breach of contract.\n\n\"Have you seen enough, gentlemen?\"\n\nThe man approached, holding a bowl of instant noodles.\n\n\"Let's go,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Go?\" The old Daoist was somewhat confused.\n\nHow could they just leave?\n\nDamn it,\n\nHelp him!\n\nThis was real life-gambling.\n\nJust letting people watch someone die in plain sight!\n\n\"Why not leave? He knows what we're here for,\" Zhou Ze pointed to the old man.\n\nClearly,\n\nThe old man knew he had been abandoned for treatment,\n\nAnd,\n\nHe understood why he and the old Daoist, and others, came to see him every day.\n\nJust like that old woman,\n\nThey all understood.\n\nIn fact,\n\nThey were even cooperating,\n\nLike the old woman, who kept holding on to die on that specific day. This was her obsession, which caused her to become a wandering soul and enter the bookstore after she died, without realizing she was already dead.\n\n\"This...\"\n\nThe old Daoist still felt uneasy in his conscience, but he followed his boss out anyway.\n\nAs they reached the doorway,\n\nThe middle-aged man leaned against the wall, slurping his instant noodles, and called out, \"Hey, want to know some inside info?\"\n\n\"What inside info?\" the old Daoist turned his head to ask.\n\nThe middle-aged man rubbed his fingers together,\n\nHis meaning was clear: to get inside info, you had to spend more money.\n\n\"You can increase your bets, it's actually not a loss.\"\n\nThe man reminded them kindly.\n\n\"Hey, who are you to him? Why should we believe you?\" the old Daoist countered.\n\nIn his eyes, the man was just a doorkeeper, a caregiver.\n\n\"I've also placed a bet.\"\n\nThe man took a sip of noodle soup, then gestured with his chin towards the room,\n\nAnd said:\n\n\"He's my father.\"",

    "content": "First subscription of twenty thousand<sup>1</sup>,\n\nIt's the best result Long has had since he started writing.\n\nThank you all for your support!\n\nFor a niche supernatural novel to achieve this result, Long is already proud enough.\n\nOur first subscription has already broken the original highest first subscription record for supernatural novels by five times.\n\nFive times!\n\nHere, I want to thank the senior authors who encouraged me back then, thank Brother Bu Zheng, Brother Zhou Zi, Brother Xiao Qi, Brother Nai Qi, Sister Xuan Shui, and other brothers. When Long was most lost, they either comforted him or actively promoted his chapters.\n\nActually, many of the elder brothers and seniors who specifically came to encourage Long were people Long didn't know or were unfamiliar with before, and had never interacted with.\n\nTherefore, it's easy to add to a splendor<sup>2</sup>, but Long will never forget the kindness of sending charcoal in the snow<sup>3</sup>.\n\nI also want to thank Brother Yi Suo, the editor of the supernatural genre, Sister Zhu Sha, the responsible editor, and Brother Zi Liang.\n\nI still remember when I stumbled last time, it was before the Chinese New Year.\n\nOriginally, it was agreed with the supernatural editors to release the new book after the New Year, but Long unilaterally changed his decision.\n\nWithout a book in hand, my heart felt panicked, as if life had lost its purpose. I couldn't just browse the comment sections or read the chapter discussions. I felt very lost and uneasy.\n\nThen Long called the editor and said, \"I want to publish my book.\"\n\nAt that time, the esteemed editors were already at the airport, preparing to go home for the New Year holiday. They called to help Long make new arrangements, which almost delayed their trip. Ultimately, Long was able to publish the book before the New Year.\n\nAt that time, Long made a promise: \"Let me publish the book. I can't guarantee anything else, but the only thing I can guarantee is that no matter how unpopular the supernatural category was before, my new book will have a first subscription of ten thousand!\"\n\nAs a dead otaku, referred to by readers as \"Fat Long,\"\n\nHonestly,\n\nThis fat slob, besides writing books and stories, really has no other special skills.\n\nThank you to my old readers for your continuous companionship, and thank you to the new readers for joining and supporting me.\n\nI stumbled once two months ago, but this time, Long got back up, and he stands twice as high as last time.\n\nThis is all due to everyone's great affection for Long.\n\nLong can only repay everyone with better stories.\n\nMany people ask Long if he's competing for the monthly ticket rankings.\n\nTo be honest, Long can't compete anymore. Since the later stages of \"Horror Broadcast,\" Long's spirit has been very fatigued, and his body has subtly started to show some problems. Then, in the past few months, there have been many things and many twists and turns. Two new book periods are no less than two Gaokao exams.\n\nAfter dealing with the matters of these few days since going on shelves, Long still needs to go to the hospital.\n\nI'm tired, truly a bit tired. During the new book period of \"Late Night Book House,\" Long more than once experienced back pain while sitting in a chair and sudden nosebleeds.\n\nThis body, after all, isn't made of iron.\n\nHowever, at the time, I thought, even if I died and lay in a coffin, I'd still vigorously knock on the coffin lid a few times and shout:\n\n\"Tell me the first subscription results after it's on shelves, otherwise I won't rest in peace.\"\n\nFor the first two chapters on shelves, some readers might feel the style is a bit different from before. Actually, that was Long's own catharsis.\n\nA breath held for two months, at that moment, Long released and vented it.\n\nIf I didn't vent it, it would be unbearable!\n\nLong also knows that many old readers, like him, also need to vent.\n\nSaying this isn't to evoke pity in order to better compete for the monthly ticket rankings.\n\nWhat Long wants to say is that he doesn't plan to compete for the monthly ticket rankings anymore.\n\nLong's biggest period of growth was during the writing of \"Horror Broadcast.\" Every day, he focused on writing good chapters and publishing them. For an entire year, he didn't compete on any rankings or publish single chapters; he just concentrated on how to write stories and how to improve his writing skills, and then he wrote Uncle Fugui,\n\nHe wrote \"Life and death are determined by fate, wealth and honor by heaven.\"<sup>4</sup>\n\nIn fact, sometimes Long even hesitates to post the concluding remarks at the end of a chapter, fearing it might affect everyone's reading experience.\n\n\"Late Night Book House,\"\n\nThe title has already set the tone of the book.\n\nThis is a book house that opens in the dead of night,\n\nIt's a story that happens in the quiet of the night.\n\n\"Listen to it as a rumor, as I have heard\"<sup>5</sup>,\n\nThe stories told in the book are also things Long has heard secondhand. I'll just retell them to everyone in a different way. Don't take them too seriously; just listen casually, treat them as a diversion, a way to pass the time.\n\nSo, let's try our best not to disrupt this atmosphere.\n\nLong also doesn't want to lose his balance for the sake of competing for rankings, or write poorly paced or bad stories just to push for more updates.\n\nMonthly tickets, I will still ask for them. If you have monthly tickets, just cast them for Long. For example, for this month's \"New Book\" monthly ticket ranking, we are determined to secure the first place.\n\nAs for other things, like competing for the overall ranking, that's up to everyone spontaneously. If you have a vote, just cast it for Long. If you enjoy it, feel free to give a reward.\n\nA cent or a yuan is also love,\n\nA helmsman<sup>6</sup> or an alliance leader<sup>7</sup> is also affection,\n\nOf course, the more the merrier.\n\nAfter this,\n\nLong plans to seclude himself, ignore everything, and just focus on writing stories, and everyone can just focus on reading them.\n\nMay the years be peaceful,\n\nMay the book house's performance get better and better,\n\nFinally,\n\nI wish everyone good health.\n\n<sup>1</sup> Refers to the number of initial subscribers to a serialized web novel.

    "content": "“He’s my old man.”\n\nA light, airy sentence,\nbut it seemed to have a deafening effect.\n\nThe middle-aged man took out a cigarette from his pocket, lit one for himself, and offered one each to Zhou Ze and the old Taoist.\n\nThe old Taoist remained blankly still.\n\nZhou Ze, however, calmly took the cigarette and lit it.\n\n“So, have you thought about it?” the middle-aged man continued to persuade. “Don’t worry, I won’t scam you. I can show you the orders I’ve placed. Then you can just place your orders at the same time as me.”\n\n“You’re a good son,” Zhou Ze said, exhaling a smoke ring.\n\nThe middle-aged man frowned slightly and sneered, “Are you in on this deal or not? Speak.”\n\nHe wasn't stupid; he could obviously hear the sarcasm in Zhou Ze's words.\n\n“Why not?” Zhou Ze said.\n\n“Good, five thousand, not expensive, right? You’ve already bet a hundred thousand. Two orders, a hundred thousand. Another five thousand will guarantee your profit.”\n\nWhen money was mentioned, the middle-aged man began to get excited, completely disregarding Zhou Ze’s previous mockery.\n\n“What if your old man doesn’t make it?” Zhou Ze asked.\n\n“How could that happen? He’s my old man, and he knows I’ve bet on him too. Don’t worry, I’ll cheer him on, make him hold on. Even if he dies, he’ll have gotten something first.”\n\nThe middle-aged man had a look of everything-under-control,\nas if at this moment,\nfather and son were truly connected,\nand a thick father-son bond permeated the air, moving and astonishing those who witnessed it.\n\n“When a person dies is unpredictable,” Zhou Ze reminded him. “Even a *gui chai* cannot pinpoint it.”\n\n*Gui chai* cannot casually take a living person’s life. Of course, it’s not impossible, but the cost is too great. A slight misstep could lead to eternal damnation.\n\n“Heh heh, if you have the guts, tell the *gui chai* to come take my old man now.”\n\nThe middle-aged man spat out another wad of phlegm, then took out his phone.\n“You can just transfer the money to me directly. Once the money’s transferred, I’ll show you my orders right away.”\n\n“This humble Taoist will transfer your mother’s *cao hai*!”\n\nThe old Taoist directly clenched his fist and slammed it toward the man’s forehead.\n\n*Bang!*\n\nThe middle-aged man was stunned by the punch and fell to the ground. He tried to get up and resist, but the old Taoist stared at him with eyes like a glaring ox.\n\nHe cowered.\nYou really can’t expect a man who relies on his father’s life to get rich to have much backbone or spirit.\n\n“You wait, you hit me, didn’t you? I’m calling the police!”\n\nThe man immediately reached for his phone that had fallen to the ground.\n\n“Call them. We’ll wait,” Zhou Ze said.\n\nThe man’s eyelids twitched. He didn’t dare to call the police, truly didn’t. At the moment, he picked up his phone, glared fiercely at the old Taoist, then walked into the house, shut the door, and locked it from the inside.\n\nThe old Taoist let out a long breath, turned around somewhat dejectedly, looked at Zhou Ze, and said,\n“Boss, I’m sorry, this humble Taoist got carried away.”\n\n“It’s fine,” Zhou Ze said indifferently, asking, “Why did you suddenly get so agitated?”\n\n“The biggest regret of this humble Taoist’s life is that when my father died, I was away in another city and didn’t make it back in time to see him one last time.\n\nThat brat’s words really disgusted this humble Taoist. He’s a complete beast; his conscience must have been eaten by dogs, earning money off his own father’s life.”\n\nZhou Ze flicked the ash off his cigarette and said nothing.\n\n“Boss, don’t you feel anything else?” the old Taoist asked, pressing his lips together. “Anyone would be annoyed by such a beast, right?”\n\n“I’m an orphan.”\n\n“…………” the old Taoist.\n\nZhou Ze smiled, exhaling a smoke ring, and said, “Actually, I’ve seen many similar things in hospitals. At first, I couldn’t understand it either,\n\nand I was even very angry.\n\nA long illness makes a child unfilial—of course, there are many unfilial children, but the vast majority of people actually want to cure their family members.\n\nAlthough national medical insurance and rural social security are becoming widespread, and medical conditions are improving year by year, if someone truly suffers from a terminal or serious illness, it’s like pouring money into a bottomless pit.”\n\nZhou Ze flicked the cigarette butt from his hand, making a “throwing” motion.\n\n“Human lives are more important than money,” the old Taoist still insisted on his view.\n\n“Human lives are indeed more important than money. ‘Life is priceless’ is indeed a well-known slogan, but the value of anything can actually be measured; it simply depends on the perspective.\n\nFor example, to treat a seriously ill elder, a family might borrow heavily, turning an ordinary family into paupers, and then the elder’s illness might still not be cured, and they pass away anyway.\n\nThen how should that family’s life, the children’s education, and their future be managed?\n\nI once encountered a case where an elderly man secretly ran out of the hospital. We found him. His son was very filial and was willing to sell everything to treat him, begging him on his knees to return to the hospital for treatment.\n\nBut he didn’t want to burden his son. He said he either wanted to go home and wait to die, or he would rush onto the road and get hit by a car. In short, he didn’t want to stay in the hospital spending money and implicating his son.”\n\nThe old Taoist pressed his lips together upon hearing this.\n\n“This is the helplessness of life. This helplessness runs through history, regardless of East or West. People always have to face choices, and sometimes these choices are truly cruel.”\n\nThe old Taoist smiled bitterly, “So, are we still calling the police?”\n\n“Yes, why not?” Zhou Ze looked at the old Taoist, “Life can sometimes be helpless, but life should not be desecrated.\n\nIt can wither in helplessness, but it should not be churned in a septic tank.\n\nGambling with human lives, treating the lives of their own kind like fighting cocks, crickets, or dogs, for fun, for thrills—these people deserve to go to hell.\n\nWhen we get back, I’ll give you some ghost money; you can burn it.”\n\nUpon hearing this, the old Taoist instinctively rubbed his hands, saying awkwardly,\n“How could I accept that, Boss? It’s only right for me to work for you. It’s just a hundred thousand yuan, right? What’s the big deal? Am I such a petty person?”\n\nImmediately after, as if afraid Zhou Ze would go back on his word, the old Taoist quickly continued,\n“If you insist on giving it, Boss, I wouldn’t want to refuse your kindness.”\n\n“You’re overthinking it. Burning ghost money is for you to gain some *yin de* (yin virtue), and then to turn yourself in as a material witness when you report the case. You were also involved in the gambling, but it’s estimated that your merits and demerits will cancel out, plus the effect of the ghost money, nothing will happen.”\n\n“…………” the old Taoist.\n\nZhou Ze walked forward, leaning on his cane, while the old Taoist followed dejectedly behind, probably drawing circles in his mind.\n\nJust then, Zhou Ze suddenly stopped.\n\n“Boss, tired?” the old Taoist asked.\n\n*My boss abuses me a thousand times, but I treat him like my first love.*\n\nThis was a fundamental rule for serving a ghost that the old Taoist knew well, otherwise, the ghost might turn him into one too.\n\n“Something’s wrong. What time is it now?” Zhou Ze asked.\n\n“It’s four-thirty in the afternoon,” the old Taoist said, glancing at his phone.\n\n“Why is the sky so overcast?” Zhou Ze pointed up.\n\n“It’s going to rain, probably,” the old Taoist guessed.\n\n“But the weather forecast said no rain today,” Zhou Ze said.\n\n“The weather forecast predicts an 80% chance of rain tomorrow. There are probably only ten people on their team, and then they vote by a show of hands. If eight people think it will rain, then it’s an 80% chance.”\n\n“Then, what about over there?” Zhou Ze pointed to the distant sky.\n\nThe old Taoist looked and was immediately stunned. Over there, the sky was clear and sunny.\n\nThis eerie contrast was truly alarming. This wasn't Yunnan or a plateau; it was the Yangtze River Delta plain region, where such a scene of sun in the east and rain in the west was very rare.\n\n“Something’s wrong,” Zhou Ze said, then he looked at a large gate to the right, with a sign that read “Xinrui Hospital.” Inside the gate was a large clock.\n\nIt was a decorative clock, very large.\n\nZhou Ze pushed the gate open and walked inside, with the old Taoist following him.\n\n“Hey, what are you doing?”\n\nJust then, a hospital security guard approached.\n\nThis hospital was actually very small, probably without much accreditation. All the departments, including the inpatient ward, were in a three-story building. There was only one security guard, not an old man, but a burly man with a tough face wearing a security uniform.\n\n“Just looking around,” Zhou Ze replied.\n\n“What’s there to see?” the security guard barked.\n\n“Hey, are you out of your mind? The hospital’s open, and you won’t let us in?” the old Taoist retorted immediately.\n\nEver heard of a fox borrowing a tiger’s prestige?\n\nThis humble Taoist is a dog relying on a ghost’s power,\nI’ll scare you to death!\n\nWait, did something sound wrong?\n\n“This isn’t a place for seeing patients. If you need to see a doctor, go somewhere else. Also, this is private property, no tours. Go, go, go…”\n\nThe security guard completely ignored the old Taoist and came up, ready to shoo them away.\n\nZhou Ze looked at the large clock placed at the entrance of the hospital hall, lost in thought.\n\nThe old Taoist stepped forward and collided directly with the security guard.\n\n*My boss is doing something very important… err, daydreaming, but you can’t disturb him!*\n\n“You want to fight, don’t you?” the security guard pointed at the old Taoist.\n\n“Come on, try it!” the old Taoist retorted.\n\nIn terms of combat, the old Taoist truly wasn’t afraid!\n\n“Do you know what this hospital does?” Zhou Ze asked, looking at the clock.\n\n“None of your damn business. This is just a crematorium, and it has nothing to do with you. If you know what’s good for you, hurry up and get out. If you lost money gambling, don’t come here looking for trouble, go find the bookmaker!”\n\nThe security guard shouted directly.\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\nIt seemed he knew.\n\nThen Zhou Ze reached out and patted the old Taoist’s shoulder.\n“Let’s go.”\n\n“Boss, why are you so cowardly today… *sigh of relief*, haha, no fighting, good, no fighting, everyone makes money peacefully, makes money peacefully.”\n\nThe old Taoist chuckled, then followed Zhou Ze out.\n\nThe security guard glanced at the two people walking out, and “hmph” a sound from his nose.\n\nWalking out onto the street, Zhou Ze lit another cigarette.\n\nThe old Taoist was a bit dejected.\nHe felt that this boss wasn’t as inspiring as the previous one. If it were the previous boss, when that guy said, “He’s my old man,” the former boss would probably have made the father see his child buried.\n\nThis current boss was too disciplined, too self-restrained.\n\n“He’s a living person, he’s not under my jurisdiction,” Zhou Ze explained.\n\n“Mm,” the old Taoist responded weakly.\n\n“Old Taoist, I really don’t like this place,” Zhou Ze said.\n\n“This humble Taoist doesn’t like it either,” the old Taoist echoed.\n\n“What time is it?” Zhou Ze asked again.\n\n“Four forty-three.”\n\nZhou Ze, with the cigarette between his fingers, nodded and said,\n“It’s coming out.”\n\n…\n\nThe security guard picked up his walkie-talkie and said, “Hey, surveillance room? Those two guys who just came in, I chased them away. They don’t look like they lost money and came to cause trouble.”\n\nAs he finished speaking, the walkie-talkie suddenly emitted a dense static.\n\n“Hello? Hello?” The security guard patted the walkie-talkie, “What a crappy machine.”\n\n*Dong… dong…*\n\nThe large clock beside him chimed.\nThe security guard subconsciously turned his head, then frowned, and then scratched his head, leaning closer. *Damn it, it’s not on the hour, why are you chiming?*\n\nFour forty-three… four minutes.\n\nJust then, the security guard suddenly saw the sound of gears grinding from inside the large clock. The sound was loud, very terrifying,\nand carried a sense of juice being crushed and splashed, like a large piece of pork being churned in a blender.\n\nThe security guard was confused and instinctively took a step back.\n\nImmediately after,\nhe saw a hand slowly reaching out from the large clock.\nThis hand looked as if it had just been crushed by gears, completely mangled and bloody. It also had a dense layer of tiny holes,\nand maggots were peeking out of each hole.\n\nThis image,\nwas definitely a nightmare for anyone with trypophobia.\n\nThe surrounding temperature,\nsuddenly dropped,\ngiving one the illusion of falling into an ice cellar.\n\nThe security guard was so scared his body started trembling. He wanted to run, he wanted to scream, but his legs felt like they were filled with lead and couldn’t move at all.\n\nThis hand slowly grasped the security guard’s neck.\nA terrifying force came from the arm, pulling the security guard closer to the large clock.\n\nThe security guard’s face was pressed against the outer wall of the clock, his face almost distorted.\n\nAn eerie, trembling voice came from the walkie-talkie:\n“What… time… is… it…? Am… Am… I… supposed to… die… yet?”",

    "content": "Tick... tock... tick... tock...\n\nThe hands of the clock were moving.\n\nFew people paid attention to these subtle changes. People always said to cherish time, shouting \"an inch of time is an inch of gold,\" but those who truly lived by it were few and far between.\n\nYet, many had experienced this feeling: suddenly, you quieted down and heard the \"tick-tock\" of the hands. You could clearly perceive time quietly slipping away, and with it, your life.\n\nThis was a chilling silence, a goosebump-inducing quiet. In the ethereal realm, it was as if a Ledger of Life and Death truly existed, on which everyone's fate had already been written.\n\nPeople lived only to complete this process.\n\nAccording to the Ledger of Life and Death, they were born.\n\nThen, according to the Ledger of Life and Death, they died.\n\nThis was the great terror hidden within time.\n\nIn the basement of the Unlicensed Hospital, the space wasn't large, but it was divided into small rooms, each containing a bed.\n\nSome beds had people lying on them.\n\nSome beds previously had people lying on them.\n\nSome beds were waiting for the next person to lie on them.\n\nThis wasn't hell, yet it carried the very breath of death.\n\nAround them, some doctors and nurses moved constantly, but here, in this hospital, they were not the white-clad angels of healing and compassion that people commonly knew.\n\nThey simply observed and recorded, noting down each target's data and then uploading it online.\n\nIt was like playing football lottery; the odds would constantly change. A star player on a team suddenly getting injured, a head coach suddenly being replaced—all sorts of on-field and off-field factors would cause the odds to shift.\n\nHere, it was the same. The vital signs data of each person would excite gamblers sitting in front of computer screens, making them read meticulously.\n\nThey probably wouldn't even read their own parents' medical records as diligently as this.\n\nFrom the real-time surveillance videos and the details within various data, they sought their judgments and threw out their chips.\n\nThis was a game of life-and-death gambling. What the gamblers gained here was not just the return on their odds but also the thrill of controlling life.\n\nAnd these thrills were built upon the trampling of their fellow humans' lives.\n\nA woman who had been lying in bed suddenly struggled to sit up for some reason. At this moment, it was exactly the shift change for the nearby doctors and nurses, and the staff in the monitoring room might have been slacking off, failing to notify of the woman's abnormal movement.\n\nThe woman pulled out the tubes attached to her body. She struggled to get out of bed, but she rolled directly onto the floor.\n\nShe was much younger than the others on the beds, appearing to be in her thirties or forties, but her body was clearly severely swollen. Her calves were unimaginably thick, almost swollen into a single mass.\n\nShe couldn't stand up. Every day, even her food intake was strictly rationed by quantity and type, with no excess, all for the sake of fairness.\n\nThe fairness people pursued was most thoroughly implemented and carried out in this aspect.\n\nShe was crawling.\n\nShe was trying hard to crawl.\n\nShe crawled to the door. The door was ajar. She pushed it open with effort and continued crawling out. She was like Sadako crawling out of a television, dressed in white, with disheveled hair, but she was still alive.\n\nOf course, she wouldn't live much longer. The candle of life on her was already flickering, on the verge of extinguishing.\n\nShe was lucky. She crawled out of the narrow ward, into the corridor, and to the office door. Along the way, no one passed by, and no one discovered her.\n\nHer hand rested on the office door. She wanted to ask the doctor inside to let her make a phone call.\n\nThere was an electronic clock in her ward, displaying the date and time.\n\nToday was her son's fifth birthday.\n\nShe wanted to remind her husband to celebrate their son's birthday.\n\nThinking of her son, a smile appeared on her lips. Her son was her deepest bond. After ten months of pregnancy, what normal mother wouldn't love her child?\n\nShe had this illness, and it was incurable. Their family's financial situation was already poor, and her husband was addicted to gambling and unemployed. Previously, the family had relied on her working outside to support them. Now, she had this illness that modern medicine was powerless against.\n\nShe couldn't bear to throw their already meager family savings into treating herself. Her son was about to start kindergarten, then school. Now, and in the future, they would all need money.\n\nHer husband knelt before her, asking her to come here.\n\nShe knew what kind of place this was. She knew what those two cameras in the ward were for.\n\nShe agreed. She consented.\n\nDying at home was death, and dying here was also death. She knew she had become a chip, but at least by being this chip, the platform would give her family a large sum of money.\n\nHer family needed money, and her child, growing up, also needed money.\n\nHer husband knelt before her and promised that he would turn over a new leaf, become a good person, a good father, and raise their son well.\n\nShe knew she was dying soon.\n\nShe had been staring at the timetable.\n\nShe wanted to hold on.\n\nTo hold on and remind her husband to celebrate their son's birthday. She wanted to last until this day.\n\nThis was why she, lying in her sickbed, unable to receive any treatment, not even pain medication, enduring the torment of her illness every day, had held onto a breath of life and hadn't died yet.\n\nShe pushed the door.\n\nIt wouldn't move.\n\nShe was already very tired.\n\nShe had little strength left in her body.\n\nInside the office, sounds of arguing could be heard.\n\nThe voices of the arguing parties were very familiar: one was the main doctor who examined her three times a day—morning, noon, and night—and the other was her husband.\n\nShe smiled.\n\nHer husband was actually here.\n\nThen she could tell him about their son's birthday in person.\n\nShe could also ask her husband to relay a few words to her son. As a mother, she would be in heaven, always accompanying her child's growth.\n\n\"Why isn't she dead yet, why isn't she dead yet!\" her husband roared.\n\n\"How should I know? Your own wife isn't dying, and you blame us?\" This was the doctor's voice.\n\n\"But I bet 200,000 that she would die last week. I thought she wouldn't live past last week.\"\n\n\"Your wife has astonishing vitality. She's practically a medical miracle. She's been off medication for so long; any ordinary person would have collapsed by now.\"\n\n\"It was you, you told me, you told me she would die last week! That's why I dared to bet 200,000, 200,000!\"\n\n\"Let go, let go of me! Are you crazy? I'm not the King of Hell; I can't control who lives or dies.\"\n\n\"You can't control it, yet you leaked this information to me and took a kickback from me? You deliberately harmed me! Do you know, this 200,000 is money my wife traded her life for!\"\n\n\"If you keep this up, I'll call security.\"\n\n\"Please help, I'll bet another 100,000. Can you make her die this week? Give her an injection secretly, make her die this week, that way I can break even and even make a profit!\"\n\n\"Another 100,000? Where did you get another 100,000?\"\n\n\"I sold my son, 100,000 yuan!\n\nOnce I turn my fortunes around and break even with this bet, I'll buy my son back.\n\nDoctor, please help, secretly kill her. Otherwise, I'll have no wife and no son!\"\n\n\"Heh, you're something else. I'm sorry, there are rules here, and cameras are monitoring. I won't do such a thing.\"\n\n\"Then what do I do, what do I do?\n\nOh, doctor, let me see her, let me see her once. Which ward is she in? I'll go see her, I'll make her die, this week. She'll understand!\n\nIf she doesn't die, our son won't be redeemed, and all the family's money will be gone. She loves me very much, and she loves her son. If you just let me see her once, she'll definitely be willing to die for our son.\n\nDoctor, I beg you,\n\nDoctor, I beg you, doctor.\"\n\n\"This doesn't meet the requirements. We're not some wild, unregulated place. We are very legitimate, and it's because we're legitimate that we have the most clients betting with us.\"\n\n\"Here, take this, take it. When you do your check-up, please pass on a message for me. And you can also place a bet; trust me, she will die, she's willing.\"\n\nThe voices of the two men continued,\n\nAnd the woman outside the door,\n\nHad stopped breathing.\n\nBut her eyes,\n\nWere wide open.\n\nOn the closed door,\n\nThere were still scratches, marks made by fingernails.\n\n………………\n\nOutside the hospital, Zhou Ze and the Old Daoist stood there.\n\n\"Old Daoist, do you have any more of those talismans?\"\n\n\"None left, inherited ones, long gone.\n\nThe last two were used up when I was taking pictures of hair at the bookstore last time.\"\n\nThe Old Daoist said sincerely, \"If this poor Daoist still had them, I would definitely give them to you, Boss.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Zhou Ze responded.\n\nThe Old Daoist sighed in relief, then unconsciously reached into his crotch.\n\nThe next moment,\n\nHis crotch suddenly felt hot,\n\nSo hot that the Old Daoist immediately jumped up, quickly reaching in to pull out a scorching red talisman.\n\n\"Whoa, whoa... hiss, hiss... So hot, so hot.\"\n\nWhile patting his crotch, the Old Daoist saw Zhou Ze looking at him, and immediately said:\n\n\"Hahahaha, Boss, isn't this amazing? I actually forgot I had one more in my crotch. It's the very last one, truly the last one.\"\n\n\"I wasn't going to ask you for it,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"I was originally going to remind you that later, there will be a very powerful vengeful ghost returning on its seventh day, and its resentment might be quite strong. If your talisman is still hidden in your crotch, it might hurt a lot.\"\n\nThe Old Daoist's face immediately contorted into an old, tender chrysanthemum:\n\n\"Boss, why didn't you say so sooner?\"\n\n\"You said you didn't have any, so I believed you.\"\n\n\"…………\" Old Daoist.\n\nContinuously rubbing his crotch, dispelling the burning sensation, the Old Daoist looked at the hospital ahead. The light inside seemed much dimmer. Even though the Old Daoist had little Taoist magic, he could sense that something had happened inside the hospital.\n\n\"Old Daoist, what's your take?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nThe Old Daoist was stunned.\n\nWhat did he mean, \"what's my take\"?\n\nAre you a ghost or am I a ghost?\n\nAre you a ghost messenger or am I a ghost messenger?\n\nIt's haunted in there, and you're asking me for my take.\n\nWhat kind of nonsense question is that!\n\nBut the Old Daoist immediately replied with seriousness:\n\n\"Boss, there must be something fishy going on here!\"\n\n\"Heh.\"\n\nThe Old Daoist felt a bit inexplicable.\n\nAfter a while, seeing that Zhou Ze had no intention of going in, he said, \"Boss, these scum, they're definitely scum, not worth helping.\"\n\nThe Old Daoist was worried that Zhou Ze would just walk in and catch ghosts.\n\nHe knew Zhou Ze's character; he was very adherence to rules, completely different from his previous boss.\n\n\"We went in, but the security guards inside chased us out,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Hmm?\"\n\n\"This vengeful ghost's seventh day return has immense resentment, so it's very unusual. Furthermore, in this place, every so often, someone dies staring at the clock, layer after layer of resentment accumulating, all finally falling upon this ghost. That's why her return on the seventh day has such a great impact.\n\nShe even has the ability to harm ordinary people.\"\n\n\"That fierce?\" The Old Daoist smacked his lips. Why did he feel a little excited?\n\nIt would be best if these scumbags died, served them right!\n\n\"Actually, she wouldn't have become so exaggerated all at once,\" Zhou Ze added.\n\n\"Then what happened?\" The Old Daoist looked around. \"Is there some mysterious person nearby instigating this?\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\nThe Old Daoist immediately widened his eyes and said in a deep voice, \"Can we find them, Boss?\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head.\n\n\"Then what do we do? What if that guy has ulterior motives?\" The Old Daoist was a bit anxious.\n\n\"That person probably severed the connection between the great clock and that female ghost, which is equivalent to opening the cage that held the female ghost. This is a demon unleashed.\n\nIf that security guard hadn't stopped me, I could have prevented this. Sigh.\"\n\n\"No, don't...\" The Old Daoist spoke halfway, then chuckled awkwardly, \"Boss, how about I go in with you right now?\"\n\nThe Boss needed to catch ghosts for performance, so the Old Daoist could only choose to follow.\n\n\"Not going. The security guard is too fierce and too strong. Both of us, an old man and a cripple, can't beat him.\"\n\n\"I can...\" The Old Daoist had intended to volunteer. That security guard looked like a brute, but the Old Daoist was confident he could handle him, and besides, he didn't know what the ghost inside had done to that guy.\n\nBut a scene suddenly came to the Old Daoist's mind.\n\nThe Boss just said that someone severed the connection between the female ghost and the great clock, unleashing the evil spirit.\n\nThe Old Daoist remembered that when he and that security guard were bickering and arguing,\n\nThe Boss, standing behind the great clock, seemed to have used his fingernails to fiddle with the clock.\n\nYes,\n\nHe remembered correctly!\n\n\"Boss, I can't beat him. I'm old, useless.\"\n\nThe Old Daoist pretended to be very dejected, and even winked at Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze was noncommittal,\n\nPlacing his hand to his mouth,\n\nHe gently,\n\nBlew on his fingernails...",

    "content": "\"Ahhhhhh!!!!\"\n\n\"Ahhhhhhh!!!!!\"\n\n\"Ahhhhhhh!!!!!\"\n\nScreams continuously echoed from the small hospital. The old Daoist stood at the entrance, watching many people in white coats run out as if something was chasing them.\n\nBut they just kept running in circles in the small courtyard, falling and getting back up, seemingly unable to see the door, and no one ran out of it.\n\n\"Is this... a ghost's wall?\" The old Daoist asked Zhou Ze, looking at him.\n\nZhou Ze ignored him and continued to watch.\n\nHe saw a woman relentlessly chasing people, asking:\n\n\"Am I supposed to die yet?\"\n\n\"What time is it?\"\n\n\"Am I supposed to die?\"\n\nShe was anxious,\nShe was desperate,\nShe was bewildered,\nAs if, if she didn't die at the fixed time, her son couldn't be redeemed.\nIf she didn't die at the regulated time, her family would be shattered.\nIf she didn't die at the regulated time, she would have made a huge mistake!\n\nZhou Ze's brows furrowed deeper the more he watched.\n\nThe old Daoist couldn't see what was happening inside, so he was completely confused, but watching a group of living people screaming and running around, constantly falling, was quite amusing, like watching monkeys in a circus. And some of the female nurses, wearing skirts, tore their clothes as they ran and fell, revealing large expanses of their bodies:\n\nLacy,\nHollowed-out,\nAnd even Peppa Pig!\n\nThe old Daoist, with the thought of getting some interest back for those victims, almost had his eyeballs pop out. Anyway, he kept looking at all the places he shouldn't.\n\nFinally, Zhou Ze couldn't watch anymore; he genuinely couldn't.\n\n\"Truly... an idiotic teammate.\"\n\nThe old Daoist heard this and froze for a moment, instantly feeling very wronged, his old face wrinkled into a tender chrysanthemum.\n\nBoss, don't be so discouraging, right?\n\nI was just looking...\n\nYou don't look, you're not interested, you're hard... erm... but I'm still normal!\n\nZhou Ze reached out to the old Daoist for a lighter, just then seeing the old Daoist looking at him with a wronged expression. He then seemed to understand something and smiled:\n\n\"I wasn't talking about you.\"\n\n\"Then who were you talking about?\" The old Daoist truly didn't understand.\n\n\"Her.\"\n\nWith that, Zhou Ze pushed the door open and walked in, leaning on his cane.\n\nThe old Daoist followed him in. Anyway, wherever the boss went, he went, because no matter how amazing the boss was, he still needed a sidekick to butter him up and shout \"6666.\"\n\nThe old Daoist had always been precise about his self-positioning.\n\nHowever, the moment he followed the boss inside, the old Daoist felt a chill run through him, as if someone with cold hands had gently slid them across his back while he slept, giving him a finger-tip tour.\n\nThat thrill,\nDirectly made the old Daoist's flaccid sack shrink into a large walnut.\n\nThen, a female nurse suddenly ran in front of the old Daoist and fell right before him. The old Daoist quickly bent down to help her up.\n\n\"Are you okay? Are you okay?\"\n\nWhile helping her, his hand instinctively took advantage.\n\nHmm, this is also acting on behalf of Heaven!\n\nHowever, what surprised the old Daoist was that the anticipated soft sensation didn't appear. Instead, his hand, with the force he used, directly pierced into the female nurse's chest.\n\n\"Hiss...\"\n\nThe old Daoist gasped in fear and began to retreat, but the female nurse was like a maggot in the bone, clinging to him.\n\n\"Oh my god, Boss, help me, help me!\"\n\nThe female nurse in his arms suddenly lifted her head.\n\nHer face began to become rough and swollen, pitted with holes, and maggots and crawling insects wriggled and moved about inside, going back and forth.\n\nShe bared her teeth,\nHer mouth full of yellow teeth, a large fleshy tumor protruded from her mouth. The tumor was yellowish-green, looking like it could burst at any moment.\n\n\"What time is it, am I supposed to die yet?\"\n\nThe female nurse asked the old Daoist.\n\nThe old Daoist was so scared he fumbled with his crotch, only then realizing he had thrown away the talisman earlier because his crotch was burning.\n\nThis action successfully caught the female nurse's attention, and her hand also reached for the old Daoist's crotch.\n\n\"Oh oh oh oh oh oh!!!!!\"\n\nThe old Daoist felt as if his \"thing,\" which had shrunk from a gluten stick to a caterpillar, instantly shrank even further.\n\nThat walnut was almost frozen into a marble.\n\nSo cold,\nThe female nurse's hand was so cold,\nSo cold the old Daoist couldn't bear it,\nThis feeling was like stripping naked on a Himalayan peak and pole dancing towards the sunrise,\nThrilling and deadly!\n\nThe old Daoist quickly raised both hands. No one was holding a gun to him, but someone was holding his gun,\nSo, surrendering was an instinctive action.\n\nBoss,\nWhere did you go?\nYour loyal Daoist is about to be cut off from his lineage!\n\n\"Enough!\"\n\nZhou Ze's voice came.\n\nThe old Daoist felt that Zhou Ze's voice at this moment was even more pleasant than those beautiful female celebrities on TV. It was a pity he couldn't see where the boss was standing, otherwise, he really wanted to rush over and kiss him hard!\n\n\"Dong... dong...\"\n\nThe bell rang, signaling the time to go home.\nAll the surrounding scenes disappeared, and the terrifying coldness in the old Daoist's crotch also began to fade, leaving only a lingering numbness. He was almost scared to the point of collapse, directly dropping to his knees.\n\nHe looked up and saw Zhou Ze standing by the large clock.\n\nIn Zhou Ze's hand, there was a minute hand that had just been broken off.\n\n\"Zzzzzzzzz... zzzzzzzzzzz...\"\n\nA faint, scratching sound came from the cement floor, like a broken electrical wire, but it was very grating, making one's scalp tingle.\n\nThe old Daoist looked around. Several doctors and nurses, including the burly security guard, lay motionless around him. They weren't dead; they were scared unconscious.\n\n\"Tell me... what time is it... am I supposed to die yet?\"\n\nFrom behind the large clock, a woman in white climbed out. Her face was blank as she first stared at the old Daoist, making him shiver again. Then, inadvertently, she extended her finger and pointed at Zhou Ze on the other side.\n\nThere,\nBig sister,\nThe big boss is over there. You should fight the big boss first. I'm just a small fry.\n\nThe female ghost was indeed cooperative and turned to look at Zhou Ze on the other side.\n\nThen, she began to crawl towards Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze looked at her, very disappointed.\n\nThis was genuine disappointment.\n\nIn his previous life, Zhou Ze was a doctor. He always upheld his professional ethics. Although he didn't have the grand dream of \"saving all beings\" or the selfless dedication, in his work, he always adhered to \"people-oriented\" principles.\n\nThis small hospital was a microcosm of this street, a microcosm of this black gambling industry chain. It made Zhou Ze feel oppressed and very uncomfortable.\n\nIt was the kind of discomfort where,\nIf you don't do something, you feel like you won't sleep well tonight.\nAnd these doctors and nurses lying unconscious on the ground, if there were no surprises, should also have come from proper medical schools or nursing schools, with their own professional skills, definitely not just filling positions.\n\nYet, this group of people violated their ethics, violated the fundamental duties of a doctor. They learned the skills to heal and save lives, but they stood by dying patients, merely recording a series of cold data.\n\nThen,\nThey watched the patient die with cold eyes, absolutely refusing to offer aid, because aid and medication would affect the fairness of the gambling.\n\nThere's a saying popular among doctors: \"Encouraging someone to study medicine is like inviting a lightning strike from Heaven.\"\n\nMost doctors' work is far from as leisurely and comfortable as commonly perceived in society. The vast majority of medical personnel face great dangers every day, from exposure to infection in the operating room, heavy workloads, and even... medical disputes.\n\nBut since they put on that pure white uniform, they must live up to their identity.\n\nThat's right,\nZhou Ze wanted them to die.\nWhether it was out of impulse or pique, at that moment, Zhou Ze truly wished for all the dregs of this industry to go to hell!\n\nTo toy with human lives, to find pleasure in human lives, this was a blasphemy against life. And as someone who had died once, Zhou Ze understood the preciousness of life even more.\n\nSince you treat human lives as tools for cockfighting or dogfighting, then I can also choose not to treat you as humans.\n\nThe old Daoist could beat the burly security guard, and even though Zhou Ze leaned on a cane, with one fingernail, he could bring down an ox.\n\nBut Zhou Ze naturally backed away, exclaiming, \"Can't mess with that, can't mess with that.\"\n\nSome things, it wasn't convenient for him to act, so he wanted to watch the fire from across the river, to observe from a safe distance.\n\nHe was indulging, he was passively dealing with it,\nThe purpose,\nWas to kill with a borrowed knife.\n\nAnyway, it was inevitable that you would become a malevolent ghost. You could no longer enter the cycle of reincarnation. Even if you went to hell, you could only endure endless karmic fires until your soul was scattered.\n\nSo,\nWhy not give you a chance,\nTo clean up this garbage dump,\nYou'll be satisfied,\nI'll be satisfied,\nAnd the smog in this sky can dissipate a bit.\n\nBut this woman in front of him,\nShe was like an idiot!\n\nZhou Ze gave her a chance, even secretly pushing her. She was much stronger than ordinary malevolent ghosts and had the ability to seek revenge.\n\nBut her so-called revenge was just scaring people unconscious?\n\nWhen they woke up, they would be fine again?\n\n\"Zzzzzzzzz... zzzzzzzzz... zzzzzzzzz...\"\n\nThe female ghost continued to crawl towards Zhou Ze, then looked at him pitifully, asking:\n\n\"What time is it, am I supposed to die yet?\nPlease,\nTell me, tell me...\"\n\nZhou Ze slowly bent down, looking at the female ghost's pockmarked face, and asked:\n\n\"Don't you hate them?\"\n\nYes, don't you hate them?\n\n\"What time is it?\" The female ghost continued to ask.\n\nZhou Ze then pointed at the unconscious nurses and doctors below and asked, \"Don't you want revenge?\"\n\nThey placed you on a cold bed, watching you die. Don't you want revenge on them? Don't you want revenge on those gamblers, on those behind-the-scenes bookmakers who count their money happily, on the husband who personally pushed you into the abyss of despair—revenge?\n\n\"Please tell me what time it is, I'm calculating if I should die. If I die, I'll get money, my husband will get money, our family will have money, and our son can be redeemed.\nPlease tell me, tell me, what time is it, what time is it!\nI must die at the appointed time. My family needs money, my son needs money when he grows up, he needs money for school, and he'll need money for marriage later.\nWhat time is it,\nPlease tell me, tell me!!!!!!!!!\"\n\nThe female ghost seemed very angry at Zhou Ze's repeated disregard of her question. She began to become incredibly furious, so furious she wanted to strangle Zhou Ze!\n\nZhou Ze paused,\nThis female ghost,\nShe didn't have murderous intent towards those doctors and nurses,\nBut she had murderous intent towards him?\n\nFor a moment, Zhou Ze wanted to laugh, and then he did laugh.\n\n\"Hehehe...\"\n\nLaughing, Zhou Ze slowly stood up.\n\nThe female ghost instinctively lunged at Zhou Ze,\n\n\"What are you laughing at? Answer me the time, what time is it!\"\n\nZhou Ze stretched out his hand, his fingernail directly piercing the female ghost's glabella. The female ghost let out a bloodcurdling scream. Zhou Ze's fingernail was like a soldering iron, causing her terrifying pain.\n\n\"Boss?\" The old Daoist walked over at this moment.\n\nZhou Ze closed his eyes. He thought of the old woman who came to the bookstore that night, crying heartbrokenly because she had died prematurely and was unwilling. He thought of the old man he saw earlier, being watched by his son, lying in bed, waiting for the time to die.\n\nHuman life is precious, but the premise is that one knows how to cherish it and how to respect it;\nLife is your own. If you don't cherish it yourself, don't blame others for looking down on your life!\n\nZhou Ze shook his head,\nAnd said:\n\"Old Daoist, I think I made a mistake. I seem to have meddled too much.\"\n\n\"Hmm?\" The old Daoist still didn't understand.\n\nZhou Ze opened his eyes, glanced at the several doctors and nurses lying unconscious on the ground, and said:\n\n\"I found that I don't hate these guys as much as before.\"\n\n\"Uh, why? They're just a bunch of beasts,\" the old Daoist said.\n\nZhou Ze looked at the female ghost twisting and struggling under his palm,\nAnd said:\n\"Yes,\nThey are indeed beasts,\nBut those who are pitiful must also have something hateful about them.\"",

    "content": "The female ghost, under Zhou Ze's fingernails, was beaten until her soul body was damaged, even becoming transparent and unreal.\n\nShe was in great pain, she was suffering greatly, she was pitiful, but for Zhou Ze, while he could try to use her to kill others, he could never allow her to leave the hospital, nor could he allow her to leave his sight and control.\n\nNow, she couldn’t serve as a blade, so she could only be sent to where she belonged.\n\nThe Gate of Hell opened,\n\nZhou Ze grabbed the female ghost by the shoulder with one hand and threw her directly inside. After being severely wounded by his fingernails, the female ghost had no power or strength left to resist.\n\nClapping his hands, Zhou Ze took out his certificate book, which had increased to twenty-five percent.\n\nThe收益 from this female ghost was quite high, not because Zhou Ze had simply gone with the flow, but because this female ghost was originally a grotesque being, born from the accumulated resentments of many people who had died on this street.\n\nUnfortunately, she lacked the brutality of a powerful ghost as imagined; a typical mismatch between her appearance and identity.\n\nZhou Ze leaned on his cane and began to walk out. He didn't want to stay there any longer, unwilling to linger in a place that made him, a ghost messenger, feel uncomfortable and depressed.\n\nThe old Daoist followed along. After they reached the street corner, the old Daoist subconsciously looked back. Inside, there were several similar small hospitals and clinics, and of course, many illicit operations hidden in the corners.\n\nThis was the human world,\n\nYet it was more like an incinerator of hell.\n\nIn the invisible sky, it was as if chimneys rose from the ground, with smoke billowing. And those people lying on beds, painfully waiting to die, were like cartloads of coal slag being sent into the incinerator.\n\n“Boss, back to the bookstore?” the old Daoist asked.\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\n“Boss, it’s not worth getting angry over that. Just look at it with an open mind. That female ghost was actually quite pitiful. At least, she was a good mother.”\n\n“That’s precisely what makes me feel sad.”\n\n“Boss, you say that pitiful people must have something detestable about them, but I disagree. I think she did nothing wrong. Anyway, since death was inevitable, why not sell herself before dying to leave some income for her family? It’s human nature, even though human life shouldn't be bought and sold. But when it really comes to that point, using one's last remaining value is actually understandable.\n\nMoreover, her actions didn't harm anyone. It was a matter of mutual consent.”\n\n“Old Daoist, have you ever been arrested by the police?” Zhou Ze suddenly asked.\n\n“Uh, a few times, that was because…”\n\n“Have you ever been caught in a prostitution raid?”\n\n“Uh, no, not that. Lucky me. Sometimes I was on edge though, being this old. Even though I was trying to care for those fallen women, my intentions were good, but I was afraid of being misunderstood by outsiders.\n\nYou know, in this world, if you want to do something, especially something good, it's always easy to be criticized.”\n\n“Then do you think prostitution raids are right or wrong?”\n\n“Well…” The old Daoist didn't know how to answer.\n\n“According to your logic, the 'ladies' are willing, they need money, and you have needs, and you give money. Both parties get what they want. Why should the police meddle?”\n\nThe old Daoist didn’t know how to refute.\n\n“Even in the self-proclaimed free and open America, prostitution is illegal in all states except Nevada, which borders Los Angeles.\n\nLaw, in fact, is the last moral benchmark of a society. And what you call protecting the 'fallen',\n\nSeems like mutual consent, willing engagement, but if it were legalized or brought into the light, do you know how many prostitution rings it would spawn? Many women would even be forced into prostitution. In an illegal environment, there are already many cases of forced prostitution.\n\nIndia is a country that advocates legal individual prostitution, and you understand India's rape rate.”\n\n“Those are two different things…” the old Daoist explained.\n\n“Two different things?”\n\nZhou Ze smiled,\n\nHe pointed to the street behind them and continued:\n\n“This is just the tip of the iceberg of what we see. Do you know that the flame of evil might start as just a flicker? Some moths are willing to fly into it, the fire wants to burn them, and the moths make their own choice.\n\nBut when this fire grows bigger and bigger, it will no longer be satisfied with only burning the moths that actively fly into it. It will burn nearby houses, nearby forests, and then it will cause a great disaster.\n\nIn the end, aren't those moths that fed the initial flicker and made it grow also among the culprits?\n\nWhen this industry begins to mature and expand, who can guarantee that even more bloody and exciting gambling methods won't emerge? Moreover, when willing moths are not enough, won't those who are addicted to this game, those platforms accustomed to earning huge profits from this game, forcefully or semi-forcefully seek new chips to continue the game?\n\nSix months later,\n\nA year later,\n\nThree years later,\n\nThis growing and maturing dark industry brings in an innocent person, creating conditions for similar death gambling.\n\nDoes that person have the right to curse those idiots who, for money, initially volunteered as chips and joined this game?”\n\nThe old Daoist smacked his lips. He felt what the boss said seemed very reasonable, but he still felt something was off. He stubbornly retorted:\n\n“Boss, I think the real culprits are those organizers, the bookmakers.”\n\n“When an avalanche occurs, no snowflake is innocent.”\n\n...\n\nWhen they returned to the bookstore, it was already dark. Because he wasn't in a good mood, Zhou Ze had walked back, which took quite some time.\n\nThe bookstore door was open. Tang Shi was sitting behind the counter. A man and a woman were sitting there reading.\n\n“Where’s Bai Yingying?” Zhou Ze asked.\n\n“She went upstairs to play games. I’m helping her watch for a while. She’s been playing all day.” Tang Shi said indifferently.\n\nZhou Ze was speechless. It seemed he needed to limit the game time of that internet-addicted girl. She actually dared to leave the store for Tang Shi to manage; wasn't she afraid of a bloodbath in the bookstore if something really happened?\n\n“You two were out for quite a while. Oh, where’s the old Daoist?” Tang Shi asked, surprised that the old Daoist hadn’t returned to the bookstore with Zhou Ze.\n\n“Went to the police station to report a crime,” Zhou Ze replied.\n\n“Want something to drink? A cocktail?”\n\n“You know how to mix them?”\n\nTang Shi didn't speak but began to mix a drink on her own. Her mixing movements were quick and skilled. Soon, a cocktail was placed in front of Zhou Ze.\n\n“Try it.”\n\nZhou Ze picked up the glass, took a sip, then nodded,\n\n“Very good.”\n\n“Thanks.” Tang Shi sat back in her chair, holding a book called “The Origin of Hell.”\n\n“Is this book from the bookstore?” Zhou Ze didn’t recognize the book, and there was no publisher listed on it.\n\n“His book, a fantasy book from his middle school years. You can read it for fun to pass the time.”\n\nZhou Ze carried his drink upstairs. As soon as he pushed open the bedroom door, he saw Bai Yingying sitting at the computer desk, wearing headphones, talking excitedly, as if arguing with her teammates.\n\nIt seemed they initially didn't know she was a girl, and only realized it when she spoke during the argument, saying something else.\n\n“Heh heh, you want me to play with you?”\n\nBai Yingying didn’t know Zhou Ze was already standing behind her. She lowered her voice and said coquettishly:\n\n“Do you want to sleep with a corpse, big brother? The kind that goes ‘_ying ying ying_’*.\n\nGo sleep with your moms, you jerks! I'm old enough to be your great-great-grandmother!”\n\nThen, Bai Yingying took off her headphones, disdainfully tossed them on the desk, leaned slightly back, and propped one long leg up. With one hand, she casually pulled a pack of women's cigarettes from her pocket, expertly tapped the filter end down on the desk, then put it in her mouth. Her fingertips rubbed, a spark appeared, and she lit the cigarette.\n\n“That’s a good way to light a cigarette,” Zhou Ze said. “Can you teach me?”\n\n“Go ask your mom to teach you. I’m busy…”\n\nAs Bai Yingying was speaking, she suddenly took a deep breath, quickly extinguished the cigarette in her hand, then stood up and bowed her head towards Zhou Ze, greeting him in a soft, gentle voice:\n\n“Boss, you’re back.”\n\nZhou Ze sat in the chair Bai Yingying had just been in; the chair still retained some warmth. He took a cigarette from the pack and lit it. It was a woman's cigarette. He took a puff and frowned slightly; this type of cigarette was too light for Zhou Ze's taste.\n\n“Was it hard to hold it in?”\n\nZhou Ze turned sideways to look at the female corpse.\n\nHe wasn't sure when he had grown accustomed to Bai Yingying obediently staying by his side, making “_ying ying ying_” sounds.\n\nHe seemed to have forgotten the intimidation and horror Bai Yingying brought to him and Xu Qinglang when she first woke up in the bookstore. Zhou Ze was also a bit confused, wondering which version was her true self.\n\n“No, boss, don’t misunderstand. In front of you, Yingying is truly just a shy little bird. Boss, you should actually know yourself,\n\nYou are also a zombie, and your bloodline is much higher than mine.”\n\nZhou Ze narrowed his eyes and said:\n\n“But in my previous life, I was just a doctor, just an ordinary person. I’ve always wondered something: I’ve already died once and changed bodies. If it were merely a matter of bloodline, that should be ruled out. Otherwise, there’s only one explanation, and that is that Xu Le himself was a zombie, but that doesn’t make sense either.”\n\n“Boss, my Madam once told me that some zombies, they…”\n\nAt this moment, Zhou Ze’s phone rang. Zhou Ze picked up his phone and motioned for Bai Yingying to pause and talk later.\n\nIt was the old Daoist’s call. The two had walked back together, but Zhou Ze had given the old Daoist some冥钞 (冥钞) to burn somewhere before going to the police station to report.\n\n“Hello, did you report it?” Zhou Ze asked.\n\n“Boss, no… didn’t dare to report…” the old Daoist stammered over the phone.\n\n“Didn't burn the冥钞 (冥钞)? It's just participating in gambling, plus the act of self-reporting, and burning some冥钞 (冥钞), you won't even be detained, at most you'll just make a statement.”\n\n“No… no, boss… I’m at the police station, and there are many reporters here now. Apparently, half an hour ago, someone reported that all the nurses, doctors, and patients in a hospital were killed. It seems… it seems it’s the same hospital we were at earlier.\n\nBoss, I can’t turn myself in now. Burning more冥钞 (冥钞) won’t help. If I turn myself in, the police will definitely detain me as the prime suspect.”\n\n“Everyone’s dead?”\n\nZhou Ze frowned slightly. That shouldn’t be right. When he left, those doctors and nurses were just lying there unconscious, not in any serious danger; they should have woken up shortly.\n\n“Absolutely, it’s that hospital,” the old Daoist said in a lowered voice. “I just asked a reporter, and he told me.”\n\n“How is that possible? We haven’t been gone that long.”\n\n“Boss…” the old Daoist asked nervously, “Weren’t you also wondering earlier why that female ghost didn’t kill anyone or take revenge?”\n\n“What are you trying to say?”\n\n“This humble Daoist is thinking, at that time, perhaps there were two ghosts, but one of them was hiding.”\n\n---\n*Translator's note: “_ying ying ying_” is an onomatopoeia, usually describing a soft, delicate, or somewhat affected sound, often used in a cutesy or coy manner.

    "content": "The incident happened suddenly, and many deceased were brought in, a total of over ten bodies. To expedite the autopsy and examination process, several bodies were transferred to Tongcheng Affiliated Hospital to assist with the investigation.\n\nTongcheng is a peaceful city, and precisely because of this, the sudden occurrence of such a severe murder case immediately garnered attention from all sides. News about the incident had already spread on WeChat Moments and Weibo, causing many citizens to feel fear and unease.\n\nTo some extent, this put pressure on the police handling the case.\n\nThe police force was fully deployed in hopes of uncovering the truth of the incident soon, and a special task force was immediately established. Of course, none of this concerned Zhou Ze.\n\nFor now, he only needed to ascertain one thing: were the deceased doctors and nurses killed by humans, or by… ghosts?\n\nIn reality, Zhou Ze felt no unease about the deaths of those people, nor did he feel any responsibility or guilt. If that female ghost had been a bit more capable, she would have long ago become Zhou Ze's weapon for killing with a borrowed knife. Those scoundrels who treated human lives as gambling tools, their deaths would only make the world cleaner.\n\nBut what Zhou Ze couldn't tolerate was if there was another ghost, constantly hidden in the shadows, and he hadn't discovered it, only for it to start killing as soon as he left. That would be his dereliction of duty.\n\nLike a hunter who catches birds all day, only to have a bird peck out his eye—that feeling was far from pleasant.\n\nHe casually stole a white coat, put it on, and entered the morgue. Two bodies were currently undergoing autopsies, while three remained here. Zhou Ze used to be a doctor here, working for ten years, so he was naturally very familiar with the affiliated hospital.\n\nMoreover, Zhou Ze had actually been to this morgue once since his reincarnation. Last time, he encountered the case of several children fighting over an inheritance, with their deceased mother’s body left unclaimed.\n\nThe old Daoist also rushed over from the police station and met Zhou Ze at the affiliated hospital. He had cultivated relationships with some reporters and obtained some superficial information, which he quickly came to report to Zhou Ze.\n\nHowever, to the old man’s disappointment, Zhou Ze was not interested in this news. Unlike his previous boss, he had little interest in solving cases.\n\nThe temperature in the morgue was naturally not high, and a chilling aura permeated both inside and out.\n\n\"Boss, why are the bodies being transported to the hospital for autopsy?\" The old Daoist couldn't understand this.\n\n\"Forensic pathologists, even in developed countries, are in short supply, and it's the same domestically. If it were a case with only one or two lives, it wouldn't be necessary, but this time there are over ten deceased. The forensic resources allocated to the Tongcheng police bureau would certainly not be enough, so they had to seek assistance from private institutions.\"\n\nZhou Ze checked the numbers, then scanned the table behind the door a few times before pulling out a freezer drawer. Inside lay the body of an old woman with gray hair.\n\nThe old Daoist's eyes widened immediately upon seeing the body. \"This must be a ghost's doing. The nurse小姐姐 was sucked dry like a husk.\"\n\nZhou Ze tapped the metal plate. \"This is the body of a patient from the hospital's basement.\"\n\n\"Oh, I see.\"\n\nThe old Daoist rubbed his head, somewhat embarrassed.\n\n\"Then how did she die?\" the old Daoist asked again.\n\n\"The body was already suffering from cancer before death. Those patients lying in the basement, used as gambling tools, had already had all medical assistance terminated. They could die at any moment.\n\n\"Roughly speaking, this body has no obvious external injuries, and I didn't detect any residual malevolent energy on her.\"\n\n\"Is her cause of death very strange and difficult to find?\" the old Daoist said, stroking his chin in a feigned thoughtful manner, as if he too were deeply contemplating the matter. \"That's interesting. A mysterious cause of death, there must be something strange about this.\"\n\n\"Died of illness.\"\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\n\"I said, she probably died of illness.\"\n\n\"This...\"\n\nIf it weren't Zhou Ze in front of him, but someone else, the old Daoist would probably have exploded in anger.\n\nDied of illness, and you spent so long analyzing it, making me act so engrossed.\n\nAm I not supposed to feel awkward?!\n\nZhou Ze ignored the old Daoist's thoughts and pulled out the second body, a young male corpse.\n\n\"This body looks a bit familiar. Oh, holy crap, it's that security guard's body.\" The old Daoist recognized the body, as he had had physical contact with this security guard.\n\nZhou Ze reached out and lifted the corpse's chin; there was a dark red wound there.\n\nThe wound was deep, and the incision was very smooth.\n\n\"Was this a slit throat?\"\n\nThe old Daoist guessed.\n\nZhou Ze nodded. The cause of death was excessive blood loss from a sharp object severing the throat.\n\nZhou Ze then pushed open the freezer containing the third body, which was a female corpse.\n\n\"I know this one too. She was a nurse at the hospital. She was wearing Peppa Pig on the bottom, so I took a few extra glances.\"\n\nZhou Ze examined the female corpse's chin area and found no wound there. However, moving down her neck, Zhou Ze saw a very deep cut below her left breast. The wound mark wasn't as long as the male corpse's neck wound, but its depth was probably more terrifying.\n\nExcluding other possible accidental factors, purely based on Zhou Ze's experience in his previous life, the fatal injuries of these two individuals should be the two wounds he found.\n\n\"This must have been a stab with a dagger.\"\n\nThe old Daoist was also someone who had wandered the *jianghu*, and for a while, he had even served as a barefoot doctor in the countryside. Although his skills were mostly for bluffing, he had seen a lot.\n\n\"It should be a sharp object similar to a dagger,\" Zhou Ze nodded.\n\nGhosts don't use knives to kill, so for now, it seemed to be a human act.\n\nSince it was human-caused, it had nothing to do with Zhou Ze. Earthly matters were for the police to handle; he was only responsible for containing ghosts.\n\nBut this matter still made Zhou Ze very uncomfortable. He had indeed wanted to kill these doctors and nurses before, but in the end, he didn't. However, a scene could be inferred in his mind:\n\nAfter he and the old Daoist left,\n\nSomeone, holding a dagger or a small knife-like object, came to this hospital, and these nurses and doctors were likely still unconscious.\n\nHe approached them one by one, slitting their throats with the dagger or stabbing their abdomens, letting them slowly and painfully die of blood loss while unconscious.\n\nPeople killed those whom ghosts didn't.\n\nWhether I kill or not is my business. You taking advantage of my absence and their unconsciousness to finish them off—Zhou Ze felt like he had been exploited and outmaneuvered.\n\n\"Let's go, it's fine,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nSince it wasn't a ghost's doing, Zhou Ze intended to withdraw.\n\n\"Then... do I still need to turn myself in?\"\n\n\"With such a big incident, some things cannot be kept hidden. Even if you don't turn yourself in, this dark industry chain will be uncovered in this incident.\"\n\n\"That's good.\"\n\nThe old Daoist was really worried that Zhou Ze would continue to make him surrender and be a star witness.\n\nLeaving the hospital, it was already late at night. There were many late-night food stalls outside. The old Daoist suggested eating something, as he hadn't eaten since noon.\n\nZhou Ze nodded in agreement. He also felt a bit light-headed; Xu Qinglang had returned to his hometown, and his appetite had been noticeably poor these past few days.\n\nHowever, because he didn't bring sour plum juice, the old Daoist ate heartily beside him, but Zhou Ze found it very difficult to eat. Each bite of food had to be swallowed with great difficulty, suppressing the urge to vomit.\n\nAnd the food at the late-night stalls was quite oily, which made it even harder for Zhou Ze to eat.\n\nWhile eating, the old Daoist wiped his mouth, got up, and went to the front. When he returned, he held two warm steamed buns.\n\n\"Boss, you should eat something lighter. There's a 24-hour pastry shop right ahead. I bought you two steamed buns.\"\n\nZhou Ze also put down his chopsticks and took the steamed buns. He had to eat something, at least to maintain the energy needed for his body's activities, so he wouldn't deplete his body and collapse.\n\nHolding the steamed buns in his hand, Zhou Ze shook his head helplessly. \"The steamed buns aren't fresh.\"\n\n\"Uh...\" The old Daoist said, somewhat helplessly, \"It's already night, after all. To get fresh ones, you'd have to wait until they just open in the morning.\"\n\nZhou Ze poked the steamed bun with his fingernail. It was soft on the outside and a bit hard on the inside.\n\nJust as he was about to tear off a piece and put it in his mouth, Zhou Ze suddenly froze.\n\nHe abruptly turned the steamed bun around, looking at the spot where his fingernail had just pierced.\n\nDropping the steamed bun, Zhou Ze immediately stood up and rushed across the road towards the hospital.\n\n\"Boss!\"\n\nThe old Daoist called out, and seeing that Zhou Ze didn't respond, he threw two hundred yuan onto the table, shouted \"Check please\" to the food stall owner, and then ran after his boss.\n\nThe two returned to the hospital. Zhou Ze still headed straight for the morgue. Coincidentally, a doctor in a white coat came out of the morgue door. Fortunately, he had his back to Zhou Ze and walked in the other direction, going upstairs from there.\n\nAfter that doctor left, Zhou Ze and the old Daoist opened the morgue door and entered again.\n\nZhou Ze personally pulled open a freezer drawer; the female corpse lay inside.\n\n\"Boss, what exactly happened?\" the old Daoist asked breathlessly.\n\n\"It wasn't a dagger that killed her,\" Zhou Ze said in a deep voice.\n\n\"Not a dagger, then a small knife, right? You ran all the way back just for that?\" The old Daoist sighed.\n\nZhou Ze didn't speak.\n\nInstead, he silently let his index fingernail grow out.\n\nThen,\n\nZhou Ze gently placed the dark fingernail on the female corpse's left chest area,\n\nFollowing the existing wound,\n\nHe inserted it,\n\nA perfect fit!\n\nIt wasn't killed by a dagger,\n\nNor by a small knife,\n\nIn fact, it wasn't killed by any sharp tool,\n\nIt was a fingernail,\n\nA fingernail!\n\nThe old Daoist's mouth immediately gaped open, so astonished he didn't know what to say, only stammering:\n\n\"Zom... zom...\"\n\n\"I knew when I first saw this wound, I had a familiar feeling,\" Zhou Ze turned his head and looked at the old Daoist. \"Pull out the male corpse's freezer too, and verify it again.\"\n\nThe old Daoist immediately nodded and pulled open the freezer where the male corpse was.\n\nThen the old Daoist froze completely.\n\nHe said,\n\n\"Boss, this isn't good, something's wrong!\"\n\n\"What's wrong?\" Zhou Ze pulled out his fingernail and turned to look at the old Daoist.\n\n\"The body... the body is gone!\"\n\nThe old Daoist turned sideways to Zhou Ze, indicating that the freezer he had pulled out was empty.\n\nImmediately after,\n\nA more terrifying scene unfolded. The old Daoist reached out, trembling, and pointed at Zhou Ze,\n\nBecause he saw,\n\nBehind Zhou Ze,\n\nThe female corpse, which had been lying on the morgue rack,\n\nWas slowly sitting up.\n\nThe female corpse turned her face,\n\nSmiling,\n\nAnd looked at him...",

    "content": "The female corpse suddenly sat up. All was silent.\n\nThis was very much like a classic scene and plot device from a horror movie: the protagonist and some minor character are investigating something when a terrifying scene suddenly appears, and the whole affair begins to spiral into an unknowable abyss of mystery.\n\n\"Boss...\"\n\nOld Daoist priest had seen much in his time, but he had never witnessed anything this strange. After all, many past incidents ultimately had a greater \"human\" factor, while ghosts often seemed somewhat constrained.\n\nBut now,\nThis was true corpse reanimation, dammit!\n\n\"What is it?\" Zhou Ze asked, not turning around, but looking at the Old Daoist.\n\n\"You... you...\"\n\nThe female corpse looked at Zhou Ze in front of her. She wasn't actually smiling, but in this atmosphere and under the current lighting, from the Old Daoist's perspective, the female corpse was like a venomous snake, preparing to devour someone.\n\nBecause of this, it gave the Old Daoist the illusion that the female corpse was smiling, as if everything was under her control.\n\n\"Speak, hey,\" Zhou Ze said, a bit impatient as the Old Daoist continued to stammer.\n\nAnd at this moment, the female corpse opened her mouth and bit down towards Zhou Ze's neck.\n\n\"Boss, behind you...\"\n\n\"Smack!\"\n\nZhou Ze suddenly extended a hand, like a snake catcher grasping a snake by its vital spot, and clamped onto the female corpse's neck, his nails instantly piercing into it.\n\nThe female corpse began to twist, to struggle, she seemed to be in great pain.\n\n\"What is it, speak,\" Zhou Ze urged.\n\nSeeing this, the heart that had been in the Old Daoist's throat immediately plummeted back down.\n\n\"Nothing,\" the Old Daoist replied weakly, feeling he had wasted his expressions and emotions.\n\n\"Oh.\"\n\nZhou Ze responded, then threw the female corpse to the ground.\n\n\"Thud!\"\n\nWith a crisp sound, the female corpse's skin began to crack, and black pus slowly seeped out from inside, like a water balloon played with by a child with malicious intent, bursting upon hitting the ground.\n\nWhen the water inside seeped out, only the tattered balloon skin remained.\n\nThe female corpse was the same; when the black pus splattered out, her bones and insides seemed to have completely vanished, leaving only the outermost layer of skin, floating and sinking in the pus.\n\nThat face, immersed in the liquid, constantly wrinkled and changed, like a person continuously altering their expression.\n\nZhou Ze looked at his nails. There were several nicks on them. When he had pierced into the female corpse earlier, he distinctly felt a strong corrosive property, which had caused some damage to his nails.\n\nThe terrifying and strange scene was so casually resolved by Zhou Ze that the Old Daoist had a ridiculous feeling that they had the wrong script. He even felt that such a good atmosphere and buildup had been wasted.\n\nHe immediately rubbed his face hard, forcing himself to sober up, then said:\n\n\"Boss, I just thought of something. When we came in, wasn't there a doctor in a white coat walking out?\n\nWas he a real doctor?\"\n\n\"Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!\"\n\nFrom upstairs, a piercing scream echoed.\n\n………………\n\nIn the hospital room, a girl sat on a nearby bed, unable to help but doze off. Her mother, who had just undergone surgery, lay on the bed with an IV drip, still under anesthesia.\n\nThe girl slept fitfully for a while, her body swaying, then she woke up. She was exhausted, but her sleep was restless. She needed to care for her mother, at least to check if the IV drip was finished so she could call a nurse to help replace it.\n\nShe looked up and saw that this bottle was almost empty. Standing up, the girl gently yawned, then reached out and pressed the call button by the bed, notifying the nurse to help change the IV bag.\n\nThe button was pressed, but after a while, no nurse came. The girl grew a little anxious, walked to the hospital room door, and pushed it open. She planned to go to the nurse's station at the other end to check; perhaps the nurse on duty had also fallen asleep.\n\nPushing the door open, just as she stepped out, the girl saw a male doctor in a white coat standing on the opposite side of the corridor, his face obscured by a white mask, turned sideways to her.\n\n\"Doctor, excuse me, I need a bottle change here.\"\n\nThe girl called out to the doctor.\n\nThe doctor ignored her, remaining motionless where he stood.\n\n\"Doctor? Doctor? We need a bottle change here.\"\n\nThe girl called again.\n\nThe doctor's body trembled slightly, as if he had been startled awake from a daze. Then he half-turned and walked towards the girl.\n\nThe girl let out a sigh of relief. Her mother only had one last bottle of IV fluid, and then she could finally get some proper sleep.\n\nHowever, gradually, the girl noticed something was wrong, as if there was something amiss somewhere.\n\nAt first, the girl thought she was too tired, leading to neurasthenia, making everything seem off. But slowly, the girl realized this wasn't the reason; rather, the doctor walking towards her was indeed problematic.\n\nHe... was barefoot!\n\nYes, a doctor, walking barefoot in a hospital?\n\nWorking barefoot?\n\nWas it possible?\n\nThe girl immediately took two steps back, closed the hospital room door, and then quickly locked it from the inside. This was her subconscious reaction.\n\nIn fact, everyone possesses a sixth sense. When human ancestors lived a primitive life, they were constantly on guard against attacks from wild beasts, naturally possessing an instinct for self-preservation.\n\nOf course, with the development of human society, humanity has been at the top of the food chain for a very long time, and this instinct is slowly degenerating. But some people are inherently more sensitive, with a more acute perception of danger than ordinary people.\n\nThrough the transparent glass on the hospital room door, the girl saw the male doctor still walking towards her, and his way of walking was also somewhat peculiar.\n\nAfter taking a step, his foot immediately twisted, causing his body to twist along with it, like the exaggeratedly comical walking style in a Charlie Chaplin silent comedy.\n\nBut in the dead of night, in a hospital, in a deserted ward corridor, this way of walking brought not comedy, but a horrifying terror that made one's hair stand on end!\n\nThe doctor continued to walk towards her, his swaying motion growing wider and wider. The girl even heard \"creaking\" sounds.\n\nThe girl wondered if she was having a nightmare.\n\nWhy would something like this happen in a hospital?\n\nShe lowered her head, closed her eyes, and forced herself to calm down. If this was a dream, please wake up.\n\nThen, she opened her eyes and found herself still standing behind the door. This, it seemed, was not a dream.\n\nSummoning courage, the girl once again looked out through the glass window on the hospital room door, only to find that the doctor was gone, completely out of sight.\n\nThe girl was a little confused. What was going on?\n\nHad she seen things?\n\nOr was she already having illusions?\n\nShe didn't dare to open the door. Even if she had seen things, she wasn't prepared to open the door and confirm it at this moment. After all, she was a girl, and after her mother fell ill, she became even more cautious.\n\nOutside, it seemed there was really no one left.\n\nThe girl pressed her face against the door to get a wider view through the glass.\n\nSuddenly,\n\nThe girl felt the light in front of her was blocked.\n\nA male doctor's face, wearing a mask,\n\nAppeared silently from the glass window,\n\nThe distance between his face and the girl's face,\n\nWas less than a centimeter, just the thickness of the glass!\n\nThe girl was completely scared stiff.\n\nShe forgot to scream, forgot everything, just stood there dumbfounded, looking at the person outside the glass window, that face!\n\nThe mask was squirming, as if the mouth covered by it was speaking, but what came out was not human language, but the \"creaking\" sound she had heard before,\n\nLike walking through a muddy puddle in rain boots on a rainy day.\n\nAnd the male doctor's eyes were exaggeratedly huge, five or six times larger than normal human eyes. His eyeballs were swollen like eggs, almost the size of a chicken egg, practically bursting out of their sockets.\n\nAt the same time, these eyeballs were constantly shaking, wobbling, like the eyes of a puppet, able to flip up and down, as if they could fall out at any moment.\n\nThe girl covered her mouth, her body trembling with immense fear.\n\n\"Click-creak...\"\n\nIt was the sound of the doorknob turning.\n\nThe doctor was opening the door!\n\nThe girl immediately pushed forward with her body, bracing against the hospital room door.\n\nShe had just locked the door, so it couldn't be opened from the outside, but because it couldn't be opened, the doctor outside started pounding on the door.\n\n\"Bang! Bang! Bang!...\"\n\nThe girl bit her lip, pressing against the door. Her eyes were full of tears. She was terrified, frantic. She didn't know why this was happening in a hospital.\n\n\"Creak-creak-creak...\"\n\nAlong with the sounds of the door being hit, the \"creaking\" sound grew more intense and clear.\n\n\"Boom!\"\n\nA sound came from outside the door.\n\nThe girl didn't know what had happened, but she suddenly realized that the person outside was no longer hitting the door. Leaning against the door, she heavily gasped for breath.\n\nIt was too terrifying.\n\nTruly too terrifying.\n\nIf this was a nightmare, please let her wake up quickly.\n\nBut soon, the girl suddenly found her feet wet, as if a puddle of water had flowed in from under the door.\n\nThe girl lowered her head and looked at the ground.\n\nSomething white seemed to be seeping through the bottom door crack along with the pus on the floor.\n\nIt was a human skin!\n\nOn top was a face twisted into a grotesque knot.\n\nThose two huge eyeballs flowed like two freshly cracked egg yolks covered in egg white.\n\nWith a \"squelch,\"\n\nOne of the eyeballs burst, and yellowish, foul-smelling liquid splattered onto the girl's face.\n\nThe other eyeball continued to roll around,\n\nAs if the doctor was lying on the ground, with one eye squinted and the other open, looking at her with a mocking expression.\n\n\"Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!\"\n\nThe girl collapsed.\n\nHer scream,\n\nEchoed throughout the entire inpatient building.",

    "content": "Zhou Ze and the old Daoist priest followed the screams and found the floor. Because Zhou Ze's legs were inconvenient, by the time they arrived, many people had already gathered there. Many family members of inpatients were out to watch the commotion, forming three layers of crowds.\n\nThere were even some patients in hospital gowns, holding their IV drips in one hand and leaning against the wall with the other, coming over to gawk, perfectly embodying the spirit of \"life never ends, neither does watching a good show.\"\n\nSeveral nurses nearby were comforting a girl, and someone was calling the hospital security. Security should arrive soon.\n\nBecause Zhou Ze was also wearing a white lab coat, he and the old Daoist priest easily squeezed through the crowd and got inside.\n\nOn the ground was a puddle of yellowish-brown pus, and something like an egg yolk was constantly floating in it. An uninformed person might think someone had peeled an egg and thrown it there, but Zhou Ze knew that it was actually a human eyeball.\n\n\"Boss, this fellow's amniotic fluid also broke.\"\n\nThe old Daoist priest whispered in Zhou Ze's ear.\n\nZhou Ze frowned slightly. The old Daoist priest always got mischievous at critical moments; this might be a self-preservation mechanism for him under stress, involuntarily trying to relax himself during tense times.\n\nThen, Zhou Ze extended his index finger and stirred it in the pus.\n\nSeeing this, the old Daoist priest also squatted down and put his finger in to stir. Honestly, this stuff was too disgusting, but since the boss did it, he could only follow suit.\n\nIt must be said that the old Daoist priest was a very dedicated person. Whether following his previous boss or his current one, he had a strong desire to learn and imitate.\n\nImmediately, the old Daoist priest saw a scene that made him want to throw up his supper. Zhou Ze actually put his middle finger in his mouth and sucked it, then bowed his head in thought, as if discerning the ingredients within.\n\nAt the same time,\n\nHe even smacked his lips.\n\nSo dedicated?\n\nWhat did it taste like?\n\nThe old Daoist priest hesitated.\n\nA fierce struggle occurred in his mind in a short time, but in the end,\n\nHe also put the finger that had just stirred the pus into his mouth and tasted it. The taste was overwhelmingly pungent, with a stinging, spicy sensation erupting immediately upon entry, more burning to the throat than drinking high-proof baijiu.\n\nThere was even a taste of aged seafood, a taste that most boys and some girls knew.\n\nThe old Daoist priest's face turned green, but seeing his boss still deep in thought with a normal expression, at that moment, a feeling of awe for Zhou Ze inexplicably rose in the old Daoist priest's heart.\n\nHe could endure this taste; he was truly not human!\n\nZhou Ze turned his head and saw the old Daoist priest's miserable face, like he had just been inseminated, then looked at the liquid still clinging to the old Daoist priest's fingertips. He asked, somewhat surprised:\n\n\"What are you doing?\"\n\nThe old Daoist priest gently patted his chest and said tragically, \"Shennong tasted a hundred herbs. What the boss can do, this humble Daoist naturally can too.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded and smiled.\n\nThe old Daoist priest felt flattered, as if he had finally been recognized by his boss at that moment, just like when Patriarch Bodhi tapped Sun Wukong's head three times.\n\n\"I used my index finger to stir, and put my middle finger in my mouth.\"\n\nZhou Ze showed his fingers to the old Daoist priest and continued:\n\n\"I just had leeks stuck in my teeth after supper, so I was just picking them out. Who would be crazy enough to taste this stuff? Are they masochists?\"\n\n\"...\" The old Daoist priest.\n\nThe old Daoist priest wanted to say more, but then his stomach began to cramp. He pushed through the surrounding crowd and rushed straight to the restroom to vomit.\n\nZhou Ze silently stroked his chin. The startled girl was still sitting in the hospital room, with several nurses comforting her. Zhou Ze didn't go to inquire about the girl's condition, as he had experienced a similar scene himself in the morgue before.\n\nIt's just that some things were merely a drizzle and small-scale for him, but for ordinary people, they were already shocking enough to shake the world.\n\nA dead body suddenly sat up.\n\nThe fatal wound came from extremely sharp nails that could be used as weapons.\n\nThe pus that the corpse eventually turned into.\n\nEverything indicated that the murderer was not an ordinary person, but a devil hidden in the darkness. In fact, since Zhou Ze became an underworld official, he had never encountered an opponent with such mysterious and varied methods.\n\nThat thing clearly couldn't be treated as an ordinary fierce ghost.\n\nStanding up, Zhou Ze walked to the other end of the corridor, took out his phone, and dialed Tang Shi's number.\n\n\"Hello.\" Tang Shi's voice was as cold as ever.\n\n\"Do me a favor. It seems a... a wild zombie has appeared here.\"\n\n\"You can go find plants.\"¹\n\nThe implication was that she was busy and couldn't be bothered.\n\n\"Then help me call Bai Yingying and ask her to come to the hospital.\"\n\n\"That's no problem.\"\n\nAfter hanging up the phone, Zhou Ze once again wondered if keeping Tang Shi by his side was a mistake. This woman was even more useless than a vase.\n\nHis own Yingying was much better.\n\nBoth were women, both were not living people, yet the difference could be so great.\n\nThe old Daoist priest had vomited all the stomach acid out and walked out of the restroom, coming over to Zhou Ze. He asked, somewhat complainingly:\n\n\"Why did that thing have to do this when killing someone?\"\n\n\"He did it on purpose,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Will everyone he kills turn into zombies? Hey, this is just like the old Hong Kong zombie movies from the eighties and nineties. People bitten by zombies turn into zombies too.\"\n\nSaying that, the old Daoist priest looked into Zhou Ze's eyes, somewhat eager to try.\n\n\"What are you looking at?\"\n\n\"Uh, Boss, a small request, can all zombies become like Bai Yingying?\"\n\n\"Get straight to the point, don't beat around the bush.\"\n\n\"Uh, ahem... what this humble Daoist means is, look, Boss, I'm getting on in years. Who knows, one day I might kick the bucket and go to the Western Paradise.\"\n\n\"You're a Daoist priest, not a monk.\"\n\n\"Uh, that is to say, kick the bucket and ascend to immortality. But this old Daoist worries, if I leave, who will take care of you?\"\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze.\n\n\"So, Boss, if that day comes, could you bite me?\"\n\n\"I find it disgusting.\"\n\n\"...\" The old Daoist priest.\n\nCan we still be friends!\n\n\"It's not as exaggerated as you think. Being bitten by a zombie won't turn you into one. If you don't believe me, you can go back and let Bai Yingying bite your neck. Besides getting a zombie poison that will speed up your demise, I guarantee there won't be any other effects.\n\nAs for turning into a zombie, you might as well choose a very inauspicious tomb and bury yourself. Perhaps in a hundred years or so, you might pop out, but that 'you' after that has nothing to do with the 'you' now; it's a new life.\"\n\n\"Movies are all lies?\"\n\n\"What do you think?\"\n\nThe old Daoist priest was a bit dejected. He had thought he had found a way to extend his life, but it turned out to be this result. Still, the old Daoist priest was a bit unwilling to give up and said:\n\n\"Then what about these two people?\"\n\n\"What was the outcome?\" Zhou Ze asked. \"They just split open, and all their bones and organs turned into pus.\"\n\n\"Why is that?\"\n\n\"Because they were used as nutrients and absorbed by someone. They didn't turn into zombies. To take a step back, would you want to become that kind of zombie?\"\n\n\"Will he continue to kill?\" The old Daoist priest asked, a bit worried.\n\n\"If he hasn't eaten his fill,\" Zhou Ze pursed his lips. \"Of course, even if he's full, it doesn't mean he won't get hungry again.\"\n\nZhou Ze suddenly seemed to remember something else and said to the old Daoist priest, \"Try to find out what happened to those other bodies, if similar situations occurred...\"\n\nHis phone rang at that moment. Zhou Ze picked it up and saw \"Wang Ke\" on the caller ID.\n\nSince the \"eating meat\" incident last time, Zhou Ze hadn't contacted Wang Ke again, and Wang Ke had also promised not to contact him actively.\n\n\"Hello.\" Zhou Ze still answered the call.\n\n\"I'm sorry I have to go back on my word, but I think you'll be interested in this,\" Wang Ke's voice came from the other end of the line.\n\n\"Speak.\"\n\n\"Have you heard about the mass deaths at that small hospital?\"\n\nZhou Ze turned around, looked at the puddle of pus behind him, and said:\n\n\"Just heard.\"\n\n\"I'm a part-time consultant for the police station, usually helping with psychological profiling and such. This incident is very serious, and I've been invited to help. Based on the existing known conditions, I need to delineate some psychological and physical characteristics of the culprit. Haha, for this, I drew a sketch. Would you like to see it?\"\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\n\"Ding dong...\"\n\nA WeChat message notification sound.\n\nZhou Ze minimized the call and opened WeChat.\n\nIt was a very rough sketch, but the person in the sketch made Zhou Ze's pupils contract.\n\n\"What kind of joke are you playing?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Haha, I don't believe it's you, but the person I drew based on the known conditions and clues really looks a lot like you. How about it, this time I'm not asking you for a favor; I'm just asking if you're interested?\"\n\n\"Interested in what?\"\n\n\"I can get all the police investigation materials here.\" Wang Ke rubbed his brow on the other end of the phone, sounding a bit tired. \"Although I don't want to admit it and feel a bit helpless, I increasingly feel that the culprit in this case might not be human.\"\n\n\"Are you at the police station?\"\n\n\"No, I'm at home. You can come to my place. The case files and latest information will all be compiled here for me.\" Wang Ke paused, then added, \"Also, I'm making meat soup for supper. You can come have some.\"\n\nZhou Ze directly ignored the last part and said, \"I'll be over.\"\n\nAfter saying that, Zhou Ze was about to hang up, but Wang Ke's voice came again: \"Don't hang up yet.\"\n\n\"Something else?\"\n\n\"Yes, I've never had a chance to say this to others before, and it's not good to say it to others, it sounds like scolding them.\n\nBut this time, it's a rare opportunity. This is the first time I've said this to someone else:\n\nHappy Qingming Festival.\"²\n\n---\n¹ \"You can go find plants\" (你可以去找植物) is a literal translation. It's an implied dismissal, as if to say, \"that's not my area of expertise, go find someone who deals with plants (like a botanist or someone who can help with natural remedies for a wild zombie).\" Given Tang Shi's personality, it's a sarcastic way of saying she won't help.\n² \"Happy Qingming Festival\" (清明節，快樂) is a literal translation. Qingming Festival is a traditional Chinese holiday where people visit ancestors' graves. It's a day associated with the dead, so saying \"Happy Qingming Festival\" is ironic, dark humor given the context of dead bodies and zombies.",

    "content": "When Zhou Ze and the old Taoist priest walked out of the hospital, Bai Yingying happened to arrive in a taxi. She was wearing blue jeans and a white hoodie, looking youthful and beautiful.\n\nAlthough she had been asleep for two hundred years, her age remained frozen at a youthful sixteen.\n\n\"Boss.\" Bai Yingying greeted Zhou Ze from across the street.\n\n\"So, the wild ones are prone to causing trouble,\" the old Taoist priest sniffed, watching Bai Yingying cross the road. He sighed, \"The domesticated ones are more sensible.\"\n\nIt was clear now: the mastermind was very likely a zombie. And conveniently, there was a domesticated zombie at the bookstore—Bai Yingying.\n\nThe old Taoist priest had personally witnessed Bai Yingying cleaning, greeting customers, and even sleeping with the boss after work. Truly the most dedicated employee of the new era.\n\n\"Boss, is the situation very serious?\" Bai Yingying asked as she approached. She understood that her boss wouldn't specifically call her unless things were extremely tricky.\n\nZhou Ze looked at the old Taoist priest. \"You tell her the situation.\" Then, Zhou Ze flagged down a taxi, and they all got in.\n\nThe car drove to the villa district. After getting out, the three walked directly to Wang Ke's villa.\n\nThey rang the doorbell, and soon, Wang Ke opened the door, gesturing for Zhou Ze and the others to come in.\n\n\"The soup will be ready soon. Let's all have some. We can't neglect our health while working.\"\n\n\"This gentleman's words resonate deeply with this humble Taoist priest.\"\n\nThe old Taoist priest was overjoyed. He had to pay and leave his supper halfway through to follow Zhou Ze back to the hospital, and his stomach wasn't entirely full yet.\n\nEveryone sat down in the living room. Wang Ke brought over a tray with four bowls of meat soup. He placed a bowl in front of Zhou Ze, the old Taoist priest, and Bai Yingying, and held one for himself.\n\nThe meat soup was pure, sprinkled with green onions and a drop or two of sesame oil. Each bowl also had two or three chunks of meat. The old Taoist priest didn't hesitate, picking up his bowl and starting to eat with great relish.\n\nWatching the old Taoist priest heartily slurping the soup, Zhou Ze sat beside him, shaking his head slightly. For some reason, he felt a wave of nausea, even though the soup in front of him hadn't been touched. That feeling of revulsion was incredibly strong.\n\nBai Yingying also didn't eat; her soup remained untouched.\n\n\"Ha, satisfying!\"\n\nThe old Taoist priest wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. Seeing that Zhou Ze hadn't touched his chopsticks, he asked in surprise,\n\n\"Boss, have some. It'll warm you up.\"\n\n\"I'm not hungry. You eat,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Oh, I couldn't possibly,\" the old Taoist priest demurred.\n\n\"Eat it, don't waste it.\"\n\nSaying this, Zhou Ze even moved the bowl of meat soup that was in front of Bai Yingying to the old Taoist priest.\n\n\"Haha, then I accept with pleasure. Mr. Wang's cooking is truly unparalleled.\"\n\nThe old Taoist priest resumed eating heartily.\n\nZhou Ze felt he couldn't watch any longer. He stood up and looked at Wang Ke. \"Let's talk about the case.\"\n\nWang Ke nodded, put down his bowl and chopsticks, and stood up, gesturing for Zhou Ze to follow him into the study.\n\nOn the desk in the study, there were many documents.\n\n\"Here, these are the photos that just arrived. The dissected bodies are fine, nothing happened to them, but several bodies that hadn't been dissected yet showed abnormal changes. The bodies turned into pus, and there were also some emergency responses that dead people shouldn't have.\n\nFor example, suddenly sitting up on the stretcher, and some people heard walking sounds coming from inside. When I received these messages, I immediately thought of you.\"\n\nWang Ke placed a stack of photos in front of Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze flipped through the photos while asking,\n\n\"Any other clues?\"\n\nZhou Ze was already aware of what was in the photos; he had personally experienced it just now.\n\n\"The police investigated the identities of all the deceased. There were no major surprises; the victims were basically all people related to that hospital. Therefore, the police's theory is that this was a revenge killing, and the perpetrator committed these heinous acts with the aim of retaliation.\n\nThe police are now focusing on suspects who had medical disputes with this hospital. However, this matter is truly surprising. This hospital, upon investigation, especially with such a serious violent incident, some things simply couldn't be hidden.\n\nGambling, using human lives as a gambling game—that's truly shocking.\"\n\nWang Ke reached out to adjust his glasses while twirling the pen in his hand.\n\n\"And what else?\" Zhou Ze continued to ask.\n\nSo far, all the information Wang Ke had obtained was already known to him.\n\n\"That's it. To identify the killer, we first need to completely dismantle this entire underground black industry chain. Then, from those who lost money gambling, we'll start by investigating gamblers from this city or province. Additionally, the families of those who were used as gambling tools are also key suspects.\n\nThis means there are currently a great many suspects, and the investigation will be difficult and time-consuming. I'm still waiting for more specific information.\"\n\nZhou Ze was getting impatient. He stood up, ready to leave. The information Wang Ke provided was of no value to him.\n\n\"Don't go, stay a bit longer.\"\n\nWang Ke tried to keep him.\n\n\"Have some more soup.\"\n\n\"Then there's really nothing more to talk about,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nIf you bring up soup again, I’ll have to leave even if I don’t want to.\n\n\"Actually, there's one more thing, something the police haven't discovered, but I have.\"\n\nWang Ke leaned back, looking at Zhou Ze, his gaze deep behind his glasses. \"But I'm afraid you'll misunderstand me.\"\n\n\"You don't have to say it.\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't press him. Honestly, he could get involved in this matter or not. He was just a ghost messenger, not a Heavenly Master from Longhu Mountain, and he didn't have much of a passion for saving all living beings.\n\nWild zombies, by rights, were not under Zhou Ze's jurisdiction, unless that zombie was so full it decided to attack the Midnight Bookstore.\n\nOtherwise, he could perfectly well eat and sleep as he pleased in the bookstore.\n\nAnd even if that zombie truly lost its mind and came to the bookstore, with himself, Bai Yingying, and Miss Tang, it would likely be the zombie that ended up suffering.\n\n\"I'll tell you anyway.\"\n\nWang Ke took out another photo from the drawer, turned it around, and placed it in front of Zhou Ze.\n\nThe background of the photo was the signboard of a hospital, the one where the incident occurred. Zhou Ze also saw the familiar large clock behind the photo.\n\n\"There are a total of seventeen people in the photo: four security guards, four nurses, three doctors, and two administrative staff. Standing at the very front are four people.\n\nThe two in the middle are the hospital's investor and a manager from the gambling platform, respectively. The leftmost one is a renowned old doctor from Tongcheng who has already retired.\n\nIn the hospital death incident, the four security guards, four nurses, three doctors, and two administrators died on that very day.\n\nHowever, among the four people in the front row, two of them died one after another a week ago.\n\nFor example, the hospital's investor died in a car accident a week ago, and this old doctor was found dead at home three days ago.\n\nJust got the news, the owner of this gambling platform died tonight while trying to escape...\"\n\nWang Ke sighed as he spoke.\n\nZhou Ze reached out, placed his hand on the photo, and gently pushed away Wang Ke's index finger that was pressing on it.\n\n\"I'm curious, is this fourth person still alive?\"\n\nWang Ke slowly moved his finger away. The face of the fourth person, previously covered by his finger, was revealed.\n\nA very familiar face.\n\nIt was Wang Ke's face!\n\nZhou Ze looked up at Wang Ke.\n\nWang Ke spread his hands. \"Calm down, let me explain.\"\n\n\"Very surprising,\" Zhou Ze lit a cigarette.\n\n\"Don't jump to conclusions. This really has nothing to do with me. This boss was my roommate in college. He said he opened a clinic and invited me to attend the ribbon-cutting. I couldn't refuse to give him face. In fact, my role, like that old doctor's, was just to fill out the crowd that day.\n\nI truly had no idea about their shady dealings, such as using human lives for gambling. After the opening, I never went to that hospital again, nor did I gain any benefits from it, and I have absolutely no connection to this matter.\"\n\nWang Ke looked at Zhou Ze,\n\n\"In fact, it's hard for you to imagine how profitable this black industrial chain is. Even a thin layer of skimmed profits from it would be a huge sum.\n\nIf I were truly involved, would I still be worried about money for the development of my psychological research firm?\n\nYou saw how anxious I was during Mr. Zheng's daughter's incident, like a cat on a hot tin roof. I'm short on money, and if I were involved in this, would I still need to run around doing odd jobs for Mr. Zheng like a servant?\"\n\nWang Ke's explanation made a lot of sense.\n\nBecause he couldn't have predicted what was happening now and started acting for Zhou Ze in the past.\n\n\"So, you called me here, to consult on this case and show me evidence, and that was just a pretense?\" Zhou Ze exhaled a smoke ring, then flicked the ash, watching it fall onto the study carpet, and slowly said,\n\n\"Your real purpose is that you're afraid of dying and you want me to protect you?\"\n\n\"Don't make me out to be so pathetic,\" Wang Ke took off his wire-rimmed glasses and rubbed his temples. \"The psychological profile I created, the final portrait I drew, it really looks like you.\n\nI called you here to confess to you, because I think those people might have been killed by you. Your identity... well, I know about it.\n\nIf it was you, wouldn't it be simpler for me to call you over?\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. \"I'm not that free.\"\n\n\"If it's not you, then I might die tonight or tomorrow,\" Wang Ke shook his head, somewhat helplessly.\n\n\"I'll stay until tomorrow, you'd better pray the killer comes for you tonight.\"\n\nThe implication was,\n\nNo later than that.\n\nZhou Ze couldn't be Wang Ke's personal bodyguard.\n\n\"What about your wife and daughter?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"I told them to get some rest upstairs early. I don't want to disturb her. Fortunately, the killer is only targeting people in the photo right now, and hasn't shown any intention of wiping out entire families.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded upon hearing this.\n\nWalking out of the study, Zhou Ze saw the old Taoist priest had eaten all three bowls of meat soup from the coffee table and was now leaning back on the sofa, rubbing his belly contentedly.\n\n\"Was it good?\" Wang Ke asked the old Taoist priest.\n\n\"It was delicious, the craftsmanship is incredible, and the meat was very fragrant,\" the old Taoist priest praised.\n\n\"Heh heh, this is fresh pork my wife specially bought from a farmer today.\"\n\n\"Thoughtful,\" the old Taoist priest licked his lips.\n\n\"There's more in the pot; I'll heat it up later.\"\n\n\"That would be great,\" the old Taoist priest clearly hadn't had enough. After he digested a bit, he could eat more.\n\nJust then, a woman's voice came from upstairs:\n\n\"Darling, do we have guests?\"\n\n\"Yes, you go back to rest.\"\n\n\"Okay, darling, you finish up and rest early too. I'll clean the kitchen tomorrow.\"\n\nThe woman, having spoken from the stair landing, turned and walked back into the bedroom.\n\nShe lay down on the bed, a large red bed that looked festive, though also a bit rustic.\n\nEven in rural areas, very few homes used such bright red bedspreads anymore.\n\nAnd,\n\nAt the edge of the bedsheet,\n\nDrops of crimson,\n\nWere dripping down,\n\nPooling beneath the bed,\n\nDrip,\n\nDrip,\n\nDrip...",

    "content": "Wang Ke’s life was very boring and monotonous. He was a workaholic, constantly striving for his future, climbing relentlessly.\n\nThose who grew up in poverty often have a greater obsession with money when they become adults, yearning for the sense of security that financial accumulation brings.\n\nMoreover, it’s difficult for people from normal families to understand the psychology of children who grew up in orphanages. What they lack is more than just the simple “financial security.”\n\nZhou Ze, in the past, was the same. However, after living a second life, Zhou Ze had become much lazier and more open-minded.\n\nThere’s no obsession that “dying once” can’t solve.\n\nIf not,\n\nThen die a few more times,\n\nAnd you’ll see things more clearly.\n\nWang Ke suggested playing poker. Zhou Ze was noncommittal, Bai Yingying disdained the idea, and the old道ist wanted to participate but playing poker with just two people was impossible, so they had to give up.\n\nIn the end, Wang Ke directly pulled out his patients’ medical records for study, immediately starting work. It was clear how terrified he truly was.\n\nZhou Ze looked at this “elder brother” he grew up with in the orphanage, as if seeing his former self.\n\nEven before dying, they wanted to possess more, pursue more. Everyone enjoyed the pleasure that work brought, that accumulation and the satisfaction similar to a squirrel hiding nuts in its tree hollow.\n\nRegardless of whether there was a tomorrow, they had to work.\n\nOutside the window, light began to appear. A night had passed, somewhat slowly, yet also somewhat quickly. The zombie didn’t come. No one knocked on the door, and no one broke through the window. Tonight was very peaceful.\n\nZhou Ze deliberately waited a while longer, until morning, before intending to get up.\n\n“That’s enough for today. I’m going back.”\n\nWang Ke didn’t shamelessly beg Zhou Ze not to leave and to continue protecting him. He kept his head down, still looking at his medical records. When Zhou Ze bid farewell, he finally looked up, stretched tiredly, and smiled at Zhou Ze:\n\n“Have breakfast before you go.”\n\nThe old道ist really wanted to nod, but he had to look at Zhou Ze’s expression. For the old道ist, he was extremely satisfied with the Wang family’s food: delicate, exquisite, focused on taste enjoyment rather than simply filling the stomach.\n\n“No, no need to trouble yourselves.”\n\nZhou Ze maintained a respectful distance from anything related to “eating” in the Wang family.\n\nUpon hearing this, the old道ist was a bit disappointed. Actually, he had quite a good meal yesterday, eating so many odd things without getting a stomach ache.\n\n“Are the guests leaving?”\n\nAt this moment, Wang Ke’s wife came down the stairs.\n\nShe was wearing a black nightgown, and because guests were present, she had put on an extra white jacket, but her graceful figure was still evident.\n\nA charming young woman, full of allure.\n\nBai Yingying stood behind Zhou Ze, gently tugging his arm. Zhou Ze followed her gaze and saw a string of red marks on Wang Ke’s wife’s left calf.\n\nIt looked like blood, winding its way down from the depths of a dense forest along a stream’s path, leaving traces of the years’ tribulations.\n\n“Darling, last night, I accidentally knocked over my bottle of red nail polish without even noticing. When I woke up this morning and saw that red puddle on the floor, it scared me half to death.\n\nI watched a horror movie recently, you know, and I thought you were like the male lead in the movie, eating me while I slept.”\n\nWang Ke’s wife walked up to Wang Ke, reaching out to caress his chin. Her husband hadn’t slept all night, and she felt a pang of sympathy.\n\n“You’re too thin, I wouldn’t be full,” Wang Ke chuckled in reply. “Go make breakfast.”\n\n“No, thank you, sister-in-law.”\n\nZhou Ze refused again.\n\n“We’ll be going now. If anything happens, you can come find me at my bookstore. Oh, by the way, my bookstore has moved to South Street now, it’s not far from here.”\n\nZhou Ze meant that if they truly sensed something was wrong, they could come to his bookstore for refuge.\n\nThis was the most Zhou Ze could do. He couldn’t stay by Wang Ke’s side 24 hours a day, protecting him without fail. Besides, today was Qingming Festival, precisely when his bookstore’s “business was good.”\n\nMany new customers would flock to the bookstore due to the Qingming Festival. This was big business, like a peak season, and Zhou Ze didn’t want to miss it.\n\nDeclining Wang Ke and his wife’s attempts to keep them, Zhou Ze and the two others walked out of the Wang family villa.\n\nJust outside, Zhou Ze stopped, turning to look at the balcony.\n\nWang Ke’s daughter should still be sleeping. It was the Qingming Festival holiday, so she didn’t have to go to school.\n\nThe little loli likely hadn’t returned, or perhaps, she couldn’t return at all. In fact, if the little loli had returned, Wang Ke’s worries would probably have been unnecessary. If that zombie truly intended to seek revenge on the Wang family, it might very well have gone there only to never return.\n\n“Boss, was that… really red nail polish?” Bai Yingying asked from behind Zhou Ze.\n\n“It could also be menstruation, and she found an excuse to avoid embarrassment.”\n\n“…………” Bai Yingying.\n\nZhou Ze suddenly thought of a question, looking at Bai Yingying, and said, “You should have stopped, right?”\n\n“…………” Bai Yingying.\n\nHow could she possibly answer that? And besides, how would a zombie have such a thing!\n\nThe three walked to the community entrance. Since it was morning, it was quite lively, with many street stalls already open.\n\nNo matter what malicious events had recently occurred, people’s lives always had to continue.\n\nA middle-aged man with all his limbs intact knelt on the ground, holding a bowl, begging. He looked somewhat pitiful, dirty, and kept muttering “ah ah ah,” like a mute.\n\nWhen the old道ist passed by, the beggar reached out and grabbed the old道ist’s pant leg, signaling for him to give him something. The old道ist, after all, was dressed as a monk, seemingly easier to scam money from.\n\nBegging was also a profession that required rich experience, and it also involved distinguishing and focusing on one’s clientele.\n\nWho knew the old道ist would just wave his sleeve, pushing away the hand that was grabbing him, and at the same time spit at the beggar, scolding:\n\n“With hands and feet, and younger than this poor道ist, what good thing can’t you do, yet you choose to beg here? You’ve completely disgraced your ancestors!”\n\nGiven the old道ist’s age and status, saying these words was perfectly justified.\n\nHe was old, yet he still live-streamed, and served ghosts. He was usually quite frugal, but Zhou Ze had heard from Bai Yingying that the old道ist apparently sponsored several poor students in the mountains.\n\nUpon hearing this, the beggar seemed to become infuriated, immediately standing up. All they heard was a scream, and then he fell to the ground, flailing his arms and legs, crying “Ah ah ah ah!”\n\nHis direct meaning was that the old道ist had hit him; his implied meaning was that he was going to extort money.\n\nThe old道ist saw this scene and was so angry he almost laughed, wishing he could truly go up and punch this scoundrel a few times.\n\nOf course, onlookers also began to appear around them. Everyone came with the mentality of watching a show, and no one spoke up for the beggar or stood up for him.\n\nIn this day and age, people’s compassion had long been exhausted by countless beggar-scammers. Sympathy for the weak is human nature, but in this era, sometimes those who appear to be “weak” often have reversals, and their lives might be better than those who sympathize with them.\n\nZhou Ze, however, frowned slightly. He didn’t want to waste any time on such matters, so he gave Bai Yingying a meaningful look.\n\nBai Yingying understood and moved closer to the crowd.\n\nThe beggar felt a chilling coldness spread through his body, and he immediately jumped up, shouting:\n\n“I’m freezing to death! I’m freezing to death!”\n\nHe could speak now, and laughter immediately erupted from the crowd. Although they didn’t understand why, everyone found it amusing.\n\nThe beggar scurried away in embarrassment.\n\nThe old道ist sniffed and sighed, “Some people deserve to be poor.”\n\nZhou Ze smiled, not mentioning that he had seen an iPhone X in the beggar’s pocket earlier.\n\nThe three had breakfast together at the community entrance. Bai Yingying thoughtfully brought plum juice, and this time Zhou Ze ate more. He hadn’t touched his supper last night and indeed needed to eat to replenish his energy.\n\nAfter eating, Bai Yingying prepared to hail a taxi back to the bookstore.\n\nJust then, an elderly man with white hair and a hunched back walked past them. The old man carried a bag in his left hand and a plastic bag in his right, as if he had just returned from buying groceries.\n\nWhat drew attention was that the old man’s left hand, holding the bag, only had two fingers. This was a genuine amputee.\n\nThe old道ist saw this and proactively stepped forward, asking if he needed help.\n\nThe old man shook his head, indicating no.\n\nThe old道ist said, “Elder brother, it’s alright. You live in this community, right? I’ll help you carry it back.”\n\nBut the old man still smiled and insisted on shaking his head, indicating he could manage on his own and didn’t need help, even though carrying things with only two fingers looked very difficult for him.\n\nThe old man walked on, presumably living in the same community as Wang Ke.\n\nThe old道ist let out a long sigh and said, “People are indeed different. A young person with all their limbs intact kneels on the ground, wanting to get something for nothing, begging for free food.\n\nBut this disabled old man, even older than me, still maintains his dignity and pride.\n\nCheers! This morning’s dose of wisdom is satisfying. I feel energized and full of positive energy for the day.”\n\nThe old道ist mumbled to himself and felt self-satisfied, which is common for anyone who has received such “chicken soup for the soul,” as if their spirit had been purified in an instant.\n\n“He dropped something,” Zhou Ze prompted.\n\n“What? Did he drop his wallet? Then I should quickly return it to him. He’s so old, it’s easy for him to forget things, and his memory won’t be good. It’s not easy for him.”\n\nThe old道ist said this while looking at Zhou Ze, then he froze, his face showing a horrified expression.\n\nZhou Ze was holding a middle finger joint in his hand, its tip still stained with blood, and even faintly steaming. It was truly fresh.\n\n“You’re right, as people get older, their memory gets worse.\n\nEven when a finger drops off,\n\nThey don’t notice.”",

    "content": "\"Knock, knock, knock... Knock, knock, knock...\"\n\nOutside, a knocking sound came. Wang Ke, still seated on the living room sofa, raised his head, straightened his clothes, and walked to the entrance. He glanced at the monitor; the camera outside showed a hunched old man.\n\nThe old man had his head down, so his true face couldn't be seen.\n\nWang Ke wasn't planning to open the door.\n\nBut then, with a \"click,\"\n\nThe door opened.\n\nWang Ke stepped back, and the old man appeared at the doorway.\n\nFrom the doorway, a chilling wind blew in, and the surrounding temperature gradually dropped.\n\nWith a \"thud,\"\n\nThe plastic bag the old man was carrying fell, spilling some pickled vegetables, ginger, garlic, and other ingredients.\n\n\"Going to cook later.\"\n\nThe old man's voice was somewhat thick, not like a young girl's soft voice, but more like a sound made by a throat full of fluid.\n\nWang Ke took a deep breath. At this moment, he was even calm enough to take off his glasses, wipe them, and put them back on, saying:\n\n\"Although I know the probability of convincing you is small, I still have to try. I really have nothing to do with that hospital.\"\n\n\"Oh.\"\n\nThe old man responded, then lifted his head. His skin began to wrinkle. Earlier, it only had some age spots, but now, it had completely turned into shriveled elm bark.\n\nRough and cracked, his eye sockets also sunken, and in his hollow eyes, a green flame flickered.\n\n\"Who cares?\"\n\nThe old man took a step forward, closing the distance between himself and Wang Ke.\n\n\"Others don't care about the cheap lives of people like us, so why should I care about others' lives?\"\n\nWatching the old man steadily close the distance, Wang Ke sighed, \"I consider myself a good person, and I sympathize with your experience.\n\nAlthough I don't know what you've been through...\"\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nBefore Wang Ke could finish his rambling, he was knocked to the ground. The old man's strength was immense, so much so that Wang Ke, an adult man, was like a small chick in front of him.\n\nThe fall was severe. Wang Ke's left arm was immediately fractured, and he didn't know how many ribs were broken in his chest.\n\n\"Sorry, I'm not a police officer, and I don't care about evidence when I act.\"\n\nThe old man squatted beside Wang Ke.\n\n\"In short, everyone in that photo, everyone related to that hospital, must die.\"\n\nAfter speaking, the old man reached out and patted Wang Ke's face. Several of the old man's fingers were missing, and green pus oozed continuously from the broken parts, looking very disgusting.\n\nWang Ke let out a long breath, enduring the intense pain. He seemed to have resigned himself to his fate.\n\nJust then, the old man looked up at the staircase. Wang Ke's wife stood there, staring blankly at everything below. The woman had changed from pajamas into sportswear, seemingly planning to go for a morning run.\n\n\"Go back to sleep, obediently. I don't kill women.\"\n\nThe old man grinned grimly, stood up, and dragged Wang Ke by the ankle. He walked in front, with Wang Ke being dragged behind him. Together, they entered the kitchen.\n\nWang Ke's wife came down from upstairs and stood at the kitchen doorway.\n\nThe old man looked at the woman at the door with some surprise. He seemed prepared to react, but he had expected the woman to call the police, but she didn't.\n\nHe had expected the woman to grab something and fight him to rescue her husband, but she didn't do that either.\n\nIn fact, the old man thought the woman screaming, crying, begging, or running away were all understandable reactions, but the woman's next response was somewhat astonishing.\n\nThe woman paused at the kitchen doorway for a moment, then turned and carried the pickled vegetables and other ingredients the old man had brought inside. She actively took out various seasonings from the kitchen cabinet and began washing pots and bowls for the old man.\n\nWang Ke, lying on the floor, wiped his face when he saw this scene, and said helplessly:\n\n\"Wife, you're having another episode.\"\n\nThe old man was also bewildered by the woman's actions. Since he couldn't figure it out, he stopped thinking about it. The old man picked up Wang Ke, pressed his neck into the sink, turned on the faucet, and began rinsing him with cold water.\n\nThe woman next to him picked up a knife, but instead of attacking the old man, she began to slice garlic and chop green onions for him at a rapid speed, demonstrating her culinary skill. At the same time, she opened the gas valve, poured oil into the wok, and lit the fire.\n\nIt was already clear what the old man intended to do with all those ingredients, and the woman seemed to be helping him.\n\nThe kitchen was harmonious, everyone performing their roles, all working towards preparing a delicious dish.\n\nWang Ke didn't resist; he also knew he couldn't resist anymore.\n\nThe old man reached out, grabbed Wang Ke's hair, and lifted his head. Then, the old man's fingernails repeatedly moved across Wang Ke's facial skin.\n\nLike a customer at a market, choosing which cut of meat to buy.\n\n\"Stir-fry first, then boil the bones for soup. Delicious.\"\n\nWang Ke's wife stood by and said to the old man. She spoke very earnestly, indicating she had given it deep thought. At the same time, she swallowed, a little hungry.\n\nThe old man seemed to have gotten used to this eccentric victim's wife and actually pondered for a moment before agreeing with her suggestion.\n\nThe old man was about to use his fingernails to cut the meat, but Wang Ke's wife actively handed him the cleaver, signaling him to use it.\n\nShe pointed at the old man's fingernails and said, \"Dirty, unsanitary.\"\n\nAn experienced housewife knows that the freshness of ingredients often determines the quality of a dish. One must be as meticulous and demanding as possible with ingredients, ensuring no external factors affect the taste. This is being responsible for oneself and for one's family.\n\nAnd the old man, who had already become a cadaveric ghoul and had \"eaten\" more than a dozen hospital people to replenish himself, was quite the gourmand.\n\nHe well knew that differences in a person's gender, age, work environment, and physique often determined variations in flavor. The old man favored Wang Ke, who had plenty of lean meat, was middle-aged and not greasy, and had well-developed bones, making him very suitable for consumption.\n\nThis was a gift from nature, and the old man knew the secret to cooking this dish. This was the last person he intended to kill, so he planned to treat himself in a more ceremonious way.\n\nHe believed that this method could soothe the anger and sorrow he experienced before his death. This was the miraculous effect of food.\n\nThe green flame in the old man's eyes flickered. He took the knife, but with so few fingers, he held it somewhat unsteadily, yet still managed to grip the handle with his remaining fingers.\n\nWang Ke was shaking, so the old man flipped the knife and hit the back of Wang Ke's head with the blunt side. Wang Ke immediately passed out, much like stunning a fish before cleaning it.\n\nAnd then,\n\nThe old man's knife fell!\n\n\"Clang!\"\n\nWith a crisp sound,\n\nThe knife in the old man's hand flew off. A long tongue, appearing from nowhere, lashed out like a whip, striking the old man's wrist and sweeping the knife away.\n\nWang Ke's wife turned around and looked behind her.\n\nThe old man also looked at the kitchen doorway, where a small loli stood.\n\nThe small loli had her mouth open, half of her tongue still hanging out. The cleaver lay at her feet. Her eyes sparkled with intimidating light, but one of her hands was actually gripping the doorframe to support herself, clearly indicating that she was already at the end of her rope, on the verge of collapsing.\n\nWang Ke's wife looked at the small loli and gently beckoned, saying:\n\n\"Rui Rui is awake. Come, brush your teeth and wash your face. The soup will be ready soon.\n\nIt's soup made from Daddy's meat. It's very delicious. The bowl is full of thick fatherly love.\"\n\nThe small loli gave the woman in front of her a complicated look. She was still ecstatic beyond words.\n\nThe old man slightly tilted his head, staring at the small loli.\n\n\"The Underworld has its order; the Yellow Springs can be crossed!\"\n\nThe small loli gathered her strength,\n\nHer tongue extended again,\n\n\"The mortal world is not a place for rogue spirits like you to run wild. You are merely a cadaveric ghoul, not yet qualified to transcend!\"\n\nThe tongue shot out again, striking the old man's chest.\n\nWith a crisp \"crack,\"\n\nThe old man's chest immediately caved in, and he flew backward, crashing into the tiled wall. A concave dent and a large area of cracks appeared on the wall behind him.\n\nBut the old man, with a hole in his chest, slowly got back up.\n\nHis fingernails were black and long, and pus began to drip from the corners of his mouth, but he stood up again and continued to look at the small loli:\n\n\"There really is... the Yellow Springs?\"\n\nThe old man seemed bewildered,\n\nHe seemed to be thinking of his own relatives.\n\nEveryone has a Yellow Springs complex because everyone, as they grow up, inevitably experiences the passing of loved ones.\n\nIn Chinese eyes, the Yellow Springs is a place to mourn the departed.\n\nThe small loli's tongue extended again, but this time, its force was clearly much weaker than before.\n\nThe old man stretched out both hands, grabbing the tongue. His body trembled, but he wasn't thrown back again. Then, his fingernails began to fiercely cut the long tongue.\n\n\"Pfft!\"\n\nThe tongue snapped,\n\nThe small loli fell to her knees, her body convulsing, the light in the depths of her eyes flickering between clear and hazy.\n\nShe had barely escaped from Rongcheng,\n\nUnexpectedly, an unformed cadaveric ghoul chose this moment to break into her home!\n\nIn any other time, if such a character dared to offend her, she would surely have annihilated him, body and soul!\n\n\"Are you... a Ghost Messenger? There really is an Underworld, and a Netherworld?\"\n\nThe old man's appearance was terrifying, with a large hole in his chest and pus everywhere on his body. He first mumbled to himself, then began to roar madly:\n\n\"If there's an Underworld, if there's a Netherworld, then why haven't those who deserve to go to hell gone to hell?!\n\nThose villains, those criminals, can still continue to harm people in the living world!\n\nI... I... I'll eat all of you, all you useless, incompetent wretches,\n\nI'll chop you all up and throw you into the pot to boil!\"\n\nAs the old man spoke, he picked up the unconscious Wang Ke again. With a \"clatter,\" he swept aside the previous pot, and the blue flame on the gas stove continued to rise.\n\nThe old man grinned grimly, poised to put Wang Ke's head into the flames.\n\nThe small loli struggled to lift her head,\n\nAnd snapped:\n\n\"How much longer are you going to watch? I understand you don't want me to live, but are you going to leave even your childhood friend to die?\"\n\n\"I really didn't expect you were already back.\"\n\nFrom the entrance, Zhou Ze's figure emerged. He walked up to the small loli, looking at her kneeling on the ground with her butt sticking out.\n\nA strange, low-level pleasure, typical of a low-level extra who doesn't survive half a scene, inexplicably arose in his heart.\n\nIn short, it was the triumph of a petty person!\n\nYou have your day too.\n\n\"Come on, Uncle will give you a pat.\"\n\nWith that, Zhou Ze reached out and ruffled the small loli's head.\n\nHeh heh,\n\nYou actually have your day today.\n\nThe small loli bit her lip tightly, her eyes full of shame and indignation, and she squeezed out two words:\n\n\"Save him.\"\n\n\"You really think of him as your father?\"\n\nZhou Ze was a bit surprised.\n\nZhou Ze knew she was injured, and she could have stayed upstairs, but she still appeared. It seemed his childhood friend wasn't entirely useless; he could make a Ghost Messenger willing to risk her life for him.\n\nOn the other hand, looking at himself,\n\nHe was now practically a villain.\n\nHe even felt a bit like he was being a jerk.\n\nTesting whether the small loli had returned was just a spur-of-the-moment idea, but if Zhou Ze had intervened earlier, Wang Ke would at least have been spared the physical pain.\n\nZhou Ze was also a bit lost in thought; people really do change.\n\nHe used to be so kind and righteous, a doctor with a parent's heart.\n\nNow, he seemed much more selfish than before.\n\nOf course, Zhou Ze had to be cautious; the small loli's existence was a concern for him, and he had to treat it carefully.\n\nThe old man was startled when Zhou Ze walked in, but seeing that Zhou Ze ignored him and only spoke to the little girl without even looking at him, he didn't hesitate, continuing to push Wang Ke's head towards the flame.\n\n\"Woof woof woof!\"\n\nA barking sound came from outside the kitchen window,\n\nThen,\n\nA long, white figure directly shattered the window glass and flew in, knocking the old man to the ground. Wang Ke also rolled to the side, escaping the fate of being roasted, at least for now.\n\nThe old man quickly bounced up and grabbed at the white figure. Immediately, dull thuds constantly echoed in the kitchen, as if two people were swinging large hammers and fiercely smashing things.\n\nNext,\n\nIt was a battle between the domesticated and the wild.",

    "content": "For a long time, Zhou Ze hadn't seen Bai Yingying fight. Bai Yingying's daily routine was cleaning, being a sales clerk, playing PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds, and sleeping with him.\n\nBut Zhou Ze never forgot the first time he and Xu Qinglang properly faced a reanimated Bai Yingying.\n\nWhy was Bai Yingying so docile?\n\nBecause she had been thoroughly *handled* by him before.\n\nBut that didn't mean she had truly become a little quail. For instance, the last time Zhou Ze saw Bai Yingying playing games, her essence wasn't that of a soft-spoken girl.\n\nZombies are, after all, zombies. Some fierce traits ingrained in their bones won't be erased, just as Zhou Ze himself isn't entirely conscious of what he does after \"drinking himself into a blackout.\"\n\nIf zombies were truly gentle and obedient babies, Madam Bai wouldn't have specifically instructed Zhou Ze to cremate her body with bamboo at the next *Han Yi Festival* when she went to hell.\n\nThat old man, referred to as a \"corpse demon\" by the little loli, Zhou Ze didn't know what the term meant, but he could probably infer that it was inferior to a proper zombie.\n\nAt least Bai Yingying wouldn't suddenly have a finger break off while carrying a plastic bag, nor would she constantly ooze disgusting acid from her entire body. If Bai Yingying were like that, Zhou Ze would rather continue sleeping in the freezer than have her sleep beside him.\n\nHe might even burn Bai Yingying as a sacrifice to the heavens without hesitation when the *Han Yi Festival* arrived.\n\nSo, this is a society that values looks, after all. Many people, after being hurt in a beauty contest, might say grudgingly, \"What's inside matters most.\"\n\nBut in reality, even after you die, having good looks is still a very important thing.\n\n\"Boom! Boom! Boom!\"\n\nA series of rumbling sounds came from the kitchen.\n\nThe floor was cracked.\n\nThe walls were dented.\n\nThe duel between two corpses, both immensely powerful, naturally caused quite a commotion. But it was clear that Bai Yingying had the upper hand and even had energy to spare.\n\nMoreover, the old man had already been severely injured by the little loli earlier.\n\n\"Boom!\"\n\nWith a loud crash, Bai Yingying directly slammed the old man onto the floor. For a moment, fluids splattered.\n\nThe old man's body was already battered beyond recognition, looking like the skeleton sailors often seen in *Pirates of the Caribbean*, with only a few scraps of flesh haphazardly adorning his frame.\n\n\"Clap, clap, clap, clap, clap!!!!\"\n\nThe old Taoist, who had been observing from outside the entrance, finally walked in at this moment, applauding and cheering for Bai Yingying, shouting, \"Yingying, you're the fattest!\"\n\n\"Shasha sha...\"\n\nDragging the old man's body, Bai Yingying emerged from the kitchen. Several green streaks were left on the tiles where the old man had slid.\n\nBut he wasn't dead. He really wasn't dead.\n\nRegardless of anything else, just looking at his vitality was terrifying enough.\n\nAnd Bai Yingying was like a cute little puppy.\n\nAt Zhou Ze's command,\n\nShe rushed out, pinned down the prey, and then dragged it before Zhou Ze, presenting it to him.\n\nZhou Ze crouched down in front of the old man. He looked at the old man, and the old man looked back at him.\n\n\"You... you're also a ghost messenger...\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"A blind ghost messenger...\"\n\nThe old man spat at Zhou Ze. If his chin hadn't been devoid of flesh, a couple of thick phlegm blobs would surely have flown out.\n\n\"I've always been curious about something. That day at the hospital, were you also watching?\"\n\n\"I wasn't there,\" the old man replied. \"So... the people in the hospital... were they... knocked out by you?\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't answer.\n\n\"Those people... are scum...\" the old man repeated.\n\n\"Mm,\" Zhou Ze agreed.\n\n\"Scum should be killed, should be eaten!\" the old man stubbornly insisted. \"Heaven didn't let me die completely... it was so that I... I could clean up... clean them up.\"\n\n\"What about him?\" Zhou Ze pointed at the unconscious Wang Ke.\n\nThe old man hesitated. After Bai Yingying's thorough beating, his anger had subsided significantly.\n\nSo, when you're in a bad mood, you can go to a street billiard hall or dance hall, flick boogers at the tattooed or sleazy-looking guys gathered there, and you'll immediately feel better.\n\n\"I don't know...\" the old man answered.\n\nWang Ke, in that situation, could still calmly explain himself. Even when his life was threatened, he continued to articulate his thoughts. This, in itself, spoke volumes.\n\nEither this guy had long since put life and death out of his mind and wasn't afraid to die, or he had a clear conscience, willing to die but not to have a bucket of feces dumped on his head.\n\n\"But you still intended to kill him and cook his flesh. You've gotten addicted to eating people, haven't you?\" Zhou Ze chuckled.\n\nThe old man remained silent.\n\n\"You say Heaven didn't let you die, for some unknown reason, turning you into this neither-man-nor-ghost state, as if great responsibilities were to befall you.\n\nI also admit, those scumbags in the hospital, even I wished they would all report to hell sooner.\n\nBut you've developed a habit, you've slowly stopped caring whether the people you kill are right or wrong, because you've become infatuated with this feeling.\n\nI once heard a story about a prosecutor abroad. In his early years, he arrested some corrupt officials, gaining great fame. Later, to sustain that feeling, he used illegal means and even deliberately framed and incriminated some high-ranking officials to build his reputation. What he did, in fact, is just like you.\"\n\nZhou Ze reached out and gently patted the old man's face, then regretted the action and wiped his hand on the old Taoist's pant leg.\n\n\"...\" The old Taoist.\n\n\"When you gaze into the abyss, the abyss also gazes into you;\n\nYou just haven't noticed it yourself.\"\n\nZhou Ze slowly stood up. \"Alright, that's enough talk. You must be tired of listening. It's time for you to be on your way.\"\n\n\"I refuse... The suffering... and persecution... my family and I endured... why did no one... no one care... about me and my family...\"\n\nZhou Ze made a cutting gesture and shook his head,\n\n\"I can guess your story must be very sad and tragic. You must have suffered greatly from that hospital's poisoning. If told, it would surely bring tears to those who hear it.\n\nBut pity and suffering cannot be a reason for your violence.\n\nBecause in this world, there are countless pitiable people, and countless people who have endured hardship.\n\nThe vast majority of people are overcoming hardships, facing new lives with a positive attitude.\n\nEven if some abandon themselves because of it, that's their own business. They haven't harmed others, just suffered their sorrow alone.\n\nSo, what makes you so special?\n\nThat's not a reason. It never will be.\"\n\nThe old man remained silent upon hearing this.\n\n\"So, the program I despise the most is the one where reporters interview murderers. In it, they're always repenting, always complaining about how miserable their lives were before, how pitiful they are.\n\nEven the prison authorities and reporters will contact the victims' families, asking them to forgive the criminals, so that the criminals can be better reformed and become new people.\n\nHow wonderful?\n\nHow touching?\n\nThey even have to strip the victims' families of their right to 'hate'.\n\nBut unfortunately, this show is still quite popular, after all, there are many people who like to defecate from a moral high ground.\"\n\nAfter mumbling to himself for a bit, Zhou Ze looked at the old Taoist again: \"I said so much, so I'll charge more for it. Nowadays, even high-end funeral homes offer psychological counseling services for families. Consider this an extra service from me. When you go down, give me more spirit money, understand?\"\n\nThe old man slowly closed his eyes and sighed.\n\n\"You still have a soul, don't you? Or some kind of conscious entity, since you're not a proper zombie. Now, float out of your body, and I'll send you to hell.\"\n\nThe old man lowered his drooping hand, seemingly resigned to his fate. As for whether he found any peace, Zhou Ze didn't know and didn't care.\n\nHowever,\n\nIn the next moment,\n\nThe old man's body suddenly spasmed. His nearly severed neck actually lifted, and he bared his fangs, biting towards Zhou Ze's body!\n\n\"Pfft!\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't move, but his fingernail directly pierced the old man's body. The black aura swirling within his nail began to rage madly through the old man's body. This was a form of torture beyond ordinary understanding, even surpassing the physical blows Bai Yingying had inflicted earlier.\n\nThe old man hadn't even bitten Zhou Ze before he began to wail. He was in agony, utterly tormented, and he was begging, pleading for Zhou Ze to withdraw his nail.\n\nBut Zhou Ze remained motionless, calmly watching the old man writhe in extreme pain before him.\n\nClearly, all of Zhou Ze's previous rambling, all that psychological counseling, had been useless.\n\nThis also showed that the program exploring the pitiful and sunny side of murderers' hearts was also useless. Many people have impulses and feelings of hatred, but normally they wouldn't kill innocent people under the guise of impulse and anger. Once they do, they are no longer human; they are beasts.\n\n\"Actually, I don't hate you as much as you might imagine,\" Zhou Ze said faintly. \"But you can no longer control yourself. You are ultimately not a knight who slays demons; in fact, you've become a demon awaiting a knight's slaying.\"\n\nUnder the pressure of Zhou Ze's fingernail, a black light cluster drifted out of the old man's body.\n\nZhou Ze opened the gates of hell,\n\nReached out, grabbed the light cluster, and threw it in.\n\nZhou Ze didn't scatter the old man's soul and even sent him to hell, giving him a glimmer of hope. This wasn't entirely because he was reluctant to part with the performance points, but rather because at the hospital entrance, he himself had harbored the idea of using others to do his dirty work and watching from the sidelines.\n\nHowever, Zhou Ze instinctively reached out, took out his small notebook, and then his eyes immediately widened!\n\nDamn it!\n\nThe performance record showed: fifty percent!\n\nIn other words, this one case with the old man was worth the sum of all the ghost performances he had sent down before!\n\nZhou Ze felt a bit of regret. He should have known not to send him down so quickly. He should have first asked if he had any fellow practitioners, or if they were also hidden in this city.\n\nThe little loli, still kneeling on the ground, watched Zhou Ze take out a small notebook, and a look of horror appeared on her face.\n\nThe shocking part wasn't just the document itself, but what that notebook represented!\n\nShe suddenly remembered what the Faceless Woman had said to her at the underworld shop: In her opinion, the prey in their eyes was far less important than that guy from Tongcheng!\n\nAt that moment, Wang Ke's wife suddenly walked over with a knife, fork, and plate, knelt beside the old man's broken body, cut off a piece of flesh, placed it on the plate, then speared the meat with the fork, and prepared to put it in her mouth.\n\nThe old man reacted quickly and stopped her. She was still struggling, shouting:\n\n\"Let me eat, let me eat, let me eat...\"\n\nZhou Ze walked over to the little loli, looked at her kneeling on the ground, then looked at Wang Ke's wife, and a hint of understanding appeared in his eyes.\n\nHe opened his mouth and asked:\n\n\"Is your mom sick?\"",

    "content": "The atmosphere in the bedroom instantly turned cold, a killing aura slowly beginning to fill the space.\n\nStrike her while she’s down!\n\nBesides, from the very beginning, he and the little loli had been in a life-or-death confrontation, and it was the little loli herself who had caused all of this.\n\nTo destroy her and extract the last bit of valuable essence from her, Zhou Ze felt no psychological burden whatsoever.\n\nThe little loli looked at Zhou Ze, then slowly opened her mouth:\n\n“Do you want to be a constable?”\n\nPeople on the verge of death always subconsciously grasp at any straw nearby to gain a sliver of hope for survival. The little loli before him was no exception.\n\nShe knew Zhou Ze wanted to kill her, and she knew Zhou Ze wanted to use her to gain a final bit of benefit and value, so she offered it willingly.\n\nMoreover, her original pride and courage had long been completely shattered in that netherworld shop in Rongcheng, on that night. While her physical injuries hadn’t recovered, her mental wounds hadn't either.\n\nThat night, she knelt in a corner, watching her colleagues, who had come with her, perish one by one, like fireworks. This scene had almost overturned her original worldview.\n\nUpon hearing the words \"constable,\" Zhou Ze remained impassive, merely sitting there quietly.\n\nHis implied meaning was: Please begin your performance.\n\nAnyway, listening wouldn't get him pregnant.\n\n“Do you know the two basic conditions for becoming a constable?”\n\nZhou Ze still didn’t answer, but he slightly raised his hand to his nose and sniffed.\n\nThe implication was: Don’t shout slogans at me, and don’t play with preambles. Speak properly, or I don’t mind re-experiencing the wonderful sensation of that unknowable spot.\n\nAnyway, you’re almost dead, and I can strike while the iron is hot.\n\nThe little loli took a deep breath. She wished she could tear Zhou Ze to pieces right now, but the tables had turned. She had returned severely injured from Rongcheng, and it was already a miracle that she hadn’t died. Now, she couldn’t even deal with a corpse demon.\n\nShe was the fish on the chopping block, and he was the knife. It was that simple.\n\n“There are two conditions to become a constable: one is to meet the performance points, and the other is to have three other ghost messengers willing to serve under your command, obey your orders, and recognize you as constable.”\n\nZhou Ze still said nothing.\n\n“To recognize you as constable, they must willingly offer their soul blood to be integrated into your identity badge, allowing you to control their life and death, making betrayal impossible.\n\nFulfilling these two conditions allows one to be promoted to constable. Afterwards, you can then strive for the position of patrol inspector.”\n\n“Recognize me as constable?” Zhou Ze chuckled. “If it’s that simple, wouldn’t you ghost messengers be fighting among yourselves first?”\n\nJust as the little loli often chanted the BGM slogan, “The Underworld has order, the Yellow Springs can be crossed,” if ghost messengers had to go through this process to become constables, and could casually force others to become their subordinates through life-or-death confrontations, wouldn't the entire ghost messenger circle become a chaotic arena for \"raising gu*\"?\n\nHowever, in Zhou Ze’s view, the ghost messenger circle was actually quite peaceful. Otherwise, the little loli wouldn’t have been able to summon so many ghost messengers to Rongcheng that time.\n\n“First, there’s only a difference in status between a constable and a ghost messenger, not a difference in strength. Only at the patrol inspector level does one receive a sealed certification from the Underworld, at which point one truly possesses a status superior to both ghost messengers and constables.\n\nSecond, as long as the constable one serves is promoted to patrol inspector, the previous contract automatically disappears, and one regains freedom.\n\nThird, you are coercing me right now. Although you are also a ghost messenger, your act of coercing a colleague must have been noted by the Underworld. If you kill another ghost messenger who has caused trouble, it’s like solving a problem for the Underworld, and there will be no repercussions.\n\nBut if you kill me, it will definitely be recorded by the Underworld. You might not feel it now, but in the future, when you seek further promotion, you will surely encounter trouble. Furthermore, if you continue to act so unrestrained, the Underworld will issue a warrant for your arrest, just like that person in Rongcheng last time.\n\nTherefore, while there is indeed coercion and an exchange of interests in the subordinate relationship among ghost messengers, there are rarely life-and-death forced subjugations because doing so isn’t worth it.\n\nWanting to be a constable is for the qualification to become a patrol inspector, to gain official status beyond being a mere yamen runner, and to have one's own spirit tablet in the Underworld, even if it's the lowest rank. So, not many lunatics would willingly use crude methods to coerce other ghost messengers just to become a constable.”\n\nZhou Ze extended his pinky finger and dug into his ear, saying, \"So, if I kill you, I'll still have trouble later?\"\n\n“Absolutely.”\n\n“Meaning, even if I become a constable, because of today’s incident, it will be difficult for me to become a so-called patrol inspector?”\n\n“Indeed.”\n\n“Then why shouldn’t I just kill you directly?”\n\n“You can use your performance and your actions to erase the negative impact of your coercion today. It’s not entirely impossible to advance further. I can... help you.\n\nBecause as long as you are not promoted, I must remain under you, with my life and death in your hands.”\n\nZhou Ze slowly stood up, pulled open the curtains, opened the French window, and walked out onto the balcony, saying:\n\n“The first time I came here, when I left the door, you were standing here watching me, right?”\n\nThe little loli didn’t understand what Zhou Ze meant.\n\nZhou Ze’s fingertips tapped lightly on the railing. He was hesitating and thinking.\n\nIn truth, Zhou Ze was a very conflicted person. He was a small figure, and he had never denied being one, neither in his previous life nor in this one.\n\nThe contradiction of a small figure lies in aspiring to freedom on one hand, and desiring to realize ambitions on the other, wanting to stand and admire the scenery, yet also thinking of kneeling to beg for progress.\n\nIf he were a powerful overlord, he would accept the little loli’s suggestion without hesitation. He wouldn’t care if she had wanted to kill him before; he would only care about the immediate benefits and progress.\n\nIf he were a free spirit, like the one in Rongcheng, he wouldn't care. He would only care about his own unrestrainedness, even if he was blacklisted, he would disdain it, thinking, \"Either you kill me, or I kill you.\"\n\nAnd Zhou Ze was exactly in between the two.\n\n“How about this, let’s flip a coin?”\n\nZhou Ze thought of a method and pulled a one-yuan coin from his pocket.\n\n“Heads, I kill you. Tails, I take you.”\n\nThe little loli’s eyes widened. She thought Zhou Ze was joking, deliberately humiliating her, to entrust her life to something like a coin toss!\n\nAre you a goddamn idiot?!\n\nThe little loli roared in anger internally!\n\nHer ten slender fingers gripped the bedsheet tightly. She hated that she was injured; otherwise, she would surely extract this person’s soul and burn it with hellfire a hundred times!\n\n“Here goes!”\n\nZhou Ze tossed the coin.\n\nThe coin spun continuously in the air.\n\nThe little loli’s eyes were fixed on the coin until it fell.\n\nZhou Ze bent down and looked at the coin on the floor.\n\nIt was the \"tails\" side.\n\nThe little loli let out a long sigh of relief. Although the process was absurd, in the end, she would live. Even if she was under someone else's control, at least she could survive.\n\nMoreover, the little loli had seen Zhou Ze’s ghost badge. She clearly knew which shadow stood behind that badge. Even if that shadow had vanished countless years ago, once, that Mount Tai had been a colossal entity that suppressed Hell!\n\nShe was willing to take a gamble. The future, in fact, was not entirely bleak. Because Zhou Ze did not seem like someone without good fortune. He was supposed to be her pre-planned performance target and substitute, but after she returned from Rongcheng, she found that everything had changed; he had gained status and controlled the situation.\n\nEven the appearance of the corpse demon today became an opportunity for him to force her to reveal herself, preventing her from hiding any longer.\n\nZhou Ze picked up the coin, smacked his lips, as if somewhat dissatisfied:\n\n“How about we flip it again?”\n\nThe little loli’s eyes instantly turned red, and her tongue extended, circling around her. She was going crazy; she was ready to fight!\n\n“Don’t get excited, don’t get excited. I know you have a long tongue and are good at it.\n\nDon’t get excited, I won’t flip it again.”\n\nZhou Ze walked up to the little loli, tilted his head slightly, and took out his ID booklet.\n\nThe little loli retracted her tongue, then slapped her forehead. Immediately, a black glowing bead floated out from there and merged into Zhou Ze’s ID booklet.\n\nZhou Ze licked his lips. In the unseen, it was as if another line had appeared in his heart, and this line concerned the little loli’s life and death.\n\nA life and death that he could sever with a single thought.\n\nThe little loli got off the bed and slowly knelt before Zhou Ze, a single knee on the floor, one hand resting on her knee, looking up, performing the bowing ritual of a subordinate to a superior.\n\n“Lin Ke, reporting to Constable!”\n\nLin Ke should be the name of the ghost messenger, and the name of this little loli's body seemed to be Wang Rui.\n\nAt this moment, the little loli, filled with anger and unwillingness, trembled slightly as she knelt, but she could only accept her fate!\n\nZhou Ze looked at the little loli beneath him,\n\nand slowly lifted his head.\n\nThe once arrogant and cold little loli, who had been so overbearing in front of him, was now kneeling at his feet.\n\nThis dramatic reversal, this mix of ice and fire,\n\nwas indeed very pleasant.\n\nJust then, the old Taoist priest came up the stairs. Wang Ke had woken up, and he was here to inform the boss.\n\nHe had just reached the stairs and gently pushed open the bedroom door,\n\nThen his eyes immediately widened!\n\nHe saw the little loli kneeling before Zhou Ze.\n\nDue to the obstruction of his view, Zhou Ze was blocking the old Taoist priest’s line of sight to the little loli. So, in the old Taoist priest’s field of vision,\n\nThe little loli was kneeling in front of the boss, her body trembling slightly,\n\nAnd the boss was looking up, hands on his hips, looking very pleased.\n\n“Hmm…”\n\nThe old Taoist priest gasped,\n\nDaring not to make a sound,\n\nHe quickly tiptoed backward, hurrying down the stairs, softly muttering:\n\n“Oh dear, truly a beast,\n\nThree years minimum, three years minimum;\n\nThe boss is such a beast.”\n\n---\nTranslator's Note:\n* \"raising gu\": A practice in ancient China involving placing multiple poisonous insects into a sealed container and letting them fight until only one survives.

    "content": "Wang Ke woke up. He was badly injured. When Zhou Ze went downstairs, he was still lying on the sofa, his face a bit pale, partly from fright, partly from his injuries.\n\n\"Do you need my help?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nWang Ke shook his head, then said, \"As long as you help me...\"\n\n\"Oh, then I'm leaving.\"\n\nZhou Ze saw Wang Ke shake his head and directly turned towards the entrance, as if he hadn't heard Wang Ke's \"subtlety\" just now.\n\nWang Ke: \"...\"\n\nStepping out the door, Bai Yingying and the old Taoist priest also followed.\n\nActually, for Zhou Ze, the matter here was already resolved. The remaining issues would be handled by the little loli. Judging by her actions of risking exposure to save Wang Ke, she still valued Wang Ke as her father very much.\n\nThis couldn't help but make Zhou Ze feel a certain emotion, though not for the sentiment of father-daughter love.\n\nRather, the ghost envoy who possessed his sister-in-law last time also seemed to have been influenced by the host, adopting the host's way of thinking, even going so far as to kill to fulfill the host's sister's unrequited love.\n\nAnd the little loli seemed to be the same, risking danger to save her father. Zhou Ze didn't think Wang Ke's personal charm was so great.\n\nSo,\n\nDoes this mean that ghost envoys or high-level ghosts can inhabit a person's body but will inevitably be affected by them?\n\nThen, was he also affected?\n\nIt seemed there was a period when that was true,\n\nFor example, that obsession that bothered him for a long time:\n\nAnyway, she's not sleeping with me?\n\nRight, that must be him being influenced by Xu Le;\n\nThe normal him couldn't possibly have such vulgar impulses in his mind.\n\nBut it seems the influence he experienced wasn't as severe as that on the two ghost envoys in the little loli and his sister-in-law. There must be some involvement and distinction here.\n\nFor example, they might keep the human host's soul intact for convenience when entering and exiting Hell, ensuring the body can continue to live for future use when their souls leave. However, with two souls in one body for a long time, some influence is inevitable.\n\nAs for Zhou Ze himself and Tang Shi, the body's original owner was dead, so there was no original soul getting in the way, and the influence was naturally smaller.\n\nEach has its pros and cons,\n\nFor example, Zhou Ze couldn't learn the little loli's \"biubiubiu\" technique.\n\nAfter hailing a taxi and returning to the bookstore, Zhou Ze yawned. He was a bit tired, but what surprised him was that there were still customers in the bookstore.\n\nHe checked the time; it was already past two in the morning.\n\nIf it were a customer who could send him Hell banknotes, Zhou Ze wouldn't be surprised, but this was a living person.\n\nA girl in a white dress sitting there, reading a book and playing with her phone.\n\nShe looked to be about twenty-five or twenty-six, with a pleasant appearance. Her reading habits were a bit unusual; she would mouth the words while reading, like an elementary school student learning a text for the first time.\n\nBai Yingying went to take a shower. After a big fight with that disgusting old man, she wasn't injured, but she was dirty. Having spent a long time with Zhou Ze, she naturally picked up some of his habits.\n\nOne must know she was a zombie lying underground for two hundred years. Zhou Ze didn't believe Madam Bai would frequently take her corpse out for a bath and a spa treatment.\n\nThe old Taoist priest went out to buy a late-night snack. With Xu Qinglang not at the shop these days, everyone's meal situation was a bit concerning, as Xu Qinglang usually handled all three meals.\n\nThinking of this, Zhou Ze felt a bit sad.\n\nIf Xu Qinglang didn't come back soon,\n\nHe'd be running out of this 'juice'.\n\nNot rushing upstairs, Zhou Ze poured two glasses of water and walked over to the girl. He placed one glass in front of her and sat on the sofa opposite.\n\nAlthough it was a bit disappointing that she wasn't a ghost, a visitor was still a guest, so he had to entertain her.\n\n\"Thank you.\"\n\nThe girl looked up at Zhou Ze, then lowered her head again to read the article in her hand, muttering softly.\n\nZhou Ze initially thought this was just her reading habit, but slowly he realized it wasn't right. She wasn't just muttering; she was reciting with emotion and feeling.\n\nAs if noticing Zhou Ze's gaze, the girl looked up and glanced at him again, then smiled.\n\n\"Are you the owner of this store?\" the girl asked.\n\nZhou Ze nodded, picked up his glass, and took a sip of water.\n\nComposure, he needed to be composed.\n\n\"How's the bookstore's business?\" the girl asked again.\n\nZhou Ze frowned. He hated it when people asked this question, because anyone who asked it had already figured out that the bookstore's business with living people wasn't good.\n\nBut he couldn't explain to them that he did business with the dead, so he could only silently endure their gaze that saw him as a fool with money to burn.\n\n\"It's alright.\"\n\n\"Oh, I think your store is great. Coming here at night to read books and drink a beverage, it has a wonderful atmosphere,\" the girl said.\n\n\"Mm.\"\n\nHaving just taken in the little loli, Zhou Ze was in a decent mood and willing to chat with the customer, so he asked,\n\n\"Are you a radio host?\"\n\nThe girl shook her head.\n\n\"Then you're an audio storyteller?\"\n\nThe girl smiled and nodded, \"Boss, you're very smart.\"\n\nThere was nothing smart about it; these days, there were only a few professions related to voice.\n\n\"What do you record?\"\n\n\"Novels.\" The girl took out her phone and asked, \"Boss, do you usually listen to audio novels?\"\n\nZhou Ze remembered that Xu Le's computer seemed to have many audio novels stored, such as the audio version of the *Bai Jie Stories* series.\n\n\"Occasionally,\" Zhou Ze said dismissively.\n\n\"This is my stage name, 'Master Hua'. I'm a signed host for 'Lazy Listener', Boss, you can try listening to the books I've recorded,\" the girl introduced herself to Zhou Ze.\n\n\"What kind of novels do you usually record?\"\n\n\"I like to record horror novels. In the audio market, horror, romance, and another major genre used to be popular.\"\n\n\"Another genre?\" Zhou Ze caught the key point.\n\n\"They're not allowed to be recorded now. Those were slightly explicit novels. They used to be allowed, and many people wanted to listen. Now, the regulations are strict, and they're forbidden.\n\nIn fact, when we had professional training, we used to specifically learn techniques for recording those kinds of books.\"\n\n\"There's even specialized training for that?\"\n\n\"Yes, the teacher would hold classes, and dozens of us signed hosts would sit together, following the teacher's rhythm, making 'ah ah ah ah' sounds, with emotion and expressiveness.\n\nThen the teacher on the podium would constantly shout at us: 'More passionate, more intense, more relaxed.'\"\n\nZhou Ze's mouth slightly opened; this was truly eye-opening.\n\nImagine that atmosphere, it's really a bit alluring, a refined version of a bacchanalian feast.\n\nOf course, this is art, after all, such matters and things related to them are not considered dirty, as no one was conceived by their mother bathing in sunlight and born.\n\n\"There was a sister in our class who was called out by the teacher for not being relaxed enough. She said aggrievedly: 'Teacher, I'm already loose, how much looser can I get?'\"\n\nAfter saying that, the girl herself laughed. Clearly, she was someone who enjoyed chatting and talking, and of course, talking was also her profession.\n\n\"What made you interested in coming here?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nEspecially late at night.\n\n\"A fan invited me here,\" the girl replied, \"He's been following my work for a long time, ever since I started out as a newcomer six years ago. He commented and messaged me every day, supporting and encouraging me for a long time. I didn't expect that he and I both live in Tongcheng, but he said he's going back to his hometown, which is very far from Tongcheng.\n\nSo he wanted to invite me out to meet him, and I agreed.\"\n\n\"He must have given you a lot of donations, right?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nThe girl shook her head, \"Not much, but the person willing to accompany you when you're most unknown is the one most worth cherishing and protecting.\"\n\n\"He invited you to this bookstore, and said he was going to a very distant place.\"\n\nA bold guess formed in Zhou Ze's mind.\n\nTo living people, his bookstore was just a quiet shop, but to another kind of person, it held unusual significance.\n\n\"Do you think all the people who listen to your books are living people?\"\n\n\"Of course! I never inflate clicks or recommendation votes. All these popularity and data metrics are real; no zombie followers or Taobao package operations here!\"\n\nClearly, the girl misunderstood Zhou Ze's meaning.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head, dodging the question.\n\nThe girl, still thinking Zhou Ze didn't believe her, continued:\n\n\"Boss, the audio market isn't huge, but there are over a billion people in China. Even if the proportion of people who enjoy listening to audiobooks is very low, it's still a significant number given such a large population base.\n\nYou should know,\n\nVisuals limit imagination,\n\nAuditory input can infinitely spark imagination.\"\n\n\"That's quite a profound statement.\"\n\nZhou Ze stood up. Bai Yingying had finished her shower, and he was about to take one himself.\n\nCoincidentally, Zhou Ze saw a man in a white shirt walk into the bookstore. He glanced around, first saw Zhou Ze, and smiled shyly and timidly,\n\nThen he saw the girl next to Zhou Ze and walked over to her.\n\nThe girl seemed not to have noticed him, completely unaware of someone approaching.\n\n\"I really like your work, and I really like your voice. I'm leaving now, I'm going away, please keep up the good work.\n\nYou're not a small-time new broadcaster anymore, your popularity is already very high. Even without my company and support from now on, you'll become more and more popular!\n\nKeep going!\"\n\nThe boy made an encouraging gesture towards the girl,\n\nHowever,\n\nThe girl heard nothing.\n\nInstead, she checked the time, muttering that her enthusiastic fan who had invited her seemed to have stood her up.\n\nZhou Ze didn't rush to send the boy to Hell but lingered for a while longer, casually picking up a book from the shelf.\n\nIndeed, the advent of the internet is truly a miraculous platform.\n\nAcross the screen,\n\nNot only can you not distinguish whether the person flirting with you is a man or a woman.\n\nIn forums, in posts, in book review sections,\n\nThose who reply to messages,\n\nThose who give you likes,\n\nThose who curse you,\n\nThose who encourage and support you,\n\nMight not only be living people,\n\nBut also...",

    "content": "\"Companionship is the most enduring declaration of love,\" and this kind of companionship was one where they couldn't even meet. The streamer eventually left; she didn't wait for the person who had invited her here. She probably intended to go back and message that account, asking why they stood her up.\n\nBut she might not have known that the person had already permanently departed from this mortal realm.\n\nThe boy had voluntarily asked Zhou Ze to send him off. Zhou Ze didn't ask what obsession kept him lingering in the mortal realm, and the boy didn't answer. This time, sending a departed soul to hell was very easy and simple.\n\nIn fact, it could even be described as \"peaceful.\"\n\nThere was no resistance, no struggle, no discontent; only a sense of composure.\n\nAfter finishing this \"business,\" Zhou Ze went to take a shower and then upstairs to rest. After relocating to the new store, \"business\" had actually improved significantly. Seeing the constantly stacking piles of Hell Bank Notes indeed gave a great sense of satisfaction to a \"ghost.\"\n\nHe woke up already at noon. Coming downstairs, Zhou Ze saw the old Taoist priest sitting behind the bar, teasing the little monkey.\n\n\"Morning, Boss,\" the old Taoist priest greeted.\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\nHe sat down on the sofa by the window. Another day of leisure and basking in the sun was about to begin. This kind of life was truly pleasant, especially watching the bustling crowds outside Nanda Street.\n\nAll under heaven bustle and toil for profit. Watching others busy themselves for their livelihoods and dreams while he could steal half a day's leisure from a floating life—comparison breeds superiority, and superiority leads to better enjoyment.\n\n\"Boss, what would you like to drink?\"\n\nBai Yingying could only wake up when Zhou Ze did. If she went too far away, Zhou Ze's sleep would be interrupted.\n\n\"Tea, please.\"\n\nBai Yingying quickly brewed tea and brought it over, placing an ashtray in front of Zhou Ze. Then she lit his cigarette before leaving.\n\nSometimes, Zhou Ze himself was a little confused. Did Bai Yingying know the instructions left by Madam Bai, which was why she was so meticulously attentive to him? But she seemed genuinely naive and sweet, and she held Madam Bai in great respect and admiration.\n\nSome questions were not suitable for probing; it would just make things meaningless. Zhou Ze was content to continue playing the fool.\n\nDrinking tea,\nSmoking a cigarette,\nAnyway, there weren weren't many ghosts during the day. He'd truly get busy only after nightfall.\n\nActually, Zhou Ze still preferred sitting in the bookstore, waiting for customers to come, like Jiang Ziya fishing — those who were willing would take the bait. It wasn't about being cool, but about it being less tiring.\n\nHe didn't like running around; it was too much hassle.\n\nHe picked up today's newspaper and skimmed through it. The \"death gamble\" case was already fermenting and undergoing trial. The police had acted swiftly; one by one, the behind-the-scenes investors and so on were apprehended and arrested. Justice awaited them.\n\nJust then, the bookstore door behind Zhou Ze was pushed open. The person who walked in made the old Taoist priest's eyes light up, and he immediately showed a fierce glare!\n\nIt wasn't surprising for the old Taoist priest to react this way, because the person who entered was a monk with ring scars on his head, seemingly also suffering from scabies. A \"scabby-headed monk,\" quite interesting.\n\nThe monk wasn't tall, about 1.6 meters, and a bit corpulent. He didn't have the demeanor of an enlightened monk; he was far from the ethereal grace of the old Taoist priest opposite him.\n\nFrom ancient times, Buddhism and Taoism have always been at odds. During ancient dynasties, when Taoism flourished, Buddhism was suppressed, and when Buddhism flourished, Taoism was suppressed. After all, they were competing for followers and resources; if you had more, I naturally had less.\n\nFrom the old Taoist priest's perspective, the bookstore was his territory, and this scabby-headed monk seemed to be here to challenge him.\n\nBut unexpectedly, the scabby-headed monk didn't even look at the old Taoist priest. He merely smiled at the \"hostile implication\" released by the old Taoist priest, then walked directly to Zhou Ze and sat down opposite him.\n\n\"A cup of tea.\"\n\nThe scabby-headed monk said.\n\nThe old Taoist priest, with a gloomy face, brought a cup of tea, while also reminding him, \"The minimum charge here is one hundred, and we don't offer fortune-telling or geomancy here.\"\n\nThe scabby-headed monk slightly raised his head, looked at the old Taoist priest, and smiled:\n\n\"We are different.\"\n\n\"We are different.\"\n\nA very profound statement, both belittling the old Taoist priest and elevating himself.\n\nIt implied: you are a quack who just muddles through, while I have real talent and learning; we are different.\n\nZhou Ze exhaled a smoke ring, blowing it directly into the monk's face.\n\nIt wasn't that Zhou Ze wanted to stick up for the old Taoist priest—after all, a visitor was a guest—but the moment the monk entered the bookstore, Zhou Ze felt an subtle sense of warning.\n\nThe scabby-headed monk was not angered. He simply clasped his hands together and recited, \"Amitābha.\"\n\nSuddenly, Zhou Ze felt uncomfortable all over, as if tiny ants were crawling on him.\n\nAt once, black nails began to slowly grow from the fingers of Zhou Ze's cigarette-holding hand.\n\n\"Patron, calm your anger. This humble monk came for tea and to read books; there is no ill intent.\"\n\nThe scabby-headed monk unclasped his hands, picked up the teacup, and took a sip of tea. Immediately, Zhou Ze's discomfort subsided.\n\n\"You can go attend to your duties,\" Zhou Ze said to the old Taoist priest.\n\nThe old Taoist priest could only withdraw.\n\n\"Patron, it's quite interesting that this shop is located in the bustling city. It provides tranquility amidst the hustle and bustle.\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't speak.\n\n\"This humble monk is currently traveling through the four directions. Today, I happened to arrive in Tongcheng, only to find that my two old friends were both gone. I was truly very curious. After some investigation, I learned that a figure like you, Patron, has appeared in Tongcheng.\"\n\n\"Who are your two friends?\"\n\n\"One is a woman, in the prime of her youth. The other is an old man, serving in the Temple of Literature.\"\n\nZhou Ze pondered slightly. The former likely referred to the female ghost messenger who had problems, and the latter was probably the elderly dwarf from the Temple of Literature.\n\n\"Are you here to avenge them?\"\n\n\"Not at all, not at all. Origins and ends, all have their destined course. Joys and sorrows, all by the will of Heaven. Nothing can be forced, nor should it be. This humble monk has come today simply to see you, Patron, to converse with you, and to forge a good karma.\"\n\n\"It seems that those who form good karma with you don't end up well.\"\n\nThe scabby-headed monk heard this and chuckled helplessly.\n\nThen, Zhou Ze didn't speak, and the scabby-headed monk didn't speak either. The atmosphere suddenly became awkward.\n\nIt was only when the tea had likely grown cold that the scabby-headed monk finally spoke:\n\n\"This humble monk came to express some thoughts to the enforcers, to share some concepts. Wherever this humble monk goes, he always seeks out the local enforcers to discuss things with.\"\n\n\"You speak, I'll listen. Once you're done, you'll still have to pay.\"\n\n\"Buddha says that all living beings are equal. The 'living beings' here actually refer not only to the living but also to the deceased. They are born here, they grow here, and they are actually no different from the living.\n\nIn this humble monk's eyes, they are also people, also members of all living beings.\n\nThose who seek good are the foundation of all beings, and should be cherished.\nThose who fall into evil are a calamity for all beings, and should be punished.\nFor those ghosts who harm people, there is naturally the wrathful Vajra aspect. But for ordinary departed souls who linger in the human realm due to obsession or various reasons, this humble monk believes they have the right and the freedom to do so.\n\nHowever, after the demise of the Lord of Mount Tai, the affairs of the Underworld operate on a system of merit points and performance. Any ghosts lingering in the human realm must be escorted to hell.\n\nThis humble monk has always disagreed with this practice.\n\nTherefore, I have come to persuade the higher-ups: ghosts also have good and evil, and both advantages and disadvantages. Things cannot be dealt with by a single stroke, otherwise, it is lazy governance and dereliction of duty.\"\n\nZhou Ze felt a little like laughing.\n\nSeeing Zhou Ze's reaction, the scabby-headed monk sighed. One who walks the path must go against the current, knowing something is impossible yet still striving for it.\n\nHe picked up the newspaper in front of Zhou Ze, turning to the last page. It featured news from another province, about a murder case.\n\n\"This newspaper, this humble monk has read it. When this incident occurred, this humble monk was not far from there.\n\nA man went missing, and his relatives reported it. The police suspected he might have been murdered, but couldn't find the body and were at a loss.\n\nAt this time, a woman from the same village told the police that her deceased old mother had appeared in her dream last night, informing her that someone was buried next to her house, occupying her land.\n\nThe police initially dismissed it as a joke, but when they sent people to check by her old mother's grave, they found a newly disturbed patch of earth. After digging, they discovered the missing man's corpse.\n\nLater, based on the evidence remaining on the corpse, the true murderer, a fellow villager named Li, was found.\n\nThe murderer was apprehended, and the victim found peace.\n\nIn this incident, the old mother's spirit did a good deed; good and evil reside in the heart.\n\nAlthough she lingered locally and did not go to hell, she did not harm anyone, and even helped people. Do you think the Underworld should take such a ghost to hell?\n\nPerhaps she just wanted to watch her children and grandchildren grow up and carry on the family line, nothing more.\"\n\nZhou Ze picked up the cold tea, took a sip, and shook his head.\n\nClearly, Zhou Ze did not agree with this argument.\n\n\"You still haven't convinced me. I'm sorry to have made you come all this way for nothing. You can go to other cities, other regions, and talk to other ghost messengers about your ideals and philosophies. Maybe you'll find a kindred spirit who will join you in fighting for ghost rights.\"\n\nThe scabby-headed monk smiled helplessly. Clearly, he had seen this kind of reaction many times. He picked up the newspaper again, looked at the news, and sighed once more.\n\nZhou Ze reached out and pressed the newspaper down.\n\nThe scabby-headed monk looked at Zhou Ze with some confusion.\n\n\"Monk, there's a saying: don't run before you can walk. You say you've been fighting for the rights of ghosts, but you can't even see humans clearly. What right do you have to speak for ghosts?\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\nZhou Ze pointed at the news in the paper, shook his head, and said:\n\n\"You said you were in that area at the time. So, did you find the old mother's departed soul in that village?\"\n\nThe scabby-headed monk shook his head. \"This humble monk was not fortunate enough to see her. If I had been, I would surely have treated her with respect. Though the elder's body perished, her good intentions remained.\"\n\nZhou Ze smiled. \"I haven't been to that place, but I'd bet a drawer full of Hell Bank Notes that there was no such departed soul of an old mother. Her soul would have gone to hell long ago after she died.\"\n\n\"How is that possible? You're a ghost messenger; do you not believe in ghosts in this world?\"\n\nThe scabby-headed monk found it absurd.\n\n\"The missing and murdered person was from the same village.\nThe murderer who hid the body was also from the same village.\nThen, a woman who relayed clues to the police through a dream was also from the same village. Isn't that obvious enough?\"\n\nZhou Ze lit another cigarette and said, \"The newspaper says the police initially didn't believe it, and later, after excavating the grave and finding the body, they also found it very strange. This is the reporter's style, to make the news interesting and attention-grabbing.\n\nBut in reality, I believe the local police were well aware.\n\nThe woman was there to report it. It's highly likely she passed by and saw the murderer burying the body.\"\n\n\"Then why didn't she tell the police directly?\" the scabby-headed monk asked.\n\n\"Because the murderer was also from the same village. The murderer might have parents, children, siblings. If she reported him directly, wouldn't she incur the resentment of his family?\n\nSo, she used the excuse of ghosts and spirits, saying her old mother dreamt it, subtly revealing the clue in that way to avoid being resented.\n\nIt's like some human trafficking cases in remote areas. Do you think the neighbors don't know that this family bought a person?\n\nOr, do you think everyone in the entire village is evil, that no one has a conscience, that no one has good intentions?\n\nIt's just that people feel that reporting it would upset their fellow villagers whom they see every day. Even if they sympathize with the poor woman who was trafficked, they can only pretend not to see.\"\n\nThe scabby-headed monk was slightly startled, and asked blankly, \"What is this?\"\n\n\"Human nature.\"",

    "content": "The Leprous Monk came suddenly and left suddenly. Of course, under the old Daoist's watchful eye, he paid his bill.\n\n\"Is this person sick, boss?\" The old Daoist asked, annoyed. \"This humble Daoist just stood by and listened for a bit. He actually advised you, boss, not to catch ghosts. If you don't catch ghosts, boss, where will your performance and netherworld money come from?\"\n\nAfter speaking, the old Daoist waved his hand and turned off the lights in the shop. Even though it was daytime, the brightness in the shop immediately dropped significantly. Then, he yelled like he was presenting a treasure:\n\n\"Monkey!\"\n\nThe little monkey immediately hopped over, holding two plastic fans. The fans were stained with silver glitter, and when waved, they truly created a dazzling effect.\n\nThe old Daoist and the monkey stood in a row. The monkey and the old Daoist stomped their feet in unison and shouted:\n\n\"Our slogan is!\"\n\n\"Work hard! Work hard! Work hard!\" (Chirp chirp chirp chirp)\n\n\"Our spirit is!\"\n\n\"Strive! Strive! Strive!\" (Chirp chirp chirp chirp)\n\n\"Our goal is!\"\n\n\"Netherworld money! Netherworld money! Netherworld money!\" (Chirp chirp chirp chirp)\n\n\"Alright, dismiss!\"\n\nThe monkey immediately retreated and jumped back onto the counter.\n\nZhou Ze watched, not knowing whether to laugh or cry.\n\n\"Netherworld money is justice, netherworld money is everything. Boss, don't let him trick you!\"\n\nThe old Daoist had a scar on his chest. It was said that he once relied on netherworld money to escape a knife aimed at his heart, so he had a deep obsession with it.\n\nZhou Ze waved his hand, indicating he understood.\n\n\"Oh, it's you?\"\n\nThe bookstore door was pushed open, and a young man walked in.\n\nZhou Ze knew this young man. He was an intern doctor at People's Hospital. When Zhou Ze pretended to be a doctor at the hospital to treat people, this intern was there several times, and Zhou Ze had helped him out of tricky situations a few times.\n\n\"Why are you here?\"\n\nThe young intern doctor was very curious about Zhou Ze. Being naturally naive, he still hadn't figured out the relationship between Zhou Ze and Dr. Lin, and still thought Zhou Ze was truly a doctor.\n\nOf course, it was also because Zhou Ze's medical skills were indeed superb, making it difficult for the young intern doctor to discern.\n\n\"Being a doctor has no future, so I started a business,\" Zhou Ze replied perfunctorily.\n\n\"Is this bookstore yours?\"\n\n\"Sort of.\"\n\nJust then, Tang Shi appeared at the top of the stairs, looking at Zhou Ze.\n\n\"You sit for now, I'll be right back.\"\n\nThe young doctor sat down, and the old Daoist enthusiastically brought tea. As long as you accepted the tea, the minimum charge was one hundred.\n\nZhou Ze walked up to Tang Shi, \"What's wrong?\"\n\n\"Are you free tomorrow?\" Tang Shi asked.\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Then what were you planning to do tomorrow?\"\n\n\"Haven't decided yet.\"\n\nTang Shi nodded, indicating she understood, \"Then let's have dinner together tomorrow night.\"\n\nAs soon as she finished speaking, both Tang Shi and Zhou Ze frowned simultaneously.\n\nHaving dinner together tomorrow was normal social etiquette for ordinary people, but for these two, it was no less than torture.\n\nTo them, \"having dinner together tomorrow night\" could be translated as \"electric shock together tomorrow night.\"\n\n\"Let's have tea,\" Tang Shi corrected.\n\n\"Are guests coming?\"\n\n\"Sort of.\" Tang Shi looked around and said, \"You can relax, I won't be fighting you for the maid anymore.\"\n\nZhou Ze smiled and nodded.\n\nAfter talking with Tang Shi, Zhou Ze turned and walked back to his original spot. The old Daoist and the young intern doctor were chatting animatedly, seeming like fast friends despite their age difference.\n\nOf course, with the old Daoist's experience, he could become a close friend with anyone from any walk of life.\n\n\"What's up?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Boss, he said that bodies in their hospital's morgue always get damaged or go missing, but they can't find out who's doing it. I just gave him a tip.\"\n\nSaying that, the old Daoist took out a plastic bottle from his pocket. It was fluorescent powder.\n\n\"I'm telling you, it's definitely someone inside your hospital doing it. You secretly sprinkle this on the bodies. If you catch the thief, then you, as an intern doctor, can also become a full-time employee.\"\n\n\"Become a full-time employee at the Public Security Bureau?\" Zhou Ze looked at the old Daoist. \"Why are you giving others such bad ideas?\"\n\nAt this moment, the young intern doctor received a call, probably urging him to return to the hospital. He hung up, smiled at the old Daoist, shook his hand, and turned to leave the bookstore.\n\n\"Boss, do people really steal bodies?\" The old Daoist asked curiously. He knew Zhou Ze was a doctor in his past life and must know some inside stories.\n\n\"Yes,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\n\"Then why? To transplant organs?\" The old Daoist immediately asked.\n\n\"Do you think organ transplantation is that simple? The conditions for organ transplantation are very strict. Stealing bodies from the morgue for organ transplantation is basically impossible.\n\nGenerally speaking, in the past, they could be sent to some medical schools or research institutes for dissection experiments. After all, human bodies are not white mice; experimental subjects are scarce.\n\nThen there are also some superstitious people who steal bodies for ghost marriages. Additionally, some people believe that drinking powder made from a corpse's skull can cure illnesses. In short, there are all sorts of theories, so body theft used to be quite serious, but it has gotten much better since cremation was promoted in the country.\"\n\n\"Grind a skull into powder and drink it? Like pearl powder?\" The old Daoist made a motion as if he wanted to vomit.\n\nZhou Ze sat back down in his usual spot by the window. A Nissan stopped in front of the bookstore, and a person got out of the car—someone who had returned to their hometown earlier.\n\n\"You're back!\"\n\nThe old Daoist looked at Xu Qinglang's figure with great excitement. He was tired of takeout and really missed the days when Xu Qinglang was in the shop.\n\nZhou Ze was calm, but he also let out a sigh of relief inwardly. He was almost out of his plum juice.\n\nXu Qinglang didn't come in. Instead, he waved at Zhou Ze, then squatted down by the shop entrance.\n\nHe looked troubled.\n\nZhou Ze walked out of the shop and stood beside him. After thinking for a moment, he also squatted down.\n\n\"What's wrong?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nXu Qinglang didn't rush to answer. Instead, he handed Zhou Ze a cigarette, then sighed and said:\n\n\"Went home for a blind date.\"\n\n\"Good news,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Sigh.\"\n\n\"Didn't hit it off?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nXu Qinglang shook his head, \"Hit it off too quickly.\"\n\n\"How fast? Did you roll in the hay?\"\n\nXu Qinglang glanced at Zhou Ze but didn't deny it.\n\n\"Really fast,\" Zhou Ze exclaimed.\n\n\"I'm not like you, I'm still normal,\" Xu Qinglang reminded him.\n\n\"Then why the long face?\"\n\n\"The problem is, after it was over, she left a sum of money on the nightstand and then left.\"\n\n\"You got paid?\" Zhou Ze was a little surprised.\n\nXu Qinglang was somewhat depressed and said:\n\n\"We originally agreed to meet at a coffee shop for the blind date, but the blind date suddenly had something come up and didn't show. I didn't get the notification and mistook someone else for her. So I sat in front of her and chatted, then I asked her to see a movie, then I accompanied her shopping, and then at night, she asked me to go to a hotel to show me a script she had just written. She's a screenwriter.\"\n\n\"I bet it was a fluorescent script, the kind you have to turn off the lights to see.\"\n\nXu Qinglang was a bit helpless, reaching out to scratch his hair.\n\n\"She left three thousand yuan on my nightstand after she left. I had thought of her as my blind date, and I was a bit surprised if she was too open and avant-garde, or if this was just irresistible love at first sight?\"\n\n\"Most love at first sight is actually lust at first sight.\"\n\n\"Then I found out that wasn't the case,\" Xu Qinglang was conflicted.\n\n\"She took you for a gigolo?\"\n\n\"Can you shut up?\" Xu Qinglang looked at Zhou Ze with a resentful expression.\n\n\"You took the money, and you slept with the person, you didn't lose anything.\"\n\n\"That's true, but I feel my self-esteem has been hurt. I'm a man with over twenty properties, and I was actually paid by a woman who took me for a gigolo!\"\n\n\"Actually, if you look at some things from a different perspective, you might feel more at ease.\"\n\n\"Like what?\"\n\n\"Like, you're the gigolo with the most properties.\"\n\n\"............\"\n\n\"Or, you're the one with the most properties who looks most like a gigolo.\"\n\n\"............\"\n\n\"Sorry, I'm not very good at comforting people.\" Zhou Ze patted Xu Qinglang's shoulder and continued:\n\n\"Cheer up.\n\nA bed is the most decadent place in the world. Why take a relationship that starts in bed seriously?\n\nBy the way, did you go back to your hometown just for a blind date?\"\n\n\"Not entirely. Our ancestral grave is being relocated, so I went back to move it. Oh, and something strange happened, I'll tell you about it in a few days. For now, I want to go up and rest.\"\n\nXu Qinglang stood up, pushed open the bookstore door, grabbed a bottle of red wine from the counter, and went upstairs to his room.\n\nThe entire afternoon passed leisurely and easily. By eight in the evening, Zhou Ze finally perked up. Usually, around this time, the real customers would start to arrive.\n\nXu Qinglang was probably drowning his sorrows in wine and didn't come downstairs, so dinner was still takeout.\n\nThe old Daoist and the little monkey sat on a stool, the grandpa and grandson eating peanuts and sipping wine. The little monkey's alcohol tolerance had also been developed by the old Daoist.\n\nThe bookstore door was pushed open, and the door curtain let out a crisp sound.\n\nThe person who pushed the door open was the intern doctor.\n\nThe old Daoist was a bit drunk and reached out to invite the intern doctor to have a drink with him.\n\nHe couldn't help it; in the entire bookstore, he couldn't find anyone else to drink with him, so he could only drink with the monkey. Now that a living person had arrived, he was naturally happy.\n\n\"I just got off work. I completely forgot I didn't pay when I came here today. Oh, and I still owe you for the fluorescent powder.\" The intern doctor was still as dull and honest.\n\n\"Don't worry about it, it's just a hundred yuan for tea, and adding the fluorescent powder only makes it one hundred fifty.\"\n\nThe old Daoist said, pretending to be very generous.\n\nThe other person handed over the money, and the old Daoist angrily took it, then patted the intern doctor's shoulder and said:\n\n\"If you really want to thank me, treat me to a meal out. We brothers can have a good drink and chat.\"\n\nAfter speaking, the old Daoist looked at Zhou Ze somewhat guiltily.\n\nZhou Ze nodded, granting him leave.\n\nThe intern doctor didn't refuse either. He wasn't a local, and due to his personality, he didn't have many close friends here. So, he and the old Daoist hooked arms and left the bookstore to find a pub.\n\nIt was already dark, and the streetlights were quite bright.\n\nThe old Daoist and the intern doctor walked for a while. As they neared the pub, the old Daoist turned into a dark alley nearby, unbuckled his belt, and said:\n\n\"Excuse me, gotta relieve myself first.\"\n\nThe intern doctor wasn't formal either. He stood side-by-side with the old Daoist and also unbuckled his belt.\n\n\"Hey, you kid, down-to-earth, I like it!\"\n\n\"Haha, it's quite exciting, peeing anywhere,\" the intern doctor had clearly been led astray by the old Daoist.\n\n\"What's this? It's human nature, you know. By the way, did you wipe the fluorescent powder I gave you on the bodies at noon?\" the old Daoist asked.\n\n\"I did, but the bodies went missing again today. The hospital already called the police, but the police still haven't found any clues.\"\n\n\"Didn't work, huh?\" The old Daoist said somewhat apologetically.\n\n\"No, it didn't work,\" the intern doctor nodded.\n\n\"Then never mind. Let's split the bill for tonight's drinks.\"\n\n\"It's fine, I'll treat you,\" the intern doctor said.\n\n\"Alright, you're a generous kid, I like you!\"\n\nSaying that, the old Daoist, without washing his hands, directly patted the other's shoulder as encouragement!\n\n\"You're older, it's appropriate.\"\n\nThe intern doctor smiled.\n\nThe old Daoist suddenly froze.\n\nHe hadn't noticed before because there were lights in the bookstore and streetlights on the road.\n\nBut in this dark alley,\n\nThe old Daoist suddenly saw, when the intern doctor smiled,\n\nOn his teeth,\n\nThere was a faint,\n\nFluorescent glow.",

    "content": "The hand that had just finished urinating trembled slightly.\n\nThe old Daoist regretted why he had skipped work to drink. Wouldn't it be a much better and nobler career to stay in the bookstore, dedicated to serving ghosts?\n\nWhy drink?!\n\nThe old Daoist was no ordinary man. Although he couldn't compare to Xu Qinglang—he had no real Taoist magic and was just a charlatan scraping by—he had, at least, served two generations of \"ghosts.\" He had a good eye and had witnessed many bizarre things.\n\nThe faint glow on the intern doctor's teeth, like a devil's smile in the dark, sent shivers down his spine. The faucet, which had just been turned off after flushing, seemed to be turned on again, threatening to drip at any moment.\n\nThe old Daoist had told him to sprinkle the fluorescent powder on the corpse, and the intern doctor had replied that he had done so.\n\nThen, the fluorescent powder appeared on his teeth. This connection immediately made him tremble with fear.\n\nThe old Daoist wasn't foolish enough to ask, \"Oh, you're so stylish! Do you use toothpaste with fluorescent powder?\"\n\n\"What's wrong?\"\n\nThe intern doctor, seeing the old Daoist staring at him, asked curiously.\n\nThe old Daoist suddenly clutched his stomach, apologizing, \"Sorry, my stomach suddenly hurts a lot. Must have eaten something bad recently.\"\n\n\"I'll take you to the hospital. It's not far from here anyway,\" the intern doctor said, helping the old Daoist. \"Why are you shaking?\"\n\n\"Damn it, my liver hurts! Cirrhosis, cirrhosis! I need to go back and take my medicine, or I'll have a cerebral hemorrhage and a stroke, and my heart disease will flare up too!\"\n\nThe old Daoist babbled nonsense, but it all boiled down to one thing: I'm getting out of here!\n\nEven if he had to invent other terminal illnesses, he had to leave. This world was too dangerous. The bookstore was safe. Now, the old Daoist suddenly found Zhou Ze's lazy sunbathing posture incredibly reassuring, and Miss Tang's cold remarks offered immense comfort!\n\n\"I'll take you back,\" the intern doctor said.\n\n\"No, you're tired too. You should rest. Go back and rest. You have to work tomorrow, right? You can't be careless; you have to treat and save people.\"\n\nThe old Daoist finished speaking and, without waiting for the intern doctor's reply, broke free from his support and ran towards the bookstore.\n\nUnder the streetlights, the old Daoist ran while looking back, afraid that the intern doctor would suddenly chase him. But the other party remained in the dark alley where the two had just relieved themselves, unmoving.\n\nAnd that glowing orb of light kept appearing and disappearing, as if the other party stood there, smiling as he watched him run.\n\nHe ran all the way to the bookstore in one breath. The old Daoist pushed open the door and immediately knelt on the ground, panting heavily. He had run back with all his might, his body covered in sweat—half from the heat, half from fear.\n\nZhou Ze was sitting behind the counter, organizing shelves. Seeing the old Daoist return in this state, he smiled and said,\n\n\"What's wrong?\"\n\n\"Boss, do you know what I just saw? That guy, that guy's teeth were glowing!\"\n\nThe old Daoist gesticulated wildly as he recounted what had happened, as if he had barely escaped the clutches of a demon after a fierce battle that caused mountains to collapse, rivers to flow backward, and the sun and moon to lose their color!\n\nIt was truly terrifying!\n\nBut Zhou Ze remained calm, continuing his work as if nothing had happened.\n\nAfter finishing his story, the old Daoist picked up the water on the table and drank it all, calming his internal panic. He asked, \"Boss, why don't you react at all?\"\n\n\"Perhaps he was just playing a prank on you.\"\n\n\"A prank?\" The old Daoist's face crumpled. \"What if it wasn't?\"\n\n\"Then maybe he has a bit of necrophilia. It's no big deal. You can report it to the police. I think there's a crime called desecration of a corpse; he could get into trouble for that.\"\n\n\"And then?\" the old Daoist continued to ask.\n\n\"Then what?\"\n\n\"Boss, aren't you going to do something?\" the old Daoist asked in surprise.\n\n\"Do I need to do something?\" Zhou Ze countered.\n\n\"............\" The old Daoist.\n\n\"You came back safely, didn't you? Nothing bad happened. Besides, if he really ate the corpse, would he deliberately sprinkle fluorescent powder on it and then eat it?\n\nIs he stupid?\"\n\n\"Boss, whether you believe it or not, I don't think that was a joke,\" the old Daoist said very seriously. \"I think for the peace of society, we shouldn't sit by and do nothing. If he really is a necrophile, it's one thing if he's secretly eating corpses in the hospital now, but what if he can't steal corpses later and still wants to eat? Who can guarantee he won't do something even more outrageous in the future?\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded upon hearing this, seeming to agree with the old Daoist. Then he reached out and patted the little monkey's head beside him, saying,\n\n\"Then you take Monkey Bro to vanquish evil and restore peace to the human world.\"\n\nThe little monkey didn't understand, but seemed quite encouraged, vigorously waving the plastic toy hammer in its hand.\n\n\"Squeak! Squeak! Squeak!\"\n\nThe old Daoist's face immediately fell. He sat on a nearby chair, clearly still shaken.\n\nAfter a while, the old Daoist looked up at Zhou Ze, who was preparing some snacks and wine. He asked curiously, \"Boss, are you preparing a midnight snack?\"\n\n\"Offerings.\"\n\n\"Offerings? Qingming Festival is over. Going to visit a grave?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"For whom?\"\n\n\"For me.\"\n\n\"This...\"\n\n\"Today is my birthday,\" Zhou Ze explained.\n\nThe old Daoist was slightly stunned. He felt a deep sense of incongruity when a \"living person\" in front of him said he was going to make offerings to himself, and it was for his own memorial birthday.\n\nZhou Ze finished packing his things, put them in a single-shoulder bag, and walked out from behind the counter.\n\n\"Boss, how about I go with you?\" the old Daoist offered eagerly. \"You don't have a driver's license.\"\n\nZhou Ze hesitated for a moment, then nodded.\n\nIf he drove there and encountered a traffic stop, not having a driver's license would indeed be troublesome.\n\nThe old Daoist drove Xu Qinglang's Nissan out and took Zhou Ze to the cemetery.\n\nThe cemetery was already closed, but the fence wasn't very high; one could easily climb over it.\n\nThe old Daoist understood why Zhou Ze wanted to come at night. Only at night, when everything was quiet and deserted, could one experience that feeling.\n\nIn the cemetery, rows of tombstones stood neatly. Many people's lives eventually ended here.\n\nIn the dead of night, faint whispers emanated from the cemetery, as if someone was talking there.\n\nThe old Daoist initially thought he was hallucinating, but after listening carefully for a while, he realized there really were voices. He immediately reached down and touched his crotch.\n\n\"Boss, there's demonic energy!\"\n\nZhou Ze ignored him, pointing to a small stand in front with a box and a speaker inside. The cover was a solar panel.\n\nThe sound was coming from within.\n\nThe old Daoist was a bit confused. He walked closer to look curiously. There was an instruction manual on it, detailing what programs played at what times, including morning news, emotional programs, international news, and local news.\n\n\"Damn, it's that user-friendly now?\"\n\nThe old Daoist had only heard of leaving QR codes on tombstones before, which he already found very avant-garde. He never expected someone to put something like this next to their tombstone for entertainment.\n\nZhou Ze found his own tombstone. It had his photo on it and a brief summary of his life.\n\nThe Qingming Festival had just passed, and there were still wreaths, small toys, and letters in front of the tombstone—from his colleagues and the children from the orphanage.\n\nZhou Ze sat down in front of his tombstone and carefully opened each letter. They were all messages from the children to him, expressing their longing.\n\nThey all began with \"Brother Zhou\" or \"Dear Brother Zhou.\" Some children's letters even used many Pinyin characters because they hadn't fully learned to read.\n\nZhou Ze leaned against his tombstone, quietly reading, without crying or red eyes.\n\nAfter reading for a while, Zhou Ze laid out the wine and food he had brought. Then he began to eat and drink slowly.\n\nHe usually found eating painful, and this time was no exception, but eating while reading the children's letters seemed to have the effect of sour plum juice.\n\nAlthough it was still hard to swallow and still nauseating, he managed to force himself not to vomit this time.\n\nThe old Daoist squatted beside him, watching his boss eat the offerings, and said nothing. He understood.\n\nHe was dead, yet still alive.\n\nThe offerings were for himself, for his own enjoyment.\n\nThe night breeze was cool, blowing all around.\n\nAt this moment, it seemed like true peace and quiet.\n\nAfter finishing the letters, Zhou Ze stretched and looked at his tombstone.\n\nHe still remembered that day, being pushed into the crematorium, the great fire consuming him.\n\nErasing,\n\nThe traces of his previous life.\n\nBeneath the tombstone lay his ashes.\n\n\"Boss, how about I secretly dig them out and take them back as a memento?\" the old Daoist suggested.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. Let the past be the past. He no longer had such deep attachments. Perhaps he once did, but now he had slowly come to terms with it.\n\nHowever, inadvertently, Zhou Ze noticed a very subtle mark on the tombstone's construction. He immediately shone his phone's flashlight downwards.\n\nSeeing this, the old Daoist also crouched down to look, then said, \"This tombstone has been opened recently!\"\n\nInstinctively, Zhou Ze had a bad premonition. He had no intention of taking his ashes, but that didn't mean he was willing to see anything happen to them.\n\nAfter all, it was his.\n\nHis fingernails immediately grew long. Zhou Ze directly used his nails to pry into the crack and lever it open, saving him the need for a shovel.\n\nSoon, the masonry underneath was dug open, revealing a black urn inside.\n\nHe took out the urn. It felt heavy, meaning there was something inside.\n\nZhou Ze pried open the lock with his fingernails, then opened the urn.\n\nInside the box,\n\nThere was something,\n\nBut not ashes,\n\nInstead, there were tiny, crystal-clear fragments.\n\n\"Damn it, Boss, you cremated out sarira*.\"\n\nZhou Ze reached in and grabbed a small fragment. With a gentle squeeze, it crumbled. At the same time, he said in a low voice, suppressing a terrifying rage,\n\n\"Have you ever seen sarira made of plastic?\"\n\n***\n**Sarira:** Crystalline or pearl-like relics found among the cremated remains of Buddhist spiritual masters.",

    "content": "**Anger?**\n\nThere must be anger!\n\n\"Boss, should we… should we call the police?\"\n\nOld Dao suggested from the side.\n\nThen, he saw Zhou Ze looking at him with the gaze one reserves for mentally challenged children.\n\nUh...\n\nDid I say something wrong?\n\nBut weren't you always saying to find the police when something happens and be a law-abiding citizen? I've been upholding your words and spirit.\n\n\"Old Dao,\" Zhou Ze slowly began.\n\n\"Hm?\"\n\n\"If your money was stolen, would you be angry?\"\n\n\"Of course, I'd be angry.\"\n\n\"Then if your ashes were stolen, would you be angry?\"\n\n\"Uh...\"\n\nWho the hell is like you, this pervert, whose original body has turned into ashes, and can still discuss whether to be angry or not?\n\n\"I'm going to find that guy.\"\n\nBlack light began to swirl in Zhou Ze's eyes, and his ten fingernails glowed with an eerie light.\n\n\"Then, I'll tear him into a thousand pieces!\"\n\nHe could have stolen anything, but he stole my ashes. Then I’ll make sure you’re buried with my ashes.\n\n\"That's the cemetery office over there. Go check the surveillance videos.\"\n\nZhou Ze instructed Old Dao. Old Dao quickly nodded. Alright, you're the boss. Whatever you want to do, I'll do it. I won't second-guess your intentions anymore.\n\nZhou Ze directly broke the lock on the cemetery gate, and the two walked in. Old Dao sat in front of the computer in the surveillance room and began to retrieve old footage, also locking onto the camera that could observe Zhou Ze's tombstone.\n\n\"Night, during the Qingming Festival.\"\n\nZhou Ze gave the specific time.\n\nBecause the trace of the moved tombstone hadn't completely faded, it must have happened recently, otherwise, if another ten days or half a month passed, Zhou Ze wouldn't have been able to discover this clue.\n\nHe might even come to worship himself every year and not know that what he's worshiping isn't his own ashes, nor his past, but a box of plastic pellets.\n\nThen he would come over every holiday and mourn with a box of plastic pellets.\n\n\"Boss, if you ask me, since the other party stole something, they should have also deleted or dealt with the surveillance footage. That's how it always happens on TV.\n\nFor us to still be checking this surveillance footage now, it's the kind of pointless plotline that I, a poor Daoist priest, dislike most when watching TV.\n\nIt's completely useless, just filling time.\"\n\nZhou Ze's hand rested on Old Dao's shoulder, his fingernails lightly swaying. The chilling coldness felt as if it was directly piercing into Old Dao's body.\n\nOld Dao's body stiffened, and he immediately sat up straight, not daring to blabber anymore, diligently starting to play back the surveillance footage.\n\n\"Stop!\"\n\nZhou Ze called out.\n\nOld Dao immediately pressed pause.\n\n\"Rewind a little more.\"\n\nOld Dao began to rewind, and sure enough, a figure dressed in red appeared on the screen. The surveillance quality wasn't very good, and it was night, so the person's figure was very blurry, only their clothing color could be roughly made out.\n\nHe actually found it?\n\nOld Dao was a little surprised.\n\nThe footage slowly played,\n\nThe person in red on the screen bent down, holding two surgical-knife-like tools, and pried open the tombstone. His movements were swift and clean, no slower than Zhou Ze's earlier use of his fingernails.\n\nThen the person took out the urn, retrieved a glass container, poured the ashes into it, and then seemed to sprinkle something else into the urn. Without a doubt, it should be that string of plastic pellets.\n\nThe man placed the glass bottle into his embrace, then turned his head to look at the camera.\n\nFrom the surveillance video's perspective, it was as if the other party was looking directly at the camera, making eye contact with Zhou Ze and whoever else was watching the video.\n\nThe other party deliberately pressed his face close to the camera,\n\nThis face,\n\nZhou Ze felt a strange sense of familiarity. It was an East Asian face, with very fair skin.\n\nHe began to search his chaotic memories for information about this person. Unfortunately, during his last confrontation with the Azure-robed Lady on the rooftop, he had entered a certain state, causing severe memory loss from that time, and he couldn't recall who the person was for a while.\n\n\"Amen!\"\n\nAfter uttering these words, the person turned and left, leaving behind a meaningful smile.\n\nIt wasn't until the person's final \"Amen\" was spoken that Zhou Ze's pupils suddenly constricted.\n\nHis memories began to rewind incessantly, finally appearing in the villa surrounded by rapeseed flowers, by the dining table, where the priest had stood quietly.\n\nIt's him!\n\nHe stole my ashes!\n\n\"Boss, do you know this person?\" Old Dao looked at Zhou Ze's reaction, finding it a bit strange.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nWhen the two walked out of the cemetery, it was already past midnight. Zhou Ze took out his phone and first called Xu Qinglang, but Xu Qinglang was probably drunk and didn't answer.\n\nZhou Ze could only call Tang Shi.\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"Help me wake up Xu Qinglang, no matter what.\"\n\n\"Alright.\"\n\nAbout half a minute later, a scream came from the other end of the phone.\n\nThen, Xu Qinglang answered the phone with some resentment, directly cursing:\n\n\"You're sick, calling her to wake me up!\"\n\n\"Give me the phone number of that lady who rented our shop.\"\n\n\"Tsk, I'll find it.\"\n\nXu Qinglang heard the suppressed anger in Zhou Ze's voice and didn't complain to Zhou Ze anymore. He immediately began to look for the number and then recited it.\n\nZhou Ze called the number, but a prompt tone came from the other end: \"The number you have dialed is switched off, please try again later.\"\n\nZhou Ze took a deep breath. Although Tongcheng was a small city with only a few million people, finding someone there without any connections would be very difficult.\n\nAnd now, Zhou Ze's anger urgently needed an outlet, but he couldn't find any specific information about that priest.\n\nWhen they returned to the bookstore at night, Tang Shi was sitting inside reading a magazine, while Xu Qinglang was at the bar counter, with some bruises on his face.\n\n\"Did you get in touch?\" Xu Qinglang asked, applying an egg to his face.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head.\n\n\"Hiss...\"\n\nXu Qinglang felt the pain on his face worsen. So he got beaten for nothing?\n\nZhou Ze walked up to Tang Shi and asked, \"Is there any way to quickly find someone in this area?\"\n\nTang Shi put down the magazine in her hand and countered, \"Try scratching the ground with your fingernails and see if you can summon a local Earth God.\"\n\n\"I'm serious.\"\n\n\"I can't help either. Did you lose something?\" Tang Shi asked.\n\nZhou Ze didn't answer. Losing his ashes wasn't something glorious to talk about, it was even comparable to having his underwear stolen.\n\nIt seemed there was no other way. The lady's phone was unreachable, and Zhou Ze believed that even if it were, finding the priest's address and information through her would be slim.\n\nThe other party seemed to have specifically investigated him. He might have deliberately left the surveillance video untouched because he was confident in his hiding place, believing that even if Zhou Ze discovered this, he wouldn't be able to find him.\n\nSuddenly, Zhou Ze thought of something. He took out his phone and dialed an unsaved number:\n\n\"Hello, who are you?\"\n\nA cute, loli-like voice came from the other end.\n\n\"Get your sister to talk,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Who are you? I don't have a sister... Captain, I was just sleeping.\"\n\nThe loli voice suddenly turned into an older sister's tone.\n\n\"Help me find someone, a Japanese priest who has been active in Tongcheng recently.\"\n\n\"Alright.\"\n\nThen, a sound like:\n\n*Biu,*\n\ncame from the other end, and the phone hung up.\n\nZhou Ze felt a bit unreal,\n\nHe didn't expect his new subordinate,\n\nOh no,\n\nIt was a subordinate girl,\n\nto be so efficient. After he told her something, she just said \"Oh\" and went to do it.\n\n\"Hey, let me ask you a question.\" Tang Shi suddenly spoke.\n\nZhou Ze looked at Tang Shi.\n\n\"Does your conscience still hurt these days?\" Tang Shi pointed to her heart.\n\nZhou Ze didn't quite understand what she meant, then shook his head.\n\n\"Heh...\" Tang Shi chuckled, \"It seems you're slowly getting used to it.\"\n\n\"Used to what?\"\n\n\"Used to living without a conscience, I suppose.\"\n\nTang Shi stood up, apparently preparing to go upstairs, and then reminded him, \"Tomorrow night, we're having tea together, don't forget.\"\n\n\"I'm not in the mood.\"\n\nTang Shi made no comment and continued upstairs.\n\n...\n\nIn the one-room rented apartment, a priest sat on the sofa. On the coffee table in front of him were some pictures and documents. He was deep in thought, muttering to himself.\n\nJust then, the door opened.\n\nThe intern doctor walked in. He saw the priest sitting on his own sofa and was startled, scolding:\n\n\"Who are you? Why are you in my house!\"\n\nAt the same time, the intern doctor reached for his phone, ready to call the police, thinking his house had been burglarized.\n\nThe priest, however, appeared before him in the blink of an eye, one hand grabbing his wrist and the other gripping his neck.\n\nThe phone dropped to the floor,\n\nAnd his neck was lifted by the priest,\n\nThe intern doctor felt an intense sensation of suffocation.\n\nThe priest remained unmoving, maintaining that posture until the intern doctor's eyes slowly began to glaze over, and a hint of cruelty appeared on his face.\n\n\"I clearly fed you something extracted from his ashes, so why have you only turned into this ghoulish thing? What good is this kind of thing to me?\"\n\nThe priest kicked the intern doctor's butt, sending him sprawling. The intern doctor immediately scrambled up, saliva dripping from his mouth.\n\n\"Slurp.\"\n\nA raw pig's trot opened onto the floor by the priest.\n\nThe intern doctor directly rushed over, clutching the trot in his hands and gnawing on it, bloodstains from the trot still on his mouth, but his eyes showed dissatisfaction. Clearly, pig's trotters and pork weren't enough to satisfy him.\n\nThe priest shook his head, looking somewhat helpless as he sat back down on the sofa.\n\n\"It seems his transformation into a zombie isn't due to his body, but rather his soul. It's because his soul resided in that body, causing some changes that, when ingested by ordinary people, produced minor mutations. But these mutations are negligible.\n\nForget zombies, they can't even become ghouls. They just developed a lovely hobby—eating corpses.\"\n\nThe priest rubbed his hands,\n\n\"So, if it's not the body's reason, is it his soul's reason?\n\nHis body in his previous life wasn't the original one either?\n\nHis borrowing of a corpse to return a soul seemed to be the female Ghost Messenger's arrangement,\n\nBut in reality, there's something deeper hidden?\"\n\nThe priest picked up his coffee and took a sip.\n\nOn the coffee table in front of him,\n\nWere photos of Zhou Ze's previous life, as well as photos of Xu Le and his sister-in-law,\n\nThere was even a photo of the old man who had stabbed Zhou Ze with his fingernails at the hospital that day.\n\nThe priest pulled out a surgical knife and directly shredded the photos of the old man and his sister-in-law, then let out a long breath,\n\n\"I'll have to start investigating all over again.\"",

    "content": "Regardless of your mood, good or bad, one thing remains constant and unaffected by human will: time.\n\nAnother day had passed, and evening arrived. Zhou Ze sat on the sofa, twirling a pen in his hand. There was still no news from the little loli.\n\nZhou Ze didn't think she was being perfunctory. After all, her life and death were in his hands. If she dared to be perfunctory the first time he asked her to do something, pretending to \"biu\" and then secretly returning to sleep and recover, then he'd have to send her to win.\n\nActually, how important were his ashes from his previous life? Not that important. In fact, if he had the ashes in his hand, and someone suggested scattering them in the sea or a large river, Zhou Ze might actually do it.\n\nLet bygones be bygones, let the past return to dust. Zhou Ze wasn't so melodramatic as to value some past item more than his own life.\n\nBut the problem was, his own things, and things deeply connected to him, he could discard them, but if someone dared to steal them, that was unacceptable.\n\nThis was no longer a matter of financial loss; it was a direct insult.\n\nThat priest, that Japanese priest, Zhou Ze hoped to find him in the next moment, and then personally pierce him with his fingernails;\n\nHe wanted the ashes, did he?\n\nThen after Zhou Ze killed him, he'd turn him into ashes too, and mix in some dog shit for him.\n\nThe little loli was definitely still searching, and Zhou Ze knew that as a senior netherworld messenger, her roots in Tongcheng were definitely deeper than his.\n\nSo, even if he was unwilling, the only thing Zhou Ze could do now was eat and sleep as usual, maintaining his energy while waiting.\n\nThe old Taoist priest saw that Zhou Ze had been in a bad mood all day.\n\nMost people couldn't experience the anger of having their ashes stolen,\n\nBut the boss did.\n\nAt this moment, the old Taoist priest brought over a cup of coffee, feeling that he should say something to relieve the boss's suppressed mood. He immediately said,\n\n\"Boss, that Japanese guy will definitely be found soon. Generally, in Chinese TV shows and novels, Japanese people are standard high-risk creatures with short lifespans.\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't look at the old Taoist, but picked up the coffee and took a sip.\n\nHe didn't want to chat with the old Taoist when he was in a bad mood, because he was afraid that at some point he might have the urge to stab the old Taoist to death. Perhaps his previous boss had also had such an urge?\n\nJust then, Tang Shi walked down from upstairs, wearing a black dress today.\n\nShe was a cold and alluring woman, always pursuing high standards and refinement in her attire. This seemed to be a kind of obsession for her. Zhou Ze remembered that when she first woke up, she made the old Taoist buy her new clothes.\n\n\"Let's go for tea.\"\n\nTang Shi said coldly.\n\n\"I think I'll skip it.\" Zhou Ze really wasn't in the mood.\n\nTang Shi looked at Zhou Ze,\n\nStanding there without moving.\n\nShe wouldn't act spoiled or beg. She always maintained that cold demeanor, and because of it, when she looked at you, you'd feel very uncomfortable and uneasy.\n\nZhou Ze was a soft-hearted person, and a kind one.\n\nHe couldn't bear to see others wronged or unhappy, always putting himself in others' shoes.\n\nOf course, the pen he was twirling in his hand had just slipped from his control and was subtly trembling, looking ready to pierce his chest at any moment.\n\nMm.\n\nHe stood up.\n\n\"Let's go, let's have some tea,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nTang Shi withdrew her gaze, pushed open the shop door, and walked out.\n\n\"Boss, it's a bit chilly tonight, bring more clothes,\" the old Taoist priest said solicitously from the side.\n\nZhou Ze waved his hand, indicating he didn't need any.\n\nThen,\n\nZhou Ze also pushed open the door,\n\nAnd then,\n\nThere was no \"then.\"\n\nBecause Tang Shi was standing by the utility pole at the doorway, motionless. It didn't look like she had called a cab and was waiting. Zhou Ze could only stand beside her, not knowing what she meant.\n\nHalf an hour later,\n\nTang Shi was still standing there, motionless, without even a change in expression. Zhou Ze began to squat down and pulled out a cigarette.\n\nAn hour later,\n\nTang Shi was still motionless, while Zhou Ze simply sat on the curb, surrounded by a pile of cigarette butts.\n\nLooking at the bookstore door, less than two meters away from him,\n\nZhou Ze really wanted to take a hammer and crack open this girl's head, to ask her what on earth she was thinking.\n\nYou've been waiting for so long less than two meters from the door, why couldn't you wait inside the bookstore?\n\nInside the shop, the old Taoist, Bai Yingying, and Xu Qinglang occasionally passed by, seeing the boss still sitting outside, and then looking again, still sitting outside.\n\nZhou Ze slightly raised his head, then lowered it,\n\nSuddenly feeling a misconception that life was very difficult.\n\nFinally, a white Roewe car drove over and stopped in front of the bookstore.\n\nAre they here?\n\nThe person to have tea with?\n\nBecause Zhou Ze saw Tang Shi move; she walked forward.\n\nZhou Ze also stood up, watching the car door open, thinking whether he should organize the employees who were laughing at him to wear bikinis, hold colored balls, and spread their legs while shouting a few times:\n\n\"Welcome, welcome, a warm welcome...\"\n\nBut it seemed that except for Yingying, who looked good, the other two... no, actually, except for the old Taoist, the other two would look quite good and pleasing to the eye dressed like that.\n\nBut then, Zhou Ze froze. There was only one person in the car, the driver, but after the driver got out, he gave off a feeling of excessive indulgence.\n\nHeavy dark circles under his eyes, combined with that excited state, made it easy to assume this guy was driving while high on drugs.\n\n\"Hahahahahaha...\"\n\nAs soon as the driver got out of the car, he clutched his stomach and laughed.\n\nLaughing like a pig.\n\nZhou Ze walked closer to him, lowered his head, and looked at him.\n\n\"Hahahahahaha... Where is this?\" the driver asked while laughing.\n\n\"Tongcheng,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\nThe other party spoke with a strong Sichuan accent,\n\nMust be a friend from Sichuan.\n\n\"Hahahahahaha... Where's Tongcheng? Never heard of it.\"\n\n\"In Jiangsu,\" Zhou Ze reminded him.\n\n\"Hahahahahaha... I drove out to buy a condom, how did I end up driving non-stop all the way to Jiangsu?\"\n\nYou ask me, who should I ask?\n\nZhou Ze felt like this driver had some mental issues.\n\nAlright,\n\nBefore, Zhou Ze had guessed whether the person Tang Shi wanted to have tea with might be that one,\n\nBut if that person was like this in front of him,\n\nZhou Ze also wanted to join in the \"hahahaha.\"\n\n\"Hahahahaha, I'm so tired, I'm so sleepy,\" the driver continued to hahahaha.\n\n\"Hahahaha, can you stop laughing?\"\n\n\"Hahahahaha, I can't! I don't know why I'm so happy!\" the driver said.\n\n\"Hahahaha, are you mentally ill?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Hahahahaha, yes, yes, I drove over two thousand kilometers non-stop from Rongcheng to this Tongcheng, I think I really am mentally ill.\"\n\n\"Hahahaha, what exactly are you here for?\"\n\n\"Hahahahaha, there's someone in my trunk! I think he's my biological father or mother! I joyfully brought him here!\"\n\n\"Hahahahaha... hmm?\"\n\nZhou Ze stopped laughing and looked at the trunk.\n\nThen he saw Tang Shi raise her hand,\n\nThe entire car shook,\n\nSqueaking,\n\nWithout pressing the unlock button, the trunk popped open directly.\n\nAlthough this white Roewe had become somewhat dusty after a long journey of over two thousand kilometers, Tang Shi's act of violently opening the trunk without even waiting to unlock it was still a bit excessive.\n\nIn the trunk, a person was lying,\n\nOh no,\n\nMore precisely,\n\nIt was one person and one cat.\n\nThe person's eyes were wrapped in bandages, from which a little blood had seeped out. Beside that person, there was a cat lying motionless.\n\nBoth the person and the cat looked as if they were dead, with only a slight rise and fall of their chests indicating they still had a breath left.\n\nTang Shi personally bent down, picked up the white cat, and then looked into the house.\n\n\"Old Taoist.\"\n\n\"Coming, what's up?\"\n\nThe old Taoist priest scurried over, then glanced at the trunk, and was immediately startled. He quickly came over and picked up the person whose eyes were wrapped in bandages.\n\n\"Boss, how did you end up like this? You're so miserable, so miserable!\"\n\nZhou Ze, standing nearby, knew the old Taoist wasn't crying for him,\n\nBut hearing such wails while standing there always felt a bit uncomfortable.\n\nThe person and the cat were carried into the bookstore by Tang Shi and the old Taoist, while the driver was still there, leaning against the car door, continuing to \"hahahahahaha...\"\n\nZhou Ze somewhat understood; this driver was really unlucky, he had been hypnotized.\n\nHe went out to buy a condom, probably had a girl waiting at the hotel, but he drove directly from Rongcheng to Tongcheng in one go.\n\nBut how did they break the hypnosis?\n\nFortunately, once the people from the car were carried inside, the driver seemed to return to normal, immediately collapsing to the ground and falling into a deep sleep.\n\nFinally, the driver was sent to a nearby hotel by Xu Qinglang to check in. As for whether the hotel owner would misunderstand anything, Zhou Ze wasn't sure.\n\nHe went straight upstairs to Tang Shi's bedroom, where the man was lying motionless.\n\nTo be honest, Zhou Ze was quite grateful to him. If it weren't for his killing spree in Rongcheng, his relationship with the little loli wouldn't have become so harmonious.\n\nPerhaps he would be facing the little loli's pursuit or already have been killed by now.\n\n\"Can he wake up?\"\n\nZhou Ze asked.\n\nTang Shi didn't answer, personally wiping his face with a wet towel.\n\nCarefully, obediently.\n\nWhy didn't I get this treatment when I was injured?\n\nWe're all possessing corpses; my Xu Le is much handsomer than this guy, alright?\n\n\"I don't mean anything else, I just want to ask, will his staying here attract the attention of other netherworld messengers, leading to another group of people coming to encircle him?\n\nDon't misunderstand, I don't mean to drive him away, I'm just asking so we can make some preparations.\n\nAfter all, you don't have netherworld messenger licenses, so your identities can't be cleared for now.\"\n\nTang Shi looked at Zhou Ze and said, \"Netherworld messenger license?\"\n\nAre you truly unaware or feigning ignorance?\n\nZhou Ze pulled out his netherworld messenger license and shook it in front of Tang Shi,\n\n\"It's this thing. With it, you can clear your identity. As long as you don't do anything too extreme afterward, you can live peacefully for a long time. It's just that this thing is difficult to obtain; you need luck to get it.\"\n\nJust then,\n\nThe unconscious man lying on the bed trembled slightly,\n\nFrom his hoodie pocket,\n\nSomething seemed to spill out,\n\nFalling from the bed to the floor,\n\nScattering all over the place,\n\nIt was a floor full of,\n\nNetherworld messenger licenses.",

    "content": "Xu Qinglang sat on a sofa, smoking a cigarette, with a glass of iced beer in front of him.\n\nZhou Ze walked over, picked up the beer, and downed it in one go.\n\n\"What's wrong with you?\" Xu Qinglang knew Zhou Ze usually didn't drink.\n\n\"Like you, showing off your twenty-some houses in front of that corgi girl last time.\"\n\n\"............\" Xu Qinglang.\n\nAfter a period of silence, Xu Qinglang poured Zhou Ze another glass of beer. The two men sat quietly.\n\n\"Let me tell you something. I meant to yesterday, but I wasn't in the mood.\"\n\n\"I'm not in the mood now either.\"\n\n\"It's just that your ashes were stolen. It's like a pervert collected your old toenail clippings. What's there to brood over?\"\n\n\"Easy for you to say.\"\n\n\"I'm actually quite envious of you. I think if I could one day be drinking and feeling sad about my ashes being stolen, I'd be laughing out loud in my bed.\"\n\nXu Qinglang wore a serious expression.\n\nYes,\n\nIf it were an ancestral grave dug up, or parents' ashes stolen by an enemy, then of course, there'd be anger and anxiety!\n\nBut it really seems no one has ever been anxious about their own ashes being stolen.\n\n\"So, should I post something on Weibo, subtly and tastefully showing off?\" Zhou Ze retorted.\n\n\"Heh, just kidding. Oh, right, have they found the thief?\"\n\n\"The little loli is still looking.\"\n\nZhou Ze could only wait for news now.\n\nJust then, Zhou Ze and Xu Qinglang both looked towards the stairwell. The old Daoist carried a man down.\n\n\"What's wrong?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nTang Shi, who followed behind, ignored Zhou Ze. A taxi was waiting outside. Tang Shi and the man got into the taxi. It looked like they were planning to leave.\n\nLeaving right after arriving, and the man was still unconscious.\n\nThe most crucial thing was that he even \"trembled\" while unconscious, scattering Ghost Messenger certificates all over the floor.\n\nZhou Ze hadn't even had a chance to wait for him to wake up and chat a bit before they were ready to leave.\n\nOf course, Zhou Ze didn't try to stop them, because both knew they weren't the type to be polite, reserved, or fond of formalities.\n\nStay if you want to stay,\n\nLeave if you want to leave,\n\nNo need for coy gestures or pretense.\n\nThe taxi drove away, but to Zhou Ze's surprise, the old Daoist came back. He didn't leave.\n\nZhou Ze had expected the old Daoist to go with them.\n\nThe old Daoist walked back into the shop as if nothing had happened.\n\n\"Hey.\" Zhou Ze called out.\n\nThe old Daoist turned his head to Zhou Ze, smiling with a simple, honest expression. He said,\n\n\"Boss, Miss Tang has left with Mr. Liang. Miss Tang had already arranged new lodging before, and they're going to Shanghai. She said they have their documents now and it's inconvenient to trouble you further.\"\n\n\"Why didn't you go with them?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"I am your loyal old Daoist!\"\n\nThe old Daoist spoke with an air of righteous conviction.\n\n\"Tell me the truth.\"\n\n\"I can't leave you, I can't let go of you.\"\n\n\"The truth.\"\n\nZhou Ze looked at his fingernails.\n\n\"Given Mr. Liang's current state, the Underworld Store won't be able to open anytime soon. There's nothing for me to do if I go with them, so I can only continue to help you here.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded and walked over to his bar counter. Business had been good these days, sending many ghosts down, so a lot of冥鈔 (ghost money) had accumulated.\n\nHe took out half of it and handed it to the old Daoist.\n\n\"Give this to them. They're new here, so they're probably short on cash.\"\n\nZhou Ze was worried that if Tang Shi was short on money, she might just rob a bank. That woman was capable of anything.\n\n冥鈔 could be used as a consumable or like a bank card; burning it would make money appear at your door.\n\nUnexpectedly, the old Daoist shook his head directly. He said,\n\n\"Boss, Mr. Liang is very rich. He has many villas in Shanghai, properties all over the country, and he's hidden many boxes of 'little gold fish'.\"\n\n\"............\" Zhou Ze.\n\nHis heart,\n\nached so much he couldn't breathe...\n\nZhou Ze felt like he'd taken two critical hits within an hour,\n\nand both were invisible.\n\nPutting the money back, Zhou Ze silently sat down.\n\nJust then, a girl ran past the doorway. The girl was dressed rather shabbily, almost to the point of being scantily clad.\n\nActually, to be honest,\n\nIn this day and age, under the brilliant leadership of the Party Central Committee, the living standards of the people across the country are continuously improving, and people's material and spiritual lives are constantly enriched and enhanced.\n\nNew era, new policies,\n\nWith the help of targeted poverty alleviation measures, impoverished households can also receive significant assistance. It can be said that the era of a moderately prosperous society for all people is not far off.\n\nEven if there are some beggars in some cities, it's very rare these years to see beggars in such a miserable state of being unclothed.\n\nThe old Daoist was still wiping the table, seemingly not noticing the little girl entering.\n\nThe little monkey, however, directly leaped onto the old Daoist's head, its two monkey paws clutching the Daoist's head, manipulating him to look towards the little girl.\n\n\"A ghost has come?\"\n\nThe old Daoist mumbled to himself while taking out ox tears from his pocket to rub on his eyes.\n\nThere was no other way; in this bookstore, he was the only one who couldn't see ghosts directly.\n\nAfter seeing the dirty little girl, the old Daoist instinctively looked at Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Boss, we have a customer! Time to greet!\"\n\nThe old voice shouted,\n\nlike a dream back to an ancient brothel.\n\nGirls,\n\nCome out and greet the customers!\n\nComing,\n\nMama.\n\nXu Qinglang stood up to prepare cold dishes and drinks. Zhou Ze motioned for the girl to follow him.\n\nThe girl seemed a little confused and a little scared. She looked at Zhou Ze, then at the old Daoist, but still instinctively followed Zhou Ze into the private room.\n\nZhou Ze sat down and gestured for her to sit down too.\n\nThe girl sat down. Xu Qinglang also brought over several cold dishes, some small side dishes, and a steamed bun.\n\nWhen he was about to pour wine, Zhou Ze gestured not to.\n\nEven though she was a ghost, she was still a child.\n\nAnd from the little girl's demeanor, it was clear she wasn't the type of being like a celestial child prodigy.\n\nThe girl began to wolf down the food,\n\nShe was clearly \"starving.\"\n\nAnd this kind of hunger was more akin to having been \"hungry\" during her life.\n\nZhou Ze sat silently, watching the girl eat.\n\nAfter the girl finished eating, a satisfied smile appeared on her face. She said,\n\n\"So full. It feels so good to be full.\"\n\nThe girl's words carried a strong local accent from Tongcheng.\n\nChildren of this era, you might not even get them to speak a dialect; they mostly speak standard Mandarin.\n\n\"Now that you're full, let's get going.\"\n\nZhou Ze was about to open the Gates of Hell.\n\nThe little girl looked at Zhou Ze with some fear, but she didn't cry or fuss; she just waited silently.\n\n\"Wait.\" Xu Qinglang, who had been watching the little girl eat, suddenly spoke. \"Want some meat?\"\n\nThe little girl froze for a moment, then her eyes lit up, and she nodded repeatedly.\n\n\"Then wait.\"\n\nHe said this to the little girl and also to Zhou Ze.\n\nAlright, Old Xu wants to be a good person, a great philanthropist. Zhou Ze had no reason to stop him, so he continued to sit there.\n\nAfter a quarter of an hour, Xu Qinglang brought out a plate of braised pork, and the little girl continued to eat.\n\nIn reality, ghosts eat offerings, incense. The little girl seemed to be devouring the food, but to ordinary people, the dishes on the table hadn't been touched at all.\n\n\"Does the meat taste good?\" Xu Qinglang asked.\n\n\"Delicious, delicious,\" the little girl said.\n\n\"Are you having a motherly outburst today?\"\n\nZhou Ze asked, somewhat curious.\n\nXu Qinglang shook his head, a faint sorrow clouding his brows. Since returning yesterday, he had maintained this melancholic, Lin Daiyu-like demeanor.\n\nA man,\n\nhaving lost his virginity,\n\ncould be so resentful, as if life had lost its meaning.\n\nZhou Ze thought he should be grateful there wasn't a well in the bookstore, otherwise, Miss Xu might have chosen to gracefully perish.\n\nThe little girl finished eating,\n\nthen patted her belly,\n\nand looked at Zhou Ze.\n\nThis time she was very well-behaved; she was good after eating her fill, a very sensible child.\n\nShe knew it was time for her to go.\n\nZhou Ze stood up, and while opening the Gates of Hell, he asked,\n\n\"Go on in.\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't ask for her story. Perhaps having heard too many stories before, Zhou Ze had become less fond of listening to them.\n\nMost people who die have their own sad stories.\n\nThe little girl blinked, looked at Zhou Ze, and asked,\n\n\"Can I eat my fill before I go in?\"\n\n\"Hmm.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"Then I'll go call everyone. The villagers are all hungry. I want everyone to be able to eat their fill.\"\n\nZhou Ze's hand, which was opening the Gates of Hell, trembled slightly.\n\nThere were \"everyone\" to call?\n\nThis meant there was a huge wave of performance to be gained!\n\nSubconsciously, Zhou Ze closed the Gates of Hell he had just opened.\n\nBoss Zhou was in the initial stages of his career, urgently needing performance to prove himself, so he naturally understood the principle of long-term investment.\n\n\"Where is your home?\"\n\nZhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Sanxiang Village,\" the little girl replied.\n\n\"Where is Sanxiang Village? Which district? Rugao, Menhai, or Chongchuan Gangzha?\"\n\nAlthough Zhou Ze had undergone transmigration, he was from Tongcheng in his previous life, but he still didn't remember a place called Sanxiang Village in Tongcheng.\n\nZhou Ze looked at Xu Qinglang, who shook his head, indicating he didn't know either.\n\n\"I don't know.\" The girl didn't know where Sanxiang Village was, and she had never even heard of the district names Zhou Ze mentioned.\n\n\"Then............\"\n\nZhou Ze was at a loss and could only continue to ask,\n\n\"Can you go back the way you came?\"\n\nThe girl shook her head ignorantly. \"I don't know how I walked out of the village, and then I kept walking and walking, and I ended up here.\"\n\nCouldn't she go back the way she came?\n\nZhou Ze even began to wonder if the girl was from a neighboring city, a ghost who had crossed boundaries, but then he thought again that it wasn't right; the girl spoke in a Tongcheng dialect, so it was unlikely she was from somewhere else.\n\nJust as Zhou Ze was wrestling with this, Xu Qinglang, who was standing by, took out his phone and searched.\n\n\"Did you find it?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nXu Qinglang shook his head. \"I didn't find any information on this administrative village.\"\n\n\"Not even searchable online?\" Zhou Ze was a little surprised.\n\n\"Hey, wait a minute, there's a post here that mentions 'Sanxiang Village'.\"\n\nXu Qinglang motioned for Zhou Ze to wait, then clicked into the post and said,\n\n\"The title of this post is:\n\n'Asking the well-informed,\n\nIs there a place called Sanxiang Village in Tongcheng?'\"\n\n\"What are the replies below?\" Zhou Ze pressed.\n\n\"None.\n\nDon't know.\n\nNever heard of it.\n\nNo.\n\nNever heard of it.\n\nUpstairs +1............\"\n\nXu Qinglang kept flipping through the pages, then froze, looked down for a while, and then looked up at Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Did you find anything?\"\n\n\"There's a reply here: 'When I was little, my grandma told me she was from Sanxiang Village, but when she was ten, she followed her maternal grandmother back to her hometown in Xingdong Town.\n\nA few days later, when she went back, she found that the village was gone.'\"\n\n\"Gone?\" Zhou Ze was stunned.\n\nGone,\n\nWhat did that mean?\n\n\"Someone asked about it below,\" Xu Qinglang said. \"I'll look for that person's reply again... Found it. He replied to the person above, saying:\n\n'That year was 1938. You can imagine why the village was gone.'\"",

    "content": "1938?\n\nZhou Ze looked at the little girl, then at Xu Qinglang, and said,\n\n\"The devils entered Tongcheng in '38, right?\"\n\nXu Qinglang thought for a moment, then said, \"It seems they entered Tongcheng in March of '38.\"\n\nIf that were the case, then the so-called Sanxiang Village was likely a tragedy of that era. The village should have been razed when the devils entered Tongcheng, and everyone in the village, including this little girl, likely perished. The grandmother of the person who posted the thread was simply lucky to have escaped.\n\nEven today, there's no way to find any other information about Sanxiang Village, nor are there any official records.\n\nThis wasn't due to official negligence; it was because, in that era, countless similar tragedies occurred. Amidst years of constant turmoil, many who died tragically were simply forgotten.\n\n\"So, an entire village that died during the Anti-Japanese War didn't enter the cycle of reincarnation?\"\n\nZhou Ze frowned.\n\nIt's been eighty years, more than a sixty-year cycle. Are the souls of this entire village still lingering there?\n\n\"I don't know, but looking at this little girl, it seems that way. How about this, I'll go to the municipal library and check the local gazetteers to see where Sanxiang Village was specifically located, or I'll consult relevant people.\"\n\nXu Qinglang got up, grabbed his car keys, and went straight out.\n\nHe was very proactive in this matter, but his proactiveness differed from Zhou Ze's. Zhou Ze still had performance targets as a reason, while Xu Qinglang simply wanted to do something from the bottom of his heart.\n\nAfter all, they were all fellow townspeople.\n\nZhou Ze sat down in a nearby chair and pointed at the old Taoist priest: \"Watch her.\"\n\nThe old Taoist nodded and watched the little girl with the little monkey.\n\nThe little girl looked somewhat bewildered, not knowing what was happening, but instinctively stood there, not daring to move much.\n\nThe little monkey reached out as if to touch the girl's soul but was directly slapped away by the old Taoist, who reprimanded,\n\n\"What are you touching? She's even older than me!\"\n\nIf the little girl hadn't died, she would be ninety years old now.\n\nBut she was still so innocent and childlike, completely retaining her pre-death mental state. This was what Zhou Ze found most curious. Zhou Ze guessed that there might have been some problem in that village, preventing the souls of the entire village from leaving, trapping them there together, unaware of seasons or time.\n\nHowever, the specific situation would only be verifiable after Xu Qinglang found concrete information.\n\nZhou Ze took out his phone and scrolled through it casually. He rarely used WeChat or QQ because they were filled with Xu Le's old social network, which couldn't be helped, as his old account couldn't be recovered and was difficult to appeal.\n\nScrolling through his Moments, Zhou Ze surprisingly saw Bai Yingying had shared an article titled \"On the Bed Skills of Men in the Military!\"\n\nZhou Ze was momentarily stunned.\n\nThis female corpse seemed to be running further and further down the path of a chuunibyo girl.\n\nIt seemed he needed to find time to have a serious talk with her. Such things should not be reposted; they were taboo.\n\nAt this moment, Bai Yingying was busy upstairs in her room playing PUBG and wasn't downstairs.\n\nZhou Ze got up and walked up the stairs, and as he walked, he casually clicked on the shared link.\n\nHmm,\n\nTo educate a chuunibyo girl, one must prescribe the right medicine and know both oneself and the enemy to win every battle.\n\nAfter clicking in,\n\nIt was a bunch of white and green pictures,\n\nAnd then,\n\nIt turned out to be a bedding-folding competition for a certain factory, and the top three winners were all masters who had previously served in the military.\n\nWhat a despicable clickbait title!\n\nZhou Ze put down his phone and pushed open the bedroom door.\n\n\"Seaweed, seaweed, swaying with the waves;\n\nSeaweed, seaweed, seaweed, seaweed, dancing in the spray!\"\n\nBai Yingying lay on the bed with her bare white feet dangling back and forth, holding her phone and scrolling through videos, giggling like a pig.\n\nShe didn't even notice Zhou Ze walking over.\n\nThen, Zhou Ze sat down by her bed.\n\n\"Hahahahaha...\"\n\nBai Yingying laughed and then rolled over, directly sprawling onto Zhou Ze's lap.\n\nImmediately,\n\nHer long eyelashes fluttered, her alluring red lips slightly closed and then opened, and her delicate skin flushed slightly.\n\nThe atmosphere,\n\nAt this moment, became enchanting.\n\nHowever, Zhou Ze, living up to his title as a spoiler of fresh atmospheres, directly said,\n\n\"I've told you many times, don't get on the bed without washing your feet and showering after getting up.\"\n\nSaying that, Zhou Ze looked at the exposed, long, and infinitely tempting jade feet, and frowned:\n\n\"Dirty.\"\n\nBai Yingying immediately got off the bed, put on her slippers, crossed her hands beneath her, and lowered her head to Zhou Ze, striking a pose ready for a lecture.\n\nShe was quite familiar with this posture.\n\n\"Wash the bedsheets.\"\n\nZhou Ze said.\n\n\"Okay, boss.\"\n\nBai Yingying tidied up the bedsheets and went downstairs. Zhou Ze, meanwhile, sat in front of the computer, opened a web page, and began searching for information about Sanxiang Village again.\n\nPreviously, Xu Qinglang had searched on his phone, which might have missed some details.\n\nUnfortunately,\n\nRegarding that village, at least online, there was no information other than that discussion thread.\n\nZhou Ze also clicked on the thread Xu Qinglang had read earlier. The thread was posted on a local Tongcheng forum in 2009.\n\nHe first read the two replies stating that the grandmother was from Sanxiang Village but found nothing. Then, Zhou Ze chose to view the main topic. In this thread, there were actually two informed people.\n\nOne was, of course, the replier, but the replier had already said everything they knew. The other was the original poster.\n\nSince Sanxiang Village had been forgotten by people, not even existing in records, only in stories told by the grandmother, why did this original poster suddenly bring up the place name and ask about it?\n\nZhou Ze clicked on the original poster's avatar and found that this user hadn't posted anything after 2009. Zhou Ze copied the original poster's ID.\n\nThe ID was \"WoxinchangdanSanqianYuejiaKeTunWu19800201\".\n\nThe beginning was familiar, and Zhou Ze speculated the string of numbers at the end might be the person's birthday.\n\nThen, Zhou Ze searched for this ID again and indeed found a thread. This thread was posted on the \"Penglai Ghost Stories\" section of the Tianya Forum.\n\nThe original poster was still \"WoxinchangdanSanqianYuejiaKeTunWu19800201\", and the post date was still 2009.\n\nThis thread didn't gain much traction, and there weren't many replies.\n\nOf course, the ID numbers at the end were also the same, which meant that the person who posted the inquiry about Sanxiang Village on the Tongcheng local forum was also the person who posted the story on the Tianya Forum.\n\nZhou Ze continued reading; it was a story.\n\nThe original poster began by saying:\n\n\"This is something I experienced personally. Although it's strange and absurd, I believe it wasn't a dream or a hallucination. This is my true story.\"\n\nA very clichéd ghost story opening,\n\nVery popular in ghost story tropes ten years ago, where the beginning would subtly emphasize its truthfulness.\n\nZhou Ze continued to read:\n\n\"In March this year, I was driving home from the Guanyin Mountain Town Power Supply Station. Yes, I work at the power supply station, but my home is near Xingdong Airport.\n\nOn my way home, I passed through Xingren Town. I got off the elevated road there because I needed to pick up my dry-cleaned clothes that I had left there that morning before work.\n\nThe dry cleaner was on Xingren Town Street, right across from Xingren Elementary School.\n\nIt was 9 PM when I drove over, and the streets were much emptier. But when I parked my car in front of the dry cleaner and stepped out, I twisted my ankle and fell directly.\n\nAt first, I just thought I was unlucky today, but this was only the beginning. Because when I fell to the ground, I suddenly found that the surrounding streets and tall buildings were gone. I wasn't on the road but on a muddy field path, and opposite me wasn't the dry cleaner but rows of mud houses.\n\nI was stunned. I looked back at my car and found that it had turned into a haystack.\n\nI was really scared then. I didn't know what had happened. I sat on the ground for fifteen minutes, constantly thinking it was a dream and hoping I would wake up soon.\n\nBut I didn't wake up. Then I saw an old man leading a little girl walking towards me. The old man had a hoe on his shoulder, and the little girl was playing with a sugar figurine.\n\nThey got closer and closer. They were also talking, and they were speaking Tongcheng dialect.\n\nI immediately asked them, where is this?\n\nThey looked at me curiously too. The old man replied that this was 'Sanxiang Village'.\n\nWhere is Sanxiang Village?\n\nI'd never heard of it.\n\nThen I immediately stood up and asked them how I could get out.\n\nThe old man probably thought I was crazy or had a problem with my mind, and quickly pulled his granddaughter away.\n\nHaving no choice, I walked into the village alone. At that time, I even wondered if I had been drugged and abducted to some remote mountain forest, but then I found it absurd. I'm a grown man; why would anyone abduct me?\n\nI can't have children.\n\nEvery household had its doors closed. A few houses occasionally had lights on with silhouettes inside. I didn't dare to knock on doors or go inside. I just walked cautiously past each house.\n\nI heard people inside many houses chatting and talking, and they were all shouting that they were hungry.\n\nWives shouted they were hungry to their husbands,\n\nChildren shouted they were hungry to their parents,\n\nElderly parents shouted they were hungry to their sons and daughters-in-law,\n\nThe people in this village were all very hungry.\n\nAt night, inside their houses, they just kept talking about \"so hungry, so hungry.\"\n\nMy heart grew more and more anxious as I walked.\n\nI had a feeling that since they were so hungry, they might all rush out and boil and eat me.\n\nI started to run,\n\nRunning quickly,\n\nI instinctively sensed danger.\n\nI had to run out of here before they came out to catch me, no matter where I ran, I just had to get as far away from this cursed village as possible.\n\nI don't know how long I ran,\n\nUntil finally,\n\nI forgot...\n\nThen, when I woke up the next day,\n\nI found myself in the driver's seat of my car, having slept through the night.\n\nBut this was absolutely not a dream; a dream couldn't be that real!\n\nAnd my clothes and pant legs were all muddy,\n\nAnd there were a few bits of straw in my neck and hair.\n\nSanxiang Village,\n\nThis place definitely exists,\n\nDefinitely!\"\n\nThe original poster also posted photos of himself at the time, showing the muddy clothes and straw bits.\n\nBut the replies below clearly didn't believe him, saying:\n\n\"This ghost story is too far-fetched.\"\n\n\"The production cost is also very low. Just make some clothes dirty, take a picture, and play 'picture talk'?\"\n\n\"Starting with one picture, everything else is made up, OP. Not serious, not serious.\"\n\n\"OP, didn't you have your phone with you then? Why didn't you record or take pictures?\"\n\nZhou Ze continued to scroll down.\n\nFortunately, there weren't many replies because this ghost story was truly neither novel nor exciting.\n\nBut below, Zhou Ze saw a reply from the original poster:\n\n\"Just wait, I will definitely find a way to go again. This time I'll bring evidence back to prove I'm not making things up.\"\n\nThe next reply was from 2010, a year later.\n\n\"It's been a year, OP, where the hell is your story? Haven't you finished writing it yet? I've kept it in my favorites.\"\n\nThen in 2011, there was a reply:\n\n\"Two years have passed, has the OP gone again or not?\"\n\nThe last reply was from 2012:\n\n\"Everyone, disperse. The OP is gone.\"\n\nAs Zhou Ze read, he was suddenly stunned.\n\nA passage suddenly came to his mind:\n\n\"Liu Ziji of Nanyang, a noble scholar, heard of it, and joyfully planned to go. Before he could, he fell ill and died, and thereafter no one sought the way again.\"",

    "content": "白鶯鶯抱著剛洗好的床單回來了，曬衣服都是在二樓，當然，白鶯鶯洗衣服的速度確實很快，但絕對沒有敷衍了事。\n\n\n\n  她清楚，在家庭衛生這一方面，自己的老闆有著幾乎苛刻地強迫症。\n\n\n\n  簡而言之，\n\n\n\n  就是好難伺候。\n\n\n\n  有時候，白鶯鶯也會在心理腹誹：\n\n\n\n  自家老闆上輩子是孤兒被父母遺棄也不是沒有原因的，很可能是奶嘴沒消毒他不吃，被褥沒洗乾淨他不睡，爹媽沒洗手不給碰，然後父母實在受不了把他丟掉了。\n\n\n\n  當然，這種腹誹白鶯鶯只敢在心理嘀咕一下，萬萬不敢說出口的。\n\n\n\n  她還必須每次都擺出受教的神情，然後陪著自己老闆一起手拉手奔向潔癖的快樂天堂，做出一副領會到精神且甘之如飴的樣子。\n\n\n\n  從心，\n\n\n\n  就是如此。\n\n\n\n  天不生我白鶯鶯，萬古慫道如長夜。\n\n\n\n  周澤站在窗邊抽著煙，那個帖子他看了，其實已經給出了很多的信息。\n\n\n\n  興仁鎮，\n\n\n\n  乾洗店，\n\n\n\n  位置應該就在那裡。\n\n\n\n  甚至，周澤還能看出很多帖子裡沒有的信息，因為他是鬼差，且不再是之前那種愣頭青，已經開始慢慢地入行且熟悉業務了。 \n\n\n\n  鬼出自於人，人必將變鬼，但人鬼殊途，有一條線，將彼此隔絕開。\n\n\n\n  陽間和陰間，\n\n\n\n  彼此共存也彼此對立。\n\n\n\n  什麼樣的人才會容易見鬼？\n\n\n\n  有遭遇了特殊事情的，這是一類。\n\n\n\n  還有一大類，則是快死的人，陽壽將盡，就像是你手機餘額不多了，10086會不停地給你發提示簡訊一樣。\n\n\n\n  到點了，\n\n\n\n  你該走了。\n\n\n\n  在那個時候，你雖然是活人，但即將變成死人，身上的死氣已經開始加重了。\n\n\n\n  這種加重，並非單純地是指你生病了，重病纏身，可能也是指你即將遭遇不測，可能是一場車禍，可能是吃飯被噎死喝水被嗆死，\n\n\n\n  總之，\n\n\n\n  你快掛了。\n\n\n\n  然後你就很可能見鬼了，彼此之間的氣場開始從對立變得融合起來。\n\n\n\n  結合這個樓主09年之後再沒有活躍的消息，應該可以大概猜出，樓主確實已經涼了。\n\n\n\n  但他對三鄉村的描述以及他自己記錄下來的經歷，再加上樓下小女孩的話語，其實已經將整件事情的淪落給勾勒了出來。\n\n\n\n  一個在日軍攻入通城的那一年被屠殺的村子， \n\n\n\n  在八十年之後，\n\n\n\n  那個村子裡的人，不，是整個村子的鬼，卻依舊被困鎖在一個區域裡，無法投胎，無法轉世。\n\n\n\n  他們也沒有變成厲鬼，如果變成了厲鬼，再加上八十年的發酵，那個樓主第一次進去時，就該GG了，也不可能出得來。\n\n\n\n  而且小女孩依舊天真爛漫，仿佛剛死的樣子。\n\n\n\n  到底是什麼原因，導致那樣子的一個和諧的村子出現？\n\n\n\n  白鶯鶯曬了被子，偷偷摸摸地坐到電腦前，網癮少女一邊打量著周澤一邊想偷偷地玩會兒遊戲，目光盯著屏幕，自然而然地把那個小故事看了一遍，隨即道：\n\n\n\n  「老闆，這不就是《桃花源記》麼？」\n\n\n\n  周澤點點頭，\n\n\n\n  是的，\n\n\n\n  這就是翻版的《桃花源記》。\n\n\n\n  一直以來，人們一直想當然地把陶淵明筆下的《桃花源記》當作一個世外桃源來理解，然而實際上，這篇看似美好的故事文章，四處都透露著詭異和陰森。\n\n\n\n  你如果換一個視角來看，《桃花源記》完全就是一個鬼故事，一個漁夫誤入鬼村的故事，正如帖子裡的樓主一樣。\n\n\n\n  十指，在窗台邊輕輕抖動，這個地方，自己是要去的。 \n\n\n\n  不提如果能夠把那個村子所有的亡魂送入地獄自己基本可以轉正的誘、、、惑，光是父老鄉親這一點，就足以讓周澤去嘗試出手幫助了。\n\n\n\n  八十年前，民族沉淪時，他們淪為了侵略者屠刀下的可憐亡魂，他們已經受了八十年的苦，是時候得以解脫了。\n\n\n\n  周澤拿出手機，撥通了許清朗的電話。\n\n\n\n  那邊卻顯示不在服務區，這讓周澤有些意外，許清朗現在不該是在地方圖書館麼，那裡手機信號這麼差？\n\n\n\n  過了一會兒，周澤又打了一次電話，對方還是無法接通，周澤不打算等了，直接示意白鶯鶯看店，自己則是帶著老道一起打車去了興仁鎮。\n\n\n\n  帶老道的原因很簡單，一是老道看管亡魂的能力不強，除了摸褲襠，對亡魂基本沒約束力，而那個小女孩的亡魂需要白鶯鶯看住。\n\n\n\n  二則是小猴子和老道玩得來，這一次要找尋那個樓主進入三鄉村的切入點，需要這頭畜生的幫助。\n\n\n\n  一念至此，\n\n\n\n  周澤的目光也就落在了小猴子身上，原本在老道膝蓋上趴著的小猴子忽然抬起頭對周澤齜牙咧嘴。\n\n\n\n  喲，\n\n\n\n  能看懂我內心想法？\n\n\n\n  或者是，\n\n\n\n  單純地感應到我在罵你？ \n\n\n\n  周澤伸手，攥住了小猴子的尾巴，避讓著前面司機的視線，盯著小猴子看了看。\n\n\n\n  好像長大了一些，\n\n\n\n  也重了一些，\n\n\n\n  呵呵，\n\n\n\n  膽兒也肥了啊。\n\n\n\n  小猴子很不滿地扭動著身子，它對周澤一向有些不感冒，所以在書店裡，它基本就跟著老道玩，對於周澤，它骨子裡有一種畏懼和忌憚。\n\n\n\n  畢竟，小猴子的前身，是被周澤活生生地用指甲刺死的。\n\n\n\n  它跟周澤，一人一猴，像是兩條交織的線，因果關係，亂得一塌糊塗。\n\n\n\n  到了地方，下了車，周澤輕輕地伸了個懶腰。\n\n\n\n  興仁鎮是一個小鎮，靠近市區，隔壁就是機場，而周澤所處的位置，就是十字街往東這邊，也是一個小交叉路口。\n\n\n\n  正北方向是興仁小學，正南是公寓樓，中間一條街都是小商鋪。\n\n\n\n  那家乾洗店還開在那裡。\n\n\n\n  算了算位置，周澤腦海中開始模擬那個樓主開車停在這裡摔跤的畫面。\n\n\n\n  「老闆，應該是小學方向吧？」老道這個時候開口道。\n\n\n\n  「哦？」周澤有些疑惑，老道是什麼水平，他是知道的。 \n\n\n\n  「嘿嘿，我沒看出來什麼，但我有經驗，通常來說，學校或者醫院這種地方，很多都是在亂葬崗那邊建起來的。\n\n\n\n  因為地便宜，尤其是學校這種地方，它不用開在鬧市區，哪怕偏僻一點，也無所謂。\n\n\n\n  而且，不是說現在學區房很熱，哪怕是很多年前，學校建在哪裡，哪裡的人氣也會馬上起來，所以在城市規劃的時候，往往都會把學校這個地方當作一個重要的落子點，選一個偏僻一點的地方，帶動那裡的發展。」\n\n\n\n  老道說得頭頭是道，也確實有幾分道理。\n\n\n\n  周澤看了看小猴子，道：「能看出什麼東西麼？」\n\n\n\n  小猴子撓撓頭，從老道身上跳下來，開始四處尋找。\n\n\n\n  然後，它懵懂地搖搖頭。\n\n\n\n  周澤眼睛微微眯了起來，他不認為小猴子在偷奸耍滑。\n\n\n\n  或許，是天還沒完全黑的原因吧，一些地方，在白天的時候受到壓制，等到晚上的時候，可能就容易顯露出蛛絲馬跡。\n\n\n\n  就這樣，周澤和老道進入了旁邊的一家快餐店，點了一些飲料零食坐在那裡等著。\n\n\n\n  小學開始放學了，這裡聚集了很多車輛，等到小學放學結束，天色也慢慢地黑了起來，附近的人氣也就慢慢低落了下去。\n\n\n\n  算算時間，也差不多了，這種事情，也沒必要等到深夜子時什麼的。 \n\n\n\n  再次牽著小猴子出來，小猴子這一次似乎一下子就捕捉到了什麼，開始在原地不停地打著圈兒，老道跟在小猴子身後也在打著圈兒。\n\n\n\n  周澤則是站在旁邊看著。\n\n\n\n  終於，小猴子嘴裡發出了「吱吱吱」的聲音，而後直接沖向了馬路。\n\n\n\n  就在此時，一輛小轎車正好開過來，車速其實並不快，但小猴子等於是往人家車輪里壓！\n\n\n\n  「吱呀！」\n\n\n\n  小轎車一個急剎車，車主罵道：「哪裡的死狗！」\n\n\n\n  車主下車檢查了一下，他剛剛看見一團黃毛衝到自己車前，結果下車後卻沒看見血污痕跡，當下又罵了幾句又上車開車走了。\n\n\n\n  老道有些後知後覺，在小猴子衝出去時，他連喊都來不及喊。\n\n\n\n  但這一會兒，他也明悟了過來，\n\n\n\n  猴子沒被車撞到，\n\n\n\n  確切的說，\n\n\n\n  猴子進去了。\n\n\n\n  「老闆，怎麼辦？」\n\n\n\n  老道問道。\n\n\n\n  周澤在原地，沿著猴子之前轉圈的位置，轉了幾圈，然後順著那個方向，衝刺了過去，剎那間，周澤感知到自己的指甲微微一顫，像是捕捉到了什麼東西，順勢一抓。 \n\n\n\n  「嗡！」\n\n\n\n  緊接著，四周的環境開始扭曲起來，\n\n\n\n  高樓、\n\n\n\n  馬路、\n\n\n\n  車輛、\n\n\n\n  全都消失不見，\n\n\n\n  這裡是一塊泥濘的田埂，不遠處則是一排排以泥土和稻草修葺起來的房子。\n\n\n\n  金絲猴蹲在周澤前面，看著周澤。\n\n\n\n  周澤環視四周，\n\n\n\n  他知道，\n\n\n\n  自己也進來了。\n\n\n\n  至於老道，\n\n\n\n  他估計進不來，除非等到他快蹬腿咽氣的時候，說不定才能碰巧起來。\n\n\n\n  遠處，走來一對爺孫，是一個爺爺牽著一個小女孩。\n\n\n\n  小女孩和自己書店裡的有點相像，比仔細看的話，還以為是一個人。\n\n\n\n  對上了，\n\n\n\n  和樓主在帖子裡的描述對上了。\n\n\n\n  「這裡是哪裡？」周澤問道。\n\n\n\n  按照劇本，他們應該回答自己這裡是「三鄉村」。\n\n\n\n  但接下來的一幕，\n\n\n\n  卻讓周澤愣了一下，\n\n\n\n  爺爺沒有回答， \n\n\n\n  女孩也沒回答，\n\n\n\n  一老一少，\n\n\n\n  就這樣死死地盯著周澤和小猴子，\n\n\n\n  嘴角開始很誇張地滴落出口水，\n\n\n\n  同時眼睛，\n\n\n\n  也開始慢慢地泛起了紅光！\n\n\n\n  喂，\n\n\n\n  導演，\n\n\n\n  劇本，\n\n\n\n  好像拿錯了？",

    "content": "The progression of events seemed to be slowly veering in an uncontrollable direction, at least, Zhou Ze hadn't been mentally prepared for it.\n\nThe state the little girl displayed upon entering his bookstore made Zhou Ze completely unprepared for the fact that the people in this village—\n\nOh no,\n\n—that the ghosts in this village, would turn out like this.\n\nHe was clearly here to deliver them, to save them,\n\nBut they were obviously treating him as food now.\n\nThe old man, hale and hearty, walked with the speed of wind. His hoe, when swung, even resembled Qin Shubao's three-strike maneuver.\n\nAnd the little girl, with her braids flying backward, a ferocious expression, and rapid speed, let out continuous shrill cries.\n\nThis was the manifestation of a vengeful spirit; ordinary deceased souls couldn't reach this level.\n\nRight now,\n\nThe old one lunged at Zhou Ze,\n\nWhile the young one lunged at the monkey.\n\nThe monkey initially swung its plastic toy hammer, but seeing the formidable vengeful spirit, it immediately stood behind Zhou Ze.\n\nCowardice,\n\nWas a belief,\n\nAnd had almost become a prevailing atmosphere in the bookstore,\n\nEven affecting the animals.\n\nOne must know that the monkey had previously shown a disdainful, aloof attitude towards Zhou Ze, but at this moment, it swiftly decided to let bygones be bygones.\n\nAlthough things had changed and the script seemed to be wrong,\n\nZhou Ze wasn't so easily startled into helplessness by two vengeful spirits.\n\nImmediately, he took a step forward, his fingernails growing longer, accompanied by wisps of black mist appearing around him.\n\nBy now, following the two instances of entering that severely injured zombie state, Zhou Ze was becoming more and more adept at using his fingernails and the power associated with them.\n\nCompared to when he first fought like a shrew tearing at people with her nails, it looked much better.\n\n\"Clap!\"\n\n\"Clap!\"\n\nWhen the black mist struck the old man and the little girl, their movements seemed to suddenly go into slow motion, while Zhou Ze floated lightly between them.\n\nHis clothes billowed,\n\nHe strolled at leisure,\n\nHis two hands,\n\nSlowly descended towards the tops of their heads,\n\nLike an immortal stroking one's crown,\n\nEverything under control.\n\nAt this moment, the only regret was perhaps that the old Daoist priest hadn't come in; otherwise, the thoughtful old Daoist would surely have helped him film this scene for future enjoyment.\n\nThen he would quietly smoke a cigarette, showing disdain,\n\nImplying it was basic operation, sit down.\n\nHowever, just as Zhou Ze's fingernails had pierced the heads of the grandfather and granddaughter, about to signal the end of everything,\n\nThe old man and the little girl's bodies suddenly twisted, and then completely dissipated.\n\nTheir speed,\n\nWas even faster than the little loli's \"pew!\"\n\nZhou Ze's hands were still suspended in the air,\n\nHe had already struck his pose,\n\nBut the people meant to collaborate in the performance had spaced out,\n\nWhich was a bit awkward.\n\nPutting his hands down, turning around, Zhou Ze was astonished to find the figures of the grandfather and granddaughter reappearing on the distant path.\n\nThe grandfather was carrying a hoe and holding his granddaughter's hand,\n\nThe old and the young seemed to have just returned from the fields,\n\nWith a sense of happiness and contentment,\n\nJust like the description in \"The Peach Blossom Spring\": \"old men with white hair and children with hair tied in knots were all content and happy.\"\n\nThe little monkey was also a bit baffled; clearly, its monkey brain, no matter how clever, couldn't comprehend what was happening.\n\nThe old and the young walked over again. The old man looked at Zhou Ze and asked curiously,\n\n\"Young man, where are you from?\"\n\n\"I don't know either.\" Zhou Ze shrugged.\n\nDamn it,\n\nThis time, he really didn't know.\n\n\"Are you lost?\" The old man was kind-hearted.\n\n\"Sort of.\" Zhou Ze sighed.\n\n\"This is Sanxiang Village, not far from the city. If you follow this road south, you'll reach the city.\" The old man kindly pointed the way.\n\nThe little girl played with the candy figurine in her hand, her figure somewhat thin, but still innocent and adorable.\n\nThe image of the grandfather and granddaughter was simply two extremes compared to their recent man-eating appearance.\n\n\"Okay, got it.\" Zhou Ze nodded.\n\nThe grandfather and granddaughter walked into the village, chatting and laughing.\n\nZhou Ze looked up at the sky; he hadn't noticed it before, but now he did—the moon in the sky seemed to have a faint reddish glow at its edges.\n\nNine years ago, when that original poster first came here, the first scene he experienced should have been the same as Zhou Ze's second experience; otherwise, he wouldn't have been able to leave or post anything after his first entry.\n\nBut he mentioned in his post that when he walked through the village at night, every household was talking about how hungry they were and how much they wanted to eat, which meant that nine years ago, the \"hunger\" in this village had already started to become problematic.\n\nNow, nine years later with his arrival, the problem had further fermented and worsened.\n\nFrom then on, if any \"fisherman\" accidentally entered, he would likely not see a simple Peach Blossom Spring, but only become food for the many departed souls in this village.\n\nHere,\n\nIt had gradually become a fierce place.\n\nZhou Ze took a step and walked into the village. He needed to look around and explore the village, at least to find out what had happened in this village during the massacres by the Japanese devils.\n\nIn those years of national crisis, countless innocent souls perished. Why did this village alone survive in such a bizarre manner?\n\nSomething abnormal must indicate something monstrous.\n\nThe houses in the village were built with mud and straw, a few better-off families would lay some tiles on their roofs. This was the general housing standard in rural areas eighty years ago.\n\nZhou Ze remembered seeing similar houses in the countryside of Tongcheng when he was a child, but those were ancestral homes, no longer inhabited.\n\nEvery household had its own fenced yard, all very tidy, even excessively tidy. Generally, one could plant some green onions, ginger, garlic, or other small vegetables in the yard, but here the yards were barren and flat, not even a blade of grass.\n\nAn old woman sat on a small stool by the door, doing needlework on cloth shoes. She was very serious and engrossed, but Zhou Ze saw from afar that the old woman was drooling while doing her needlework.\n\nOn the ground,\n\nA large puddle had already accumulated.\n\nThis scene was quite eerie.\n\nThe old woman remained oblivious, even as her saliva soaked the shoes in her hands, she continued as she pleased, immersed in her own world.\n\nFortunately, when Zhou Ze and the little monkey walked past, she didn't look up. However, Zhou Ze didn't dare to completely disregard her as a passerby. With the previous example of the old man and the little girl, Zhou Ze knew that the people in this village could be overwhelmed by hunger and turn into vengeful spirits at any moment.\n\nAhead was a well, where a woman in her thirties or forties was drawing water. The woman had a good figure; though a bit rustic, in that era, she would have been considered a standard rural beauty.\n\nTall, with ample breasts and two round buttocks, exuding the most primitive and impulsive allure.\n\nBut when the woman turned around with her bucket, Zhou Ze saw that her mouth was full of a black mass, which she was vigorously chewing.\n\nIt was her hair,\n\nShe was tearing and eating her own hair while drawing water; she was very hungry, terribly hungry.\n\nThe old woman making cloth shoes looked up at the woman drawing water and called out,\n\n\"Dead widow, you lost your man and still dress so alluringly. Is that mouth of yours down there very thirsty?\"\n\nThe woman called a widow didn't back down, immediately shouting, \"Old Woman Cui, I'm not like you. Your mouth down there can't even spit out saliva anymore.\"\n\n\"Pah, you indecent thing, always thinking about men!\"\n\n\"I do, I think about it every day, I wish all the men in the village would come to my bed tonight, so I can eat them one by one.\n\nFried,\n\nSteamed,\n\nMixed with sauce,\n\nTsk, tsk,\n\nThat taste... I can't take it anymore, I really want a man.\"\n\nAs the widow spoke, she chewed her hair even more vigorously.\n\nAnd the old woman seemed to be stirred, drooling even more profusely, with an expression of longing.\n\nZhou Ze walked between them. For some reason, these two women seemed not to have seen him at all. But after Zhou Ze and the little monkey had walked away,\n\nThe old woman and the widow slowly raised their heads together, looking in the direction Zhou Ze had walked,\n\nBoth their eyes glowed with streaks of crimson.\n\nThe houses ahead looked a bit grander, with tiles on the roof and stone piers at the entrance, indicating a prosperous family.\n\nZhou Ze entered the courtyard; there was no one in the yard, but the smell of meat came from the kitchen. Zhou Ze walked over and opened the window.\n\nInside was a rural earthen stove,\n\nA young man was putting firewood behind the stove; the fire was burning fiercely.\n\nBut there was nothing in the pot, just a large pot of boiling water.\n\n\"Wife, the water's boiling, come quickly!\"\n\nThe man called to the other side, sounding a bit impatient.\n\nLike a newlywed husband, urging his wife to take a bath every night.\n\n\"Coming, coming, look at you!\n\nYou're never so diligent with other things, only so keen on this.\"\n\nThe man ran out from behind the stove and embraced the woman, shouting,\n\n\"Quick, quick, quick, I can't hold back, I can't hold back.\"\n\n\"You wait.\"\n\nThe woman took off her clothes,\n\nSeemingly completely oblivious to the person standing by the window watching.\n\nAfter the woman took off her clothes, she revealed a clean, smooth back, but her right arm was already red, like the cooked pork head sold at a street food stall.\n\nThe woman directly climbed onto the stove and then sat into the scalding hot water, pouring hot water over herself with a basin while scolding her husband:\n\n\"Keep adding firewood, or it won't cook thoroughly, and it won't be tasty! Look at you, useless thing, put more effort into it, your old lady's not feeling good!\"\n\n\"Alright!\"\n\nThe husband immediately went to the back to add firewood.\n\nAnd the woman sitting in the pot, while cooking herself,\n\nBit into her right arm, which she had already cooked and braised earlier.\n\nHer eyes narrowed,\n\nAnd she enjoyed saying,\n\n\"So, so delicious.\"",

    "content": "A calm pace of life,\n\nA tranquil Republic of China rural atmosphere,\n\nDown-to-earth shouts of curses,\n\nNotes carrying the fragrance of soil.\n\nThis is its silhouette, the silhouette of Sanxiang Village, but once you take a few steps to the front, you'll be scared to death by its full face.\n\nEvery detail here is like a crack, and drops of fresh blood gush out from within, then engulfing and suffocating people.\n\nA terrifying dark cloud constantly hovers above this village, like a stage play, where every character seems to wear a mask with profound meaning.\n\nHanging in the sky was clearly the moon;\n\nBut the light on the ground was an uneven, ghastly white, as if an incompetent lighting technician had adjusted the angle incorrectly, making everything quite chaotic.\n\nSome people were sleeping,\n\nSome were cooking,\n\nSome were fetching water,\n\nSome were shouting curses,\n\nSome were laughing,\n\nAnd some were crying.\n\nZhou Ze walked for a long time, almost touring the entire village.\n\nIt could be confirmed that this place was indeed entirely different from when the original poster last visited.\n\nIf nine years ago, when the original poster first arrived, this place was merely playing hard to get, then now, it truly resembles a giant tiger that has opened its mouth, while its tiger eyes are fixed on you.\n\nIt can devour you whenever it wishes,\n\nAnd that feeling of constantly anticipating being eaten is the most agonizing and torturous.\n\nIf the original poster from nine years ago had seen this scene today, he probably wouldn't have had the courage to say he wanted to come back for evidence and photos.\n\nAfter walking around, Zhou Ze arrived outside an ancestral hall.\n\nThis ancestral hall was considered the most prestigious building in all of Sanxiang Village.\n\nIt wasn’t large,\n\nBut outside hung a plaque, and inside were carved beams and painted rafters; though small and somewhat cramped, it exuded a sense of refinement and solemnity.\n\nA blind old man in a long gown sat at the entrance of the ancestral hall, tapping the ground repeatedly with his cane, his lips trembling slightly.\n\nZhou Ze stopped in front of him, because this old man, in Zhou Ze's opinion, was the most normal one in the entire village.\n\nAt least, the old man wasn't drooling or letting saliva drip.\n\nBut after approaching,\n\nZhou Ze still heard the old man muttering to himself:\n\n\"Hungry, so hungry, truly hungry, I really want to eat white steamed buns, I really want to eat steamed buns.\"\n\nThe little monkey directly scampered up and grabbed the blind old man's goatee.\n\nThe blind old man raised his head; he was blind, without sunglasses, but where his eyes should have been was a murky expanse. At this moment, however, he must have sensed that someone, a stranger, was in front of him.\n\nHe licked his tongue, then swallowed,\n\nAnd said:\n\n\"Go, you should go. Everyone is about to lose control.\"\n\nThe blind old man's words were filled with weariness and helplessness.\n\nHe was warning Zhou Ze,\n\nThat this place,\n\nWas a place of trouble, and the people here were all very hungry.\n\nOne by one, hungry ghosts were about to be unleashed!\n\nIf he didn't leave now, he wouldn't be able to.\n\nZhou Ze still didn't move. To be honest, he wasn't particularly afraid of the vengeful spirits here. Even if their large number was a bit much for him to handle, there was a big difference between being unable to defeat them and being unable to escape.\n\nZhou Ze believed that no matter what, he still had a chance of escaping.\n\n\"What exactly happened here?\"\n\nZhou Ze asked.\n\nHe hoped for an answer, as to why the people in this village had turned out like this.\n\nActually,\n\nThe darkness and blood moon above the village had already explained many things. The village was an ominous place, a characteristic often seen in ancient battlefield sites.\n\n\"Don't ask, don't ask. Go, everyone is very hungry, very hungry. If you don't go, you'll be eaten.\"\n\nThe blind old man kept repeating these few sentences.\n\n\"Hungry? Were you starved to death?\"\n\nThat's impossible.\n\nHow could an entire village starve to death? If there was no food, wouldn't they go out to flee famine?\n\nMoreover, that grandma online who used to be from Sanxiang Village had replied that this village was massacred on the day the Japanese invaders marched into Tongcheng. What does that have to do with starvation?\n\n\"Go, you go!\"\n\nThe blind old man grew angry,\n\nTapping his cane on the ground incessantly.\n\n\"Go! Go!\"\n\nZhou Ze still didn't move, which made the blind old man anxious. Of course, while anxious, he also began sniffing continuously, clearly, he was drooling!\n\n\"If you don't go, you'll be eaten.\"\n\nThe blind old man's voice began to get lower and lower.\n\nHe himself was about to lose control.\n\nZhou Ze still didn't move. He wouldn't leave until he figured out what was happening here.\n\nThe affairs of the living belonged to the police, but the affairs of the dead were his responsibility.\n\nThis village, once called a \"modern-day\" Peach Blossom Spring, had, after nine years, gradually shown a tendency to become a den of vengeful spirits.\n\nThat little girl was likely fortunate; she wasn't corrupted or greatly affected and ended up at his bookstore.\n\nBut at the same time, the fact that the little girl appeared at the bookstore also indicated that the ghosts in Sanxiang Village, and the situation here, had begun to change.\n\nNot only could people enter,\n\nBut ghosts,\n\nCould also leave!\n\nOnce so many vengeful spirits were unleashed at once, how much impact and destruction would they cause?\n\nIf Zhou Ze hadn't known, it would have been fine, he could just deal with it in time, but he was already here.\n\nThe little loli once said that the Underworld had a scale.\n\nZhou Ze believed that if he left without intervening, his actions would be judged far more severely by the Underworld than his coercing the little loli into becoming his subordinate.\n\nIn the eyes of the Underworld,\n\nGhost messengers and constables are the lowest-ranking civil servants. You can engage in internal strife, vie for favor, or quarrel, but you must get things done, and maintaining stability is paramount.\n\nControlling the situation and preventing ghosts from affecting the human world is the most basic red line; everything else is not a problem.\n\nTherefore, Zhou Ze couldn't leave, even though he could sense that the oppressive feeling in the air was becoming increasingly intense.\n\nBut the most critical issue now was that without knowing the secret and origin of this village, Zhou Ze had no way to resolve the problem.\n\nJust like the old man and the little girl he encountered when he first entered, after Zhou Ze killed them, they instantly reverted to their previous state.\n\nIn this place, Zhou Ze simply couldn't kill them, let alone capture them for performance points.\n\n\"Go!\"\n\nThe blind old man suddenly stood up, extending his cane toward Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze reached out and grabbed the cane, his two fingernails directly embedding into it.\n\n\"Ahhhhhhh!!!!!!\"\n\nThe blind old man let out a low roar, then opened his mouth and bit directly at Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze took a step back, turned sideways, and entered the ancestral hall, while the blind old man was thrown back, tumbling down the ancestral hall steps.\n\nBut then, the blind old man directly lay on the ground, propping himself up with both hands and feet, his stomach heaving.\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nThe blind old man leaped over again,\n\nZhou Ze spread his hands, black mist swirling, directly trapping the blind old man. But Zhou Ze didn't use his fingernails to stab him to death; instead, he patted his face,\n\nAnd asked:\n\n\"Tell me, what exactly happened to this village!\"\n\n\"Ahhhhhhh!!!!!!\"\n\nHowever, the blind old man seemed to have completely lost his mind, struggling incessantly, trying to break free from Zhou Ze's restraint to bite him.\n\nThere was no way around it; Zhou Ze could only kick him again, sending him flying once more.\n\nJust like last time, the blind old man bounced back up after landing. Black liquid, mixed with fragments of tree bark and grass roots, constantly seeped from the corners of his mouth.\n\nClearly, for a long time, he had been so hungry that he had to subsist on such things.\n\nAnd at this moment,\n\nUnbeknownst to Zhou Ze, one villager after another had slowly gathered outside the ancestral hall. They all looked numb and staggered closer.\n\nThere was the old man carrying a hoe,\n\nThe little girl holding a candy figure,\n\nThe widow eating her own hair,\n\nThe old woman holding cloth shoes,\n\nThe young couple eating their own flesh,\n\nAnd many, many others,\n\nThey all gathered at the entrance of the ancestral hall,\n\nTheir eyes fixed on Zhou Ze. They were hungry, extremely, extremely hungry.\n\nThe little monkey shivered in fear and jumped directly onto the ancestral hall's offering table, trembling.\n\nSo many vengeful spirits,\n\nIt was terrifying,\n\nThe malevolent aura emanating from them alone was enough to suffocate a person. When they stood there, it seemed as if a dark cloud had engulfed the sky.\n\nZhou Ze gritted his teeth and asked:\n\n\"I know you're very hungry, but I truly wish for someone who is still sane enough to speak to tell me what's wrong with you.\n\nI'm here to help you, to relieve your suffering. Even if you've become like this, there's not entirely no possibility of reincarnation!\"\n\nZhou Ze spoke earnestly and sincerely,\n\nAnd,\n\nThe place where he hadn't felt pain for a long time now began to ache.\n\nZhou Ze instinctively reached for his chest.\n\nHe had almost forgotten its existence; it hadn't hurt for a long time.\n\nTang Shi told him before she left that he had become accustomed to living heartlessly, so now, was he starting to have a conscience again?\n\nYes,\n\nHe was having a conscience,\n\nBecause Zhou Ze couldn't bear to completely extinguish the last hope for everyone in this village. Eighty years ago, they were already tragic, like the 300,000 souls lost in Nanjing.\n\nSo, as long as there was a sliver of possibility, Zhou Ze still hoped they could have a chance to re-enter reincarnation.\n\nIt was precisely for this reason that Zhou Ze held onto a sliver of hope, attempting to find another conscious person in this village to gain some clues.\n\nNow, he was surrounded by the entire village, losing the flexibility he had previously held.\n\nHe could charge out, but he would probably have to enter that state again amidst the tearing of vengeful spirits,\n\nAnd then be paralyzed and severely injured for a long time again.\n\nThis was very costly,\n\nAnd very foolish,\n\nIt was a stupid act and choice,\n\nSo his conscience ached again.\n\n\"Roar!\"\n\n\"Hungry!\"\n\n\"Eat him!\"\n\n\"Eat!\"\n\nNo one seriously responded to Zhou Ze's words,\n\nThey swarmed forward, rushing over.\n\nZhou Ze's fingernails flew incessantly, and one vengeful spirit after another was flung away by him. But they seemed endless; even when dispersed, they would quickly reappear in some corner of the village and continue to join the fray.\n\nZhou Ze was essentially facing an army of undead that could continuously revive!\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nThe ancestral hall continuously endured blows,\n\nThe floor tiles also began to crack,\n\nFinally, after Zhou Ze heavily slammed a vengeful spirit onto the ground,\n\nA string of floor tiles beneath his feet completely shattered,\n\nBut beneath the tiles,\n\nA large expanse of glistening white rice appeared.\n\nZhou Ze was stunned,\n\nAll the vengeful spirits present were also stunned,\n\nThe rice was definitely fake,\n\nThe village had long been flattened, even a school built on top of it,\n\nBut the scene here was real.\n\nThis meant that,\n\nWhen everyone in the village was starving,\n\nBeneath the ancestral hall of this village,\n\nThere truly was so much grain hidden!\n\nZhou Ze squatted down, scooped up a handful of rice, and held it up to the vengeful spirits in front of him,\n\nSaying:\n\n\"Eat, you won't be hungry after eating, and then... you can depart in peace.\"\n\nHowever,\n\nThe vengeful spirits of the entire village in the ancestral hall didn't move. They seemed to feel nothing for the rice.\n\nTheir gaze lingered on the rice for only a moment,\n\nThen, in unison, their eyes fell back on Zhou Ze.\n\nThey didn't eat rice,\n\nBut they were still hungry,\n\nSo,\n\nThey could only eat Zhou Ze!\n\nZhou Ze truly had the feeling of laughing out of extreme anger,\n\nWhat the hell,\n\nAm I really that delicious?",

    "content": "It was a chaotic scene that left Zhou Ze somewhat helpless. The villagers completely ignored the food, instead swarming towards Zhou Ze once more.\n\nZhou Ze's fingernails tore through the villagers in front of him again and again, but they would quickly reassemble. It was an endless slaughter, a typical case of ants biting an elephant to death.\n\nSomething must be supporting this place, making it like a looped barrier that continuously repeats. These vengeful spirits didn't seem as strong as true vengeful spirits, but their most abnormal trait was their ability to reform after being destroyed.\n\nThe little monkey grabbed Zhou Ze's shoulder, watching him fight his way out. It wanted to help but couldn't. If it were its old self, working with Zhou Ze—one demon, one ghost-catcher—they could have easily charged out. But now, all it could do was tremble, praying that Zhou Ze wouldn't run out of strength too quickly.\n\nIt knew that if Zhou Ze was finished, it would surely be finished too.\n\nLast life, it was eaten by humans. This life, was it going to be eaten by ghosts again?\n\nIt definitely didn't want that kind of grand slam.\n\nThese villagers seemed intent on blocking Zhou Ze's path out of the ancestral hall, rushing forward fearlessly, one after another, just to delay Zhou Ze for a few seconds. And they succeeded. Zhou Ze wasn't far from the ancestral hall's entrance; if he could just get out, finding a way to escape would be much simpler. But now, he was trapped in this narrow space, which was very uncomfortable.\n\n\"Squeak! Squeak! Squeak!!!!\"\n\nThe little monkey's tail was grabbed by a villager, and it let out a cry of agony. It felt like it was about to be eaten.\n\nZhou Ze directly turned around, his fingernails bringing a black mist that instantly tore apart the villager and pulled the little monkey back. However, this action made Zhou Ze's distance from the door even greater.\n\nThe villagers pressed on, their momentum building, making Zhou Ze's repeated attempts to break through futile. Now, Zhou Ze was pinned against the offering table at the deepest part of the ancestral hall, where the ancestral tablets were placed.\n\n\"Huff... huff... huff...\"\n\nGasping repeatedly, Zhou Ze was indeed a bit tired, but these villagers gave him no chance to relax.\n\n\"Clatter!\"\n\nWith a crisp sound,\n\nZhou Ze directly swept all the ancestral tablets off the offering table. He hoped the villagers would go protect their ancestral tablets, giving him an opening.\n\nBut unfortunately, the villagers felt nothing for the ancestral tablets. They remained indifferent as the tablets fell to the ground, continuing to charge at Zhou Ze.\n\nFor the first time, Zhou Ze felt a bit wronged.\n\nFirst, he genuinely wanted to help people; his conscience was aching!\n\nYou say you're very hungry, I can see that, but rice and grain are right in front of you, and you won't eat them. You still want to eat me?\n\nThat's unreasonable!\n\nIf you're going to be unreasonable, don't blame me for being unreasonable too!\n\nZhou Ze's anger was ignited. Human kindness and compassion have limits. Zhou Ze charged forward. This time, he didn't actively try to run away; instead, he targeted the spirits and killed them. At the same time, as the irritation and anger piled up in his heart, Zhou Ze's skin slowly began to take on a bronze color.\n\nClearly, the invasion of fatigue and anger was slowly awakening Zhou Ze's other side.\n\n\"Boom!\"\n\nTwo spirits were grabbed by Zhou Ze's hands and slammed violently onto the ground.\n\n\"Boom!\"\n\nThe spirits exploded, scattering to reform elsewhere before rushing back. At the same time, another pit was smashed into the ground, and white rice grains splattered everywhere.\n\nSuddenly, Zhou Ze stood up, somewhat bewildered, because all the villagers who had been screaming in hunger and frantically charging at him had suddenly crouched down again, beginning to pick up the rice grains from the ground, not even missing those in the crevices.\n\nThen,\n\nThe darling of the stage, the one with the spotlight, Zhou Ze,\n\nwas suddenly ignored by everyone.\n\nThis was a huge drop-off.\n\nIt left Zhou Ze feeling at a loss. He could only say that these villagers seemed to have some kind of illness, starving like this yet not touching the abundant grain in the ancestral hall.\n\nWere they all misers?\n\nFortunately, Zhou Ze knew this wasn't the time to quibble. He immediately took the little monkey and rushed out of the ancestral hall. This time, no one blocked him. After running back to the field path, the bronze glow that had just appeared on Zhou Ze's body began to slowly fade.\n\nZhou Ze also let out a long sigh of relief. It was better not to enter that state if possible. The main reason was that afterwards, not only did his soul suffer greatly, but the resulting paralysis and long-term inconvenience in life made Zhou Ze very resistant.\n\nHe grabbed the monkey, still clutching his shoulder and looking somewhat shaken, and directly dropped it to the ground.\n\n\"Find the way out.\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't want to linger here until the villagers finished picking up the rice and came back to attack him again.\n\nThe little monkey didn't disappoint Zhou Ze. After running a short distance and circling a few times, it plunged directly into a pile of thatch and disappeared.\n\nThis made Zhou Ze wonder if he had adopted a monkey or a dog,\n\nbecause when the monkey was circling on the ground, its nose was constantly sniffing the ground.\n\nZhou Ze also circled a few times, but he didn't imitate it by putting his nose to the ground, and then plunged into the pile of thatch.\n\nHe felt his whole body lighten,\n\nand Zhou Ze found himself on the street. At this time, the shops on this street were mostly closed; it was clearly very late.\n\nThe old Taoist priest was squatting on the side, petting the monkey that had come out earlier. Seeing Zhou Ze emerge, he immediately stood up and asked,\n\n\"Boss, are you alright?\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head.\n\nA Nissan was parked across the street, and Xu Qinglang was sitting inside. When Zhou Ze came out, he also got out of the car and asked,\n\n\"Is the matter resolved?\"\n\n\"Where were you before? I couldn't reach you when I called.\"\n\n\"The basement of the library probably has bad signal. Get in the car first, I've found some other clues here.\"\n\nOnce in the car, Zhou Ze briefly recounted what had happened inside.\n\nXu Qinglang nodded and said, \"I went to the Municipal Library first and looked up some information. I found a local diary from the Republican era. Actually, it wasn't really the Republican era; this area was under Japanese occupation at the time.\n\nIt was a record book, kept by the local puppet government, and it was preserved. It documented the massacre of Sanxiang Village. According to the book, it was because the villagers had hidden wounded anti-Japanese resistance fighters, which led to retaliatory mopping-up operations by the devils.\"\n\n\"Get to the point,\" Zhou Ze reminded him.\n\n\"Then, I checked the borrowing record for this book. It's a very obscure book that ordinary people wouldn't even notice. But in 2009, someone borrowed it, named Li Shi. I suspect this person and the one who posted are the same.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\nDuring that period, not many people would have paid attention to the events of Sanxiang Village.\n\n\"I also investigated Li Shi and found that he died of a sudden heart attack at the end of 2009. However, his trail didn't go cold because he was driving when he had the heart attack, and his car hit a tree.\n\nThe death location was on a road in the suburban woods.\n\nIt was very desolate there in 2009, and it still is now. But there's a sanatorium there, similar to a nursing home, but more upscale, a public-private partnership.\"\n\n\"So, you think Li Shi was driving there, going to the sanatorium before he died?\"\n\n\"That's right, so I think there should be a clue hidden at the sanatorium, and he found it. In fact, I think he might have entered Sanxiang Village a second time back then. According to what you said, the villagers inside were all starving and trying to eat people, but in 2009, the problem shouldn't have been that serious.\n\nThen, he got some information in the village. But, anyone who can enter Sanxiang Village, apart from you as a special case, are people who are about to die.\"\n\nAt this point, Xu Qinglang subconsciously looked at the old Taoist priest sitting in the back seat.\n\nThe old Taoist priest had initially felt very dejected,\n\nthe monkey went in,\n\nthe boss went in,\n\nbut he himself couldn't get in no matter what, making him feel like a failure.\n\nThen, when Xu Qinglang arrived and told him that only those close to death could enter, the old Taoist priest laughed joyfully, with two snot bubbles appearing at his nose.\n\n\"Li Shi didn't have time to solve that problem; he died halfway.\"\n\nZhou Ze watched Xu Qinglang driving and chatting, then asked, \"So, we're going to the sanatorium now?\"\n\nXu Qinglang nodded.\n\nHalf an hour later,\n\nthe car drove into the sanatorium. Because it was late at night, the sanatorium was already closed, but Zhou Ze and Xu Qinglang still climbed over the wall and entered the office to access the sanatorium's client data.\n\nExtraordinary times naturally call for extraordinary measures. If the problem in Sanxiang Village wasn't resolved soon, the issues caused if vengeful spirits truly broke loose would be terrifying.\n\nZhou Ze, the old Taoist, and Xu Qinglang searched together, but this kind of search was like looking for a needle in a haystack.\n\nBecause no one knew,\n\nif the person the楼主 (original poster) was looking for nine years ago,\n\nwas still alive?\n\nAfter all, many people who enter sanatoriums are elderly or in very poor health. Nine years might genuinely be too long for them to survive.\n\nMoreover, there was no specific search information; they could only rely on intuition.\n\nThis was no longer looking for a needle in a haystack, but fishing for a needle in the ocean.\n\nHowever, a patient's record made Zhou Ze's gaze slightly condense. He gestured to Xu Qinglang and the old Taoist beside him to come over, then pointed to the person in the photo and said,\n\n\"Chen Guangnong, born in 1919.\"\n\n\"Holy cow, Boss, this guy must be 99 already?\" the old Taoist exclaimed, then puzzled, \"This... surely the person we're looking for isn't necessarily the oldest one? I have a few centenarians here too.\"\n\nTongcheng was a longevity village, with the number of centenarians ranking among the top cities nationwide.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head and said, \"This one's different. I think I've heard of this person. He served as an official in Tongcheng for a period in earlier years.\"\n\nZhou Ze opened a webpage and started searching. Baidu Baike directly brought up Chen Guangnong's detailed biography.\n\n\"He revolted?\" Xu Qinglang noticed something.\n\nThe record states that this person was a battalion commander in the Huaihai Campaign during the Liberation War. He led his troops in an uprising and also participated in the Korean War. Later, he returned to his hometown, Tongcheng, and served as a local official for a period before retiring.\n\n\"I think it should be this person. Li Shi was likely looking for him,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nA legendary person must have a legendary life to match. This person's life story was already exciting enough.\n\nZhou Ze first found his hospital room, but to the dumbfoundment of Zhou Ze, Xu Qinglang, and the old Taoist, Chen Guangnong had already fallen into a long-term coma several years ago, similar to a vegetative state. Now, he was merely still physically alive.\n\n\"Damn, how do we handle this?\" The old Taoist looked bewildered.\n\nZhou Ze opened the ward door and walked in. Xu Qinglang signaled the old Taoist and the monkey to keep watch outside, then followed him in.\n\nThe ward felt somewhat oppressive. This elder, just one year shy of achieving the centenarian milestone, his life truly had reached the stage of a dying lamp.\n\nHe lay there now, unconscious.\n\nYou could say he was alive, but it was indistinguishable from death.\n\nZhou Ze sat down on the chair beside the bed and glanced at the data from the various instruments beside the elder. The elder's condition was not optimistic.\n\n\"Is there any way to wake him up?\" Xu Qinglang asked.\n\nHe knew that Zhou Ze used to be a doctor.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. If the one from Rongcheng hadn't been taken away by Tang Shi, inviting him might have been easier. That guy was said to be a psychologist, and his hypnotism was terrifying; he could even hypnotize and control ghost-catchers.\n\n\"Now, it seems there's only one way left,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"What way?\"\n\n\"Kill him now, then grab his spirit and question it.\"\n\n\"...\" Xu Qinglang.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head, indicating he was just joking. It was not easy for someone to live to be ninety-nine. He couldn't just kill someone for an uncertain reason, just to ask a few questions.\n\nMoreover, looking at his state, his life had been full of ups and downs, rich and colorful, and he had been lying here for so many years. He might have already come to terms with everything. If he killed him, his soul might go directly to hell, and he wouldn't even be able to ask.\n\n\"There's a book in the drawer.\"\n\nXu Qinglang opened the drawer and said.\n\n\"What book?\"\n\n\"An autobiography. It must have been self-published by later generations or others.\"\n\nXu Qinglang took out the book and flipped through it.\n\n\"Look at his early life,\" Zhou Ze reminded him.\n\n\"I know.\"\n\nSoon, Xu Qinglang found an entry and said, \"Before the War of Resistance, he served as a company commander in the Tongcheng Security Regiment.\"\n\nThe Security Regiment, which was a local armed force, was pretty much as depicted in anti-Japanese war dramas, essentially having little fighting capability.\n\n\"When the Japanese invaded Tongcheng, was there any resistance?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"I checked. The Japanese Iizuka Unit, I think it was the 101st Division, I'm not entirely sure of the specifics. But it's said that Japanese divisions numbered 100 and above generally weren't very strong in combat. This division was apparently badly beaten in Jiangxi.\n\nHowever, at that time, Tongcheng had no regular Chinese army. It was entirely local armed organizations in Tongcheng that organized the resistance and fought against the Japanese. But no matter how greenhorn a greenhorn division was, it was still far stronger than local armed security regiments and the like, so Tongcheng fell quite quickly at the time.\"\n\n\"So, he participated in Tongcheng's resistance against the Japanese army then?\"\n\n\"He should have. He probably didn't betray and surrender, otherwise he wouldn't have become a battalion commander in the National Revolutionary Army.\"\n\nZhou Ze frowned,\n\nThe sleeping old man, covered in age spots, and all the villagers of Sanxiang Village, gave him a sense of powerlessness. He had all the strength in the world, but it was like punching cotton.\n\nHe and Xu Qinglang had been standing there talking for so long, and the old man just kept his eyes closed without any reaction. Clearly, he had truly lost his perception of the outside world.\n\nBut Zhou Ze was a bit unwilling to just leave like that. So, Zhou Ze bent down, leaned close to the old man's ear, and slowly asked,\n\n\"Old sir, do you still remember... Sanxiang Village?\"\n\nSuddenly,\n\na miracle happened,\n\nThe old man's fingers suddenly trembled,\n\nfollowed by his eyelids twitching incessantly.\n\nIt was as if he had heard, or been stimulated. His lips parted slightly, and he seemed to utter a very faint sound:\n\n\"Villagers...\"\n\n\"What did he say?\" Xu Qinglang asked.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head; the voice was too faint.\n\nXu Qinglang pushed Zhou Ze aside, put his ear next to the old man's mouth, and listened carefully.\n\nAfter a moment, Xu Qinglang straightened up, his expression solemn.\n\n\"What did he say?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"He said... he wants to kiss you?\"",

    "content": "“Boss, is everything alright?”\n\nThe old Taoist sat in the back, trembling slightly as he pointed to the old man lying on his lap.\n\nThe old man was still semi-conscious, but he could open his eyes, though only for a moment before closing them again. His speech was intermittent.\n\nHe was awake.\n\nHe was indeed awake.\n\nBut this awakening,\n\nStrictly speaking, should be considered a final burst of energy before death.\n\nHe was awake,\n\nWhich meant he was nearing his end.\n\nHe had held on, sustained by a single breath. Previously, Zhou Ze thought it might be his strong life force, or good medical conditions coupled with some heavenly favor, but now he realized it was likely that there was something he couldn't let go of, something that prevented him from closing his eyes in peace.\n\nXu Qinglang was driving, fast yet steady. He had to be steady, because a sudden brake or sharp turn could make the old man simply pass away.\n\nTaking a patient, a dying, long-comatose one, out of a sanatorium was a crazy thing to do, but Zhou Ze didn't regret it and felt no burden of conscience.\n\nAlthough the old man hadn’t spoken clearly, his attitude had made it evident:\n\nSanxiang Village,\n\nIt had always been in his heart, never erased.\n\nIn truth, humans are forgetful creatures. People always subconsciously blur out what they don’t want to see, erasing painful memories.\n\nMany people remain undisturbed and indifferent as the elderly women who were comfort women pass away one by one, unaware that their departures slowly seal off that part of history from us.\n\nSome things, in fact, must not be forgotten.\n\nUpon reaching the streets of Xingren Town, Xu Qinglang got out of the car, then, with the old Taoist, helped the old man out.\n\n“Old brother, hold on a little longer, we’re almost there, almost there,” the old Taoist encouraged the 99-year-old elder.\n\nXu Qinglang felt the old man’s hand press lightly on his shoulder.\n\nThe old man’s half-open eyes turned to Zhou Ze. His eyes were very cloudy, as if veiled. His body was long exhausted; he needed to rest, he needed to go.\n\n“The villagers are all there,” Zhou Ze said earnestly. “I don’t know what they’re waiting for, but since you woke up when I spoke the words ‘Sanxiang Village,’ it means I found the right person, and you too care for them.”\n\nSaying this,\n\nZhou Ze reached out and smoothed the old man’s sparse hair, then fastened a button on his patient gown.\n\nThe old man was already experiencing a final burst of energy.\n\nRight and wrong, good and bad deeds, would be judged by future generations.\n\nIt was hard for modern people to empathize with or judge the disputes of that era.\n\nAt least, one thing could be proven: when the old man served in the Tongcheng Security Regiment back then, he didn’t desert or become a collaborator. When a Japanese division landed in a harbor near Tongcheng, there were no regular Chinese forces in Tongcheng.\n\nHowever, relying solely on the local armed Security Regiment and spontaneous resistance from residents, they inflicted significant losses on the Japanese. In fact, the local armed forces had planned counterattacks on the Tongcheng city gates more than once. While the main forces and their focus shifted southwest,\n\nIn this isolated Japanese-occupied zone, resistance continued, and gunshots still echoed.\n\nThe old man was still looking at Zhou Ze. As he watched, he began to cough. Most of his teeth were gone, and his cough was weak, but he was smiling.\n\nThen,\n\nHe painstakingly reached out, as if trying to grasp Zhou Ze.\n\nThe old Taoist watched beside him, his heart aching, thinking, *Old brother, just rest easy, don’t wear yourself out before you even get in.*\n\nZhou Ze stood still,\n\nAllowing the old man’s emaciated hand to gently grasp the fabric over his chest.\n\nThe old man’s grip was faint.\n\nThen, Zhou Ze felt two light presses on his chest,\n\nRight where,\n\nHis heart was.\n\nAfter performing this action, the old man slumped, as if all his strength had been drained, and his breathing became erratic.\n\n“Go in, quickly.”\n\nWith that, Zhou Ze began circling at that spot, then rushed onto the road, and then his entire being vanished.\n\nXu Qinglang took out a talisman and placed it on his forehead. Instantly, his glabella darkened, and then, following suit, he also circled a few times at that spot and rushed forward.\n\nThe old Taoist also circled a few times at the end, then rushed forward,\n\nHey,\n\nHe didn’t get in.\n\nHehehe.\n\nThe old Taoist laughed, his entire face wrinkled like a chrysanthemum, truly overjoyed.\n\nThe little monkey beside him watched the old Taoist’s foolishness, tilting its head slightly to indicate it didn’t know this old salted pervert.\n\nEntering Sanxiang Village again, Zhou Ze looked up and saw that the moon in the sky had almost turned blood-red. It hadn’t been like this when he came in half a day ago.\n\nIt seemed that his massacre in the ancestral hall had intensified something, invisibly making the situation here more urgent.\n\nTherefore, if the old man on Xu Qinglang’s back couldn’t resolve the situation here and break the deadlock, then Zhou Ze, as a ghost messenger, would probably have to call the little loli to guard the exit.\n\nWhether they would succeed in guarding the passage and preventing these fierce ghosts from wandering into the human world,\n\nIt was hard to say.\n\nXu Qinglang also entered, carrying the old man. As soon as he entered, Xu Qinglang felt the person on his back grow heavier. Xu Qinglang immediately widened his eyes, somewhat disbelieving:\n\nNo way,\n\nDead?\n\nGrandpa, don't scare me, you haven't lived to be a hundred yet!\n\nXu Qinglang anxiously tried to turn his head to check on the old man on his back, but he suddenly saw Zhou Ze looking calmly behind him.\n\n“Put him down,” Zhou Ze said.\n\nXu Qinglang slowly lowered the old man's remains from his back. Turning around, he saw a young man standing behind him.\n\nThe young man wore a black military uniform, with a rifle slung over his back and a cap on his head.\n\nIt was a typical Security Regiment uniform, with some patches showing signs of wear. This attire was common in popular anti-Japanese war films.\n\nHe was dead.\n\nWas this his soul?\n\nThe old man,\n\nOh no,\n\nThe young man looked at Zhou Ze and Xu Qinglang, nodded slightly, closed his eyes, and took a deep breath, as if in remembrance, or perhaps in mourning.\n\nTwo lines of tears trickled down from the corners of his eyes.\n\nHe was dead,\n\nBut the tears were not because he had died.\n\nIn fact, death was more of a release for him. He had been bedridden for too long, and before he fell into a coma and lost consciousness, he had actually endured for far too long.\n\nHe didn't know what he was holding on for. His comrades, who had walked out of the flames of war with him, had left one by one, until he was left all alone.\n\nHe was almost a hundred years old, but he didn't live for the sake of living to a hundred. He had people he cared for, promises he cherished, and...\n\nA debt of gratitude.\n\nWhat the old man didn't know was that nine years ago, when he wasn't yet comatose, a man named Li Shi had planned to drive to the sanatorium to find him. He could have arrived here nine years earlier.\n\nBut the original poster of that thread, after all, couldn't defy his fate. The fact that he could enter Sanxiang Village meant that his life was already nearing its end.\n\nLi Shi, in the end, couldn't outrun his destiny.\n\nPerhaps, nine years ago, the villagers of this village weren't as insane as they were now. There were still people... who could talk, who could communicate.\n\nThey told Li Shi some things, and Li Shi intended to go out and help them find the person they had been waiting for.\n\nAt this moment, Zhou Ze saw the old man and the little girl walking from the village entrance again.\n\nBoth the old man and the little girl walked with stiff postures. The little girl clutched her sugar figurine, tugging at it repeatedly, while the old man carried a hoe, his face pale.\n\nIn the corners of their eyes, a red glow flickered, and drool continuously dripped from their mouths.\n\nIt's getting worse,\n\nHere.\n\nThe young man walked forward, along the paddy field ridge, onto the road.\n\nHe showed no fear, for there was no need for him to be afraid.\n\nThe debt of gratitude that had remained deep in his heart for nearly eighty years,\n\nToday,\n\nWould finally be released.\n\nThe young man was a centenarian, but at this moment, he took off his hat, waved it vigorously, and shouted:\n\n“Grandpa Xu, Ah Hua!”\n\nJust like eighty years ago!\n\nThe old man heard the voice and froze.\n\nThe little girl also suddenly paused.\n\nThe old and the young,\n\nSuddenly stood still.\n\nXu Qinglang stood beside Zhou Ze, hands on hips, a little worried, “Nothing bad will happen, right?”\n\n“We can only try,” Zhou Ze said.\n\nA moment later,\n\nThe crimson in the old man’s eyes began to recede, and he shouted, “Xiao Chenzi (little boy), hey, you’re back!”\n\nThe little girl’s expression also changed from sinister to innocent and joyful. She happily ran towards the young man: “Uncle Chen, you’re back!”\n\nThe old and the young both ran to the young man’s side, overjoyed.\n\nThe young man turned his head, glanced at Zhou Ze and Xu Qinglang who were standing in the distance, then nodded heavily at the old man and the little girl in front of him, saying:\n\n“Yes, I’m back, I’m back!”\n\n“What about the troops? Have the troops returned? I heard yesterday that the Japanese devils were still killing people in the city, and bodies were hung on the city walls.”\n\n“The troops, the troops are back too,” the young man shouted forcefully. “We’re preparing to fight the devils!”\n\n“Good!” The old man waved a fist, then said, “Come on, before you left, you told us to help collect grain for the troops when the main force fought back. All the grain in our village is collected and hidden underground in the ancestral hall. The devils came a while ago, but they couldn’t find it.”\n\n“Does everyone still have food at home?” the young man asked worriedly.\n\n“Heh, it was all voluntary. Everyone just ate some wild vegetables to fill their stomachs. We won’t die from being hungry for a while. Of course we’re hungry, but it’s nothing.”\n\nThe old man pulled the young man’s hand and walked towards the village, while the young man happily held the little girl.\n\nZhou Ze, hearing this conversation from a distance,\n\nWas deeply moved,\n\nThe old man said it was okay to be hungry for a few days,\n\nBut they had been hungry for eighty years.\n\nBeing hungry for a while is indeed fine for a human;\n\nBut eighty years of continuous hunger is enough to break even a ghost. It is an unimaginable torture!\n\n“Xiao Chenzi is back, the main force is coming back!”\n\nAs soon as they entered the village, the old man shouted.\n\nThe entire Sanxiang Village instantly erupted.\n\nThe old woman sitting at the doorway, who had been drooling while sewing shoe soles, jolted, stood up, and shouted:\n\n“Xiao Chenzi is back!”\n\nThe widow who was drawing water from the well and chewing on her own hair immediately spat out the hair from her mouth.\n\nHer face flushed with spring,\n\nRevealing a touch of her charm, she swayed her waist and shouted:\n\n“Xiao Chenzi, if you don’t come back soon, my breasts will shrink from hunger, and then if this granny can’t find a man, you’ll have to take me in!”\n\nInside the tiled house, the man who was boiling water immediately dropped the firewood in his hand, grabbed his wife’s hand, and rushed out of the house.\n\nVillagers gathered,\n\nCrowding around the young man and walking towards the ancestral hall.\n\nThe blind old man sitting at the entrance of the ancestral hall shakily stood up. He had heard the voices and the commotion. Xiao Chenzi, who had recuperated in the village before, was back.\n\nHe had said that the main forces would soon fight their way back.\n\nHe had said that the little devils wouldn't jump around for long.\n\nHe had asked everyone to help prepare food for when the main forces fought back.\n\nThe blind old man dropped his cane and knelt on the ground of the ancestral hall, his hands fumbling along the floor tiles. Then, he lifted a few bricks.\n\nHe reached his hand under the bricks. As the crowd surged to the ancestral hall entrance,\n\nThe blind old man held up a handful of gleaming white rice,\n\nAnd shouted:\n\n“Xiao Chenzi, the grain!\n\nThe grain the folks prepared for the main forces,\n\nWe’ve kept it hidden all this time,\n\nThe devils didn’t find it.\n\nIt’s been kept for the main forces!\n\nYou eat your fill, so you can fight the devils well!”\n\nThe young man stood at the entrance of the ancestral hall, watching the grains of rice continuously fall from between the blind old man’s fingers.\n\nSlowly, he raised his head.\n\nHe cried.\n\nBack then, he was full of confidence, telling the villagers while recovering from his injuries that the main forces would soon fight their way back.\n\nThe villagers believed him.\n\nBut in reality,\n\nThe main forces didn’t return until nearly seven years later. The villagers didn’t live to see those seven years. In fact, less than a week after he recovered and went out to find the main forces, the news of this village sheltering wounded soldiers leaked out.\n\nThe Japanese army and puppet forces rushed here and slaughtered everyone in the village, young and old, as a warning.\n\nThis was also why he didn’t want to fight in the civil war and eventually defected:\n\nSome people,\n\nWere still waiting for him,\n\nWaiting for him to return.\n\nThe Japanese had been driven away, and he should return too.\n\n“Can there really be such deep obsession?” Xu Qinglang was shocked.\n\n“There must be external factors influencing it,”\n\nZhou Ze looked up and saw the blood moon in the sky slowly becoming clearer, and the malevolent aura in the village was also gradually dissipating;\n\nAt the same time, a crystalline object fell from the sky, landing in the hay pile ahead.\n\nZhou Ze walked over, searched, and found a bronze ring in the hay pile. Its patterns were bizarre, and it felt heavy in his hand.\n\nHe hadn’t finished his sentence just now.\n\nPicking up the ring, Zhou Ze continued:\n\n“But external things are external things. Some obsessions are bone-deep, and external factors cannot stop them.\n\nOtherwise,\n\nEighty years ago, we would have been annihilated.”",

    "content": "If you look closely at the ring, there are some cracks, a feeling of imperfection, which makes one feel a strong sense of pity.\n\nZhou Ze didn't hastily put the ring on his finger, but placed it in his pocket.\n\nThis ring was unusual; Three Villages' ability to maintain itself in this way for eighty years must be inextricably linked to it. Zhou Ze was afraid of an accident if he rashly put it on his finger.\n\nMoreover, now was not the time to study the ring. There was still one thing left undone, one that was the most essential and most important.\n\nZhou Ze walked purposefully towards the ancestral hall. Looking at the boisterous crowd there, his gaze met that of the young man for a few seconds. The young man nodded slightly.\n\nA tacit understanding had formed between them.\n\nThe young man had lived to be ninety-nine, experiencing wars and various turbulent times. Such a life was one in ten thousand, and the wisdom his life experiences brought him was difficult to imitate or surpass.\n\nMany things didn't need to be said, but they both understood.\n\nZhou Ze crossed his hands, slowly spreading them apart.\n\nThe Gates of Hell slowly opened.\n\nThis was the end.\n\nThis was the final resting place for the dead.\n\nIt was the inevitable path for all beings!\n\n\"Villagers, let's go!\"\n\nThe young man led the villagers towards Zhou Ze.\n\nEighty years of trials and tribulations,\n\nThey had suffered hardships,\n\nThey had endured difficulties.\n\nAt this moment, the young man felt it was time to close his eyes, and with his fellow villagers, close their eyes together.\n\nThe young man was very satisfied with this ending. It was the ending he had been waiting for, and the ending he had yearned for.\n\nIn the past, the villagers had died because of his involvement. When he heard the news, he knelt for an entire night in front of the old locust tree at the army's entrance.\n\nThen, over seven years, he fought in bloody battles again and again, wanting to sacrifice his life on the battlefield against the devils, in exchange for having no regrets towards the villagers!\n\nBut on the battlefield, the less afraid of death one was, the more one couldn't die. He survived battle after battle and even got promoted.\n\nWhen the devils surrendered, he also grew weary, feeling that his mission was complete and it was time to end. Therefore, he hated civil war, which he saw as a complete desecration of the Three Villages' people and the heroes who died on the anti-Japanese battlefield!\n\nThe devils had been driven out, World War II had ended, but at that time, on the land of eastern China, a million-person-scale great melee was still happening.\n\nSo he revolted.\n\nHe hoped this chaotic situation could end soon.\n\nFrom his youth to his twilight years, his life had passed through many turning points, but only today, at this moment, did the young man feel that his life was complete.\n\nThe half-missing full stop was finally rounded out.\n\nThe young man was the first to walk into the Gates of Hell.\n\nThe villagers followed, one after another, entering.\n\nNo one resisted.\n\nNo one cried or fussed.\n\nEveryone had a smile on their faces.\n\nDeep within the smile, there was a sense of release.\n\nThey were tired, everyone was tired.\n\nSome things were fake, but how could people living in a fake world not discover anything at all?\n\nThis was a dream, a dream everyone was holding onto.\n\nAnd now, the dream had ended, but the outcome was beautiful.\n\nTherefore, there was naturally no unwillingness, no complaints.\n\nOnly freedom and straightforwardness.\n\nXu Qinglang stood by, silently counting the heads.\n\nThe last one was the little girl with the sugar figurine. The little girl looked at Zhou Ze, smiled, her eyes narrowed into cute crescents, and then she skipped into the Gates of Hell.\n\nZhou Ze released his hands.\n\nThe Gates of Hell dissipated.\n\n\"Rest in peace.\"\n\nZhou Ze said slowly.\n\nXu Qinglang bowed his head slightly, respectfully:\n\n\"Rest in peace.\"\n\nTo be honest, maintaining the Gates of Hell was also a very tiring task, and it had been maintained for so long.\n\nBut Boss Zhou had never felt this good.\n\nAlright,\n\nTalking about performance in front of the villagers was indeed inappropriate,\n\nEspecially in this atmosphere,\n\nOne should cry,\n\nEveryone, cry your hearts out!\n\nBut the satisfaction of continuously accumulating performance points kept stimulating Boss Zhou's nerves.\n\nHe tried,\n\nHe tried very hard,\n\nBut he couldn't cry.\n\nHe really couldn't cry.\n\nNot laughing was already a great struggle.\n\nXu Qinglang watched from the side, a little speechless. \"If you want to laugh, just laugh. You already have issues; suppressing it will only make it worse.\"\n\nZhou Ze turned his head, looked at Xu Qinglang, and said, \"Let's build a monument for them, a memorial stone or something.\"\n\n\"I have no problem, you decide.\"\n\n\"But I have no money. I still owe you money and money to my Yingying.\"\n\n\"............\" Xu Qinglang.\n\nXu Qinglang suddenly had a bad premonition.\n\nNo,\n\nCannot,\n\nRefuse!\n\n\"As someone with over twenty properties, selling one to build a memorial should be acceptable, right?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"............\" Xu Qinglang.\n\n\"You have to consider, without their dedication and sacrifice eighty years ago, you wouldn't be living in an era of peace and prosperity, and property prices wouldn't be this high.\n\nRight?\"\n\n\"............\" Xu Qinglang.\n\n\"So, you're willing, right?\"\n\n\"How do I feel like you're trying to morally blackmail me?\" Xu Qinglang said, displeased.\n\n\"It depends on your mood. Actually,冥钞 (hell money) is something visible, but some things are invisible.\" Zhou Ze patted Xu Qinglang on the shoulder.\n\n\"We'll talk about this when we get back.\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't continue the topic, but instinctively took out his ID book.\n\nSo many villagers,\n\nThe performance should be enough, right?\n\nHis \"temporary\" badge should also be removable; he should be able to become a permanent employee, right?\n\nHowever,\n\nWhen he opened the ID book,\n\nZhou Ze was stunned.\n\nPerformance: ninety-nine percent.\n\nThis means, I'm just rubbing it on the outside, I'm not going in!\n\nIt kept its promise, it really didn't go in.\n\nGoing in makes you a beast.\n\nBut not going in, makes you worse than a beast!\n\n\"How much is it?\" Xu Qinglang leaned over to also take a look. \"If you become permanent, should we get some hell money as a bonus?\"\n\nWhen Xu Qinglang saw ninety-nine percent, he laughed ungracefully.\n\nHe laughed exaggeratedly,\n\nVery unrestrainedly.\n\nZhou Ze sighed, looking at the charmingly laughing Miss Xu, and said:\n\n\"Old Xu, I want to discuss something with you.\"\n\n\"Speak.\"\n\n\"Will you help if you can?\"\n\n\"Mm, I'll help if I can.\"\n\n\"You're a Xuanxiu, the probability of turning into a ghost after death is much higher for you than for ordinary people, right? How about this, let me kill you, collect your soul, and let me round up my score, okay?\"\n\n\"............\" Xu Qinglang.\n\nShaking his head, Zhou Ze smiled and said, \"Don't be nervous, it's fine. Isn't there still a little girl in the bookstore?\"\n\nSending that girl off would also make it complete, truly complete.\n\nThis time, there was no drilling into haystacks. After the ring fell and was collected by Zhou Ze, and the villagers entered the Gates of Hell one by one, the environment here slowly faded.\n\nEventually,\n\nIt reconnected and overlapped with reality.\n\nXu Qinglang and Zhou Ze stood on the road, while the old Taoist and Monkey were opposite them.\n\nThey got into the car, with Xu Qinglang still driving. Zhou Ze sat in the passenger seat, constantly fiddling with the ID book in his hand.\n\nTo be honest, Zhou Ze felt a bit like when his primary school teacher appointed him as a group leader.\n\nVery childish,\n\nBut also a little excited.\n\n\"Hehe.\" Xu Qinglang chuckled twice. \"You're already so happy. When you get promoted to open an office on Mount Tai, won't you just die of happiness?\"\n\n\"If that day ever comes, after your death, I will help you.\"\n\n\"At least you have some conscience.\" Xu Qinglang said, greatly comforted.\n\n\"I will help you be reborn as a woman in your next life, completely relieving your pain and discomfort.\"\n\n\"Click...\"\n\nSuddenly, an abrupt brake, and everyone in the car jolted.\n\nXu Qinglang took a few deep breaths, suppressing the urge to strangle Zhou Ze.\n\nDamn it,\n\nHe was truly afraid,\n\nBecause theoretically speaking,\n\nZhou Ze had the possibility of making this happen!\n\n\"Is there any benefit to removing the temporary employee badge?\" Xu Qinglang asked.\n\nZhou Ze didn't answer.\n\n\"Is it a great increase in power? An extra magic weapon? Or will it add some special effects for you?\" Xu Qinglang pressed on.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. \"I asked the little loli. She said that after becoming a permanent employee, a judgment poem will automatically appear in the book every time someone is sent to hell.\"\n\n\"Judgment poem?\"\n\n\"Similar to the judgment poems in *Dream of the Red Chamber*.\"\n\n\"What's the use of that?\" Xu Qinglang asked, puzzled.\n\n\"It increases 'B-grid'.\"\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\n\"Meaning, it makes it a bit more prestigious.\"\n\nAfter saying that,\n\nZhou Ze raised his head and looked out the window,\n\nGazing at the sky.\n\n............\n\nWhen the car arrived at the bookstore entrance, Zhou Ze got out first. Ninety-nine was only one short, and that one was inside.\n\nPreviously, for fear of other accidents, Zhou Ze had made a contingency plan: he hadn't sent the little girl to hell yet, but let Bai Yingying watch her.\n\nSo, after pushing open the bookstore door, Zhou Ze called out directly:\n\n\"Yingying?\"\n\n\"Yingyingyingying............\"\n\nA sound came from behind the counter.\n\n\"Hello?\" Zhou Ze called out again.\n\n\"Yingyingyingying............\"\n\n\"What are you doing, don't play tricks. Bring the girl's soul over.\"\n\n\"Yingyingyingying............\"\n\nZhou Ze realized something was wrong, immediately went around the counter, and found Bai Yingying tied hand and foot with a black rope, sitting there. Her mouth was also gagged with a rope.\n\nShe could only make \"Yingyingyingying\" sounds.\n\nZhou Ze immediately went to help Bai Yingying untie the ropes, but his fingers stung when they touched the black rope. Bai Yingying trembled with pain.\n\nTaking a deep breath, Zhou Ze let his fingernails grow out and used them to break the rope. The broken rope immediately turned into ordinary straw rope and scattered.\n\n\"What happened?\"\n\n\"Boss! Yingyingying............\"\n\nBai Yingying lunged into Zhou Ze's arms, hugging his neck and crying bitterly, as if she had suffered a great grievance.\n\n\"What exactly happened?\" Zhou Ze asked again.\n\n\"That little girl... the little girl... I couldn't beat her. Yingying is useless. I've embarrassed you, Boss.\"\n\nZhou Ze patted Bai Yingying on the back, his expression a little grave, and asked again:\n\n\"That little girl?\"\n\n\"Yes, she wanted to leave, and I stopped her. Then she just tied me up.\"\n\n\"Where is she?\"\n\n\"She left.\"\n\n\"Left?\"\n\n\"Oh, she also left a note, it seems to be written on the counter.\"\n\nXu Qinglang walked over at this time and also heard what happened. He immediately searched the counter, found a piece of paper with very firm handwriting, and said directly:\n\n\"When I was little, I was afraid of ghosts, thinking they were hideous and terrifying;\n\nWhen I grew up, I was afraid of people, even if they were well-dressed.\n\nIt's really well-written.\" Xu Qinglang said.\n\n\"I wrote that.\" Zhou Ze said, and as he spoke, Zhou Ze also walked over, pushed aside the papers and books on the counter, and continued searching.\n\n\"You wrote it? Then where's what she wrote? It should be even more profound, right?\" Xu Qinglang asked curiously.\n\nThen,\n\nXu Qinglang was stunned.\n\nAfter Zhou Ze pushed aside the clutter on the counter,\n\nOn the counter table, there was a line of crooked words, like those written by a child:\n\n\"Braised pork, really delicious!\"",

    "content": "Two more days passed. It was strange, these two days; not a single ghost came to the door. Boss Zhou sat in the bookstore every night,\n\nwaiting,\n\nwaiting,\n\nwaiting until his eyes almost popped out, but still nothing.\n\nEven Bai Yingying couldn't stand it. With the boss's lazy nature, it was rare for him to throw himself wholeheartedly into the fervor of work, but there were no customers.\n\nAs for the little girl who tied up Bai Yingying, she hadn't reappeared, and her identity remained a mystery.\n\nShe might be an anomaly in that village,\n\nbut it was also possible she wasn't from the village at all.\n\nHer appearance might have just been to act as a go-between and guide him to pay attention to the matters of Three Villages, using his hand to deal with Three Villages.\n\nZhou Ze had speculated about her identity, even thinking she might be of a higher status than a ghost messenger?\n\nLike a Constable?\n\nOr even... a Judge of the Underworld?\n\nIt was just that Zhong Kui's image was too deeply ingrained in people's minds. If a Judge was that little girl, it made Zhou Ze worried about the aesthetic and atmosphere of Hell.\n\nA loli might be one thing, but if a Judge was also a delicate little girl, would the Ten Kings of Hell all be manly girls with big pectorals?\n\nOf course, this was just a joke; it was probably impossible.\n\nThe loli was still investigating the whereabouts of the priest. She sent a message once saying she was close to finding him, so Zhou Ze didn't ask her to look for that little girl anymore. Someone who could directly overturn Bai Yingying, a 200-year-old female corpse, and play BDSM with her, as long as she had no ill intentions, he didn't need to provoke her.\n\nBesides, the other party hadn't played any bad role in the whole affair.\n\nBut when would he find the next ghost?\n\nJust one more to go.\n\n\"Come back quickly!\n\nI can't wait any longer!\n\nCome back quickly...\"\n\nThe bookstore's speaker started playing this song. Zhou Ze coughed and looked at the monkey beside him. The monkey silently skipped the song.\n\nThe old Daoist sat opposite him. Since there weren't many customers, he sat there cracking melon seeds and watching TV, quite leisurely. Recently, international news had been quite rich, with one after another, making it dazzling.\n\nZhou Ze stood up, poured himself a glass of water. As he passed by the old Daoist, the old Daoist suddenly asked:\n\n\"Boss, does Hell have a TV station?\"\n\n\"What do you think?\"\n\n\"It should, right?\" the old Daoist guessed.\n\n\"Heh.\" Xu Qinglang, who was mixing new cocktails in the distance, chuckled.\n\n\"What's so funny? You've never died, so you have no right to speak,\" the old Daoist retorted.\n\n\"Then tell me, if Hell has TV programs, what do they show?\" Xu Qinglang teased the old Daoist.\n\n\"Hmph hmph.\"\n\nThe old Daoist subconsciously cleared his throat, then said:\n\n\"Now broadcasting the Underworld News Broadcast. Here are the highlights:\n\nThe King of Hell, representative of the Eastern Underworld, met with Hades, Lord of the Western Underworld.\n\nThe two sides held friendly consultations on the issue of ferrying souls of the deceased between East and West;\n\nJudge Zhong Kui of the Underworld inspected the land registration work in the Underworld, resolutely cracking down on the phenomenon of evil spirits occupying land.\"\n\nZhou Ze listened for a while, shook his head, and walked back to his original seat.\n\nXu Qinglang was stunned for a moment. He was impressed by the old Daoist's glibness.\n\nAt this moment, it started raining outside, and the rain became heavier and heavier.\n\nZhou Ze initially didn't think much of it, but gradually his expression became serious. In the depths of the rain curtain, there was a woman in a qipao holding a red paper umbrella, standing there.\n\nHer red umbrella covered her head, but from that angle, she was actually looking at him.\n\nHowever, this time, not only did the old Daoist not notice anything, but even Xu Qinglang didn't feel anything at all.\n\nThe qipao woman's feet didn't move,\n\nbut her whole person was drawing closer to Zhou Ze in segments,\n\nafter a few moments, she stood directly outside the glass window next to Zhou Ze's seat.\n\nA graceful figure, beautiful face, the most exquisite skin in the world, but inside, it was a nest of vipers and maggots.\n\nZhou Ze had seen these qipao women walking with umbrellas and chanting on the Yellow Springs Road more than once, but this time, she appeared in the Human World.\n\nZhou Ze walked out of the bookstore door. The qipao woman turned around and started to distance herself again. In this rain curtain, her figure appeared so hazy.\n\nIf it were an ordinary person, they might develop a fascination and pursuit of affection for this. In the rain, such a woman could often make you ignore fear and strangeness, and instead, completely prostrate yourself at her feet.\n\n\"Hey.\"\n\nZhou Ze called out,\n\nbut the other party kept walking. Her arrival seemed to be only to attract Zhou Ze's attention and then lead him to another place. She should be like a messenger.\n\nTo have a qipao woman who could walk back and forth on the Yellow Springs Road act as a messenger, the person behind her must be extraordinary.\n\nHowever, seeing that the qipao woman had already distanced herself, Zhou Ze directly turned and went back into the bookstore.\n\nWhat a joke,\n\nYou come coolly, without a word,\n\nYou leave coolly, do I have to keep chasing and shouting like the male lead in a melodramatic TV show?\n\nThis isn't Hell, it's the Human World,\n\nThis bad habit,\n\nis really spoiled rotten.\n\nClosing the bookstore door, Zhou Ze stretched lazily, sat back in his seat, and asked Bai Yingying to pour him a cup of coffee.\n\nWhat he didn't know was that the moment he turned and walked into the bookstore,\n\nthe ethereal qipao woman in the distance made a \"creak\" sound, stepping into a puddle.\n\nShe turned her head,\n\nrevealing her face, which was a feast for maggots,\n\nwith a hint of disbelief!\n\nHe,\n\nactually went back just like that?\n\nThen, she seemed to hesitate, wondering if she needed to walk the path again?\n\nWith the same posture, with the same demeanor as before?\n\n\"Splish.\"\n\nA pair of black rain boots stepped into the puddle. A man with completely white hair reached out and flicked the raindrops from his hat brim. His slightly pale hand rested on the qipao woman.\n\nThe qipao woman immediately began to wither, transforming into a paper doll, slowly getting soaked in the rain, and finally, completely disintegrated in the puddle.\n\n\"Forget it, since I can't invite him, I'll visit him myself.\"\n\nThe man wore a coffee-colored coat, distinctly English in style, but his head of white hair made his temperament seem a bit out of place.\n\nAt this age, with that hair,\n\nhe was a walking example of the \"Shamate\" trend popular ten years ago.\n\nBut the man continued to go his own way, walking slowly. Finally, he reached the bookstore door and pushed it open.\n\nWhat greeted his eyes was a woman mixing drinks at the bar,\n\noh no,\n\non closer inspection,\n\nthere was an Adam's apple,\n\nit was a man?\n\nThe white-haired man couldn't help but glance at Xu Qinglang again.\n\nInteresting,\n\na man who looked better than a woman was working as a bartender here.\n\nLooking further, Bai Yingying appeared in the white-haired man's line of sight. She carried coffee over, small and demure.\n\nA zombie?\n\nKept in the shop?\n\nThe man pondered silently. He had arrived, but no one in the shop could see him, including Zhou Ze, who was sitting there, taking the coffee and preparing to read the newspaper.\n\nPeople inherently feared one thing:\n\nwhat they couldn't see.\n\nAnd Zhou Ze could previously see the umbrella-wielding woman, but he couldn't see that a person, whom even he couldn't perceive, was now standing at the entrance of his shop.\n\nA small monkey ran past the white-haired man, carrying its toy hammer. Naturally agile, it didn't notice anything unusual, completely unaware that there was a person beside it, looking down at it.\n\nAnd in the white-haired man's eyes, this monkey exuded a strong malevolent aura.\n\nIt was originally a spiritual monkey, but it had cultivated the feeling of a fierce ghost, only these things were suppressed and not revealed.\n\n\"Achoo!\"\n\nThe old Daoist sneezed loudly.\n\nThe white-haired man looked at the old Daoist,\n\nthen,\n\nhis gaze fell directly on the old Daoist's crotch, where a cluster of bright yellow light talismans covered the old Daoist's two walnuts.\n\nThe white-haired man closed his eyes. He felt it was a bit jarring to the eyes.\n\nThis shop,\n\nis really interesting,\n\na small ghost messenger has arranged his residence so richly, filling it with so many strange people and things.\n\nFinally, the white-haired man looked at Zhou Ze,\n\nand walked to stand in front of Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze frowned slightly, his hand suddenly trembled, and some coffee spilled onto his sleeve.\n\nBai Yingying, quick-witted, immediately came over to help wipe it, and at the same time, took off Zhou Ze's stained jacket to get him a clean one.\n\nWhen the boss cared about cleanliness, he was truly meticulous,\n\nbut fortunately, Comrade Yingying was already used to it.\n\nThe white-haired man sat down in front of Zhou Ze, the two of them essentially sitting face to face.\n\n\"Temporary ghost messenger?\"\n\nThe white-haired man murmured,\n\n\"Tongcheng, this small place, the ghost messengers are being replaced so quickly.\"\n\nZhou Ze looked around in confusion, always feeling something was off. Did that umbrella-wielding, cool-looking qipao woman just leave?\n\nShe left,\n\nand there was nothing else?\n\nWhat Zhou Ze didn't know was that the \"nothing else\" was sitting right in front of him.\n\nA brush appeared in the white-haired man's hand, which he gently rubbed between his fingers.\n\n\"Ninety-nine percent, just a little bit more and he can become a regular.\"\n\nThe white-haired man smiled,\n\n\"Then, I'll do you a favor and help you with that last bit, so you can become a regular.\n\nBut since this is official business,\n\nyou must kneel before me,\n\nand pay your respects to this humble one.\"\n\nZhou Ze suddenly felt a soreness in his knees, and this feeling was intensifying, all coming inexplicably.\n\nThe white-haired man held the brush, sitting calmly. Seeing that Zhou Ze merely stood up and massaged his legs, he was somewhat surprised. Why was Zhou Ze so slow to react?\n\nAn ordinary ghost messenger, after being stimulated by a wisp of his leaked aura, should immediately tremble and kneel down.\n\nAre you,\n\nany different from others?\n\nThe white-haired man frowned slightly, and at the same time, softly said:\n\n\"Kneel.\"\n\nZhou Ze's pupils suddenly contracted,\n\nhis body also stiffened directly, like someone who was lying in a warm bed suddenly being sent naked into the icy cold and snow.\n\n\"Boss, your ID, you forgot to take your ID out of the dirty clothes.\"\n\nBai Yingying came over with Zhou Ze's ID and handed it to him.\n\nThe ID returned to Zhou Ze's hand,\n\nand the previously calm white-haired man suddenly opened his mouth.\n\nBehind Zhou Ze,\n\nhe saw a large mountain, and beneath the mountain, faintly, the figure of a monkey;\n\nA monkey moving mountains, a mountain-moving ape,\n\nits body tens of thousands of feet tall,\n\nbearing only Mount Tai!\n\nWith a crisp \"thump,\"\n\nthe white-haired man instantly fell to his knees, startled,\n\nand asked in disbelief:\n\n\"Lord... of the Manor?\"\n\nAfter saying this, the white-haired man's already imperceptible figure directly disintegrated, dissipating into nothingness.\n\n............\n\nIn a dark place,\n\nthe white-haired boy, who was dozing against the old locust tree, suddenly opened his eyes.\n\nHe looked as if he had a dream, covered in cold sweat. Behind the boy, he carried a huge brush, which seemed somewhat out of place.\n\nThe boy looked disheveled.\n\nSuddenly,\n\nbelow,\n\nunder the old locust tree,\n\na pair of blood-red eyes, as large as two houses, appeared, like two giant lanterns hanging in the sky.\n\nThe old locust tree was growing on its body.\n\nIt had horns like a deer, a head like a camel, a mouth like a donkey, eyes like a turtle, ears like an ox, scales like a fish, whiskers like a shrimp, a belly like a snake, and feet like an eagle, truly a \"nine-unlikes,\" even more exaggerated and bizarre than the so-called \"four-unlikes.\"\n\n\"Didn't I allow you... to wander... for three months... Woke up... a bit early...\"\n\nThe boy pursed his lips, a fawning expression on his face, and said:\n\n\"I thought I'd wake up early to weed and catch lice for you, Old Ancestor.\"\n\nThe boy,\n\ndidn't tell the truth.\n\nThe giant beast below seemed satisfied with this answer, slowly lowered its head, and said:\n\n\"You have a heart... It wasn't in vain that I... asked the Bodhisattva... for a Judge's position... for you...\"\n\n\"That's right, that's right. Without you, Old Ancestor, I'd still be just a wandering soul in the Underworld. How could I have today's good fortune?\"\n\nThe boy began to weed for the locust tree,\n\nvery diligently,\n\nwith meticulous care.",

    "content": "\"My name is Sun Qiu, and I'm a third-year junior high student at Pingchao Middle School.\n\nOur school is very big, with many students, and most of them are boarders. So, generally after 9:30 PM, students finish evening study and return to their dorms to prepare for rest.\n\nEvening study usually ends at 9:30 PM, and lights are required to be off by 10:00 PM for bedtime.\n\nOur dorm is on the sixth floor and houses eight people. Actually, the time between the end of evening study and lights out is really too short. During this time, we usually rush back to the dorm, then wash clothes, socks, and complete our personal hygiene. Basically, by the time these tasks are done or even before they're finished, a whistle will sound in the hallway outside, signaling the dormitory supervisor's demand for us to turn off the lights and go to bed.\n\nThe dormitory supervisors are all very strict, middle-aged men who look quite fierce. And, to be honest, most of them have a very strong sense of wielding power arbitrarily.\n\nThey see us as students and scold us at every turn. They aren't highly educated, but each one loves to play the role of a teacher, sometimes deliberately looking for trouble to reprimand students.\n\nAnd it's quite funny when they scold students, like a high-ranking leader holding a meeting. First, they scold us to their heart's content, treating students who return late to the dorm or read novels or use their phones in the dorm as criminals to be educated. After they've finished speaking and tired themselves out and gotten their fill, they'll even ask students to grasp the 'spirit of their speech.'\n\nAt the same time, they make students stand in the office and write so-called 'self-criticisms' and 'thought reports,' deeply reflecting on their problems, and even set a word count.\n\nActually, they just pick on us junior high students because we're more obedient and younger. With high school students, they don't dare to be so arrogant.\n\nSo, we all dislike them. They wander outside the dorms after lights out. Our dorm doors have a window in the middle, through which they can see inside, and they love to watch from there.\n\nIf someone talks after lights out, or uses a flashlight or phone, they'll immediately pull out their keys and rush in like mad dogs, confiscate your belongings, drag you off your bed, and take you to the hallway outside or to their office for a scolding.\n\nSo, every time after lights out, my roommates and I don't dare to speak loudly, afraid they'll hear us from outside. If a roommate uses a phone, they always hide under the covers.\n\nI particularly like reading novels, and my phone was confiscated a while ago, so I'd pull my blanket over my head and hide inside, shining a flashlight to read novels.\n\nIn the past, I could read like that all night. After all, school life is too boring. We only get two days off a month to go home and leave school grounds; otherwise, we're stuck in school.\n\nMorning study starts at 6:30 AM and continues until evening study ends at 9:30 PM. Both our morning and evening study sessions are used by teachers for classes, so there's no such thing as being 'voluntary.'\n\nTherefore, for me, the only pastime and joy was reading novels in the dorm during sleep time.\n\nThat night, I started reading novels very early, wrapping myself tightly in my quilt.\n\nIt's actually quite hot now, and being wrapped in a quilt makes it easy to sweat, it's stuffy and uncomfortable, but I couldn't care less. I just had to turn off the flashlight occasionally, poke my head out to breathe some fresh air, and then dive back in to read.\n\nAround 2:00 AM, my roommates were all asleep, and I got out of bed to use the restroom.\n\nOh, by the way,\n\nOur dorm has four bunk beds, meaning it can house eight people. My bunk is the upper one near the window balcony.\n\nThe dorm has a small, self-contained restroom, just big enough for a toilet.\n\nI didn't dare to bring my book into the restroom to read, because if the light in your restroom stays on for too long, a dormitory supervisor might notice and directly use their key to quickly open the door and push open the restroom door to check on you. They open doors with keys incredibly fast, they've practiced!\n\nOne of my roommates was once watching an MP4 in the restroom while, um, performing 'air defense' by himself, when\n\na dormitory supervisor suddenly rushed in,\n\nperson,\n\n\"loot,\"\n\nall caught,\n\nwhich made him write several self-criticisms and had his parents called in. Later, that roommate never watched those things again, but he got closer and closer to his male deskmate.\n\nExcuse me, I got off topic. That night, I was sitting on the toilet, doing my business and thinking about the plot of the novel, when I heard footsteps from outside.\n\nMy heart immediately skipped a beat. I was lucky I hadn't brought the novel into the restroom, otherwise, if that mad dog had set his sights on me, it would have been over.\n\nWhen I finished my business and came out of the restroom, I suddenly heard \"rustling\" sounds from outside the door. I silently lowered my head, and through the crack in the door, I saw a pair of leather shoes.\n\nSomeone was indeed standing outside. He was watching me, waiting for me. I silently took a deep breath, preparing to go back to bed. But after a few steps, a question suddenly occurred to me.\n\nOur dorm door's glass is actually not high; I can stand there and see inside through the glass. But why did I only see the dormitory supervisor's shoes when he was standing there, and not his face?\n\nWas he perhaps squatting there, deliberately waiting for me to expose myself?\n\nWas he that sneaky?\n\nDamn,\n\nwhat an old fox!*\n\n\"Swish, swish, swish, swish...\"\n\nThere was a scratching sound from the door, very subtle and light. I heard it, like someone was rubbing keys against the wooden dorm door.\n\nI wasn't holding my novel, so I had nothing to fear. Hearing the sound, I wasn't in a hurry to get into bed anymore. I walked directly to the door, pressed my face close to the glass, intending to see what was happening outside, to see what the dormitory supervisor was doing.\n\nBut when I pressed my face to the glass, I found it was empty outside; there was no one there at all, and no one was squatting.\n\nI pulled my head back, then bent down again to look through the door crack, but there really was a pair of leather shoes there.\n\nWho took off their leather shoes here?\n\nI opened the dorm door. To be honest, at that moment, I really wasn't very scared, nor did I think much. After opening the door, I found there were no leather shoes outside the dorm door at all.\n\nI paused, a bit baffled.\n\n\"What are you doing? Why are you opening the door!\"\n\nA shout came from a distance. I saw a dark figure walking from the end of the hallway, pointing at me. I couldn't clearly see which dormitory supervisor it was; the hallway light there was a bit faulty and not very bright. But I was still startled and immediately closed the dorm door, then quickly climbed onto my bunk.\n\nI didn't dare to immediately wrap myself in the quilt and open the flashlight to read my novel. I was afraid my actions just now had attracted the attention of that dormitory supervisor. He might specifically watch our dorm, and if he discovered even a tiny bit of light from my area, I'd be finished.\n\nMoreover, I was worried he would use this as an excuse to open our dorm door and scold me for why I had just opened the dorm door and poked my head out.\n\nI waited and waited, I waited for a long time.\n\nThis was a test of patience, a confrontation.\n\nThis was a game of hunter and wolf.\n\nReally, this is no exaggeration.\n\nI really wanted to keep reading my novel, to continue immersing myself in the world of the story, but I didn't dare. Because after I got into bed, I kept vaguely hearing the sound of leather shoes echoing in the hallway outside, sometimes near, sometimes far.\n\nI checked the time on my watch; it was already 2:30 AM.\n\nDamn it,\n\nthey were still hunting for prey at this hour!\n\nThe sound of those leather shoes bothered me for a long time. I really wanted to turn on my flashlight and keep reading, but I truly didn't dare.\n\nFrom 2:30 to 3:00, the sound of leather shoes barely stopped, appearing intermittently. In my mind, I cursed that dormitory supervisor countless times.\n\nIf he didn't leave, I wouldn't dare to read my novel. I was really frustrated.\n\nAt that moment, I even wondered if he had just gotten divorced, which made him moody, and he just wanted to find someone to scold tonight, which was why he was so persistent even at this hour.\n\nJust then, our dorm door was opened.\n\nI was startled and immediately closed my eyes, pretending I was asleep.\n\nMy novel and flashlight were already in my quilt, and I was lying on my bed doing nothing else when he opened the door and came in, so I wasn't scared.\n\nThe sound of leather shoes,\n\nbegan to slowly approach;\n\nDrip,\n\nDrip,\n\nDrip...\n\nAccompanied by the sound of something dripping.\n\nAnd, I suddenly felt a breeze, I was a bit cold, and my body started to tremble slightly, uncontrollably.\n\nMaybe it was because the dorm door was open and the balcony window wasn't closed, causing a draft.\n\nThe leather shoes came to my side and stopped for a while. I kept my breathing even. At that moment, I thought my acting was pretty good.\n\nThe leather shoes lingered by me for a while, then he silently left, and the door was closed.\n\nI didn't dare to move,\n\ncontinued lying there.\n\nAfter about two minutes, the door opened again, then I heard the sound of leather shoes again, and the door closed.\n\nSon of a bitch!\n\nThe first time he closed the door, he didn't leave; he was just waiting for me to make a move!\n\nGood thing I was quick-witted!\n\nSon of a bitch!\n\nFinally, I couldn't hear the sound of leather shoes outside anymore.\n\nI let out a long sigh of relief,\n\nthen pulled the quilt over my head, turned on my flashlight, and continued reading my novel.\n\nI read for about another half hour, thoroughly enjoying it, it was a particularly exciting part.\n\n\"Thud...\"\n\nI heard a sound from the balcony.\n\nI somewhat doubtfully turned off my flashlight and poked my head out from under the quilt. I wasn't scared of sounds from the balcony; as long as it wasn't from the corridor, it was fine.\n\nI leaned my head out of the bed and looked towards the balcony. Actually, due to the moon, visibility on the balcony was quite good. I thought maybe someone's clothes had fallen off the line while drying, but I found no clothes on the balcony floor.\n\nThen,\n\nI was so scared my mouth fell open.\n\nI saw it,\n\nI saw a pair of leather shoes fallen on the balcony!\n\nLeather shoes!\n\nHow could there be leather shoes here?\n\nWe're on the sixth floor, the top floor. No one lives above us, so nothing could be thrown down. And it's impossible for the dorm next door to throw things over at this hour, especially leather shoes.\n\nThen,\n\nas I was still in shock,\n\na face,\n\nan inverted face,\n\nslowly slid down from the wall above the balcony.\n\nMy body almost froze. I just instinctively watched this adult male's face slowly slide down.\n\nHis eyes were narrowed,\n\na very exaggerated smile on his lips,\n\nthen,\n\nhe opened his mouth,\n\nand blew a puff of air onto my face,\n\nsaying:\n\n\"Hey,\n\nI got you, didn't I?\n\nReading novels.\"\n\n---\n*老硬幣 (lǎo yìngbì) - Literally \"old hard coin,\" an internet slang term used to describe someone who is cunning, experienced, and perhaps a bit manipulative or tricky, often in a humorous or slightly exasperated way. It implies they are a seasoned player in some game or situation.",

    "content": "\"Then what?\"\n\nZhou Ze asked while drinking coffee.\n\nXu Qinglang was also listening to the story beside him. Well, it was quite interesting to listen to as a late-night tale.\n\nAs for feelings of tension or fear,\n\nforget Xu Qinglang; even the old Taoist priest beside him wasn't scared in the slightest.\n\nIn the old Taoist priest's words,\n\n\"Scared of what the hell?\n\nI spend all day with a ghost and a zombie.\n\nWas I ever scared?\n\nDid I ever chicken out?\n\nI wasn't scared, I didn't chicken out.\n\nI just...\n\nplayed it safe.\"*\n\n\"What else?\" The young man paused, then smiled and said, \"Then I woke up, it was just a dream. But this dream felt so real, hehe.\"\n\nAfter speaking, the young man yawned, then picked up the novel he had taken from the bookshelf and started reading. He seemed to have found something amusing and burst out laughing.\n\nWhat a simple child,\n\nstill thinking he only had a dream.\n\nThen why did you come to my bookstore in the middle of the night?\n\nAre you sleepwalking?\n\nXu Qinglang also looked at Zhou Ze in surprise, pointed at the young man, and then pointed at his own head.\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\nThe young man didn't know he was already dead.\n\nHe thought he was still alive, but he had already become a ghost and had been wandering for a while.\n\n\"Aren't you going to collect him?\" Xu Qinglang asked. \"Aren't you just one short?\"\n\nXu Qinglang had just come downstairs and saw Zhou Ze sitting opposite the young man, listening to his story. He wouldn't believe that Zhou Ze was worried about some evil spirit causing trouble in the school and was keeping the young man as a clue, preparing to act on behalf of heaven and save the common people.\n\nHe knew that Boss Zhou had been yearning for that last one percent, practically starving for it.\n\n\"Can't collect him, his soul isn't complete.\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head, a bit helpless.\n\nXu Qinglang frowned and looked carefully at the young man, only then noticing some details. The young man's soul was incomplete; some of his three spiritual and six corporeal souls were missing. This was why he was so \"innocent and carefree\" even after becoming a ghost, still unaware that he had died.\n\nEven with so many illogical things around him, even though he was not at school in the middle of the night but in the bookstore,\n\nhe didn't feel anything was amiss and still believed he was alive.\n\nSimply put, there's something wrong with his brain right now.\n\nA very advanced...\n\nintellectual disability.\n\nZhou Ze, in fact, opened the Gate of Hell the moment he saw him.\n\n\"How did you die?\"\n\n\"What injustices do you have?\"\n\n\"Are you hungry? Are you thirsty?\"\n\nHe didn't ask anything; he didn't have time to listen to his babbling. He just planned to send him in so he could get promoted, but he couldn't send him in, which left Zhou Ze frustrated and speechless.\n\n\"Then what are you going to do?\" Xu Qinglang looked at Zhou Ze, reminding him, \"A ghost that can kill people, can you remain indifferent?\"\n\nXu Qinglang was right; Zhou Ze really couldn't remain indifferent to this matter. Although this wasn't the \"with great power comes great responsibility\" nonsense that Spider-Man's foster father told him in superhero movies, since Zhou Ze was the infernal constable here, he had a duty to ensure that no ghost troubles occurred in this vicinity. If they did, they had to be resolved as soon as possible.\n\nThe Underworld authorities,\n\nthey were watching.\n\n\"Let's go.\" Zhou Ze nodded. \"Are you coming with me?\"\n\n\"No, I came down to get a face mask. I'll go back up later for a beauty sleep.\"\n\nXu Qinglang lounged lazily on the sofa, his posture so lithe it could bend steel plates.\n\nZhou Ze sometimes felt helpless with Xu Qinglang. He was clearly normal in that aspect; he could make a woman, after sleeping with him like a male escort, feel he was good in bed and leave three thousand yuan on the nightstand.\n\nThis proved Xu Qinglang had no problems in that area. But sometimes, when he was relaxed, the way he carried himself, even without makeup, Bai Yingying couldn't compare.\n\nNaturally enchanting,\n\nXu Qinglang was lucky to be born in modern times. If it were ancient times, he would probably have been exploited by emperors and nobles who generally had a preference for homosexuality.\n\nThe old Taoist priest immediately volunteered, eagerly stepping forward to take the car keys from Zhou Ze, saying:\n\n\"Boss, Yingying's upstairs playing 'Eat Chicken,' she's busy. I'll accompany you, resolving demons and guarding the Tao is the responsibility of us righteous people.\"\n\nAnd so, the old Taoist priest drove, with Zhou Ze in the passenger seat, heading to Pingchao Middle School.\n\nThe distance was actually a bit far, about a half-hour drive.\n\nThis middle school was indeed very large. The school gate was a memorial archway with \"Provincial Key Pingzhong\" written on it, followed by a guardhouse. Even more exaggerated was a canal behind it, with the school on the other side of the canal. There was a bridge here, spanning the canal, which was internal to the school, and another guardhouse on the other side of the bridge.\n\nSo, for students boarding here, skipping class was a pipe dream. With two guardhouse checkpoints, they'd have to swim across the canal to reach the outside streets and towns.\n\nThe old Taoist priest, relying on his eloquent tongue, directly tricked the gatekeeper into believing his grandson had a sudden heart attack inside and they needed to rush in to check on him. The gatekeeper dared not delay and immediately opened the gate. For people who clearly weren't students, the gatekeeper wasn't too vigilant.\n\nThe car drove into the campus. Zhou Ze and the old Taoist priest got out and walked to the residential area, which truly resembled an independent small town with bathhouses, a supermarket, and multiple canteens.\n\nThe students were like chickens confined in assembly-line cages, unable to even turn around, drinking and eating at fixed times, then laying eggs.\n\nBy the time they arrived, it was almost midnight. The dormitory buildings were mostly dark, except for the ground-floor dormitory supervisor's office, which was still lit. All other floors were pitch black, and despite being full of people, they gave off a ghostly, eerie feeling.\n\n\"Boss, which building is haunted?\"\n\n\"He said he lives in Building B.\" Zhou Ze pointed to a building diagonally opposite. \"It should be here.\"\n\n\"Which dorm room?\" the old Taoist priest asked.\n\n\"Sixth floor, I think. I don't know the specific dorm room. We'll go up and ask any student which one had someone recently die.\"\n\n\"That's a good idea.\" The old Taoist priest offered an insincere compliment.\n\nDamn it,\n\ndidn't ask for details back at the shop before coming out.\n\nInside the dormitory building's ground-floor supervisor's office, several men sat chatting loudly, occasionally bursting into laughter, seemingly discussing dirty jokes.\n\nEven when Zhou Ze and the old Taoist priest walked into the hallway, they didn't notice them. The management here was indeed quite lax.\n\nOr rather,\n\nwas this \"loose on the outside, tight on the inside\"?\n\nOn the sixth floor, all lights were off. The old Taoist priest randomly knocked on a dorm room door. The students inside, thinking it was the dormitory supervisor, instantly fell silent after their earlier chatter.\n\nThe old Taoist priest knocked a few more times.\n\nA student in slippers came over and opened the door. Seeing the old Taoist priest and Zhou Ze, he paused, clearly realizing these two were not the dormitory supervisor.\n\n\"Police.\"\n\nThe old Taoist priest flashed his wallet, quickly putting it away in the dark as a show of authority.\n\n\"Which dorm room here recently had someone die?\" the old Taoist priest asked.\n\nThe student was completely bewildered.\n\nWhat was going on?\n\nPolice knocking on dorm doors at midnight, asking where someone died?\n\n\"Someone died?\" The student looked at the old Taoist priest in surprise.\n\n\"Yes, I'm asking you where someone died.\"\n\n\"When did they die?\" the male student asked in astonishment.\n\n\"Stop pretending!\" The old Taoist priest stepped forward, scolding, \"Is the school trying to hide the news and told you to keep quiet? We're the police, lying to us is useless.\n\nIf any problems arise later, you'll also be held responsible.\"\n\nThe student was utterly terrified. He turned his head and asked his roommate on the bed behind him, \"Did someone die here?\"\n\nThe roommates also started chattering, everyone very confused.\n\nTo the old Taoist priest's surprise, these students seemed genuinely confused. It didn't look like an act; this was high school, not some film academy.\n\n\"Sun Qiu, which dorm room is Sun Qiu in?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Sun Qiu? He's in the room across the hall.\"\n\nThe male student pointed to the dorm door opposite and said.\n\n\"Alright, you're fine. Go back to sleep, don't make any noise.\" The old Taoist priest ordered imperiously.\n\nTurning around, the old Taoist priest went to knock on the opposite dorm room's door.\n\nSoon, a male student wearing glasses came over and opened the dorm room door.\n\nThe old Taoist priest and Zhou Ze walked straight in, leaving the opening student a bit bewildered.\n\n\"I remember he said his bed was the top bunk by the window, is that right?\"\n\nThe old Taoist priest pointed to that bed. To his surprise, someone was actually sleeping in that bed, covered by a quilt.\n\n\"What's going on? Someone's sleeping in a place where someone just died?\" The old Taoist priest was a bit surprised.\n\n\"Who are you?\"\n\nA male student in the dorm asked.\n\n\"Is Sun Qiu in this dorm? How long has he been dead?\" the old Taoist priest asked.\n\n\"Sun Qiu?\" That male student paused, then called out, \"Sun Qiu, wake up, someone's looking for you.\"\n\nWhat?\n\nThe old Taoist priest turned his head in shock,\n\nand then,\n\nhe saw the male student on that bunk throw off his quilt, rub his eyes, and sit up. He looked at the old Taoist priest and Zhou Ze, and asked:\n\n\"Who's looking for me?\"\n\nHe looked very sleepy.\n\nIt wasn't a coincidence of the same name,\n\nthis appearance,\n\nit was clearly the young man who had been telling stories in the bookstore just an hour ago!\n\nThe old Taoist priest's eyes widened.\n\nWhat was going on?\n\nHadn't the person already died?\n\nHis ghost had already floated out, so who was this person lying in bed?\n\nAt this moment, Zhou Ze directly grabbed Sun Qiu's wrist. Sun Qiu frowned, but didn't yell, as if his reaction was a bit sluggish.\n\nZhou Ze pulled up Sun Qiu's sleeve and shone his phone flashlight on it.\n\nOn Sun Qiu's arm,\n\nwas densely covered with lividity!\n\nThis was not a living person,\n\nthis was a corpse that had been dead for quite some time!\n\nThe old Taoist priest, seeing this scene, also gasped.\n\nZhou Ze calmly pulled Sun Qiu's sleeve back down, \"It's nothing, you all go to sleep early, don't make a fuss.\"\n\nWith that, Zhou Ze walked out of the dorm.\n\nThe old Taoist priest immediately followed him out, eagerly asking, \"Boss, what's going on? Is this person dead or not?\"\n\n\"Dead,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\n\"Then this...\" The old Taoist priest couldn't understand.\n\n\"Because of inertia,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\n\"Inertia?\"\n\n\"Yes, inertia. In this school, students' daily schedules are strictly managed. When to wake up, when to go to class, when to eat at the cafeteria, when to return to the dorm, when lights out—everything is fixed.\n\nSo, even if he died, the long-standing inertia from this lifestyle allows him to maintain the state of 'being alive.'\n\nBecause every day, for him, is almost identical.\n\nIt's like a small ball rolling down a track; it continues to roll forward due to its inertia. He is like that now.\n\nDidn't you notice?\n\nHis reactions are already very sluggish,\n\nbut none of his classmates or teachers around him noticed,\n\nthat he had already died.\"\n\n\"That's so mystical?\"\n\n\"When I was a doctor, I also encountered a few similar cases. Autopsies showed bodies that had been dead for many days, yet their colleagues or family members said they had seen them going to work and living normally just yesterday.\"\n\n\"How can that be?\" The old Taoist priest smacked his lips, unable to comprehend.\n\n\"An unchanging life, with daily behaviors that are fixed, like an automated machine;\n\nDoes it matter whether the driver is alive or dead?\"\n\n---\n* The phrase used, \"从心 (cóng xīn)\", literally means \"from the heart\" but is a common internet meme derived from \"怂 (sǒng)\", meaning \"to chicken out\". It is used as a humorous way to say \"I chose to be a coward\" or \"I played it safe\" by twisting the character for \"counsel\" or \"instigate\" (怂) to mean \"follow one's heart\" (从心), implying the \"heart's desire\" was to be cowardly. Here, it maintains the humor of the original.",

Driven by this inertia, he seemed to still be \"alive.\"\n\nHowever,\n\nThis kind of living was inherently a very desolate and pitiable thing.\n\nImagine, your life, your existence, the trajectory of your every day, whether your consciousness is present or not, remains unchanged.\n\nThen, what meaning is left in your life, your existence, if you strip away the superficial?\n\nZhou Ze remembered an incident in Hong Kong that was quite famous online, often compiled into one of Hong Kong's top ten or eight supernatural occurrences.\n\nIt told of a restaurant deliveryman who went to deliver food. Standing outside, he could still hear the sound of Mahjong inside, but after knocking and entering, he found that the four Mahjong players inside had all died a long time ago.\n\nThis was a very typical example.\n\n\"Boss, he's already dead, so what do we do?\" The old Taoist asked the question.\n\nBecause living people seeing ghosts is rare.\n\nBut if dead people see ghosts, that's not rare; it’s as common as fellow villagers seeing each other and shedding tears of recognition.\n\nMoreover, Sun Qiu's death was likely not caused by a ghost. In the story he recounted, he was probably already dead at the time, which is why he witnessed some strange phenomena.\n\nZhou Ze frowned slightly. The problem now was that he couldn't determine Sun Qiu's time of death, which meant he couldn't ascertain whether Sun Qiu died a natural accidental death or was harmed by a ghost.\n\nAs for Sun Qiu's incomplete soul, there were many possibilities for that as well; it wasn't necessarily controlled by a more powerful ghost.\n\n\"Let's go down and ask. Ask those dorm supervisors.\"\n\nSince Sun Qiu was now a \"highly impaired\" individual, much information was broken and irrecoverable from him. The only option was to find a breakthrough elsewhere.\n\nIn short, what Zhou Ze needed was a ghost. If Sun Qiu couldn't be captured, then capturing the dorm supervisor's soul would be the same.\n\nIt was quite like the saying, \"Three years in the army, a sow is more beautiful than Diao Chan.\"\n\nThey descended the stairs and arrived at the dorm supervisor's office on the first floor. Two middle-aged men were still chatting inside. The other few had either gotten off work or perhaps gone to search for \"prey.\"\n\nThis time, Zhou Ze and the old Taoist finally caught their attention.\n\n\"What are you doing here!\"\n\nOne of the men with a flat-top haircut pointed directly at Zhou Ze and asked.\n\nZhou Ze took out a cigarette and bit it between his lips. This time, he didn't let the old Taoist ask but spoke himself:\n\n\"I want to ask you something. Has a dorm supervisor died here recently?\"\n\nAs soon as Zhou Ze's words fell, the faces of the two dorm supervisors immediately changed.\n\n\"Are you police or something?\" The flat-top man asked.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head.\n\n\"Then a student's parent?\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head again.\n\n\"Then why are you asking so many questions? This is a school. Unrelated personnel, please leave.\" The flat-top man walked over and pushed Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze reached out and grabbed the man's wrist, his pinky fingernail extending and directly touching the other's skin.\n\n\"Hiss...\"\n\nThe flat-top man immediately fell to his knees, his face contorting in obvious agony.\n\nThe other dorm supervisor, seeing this, didn't flinch and charged over.\n\n\"This humble Taoist has come to protect!\"\n\nThe old Taoist proactively rushed forward. After their shoulders collided, the old Taoist executed an over-the-shoulder throw, slamming the other man to the ground. This dorm supervisor almost had the wind knocked out of him.\n\nThe old Taoist actually knew some martial arts. In the bookstore, he seemed to have the least presence, but that was compared to the Ghost Messengers and the zombie. Compared to ordinary people, he wasn't afraid.\n\n\"Speak.\"\n\nZhou Ze dragged over a chair and sat down, letting the man remain kneeling before him.\n\nThe flat-top man looked at Zhou Ze with intense fear, but he didn't answer Zhou Ze's question. Instead, he asked, \"Who exactly are you, and what do you want... Ahhh!\"\n\nZhou Ze's fingernail touched the flat-top man's skin again. At the same time, Zhou Ze pulled up the man's clothing to cover his mouth, preventing him from screaming.\n\n\"Go ahead and scream. No one will pay attention to you even if you scream yourself hoarse.\"\n\nThe old Taoist gloated from the side.\n\n\"You answer what I ask.\"\n\nBoss Zhou had been mentally exhausted for a long time due to that one percent performance goal; he really didn't want to waste any more words with irrelevant people.\n\n\"Has a dorm supervisor died recently?\"\n\nThe flat-top man was crying tears and snot from the pain. This time, he was truly scared and immediately nodded:\n\n\"Yes, there was one. He died last month. His name was Wang Baogang.\"\n\n\"How did he die?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"He jumped. He jumped to his death from the dorm building. His head hit the ground and he died instantly.\"\n\n\"Oh, did he have any special habits, like liking to wear leather shoes?\"\n\nGenerally speaking, it's normal for adults to wear leather shoes, especially in certain work environments. But this was a school. Dorm supervisors, while called \"teachers\" to sound better, were actually just young, strong men hired by the school to act as \"enforcers.\" They had nothing to do with being teachers.\n\nThe two men in the room, one was still wearing slippers, and the other just sneakers. Wearing leather shoes to formally check rooms in a dorm building was quite unusual.\n\n\"Yes, he liked wearing leather shoes and suits. We used to tease him, saying he really thought of himself as a people's teacher, always coming to work here in a full outfit for roll call.\"\n\n\"Where did he die?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Right in the flowerbed in front of this building.\" The flat-top man pointed and said, \"His room was on the first floor. He used to share a room with me. After he died, I moved out and lived with someone else.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded. There were still some clothes in the wardrobe, and crucially, two pairs of leather shoes under the bedside table.\n\n\"These are the leather shoes he usually wore,\" the flat-top man explained.\n\nZhou Ze squatted down in front of the leather shoes, picked up one, and felt the sole. There was some still-wet mud on it.\n\nThe dorm was very damp, especially the hallway.\n\nGenerally, when dorm supervisors checked rooms, their shoe soles would often get wet. But according to the flat-top man, this Wang Baogang had died last month, and his shoes should have been left here. How could they be wet?\n\n\"Why did Wang Baogang jump?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"I don't know,\" the flat-top man shook his head. \"He didn't seem to have been provoked or anything. That night, everything was as usual. He took his keyring and went to check rooms.\"\n\nZhou Ze looked around, searching.\n\nRegardless of whether Wang Baogang's soul killed Sun Qiu, one thing could at least be proven: Wang Baogang's soul was still wandering this dorm building.\n\n\"You can go. You can call the police,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nThe flat-top man was stunned for a moment, then backed out of the room. As for whether he would call the police, Zhou Ze wasn't really worried.\n\nAfter that, only Zhou Ze was left in the room. Zhou Ze's right fingernails had all grown out, and a black aura swirled in his palm. Then, Zhou Ze touched the ceramic tiles with his fingertips, and the black aura seeped into the tiles.\n\nBefore long,\n\nStarting from where the shoes were placed by the bedside table, black footprints, visible only to Zhou Ze, began to appear. The footprints extended outward.\n\nZhou Ze opened the dorm door and followed the footprints upstairs.\n\nUp the stairs,\n\nThe footprints moved back and forth through the hallway,\n\nAt the entrance of the student dorm rooms, they were sometimes complex, sometimes varying in depth,\n\nThis meant that even though Wang Baogang was dead, he was still performing his duties as a dorm supervisor.\n\nHe was still inspecting the dorms, still watching the students, still checking on their bedtime. In the dead of night, he would wander the hallway, standing at doors for a long time, waiting for a long time.\n\nHe was dead,\n\nSo he had plenty of time,\n\nTo dedicate himself better to his work.\n\nThe students in the dorms were unaware that they had to contend with living dorm supervisors while also facing the gaze of a ghost!\n\nSuddenly, Zhou Ze's eyes narrowed slightly. He saw that at the end of the hallway, outside a certain dorm room, the black footprints were most concentrated.\n\nThis meant that Wang Baogang had lingered here for a very long time; one could even discern his hesitation and indecision from the footprints.\n\nZhou Ze walked to the door of that dorm room. Somewhat surprisingly, a white paper note reading \"Storage Room\" was on it, indicating that this dorm room was abandoned and no students lived there.\n\nZhou Ze reached out to open the door, but it was locked. His fingernail sank in, and with a slight force, the lock was pried open. Zhou Ze still walked in.\n\nThe bed inside the dorm room was empty, and below it were stacked mops, brooms, and other miscellaneous items. It didn't seem out of the ordinary.\n\nBut Zhou Ze knew that since Wang Baogang had deliberated here for so long, there must be something special about this place.\n\nZhou Ze sat down on the dust-covered bed frame, which let out a creaking sound.\n\nNight,\n\nWas very quiet,\n\nUnnaturally quiet.\n\nSlowly, Zhou Ze's vision began to blur. He suddenly stood up, and the blurring sensation instantly disappeared. As a Ghost Messenger, he couldn't fall asleep normally.\n\nSometimes, Zhou Ze felt this was a kind of torture, but he later slowly discovered that the inability to sleep normally might also be a guarantee that Ghost Messengers were unaffected by specters.\n\n\"Gurgle... gurgle...\"\n\n\"Gurgle... gurgle...\"\n\nBelow, the sound of gushing spring water appeared, and a strong smell of blood wafted from all around.\n\nZhou Ze slowly began to retreat. However, when Zhou Ze turned around, he found that the door he had entered through had become a solid wall.\n\nAnd beneath this dorm room,\n\nCrimson blood began to spread,\n\nIn the distance, it was as if a sea of blood was surging forward, a wave, roaring, instantly engulfing the entire dorm room.\n\n\"Gurgle... gurgle...\"\n\nZhou Ze was completely submerged in the blood. Everything around him was bathed in a crimson glow, giving Zhou Ze a feeling similar to his first time entering the pool of water in the Yellow Springs.\n\nJust then, a \"drip-drop\" sound came from outside the wall,\n\nAs if someone, wearing leather shoes, was slowly approaching,\n\nHe grew closer and closer,\n\nThen he stood in a position separated from Zhou Ze by just a wall,\n\nHe knocked on the wall,\n\nAnd said in a deep voice:\n\n\"Lights out, turn off the lights!\"\n\n\"Clack!\"\n\nA mass of black ink seemed to rapidly spread within the blood,\n\nThe crimson expanse instantly transformed into a gloomy darkness,\n\nAs if,\n\nThe lights,\n\nHad been turned off...",

    "content": "It was pitch black, one couldn't see their hand in front of their face, and the sticky, restrictive feeling all around was so clear that Zhou Ze found it hard to distinguish whether this was an illusion or reality.\n\nThis counted as a very high-level treatment, meaning this ghost's depth and spiritual power had reached a certain realm. It wasn't the usual run-of-the-mill kind that would just walk into his bookstore.\n\nZhou Ze remembered that when Madam Bai invited him and Xu Qinglang to a banquet, she also used a similar ability. Virtual and real were indistinguishable, and Xu Qinglang even ate many dishes made of flies and earthworms at that time.\n\nWang Baogang might not be the true mastermind. He wasn't qualified. He had died such a short time ago; it was impossible for him to become so powerful. This meant that the one who killed Sun Qiu and prevented Sun Qiu's soul from being complete was also someone else entirely.\n\nZhou Ze slowly spread his arms. The swaying feeling around him gave him the illusion of walking in outer space, as if gravity had been completely removed at this moment.\n\nBut as Zhou Ze's fingernails extended, black smoke scattered wildly, and the surrounding thick black blood began to retreat rapidly, as if encountering a natural enemy.\n\nHaving come step by step to this day, the present Zhou Ze was no longer the naive Wu Xia Ameng of old. Even in such a situation, a sense of composure and confidence still exuded from him.\n\n\"Clang!\"\n\nA crisp sound,\n\nA broom fell to the ground,\n\nThe blood color completely disappeared,\n\nThe dormitory room was empty.\n\nZhou Ze turned his head and looked behind him. The dormitory door was open, and outside, a pair of black leather shoes lay quietly there.\n\nIt was as if a person was standing in front of him.\n\nA moment later,\n\nThe leather shoes moved by themselves, beginning to walk out—no, to run out.\n\nZhou Ze rushed out, chasing the leather shoes down the stairs. The leather shoes ran faster and faster, but Zhou Ze's speed was not slow. In fact, Zhou Ze deliberately slowed his pace, waiting to see where these leather shoes would lead him.\n\nHe was only one lost soul away from becoming a regular, but the problem was that this one percent share had given him an enormous presence. Zhou Ze even speculated that the one manipulating all of this behind the scenes, even if not as powerful as Madam Bai, wouldn't be far off.\n\nAfter all, the previous scene and feeling of the surging blood water were not very different in quality and resonance from when Madam Bai hosted her banquet that day.\n\n\"Drip... drip... drip...\"\n\nThis was the sound the leather shoes made as they moved. Zhou Ze hadn't noticed it before, but now he did. Why did the leather shoes make a \"drip-drip\" sound when walking?\n\nAs he walked, Zhou Ze suddenly realized that after going in a circle, going down one flight of stairs and up another, he had followed the leather shoes back to the outside of the dormitory room that was used as a storage room.\n\nThe leather shoes walked in, and Zhou Ze followed again.\n\nHowever,\n\nThis time,\n\nThe dormitory room no longer looked like a storage room, nor was it a sea of blood. Everything was very ordinary. There were neatly folded quilts on the beds, washbasins and plastic cabinets under the beds, and toothbrushes and towels neatly arranged by the sink.\n\nThis was a dormitory room where students lived.\n\nZhou Ze looked at the changes around him and a smile appeared at the corner of his mouth. He didn't know the other party's purpose, but the other party was making a grand display within the confines of a single dormitory room.\n\nZhou Ze waited for a while. This time there was no sea of blood, no \"gurgling\" sounds. Everything seemed very quiet, as if he had walked into an ordinary dormitory room.\n\nBut anyone with a brain could see the unusualness here. Not to mention why the dorm room was empty at lights-out time, the fact that there was sunlight streaming in from outside the window,\n\nWhy was there sunlight shining in at midnight?\n\n\"Scrape... scrape... scrape...\"\n\nA scraping sound came from the tiles on the balcony.\n\nZhou Ze was about to walk to the balcony to look, but he stopped immediately, because whatever was making the noise on the balcony had already crawled in.\n\nYes,\n\nIt was crawling.\n\nThis was a boy.\n\nHis lower body was completely severed at the waist, leaving only his upper body. He was constantly crawling on the ground with his hands. His body was covered in bloodstains, and especially where he crawled, he left dense, hair-raising bloodstains.\n\nThe boy tilted his head, watching Zhou Ze as he crawled.\n\nHe seemed to be observing Zhou Ze, full of curiosity about him, but he did not stop crawling towards Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze slowly squatted down, leveling his gaze with the boy in front of him.\n\n\"I...\"\n\nThe boy opened his mouth, but as he prepared to speak, fresh blood began to gush out of his mouth, endlessly. He looked at Zhou Ze, his mouth opening and closing repeatedly, but he couldn't produce any clear syllables.\n\nHe seemed a little anxious, but the more anxious he was, the more his voice failed him. In the end, it even turned into a sound similar to a dog's bark!\n\nHis severed body trembled; he was enraged.\n\nHe wanted to speak, he wanted to tell Zhou Ze something, but he couldn't!\n\nHe was utterly frantic, his half-body rolling on the ground, ceaselessly pounding the tiled floor with his fists.\n\nZhou Ze reached out, touched the bloodstains on the ground with his finger, and then lightly drew on the tiles.\n\nMeaning,\n\nIf you can't speak,\n\nYou can write.\n\nThe boy paused, as if just realizing there was this method. He immediately nodded, dipped his finger in his own blood, and prepared to write on the ground.\n\nBut just as he wrote a horizontal stroke,\n\n\"Crack!\"\n\nThe boy's index finger snapped off directly.\n\nThe boy was stunned,\n\nZhou Ze's gaze also sharpened,\n\nBut the boy was not convinced. He continued to write with his ring finger, but this time, he didn't even manage a single stroke before his ring finger snapped off as soon as it touched the tile.\n\nThe boy used his thumb, and his thumb snapped.\n\nThe boy used his pinky, and his pinky snapped.\n\nIn the end,\n\nThe boy was desperate. He raised his arm,\n\nHolding up his only middle finger,\n\nRoaring incessantly.\n\nThis middle finger was his, but it was another existence's mockery of him.\n\nThe boy looked at Zhou Ze, then at the cabinet on one side.\n\nIt was an iron cabinet, divided into eight compartments, meaning each of the eight people in the dormitory could use one cabinet to store their belongings.\n\nThe boy's gaze was fixed on the lowest cabinet. Zhou Ze walked over and opened it.\n\n\"Creak... creak...\"\n\nWhat was revealed was a leg, and then there was something else inside, like a piece of clothing neatly folded and placed there.\n\nBut in reality,\n\nThis was a person's,\n\nLower half!\n\nThe boy desperately crawled towards that cabinet, while the two legs inside the cabinet thrashed about, as if responding. But this entire lower body was folded too neatly; in this narrow space, it couldn't move freely or crawl out on its own. It could only kick and squirm in anxious desperation.\n\nThis was a very strange scene, enough to make one's scalp tingle.\n\nJust as the boy was about to touch his feet,\n\nSuddenly,\n\nIt was as if something was dragging the boy from behind. The boy was pulled back towards the balcony, struggling, roaring, and howling continuously, his body rolling up and down on the tiled floor.\n\nBut he was like a fish on a cutting board; all his struggles seemed so pale and powerless.\n\nZhou Ze stood up and chased after him, but as soon as he took a step, his vision began to rapidly retreat.\n\nThe next moment,\n\nZhou Ze found himself standing at the dormitory door,\n\nAnd the dormitory room,\n\nHad returned to its original state.\n\nNo bloodstains, no boy, no exasperated roars.\n\nWhat did this mean?\n\nZhou Ze found it difficult to understand. This dormitory room was like walking into a cinema playing a horror movie late at night; every time he entered, he would get a new experience.\n\n\"Drip... drip...\"\n\nThe familiar sound rang out again.\n\nTurning his head,\n\nIndeed,\n\nThe pair of leather shoes had reappeared in the hallway behind the door.\n\nZhou Ze finally understood why the leather shoe prints were so dense outside this dormitory room. He seemed to be doing the same thing over and over again.\n\nTaking people away,\n\nThen bringing them back,\n\nThen waiting there to lead people away again,\n\nAnd then bringing them back.\n\nLike a waiter in a restaurant,\n\n\"Welcome, esteemed guest?\"\n\n\"Oh, please come again, esteemed guest.\"\n\nThe leather shoes seemed to wait for Zhou Ze to turn and look at them before they started to leave.\n\nAgain, the \"drip-drip\" sound. Zhou Ze walked over, but this time, the confusion in his mind couldn't be resolved. First, why did these leather shoes make a \"drip-drip\" sound when walking?\n\nShouldn't it be \"pat-pat-pat\"\n\nOr \"scrape-scrape-scrape\"?\n\nZhou Ze reached out, and the black mist from his fingertips began to release, directly enveloping the black leather shoes.\n\nLike a net cast down, finally catching the fish.\n\nSlowly,\n\nThe owner of the leather shoes began to reveal his true form. He was still walking forward, still making the \"drip-drip\" sound;\n\nCarrying his stubbornness,\n\nCarrying his persistence,\n\nContinuing to walk forward.\n\n\"Drip... drip...\"\n\nHis head,\n\nWas half-rotted,\n\nUpside down,\n\nHalf his head repeatedly struck the tiled floor;\n\n\"Drip... drip...\"\n\nHe kept bouncing, each landing a collision between his head and the ground.\n\nHis hands, thrust into the leather shoes, swung back and forth.\n\nHe was actually walking on his head,\n\nBut his two hands were supporting the leather shoes, pretending that the shoes were moving forward step by step.\n\nXiao Pingtou had said that Wang Baogang, when alive, always liked to wear leather shoes and a suit when checking rooms. He considered himself a teacher, not a mere dorm manager or thug.\n\nTherefore,\n\nEven after his death,\n\nHe would maintain his dignity,\n\nEven if,\n\nHe walked with his hands in his leather shoes.\n\n\"Drip... drip...\"\n\nSun Qiu said he saw Wang Baogang's head slowly slide down the wall from the balcony,\n\nIncluding Wang Baogang walking by touching the ground with his head,\n\nThere was a reason for that,\n\nBecause Xiao Pingtou also said that when Wang Baogang jumped off the building,\n\nHis head,\n\nHit the ground first.",

    "content": "\"Creak...\"\n\nPushing open the concealed dorm room door, the old Taoist priest poked his head in:\n\n\"Boss?\"\n\nHowever, no one was in the room. This was Wang Baogang's dorm. The old Taoist had asked Zhou Ze, the short-haired young man who returned from the dorm supervisor's office, where Zhou Ze was, and the latter replied that Zhou Ze was here.\n\nBut where was he?\n\nThe old Taoist scratched his head. The boss wouldn't leave without a word. Did he go upstairs?\n\nThe old Taoist started walking up the stairs. Actually, this dorm building housed many, many people. Six floors, with thirty to forty dorms on each floor, and eight students crammed into each dorm. If you did the math, how many people must be in here?\n\nBut at night, the damp environment and almost silent corridors still gave one a chilling feeling. It had to be said, this was also a strange contrast.\n\nYou were clearly in a crowd, but you still felt afraid.\n\nAnd tonight, that feeling seemed even more intense.\n\nAs the old Taoist went upstairs, he saw a student standing in front of him. The student wore a yellow sweater and held something resembling a drawing board, staring motionlessly at him.\n\n\"What are you looking at? Go back to sleep!\"\n\nThe old Taoist rebuked, sounding exactly like a possessed dorm supervisor.\n\nThe student nodded, turned around, and walked into the wall by the stairwell.\n\n\"Uh...\"\n\nThe old Taoist smacked his lips,\n\nDamn it,\n\nIs this a school or a ghost domain?\n\nThis dorm supervisor job is not for humans. Is he managing students or playing a game of ghost survival?\n\nHis hand,\n\nReached into his crotch and pulled out a yellow talisman. The old Taoist sniffed it at his nose. The paper scent of the ancestral talisman gave him a great sense of security.\n\nThe next moment, the old Taoist didn't rush to move, but took out his phone, ready to call the boss.\n\nBoss, the ghost you've been searching for, I found it!\n\nHowever, when he dialed, it showed no signal.\n\nDamn it, this is bad.\n\nThe old Taoist slowly retreated, then prepared to shout. At this point, he didn't care if he'd disturb the slumber of the nation's future, nor did he care about his own face. Without Zhou Ze by his side, the old Taoist felt very insecure.\n\nBut just as the old Taoist opened his mouth, before he could make a sound, he felt as if something was stuck in his throat, making it impossible to shout. He almost choked.\n\nNow, beads of sweat began to appear densely on the old Taoist's forehead. He knew that ghost had targeted him.\n\nDamn,\n\nWhat kind of skill is it to bully a Bronze-level player? If you're so capable, go find a spirit of the deceased!\n\nThe old Taoist intimately greeted all eighteen generations of the female ancestors of this ghost, which bullied the weak and feared the strong, then unhesitatingly turned and prepared to go down the stairs.\n\nCan't afford to provoke, can't afford to provoke.\n\nI can afford to hide!\n\nWho knew, as the old Taoist descended the stairs, he saw the steps below him suddenly become distorted, uneven in height. The old Taoist slipped and fell directly. Fortunately, he was agile, otherwise, any other elderly person falling like that could have started preparing their funeral.\n\nBut even so, the old Taoist still ended up bruised and battered.\n\nWhen he struggled to stand up, he saw the young boy in the yellow sweater, holding a drawing board, still standing in front of him.\n\nHe was looking at him,\n\nAt the same time,\n\nThe fountain pen in his hand seemed to be drawing something on the drawing board.\n\nEven a cornered rabbit will bite. The old Taoist directly charged forward, holding the talisman in his hand. At worst, it would be a fight to the death!\n\nHowever, while he couldn't go down the stairs before, now he couldn't go up. The old Taoist kept running up the stairs but maintained a distance of about two meters from the boy, unable to get close.\n\nThe old Taoist simply took flight, jumped up, and flung out the talisman in his hand.\n\nThe boy looked up,\n\nHis eyes were hollow. He raised his hand, and the fountain pen in his hand suddenly pointed out, becoming a rich, dark stroke that instantly blackened the bright yellow talisman.\n\nSeeing this, the old Taoist felt despair. His ancestral talisman had been so effortlessly neutralized by this ghost.\n\nIt's over,\n\nIt's over!\n\nThe old Taoist, who had jumped up, fell heavily onto the stairs, sliding down with a series of \"thumps.\"\n\nThe boy slowly walked down,\n\nThe old Taoist struggled to raise his head, watching the other party continuously approach him.\n\nJust then, the most beautiful, most wonderful sound in the world, the one that now brought tears to the old Taoist's eyes, rang out:\n\n\"Oh, you're here.\"\n\nBoss Zhou's voice came through,\n\nThe old Taoist's heart, which had been ashen, was instantly filled with hope!\n\nThe boy turned sideways, saw Zhou Ze behind him, and frowned slightly, as if feeling somewhat helpless, or perhaps a headache.\n\nImmediately after, the boy began to walk towards the wall, intending to hide himself again. He seemed to have no interest in confronting Zhou Ze, and he knew how difficult this man, who had entered the dorm building for the first time today, would be to handle.\n\nBut how could Zhou Ze let him leave so easily? His fingernails directly dug into the wall. Zhou Ze stepped back, using his arms to pull backward with force!\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nThe boy was yanked out and fell onto the stairs, his drawing board and fountain pen falling to the ground.\n\n\"Buzz!\"\n\nThe boy's previously hollow eyes revealed a dark red. He was angry, he was furious. Before this, he felt he had given Zhou Ze a lot of face, but Zhou Ze was being a bit ungrateful.\n\n\"Hiss...\"\n\nAn astonishing scene appeared before Zhou Ze. He heard the sound of tearing paper in front of him. Immediately after, Zhou Ze saw the sleeve on his arm rip open, followed by his skin and flesh tearing, and blood continuously flowing out.\n\nZhou Ze began to retreat. After retreating a certain distance, the previous injuries disappeared, and even Zhou Ze's previously injured arm returned to normal.\n\nWhat was going on?\n\nThe old Taoist took advantage of Zhou Ze's entanglement with the ghost to get up and try to escape, but the boy seemed to be fixated on him, appearing instantly in front of him.\n\n\"%...￥￥##@@...!\"\n\nBullying an honest man!\n\nThe old Taoist cursed in his heart.\n\n\"Pfft...\"\n\nA fountain pen,\n\nDirectly pierced the old Taoist's chest. The old Taoist looked down in shock. He saw the wound on his chest continuously expanding. Crimson blood began to permeate relentlessly, staining his entire Taoist robe red at an astonishing speed!\n\n\"Thump...\"\n\nThe old Taoist knelt on the ground, covering his wound with both hands, watching the blood continuously gushing out onto the floor.\n\nHe felt it was unreal, extremely unreal. Although he knew there were risks in accompanying the boss to catch ghosts, he really hadn't expected to die here!\n\nHe,\n\nJust died like this?\n\nDied in this dorm building?\n\nZhou Ze had already rushed over. The boy glanced at Zhou Ze, seemingly not intending to make another move, or perhaps having some reservations, and once again slipped into a nearby wall.\n\nAs Zhou Ze was about to continue the pursuit and use the same method to drag the boy out again,\n\nHe found his pant leg grasped by a pair of hands,\n\nLooking down,\n\nHe saw,\n\nIt was the old Taoist.\n\nThe old Taoist's blood-stained hands clutched Zhou Ze's pant leg,\n\nWiping snot and tears onto it incessantly,\n\nZhou Ze took a deep breath,\n\nForcing himself to resist the urge to slap this old man to death first!\n\nFor someone with mysophobia, the old Taoist's current behavior,\n\nWas like carrying a dung bucket and scurrying around the streets,\n\nLooking for excrement (death).\n\n\"Boss, I can't go on, I can't go on! Don't chase him yet, let me say my last wishes first before you chase him, I'm afraid I won't have a chance!\"\n\nAt this moment, the old Taoist didn't care if Zhou Ze was going to catch a ghost. He knew he wouldn't last much longer. He was afraid that by the time Zhou Ze came back after catching the ghost, he would already be cold, and then he wouldn't even have had time to say his last words or make arrangements for his funeral, which would be too great a loss.\n\n\"Boss, I have a small box under the bed in my bookstore room. Inside is another box of ancestral talismans, and in a hidden compartment, there are three bank cards. The password is the last six digits of my phone number. It's not much money, only about a million yuan...\"\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze.\n\nThe old Taoist suddenly shivered. He sensed a killing intent, seemingly from his boss.\n\nThe old Taoist's heart immediately warmed,\n\nAh,\n\nDon't look at how ruthless and uncaring the boss usually seems. When he saw his good buddy, good brother, good friend, good partner, and soulmate about to depart,\n\nHe too was enraged,\n\nHe probably wanted to kill that ghost immediately to avenge himself.\n\nAlas,\n\nA long road tests a horse's strength, and time reveals a person's heart.\n\nThe old Taoist sighed in his heart,\n\nHe didn't know that when Zhou Ze heard the old Taoist say, \"It's not much money, only about a million,\"\n\nA thought had occurred to him: should he just go with the flow and kill this old Taoist to seize his wealth?\n\nIf the old Taoist knew the truth, he would probably spit out a mouthful of old blood and die on the spot.\n\n\"The talismans, just burn them in front of my grave. You can keep two for yourself.\n\nBoss, after I die, please donate my money to the children in the mountain areas. You can also keep two for yourself, but don't keep too much.\n\nAlso, after I die, please inform Mr. Liang in Shanghai to attend my memorial service. After all, it's a kind of fate.\n\nOf course,\n\nBoss, if you and Mr. Liang truly can't bear to lose me, you can both kill your way into hell and rescue this poor Taoist's wandering soul. This poor Taoist won't mind!\n\nEven if I can't enter reincarnation, this poor Taoist is willing to make the sacrifice to return to the human world and continue to accompany you!\n\nCome rain or shine, this poor Taoist will wait for you!\"\n\nZhou Ze really couldn't listen anymore,\n\nKill his way into hell?\n\nAnd for you?\n\n\"Boss, this poor Taoist can't bear to leave you! Although your temper is really bad, and you're very selfish, and you're broke, not earning much money, I never had the nerve to ask you for a salary.\"\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Although you're very lustful, always making Yingying serve you in the bath with a straight face. I heard from Miss Xu that you have problems in that area, unable to get it up...\"\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze.\n\nWhy aren't you dead yet?\n\nOr, should I help you along?\n\nJust die soon,\n\nOtherwise, I really can't stop myself from killing you.\n\nThe old Taoist, with snot and tears, continued, \"But actually, you're not a bad person. Although you have many flaws, you do have advantages, for example... uh... for example...\"\n\nThe old Taoist scratched his head,\n\nIt's so hard,\n\nFor example, what?\n\nJust then, the old Taoist lost his balance and fell, rolling out of where he had been kneeling. In an instant, the old Taoist found that all his injuries had disappeared, and he was completely clean!\n\nNot dying after all?\n\n\"Boss, I'm fine now, I don't have to die!\"\n\nThe old Taoist was so excited he forgot himself,\n\nThen he saw Zhou Ze extend his fingernails towards him,\n\n\"What did you just say? I didn't hear you clearly. Say it again.\"",

    "content": "\"Boss, what exactly is going on?\"\n\nThe old Taoist priest was a bit confused. He had clearly seen himself get hit by an arrow just now—\n\nOh no, he was hit by a pen.\n\nBut now he felt completely fine, except for the lingering bruises on his face, which were from his own fall.\n\nZhou Ze reached out and picked up the pen that had fallen to the ground. As soon as it was touched, it crumbled into ash.\n\n\"It was drawn,\" Zhou Ze said. \"If he were truly that powerful, he wouldn't be unwilling to confront me directly. In fact, he could have easily crushed me.\"\n\n\"Drawn?\"\n\n\"Yes, drawn. It's like a more advanced form of hypnosis, deceiving your sight, hearing, smell, and other senses, and changing them according to his design.\"\n\nZhou Ze looked at his arm. Before, there were clear injuries on his arm, but now not a trace could be seen. Yet, the realistic texture of those images was enough to make one instinctively believe it was all real in a short amount of time.\n\n\"Damn, so he's a colleague of ours, a trickster from the jianghu.\"\n\nThe old Taoist priest instantly regained his masculine confidence.\n\nThe great leader said that all reactionaries are paper tigers!\n\n\"Boss, should we go and catch him now?\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head, pointing out the hallway window. \"It's almost dawn, and he's already hidden.\"\n\nIn truth, the appearance of ghosts has little to do with day or night. At least for ghosts, there's no fundamental impact. Instead, it affects humans.\n\nDuring the daytime, everything is out in the open, and even if something strange happens, ordinary people can feel a bit bolder, at least finding some psychological comfort.\n\nBut at night, people are easily startled by anything that happens, giving ghosts an opportune moment.\n\nOf course, that particular ghost was special. He was good at painting, but even the best painting and picture quality needed an environment to support and complement them. Daytime wasn't his preferred background for painting because it would magnify the flaws in his art, whereas at night, his paintings could be more realistic.\n\n\"So what do we do next... go for breakfast?\"\n\nZhou Ze walked towards the other end of the corridor, and the old Taoist priest naturally followed. Then, the old Taoist priest watched Zhou Ze walk into a dormitory room labeled \"Storage Room.\"\n\nInside the dormitory, besides a pile of miscellaneous items, there was a pair of black leather shoes.\n\nZhou Ze sat on a wooden board, seemingly lost in thought.\n\n\"Boss?\"\n\nZhou Ze raised his hand, gesturing for the old Taoist priest to be quiet for now.\n\nThe old Taoist priest nodded and sat down on the opposite bunk. He wasn't worried about the bruises on his body. After so many years of traveling north and south, he had endured countless hardships and minor injuries. This was child's play.\n\nAbout fifteen minutes later, Zhou Ze bent down and started searching under the bunk.\n\nThe old Taoist priest also bent down and rummaged around. He didn't know what his boss was looking for, but that was okay; searching was the right thing to do!\n\nAfter all, most bosses don't look at your progress, but your attitude.\n\nUnder the bed were only miscellaneous items. After pulling them out, the space underneath was empty, as no one had been living in this dormitory.\n\nZhou Ze opened the wardrobe. All eight compartments were open. Inside, there was nothing but a thin layer of dust.\n\nThe old Taoist priest scratched his head and simply climbed onto the upper bunk. On the wall by the upper bunk, there were many posters of football stars, like Cristiano Ronaldo and Sergio Ramos.\n\nZhou Ze also went to the upper bunk. He felt that there should be something here; otherwise, Wang Baogang's ghost wouldn't have lingered here, and he had also seen other bizarre scenes in this dorm.\n\nIf nothing else, this dormitory should be the key point in this series of events.\n\n\"Boss, what kind of painting is that poster you have? It looks weird,\" the old Taoist priest said, pointing to Zhou Ze's side.\n\n\"A Picasso painting,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\nImmediately, Zhou Ze seemed to discover something and reached out to touch the poster.\n\nFrom the old Taoist priest's perspective, his boss was actually touching the chest of the woman in the painting. The old Taoist priest immediately said:\n\n\"Boss, go home and touch Yingying's; the woman in this painting is too ugly—\"\n\nThe old Taoist priest hadn't finished his sentence when—\n\nHe heard a \"rip.\"\n\nZhou Ze directly tore the painting down. Several pieces of paper fell between the painting and the wall.\n\nZhou Ze didn't have time to bother with the old Taoist priest's nonsense. He immediately picked up a piece of paper. It was a pen drawing, meticulously done. The drawing depicted a dormitory room, but this room was filled and covered by a special liquid.\n\nIt could be water, or it could be... blood.\n\nThe next drawing showed a boy with only half a body trying to crawl inside on a balcony, and two legs extended from the dormitory wardrobe.\n\nNext was the third drawing, which showed a man standing on his head, wearing leather shoes and doing a handstand on the tile floor.\n\nThree drawings, representing three scenes, and Zhou Ze had just witnessed these three scenes earlier.\n\nOne was the dormitory filled with bloody water, another was the half-bodied boy, and the third was Wang Baogang walking upside down.\n\nBelow, there were three more drawings, making a total of six.\n\nPicking up another drawing, it depicted a skeleton holding a book, walking among students and teachers. If there was no mistake, it should be Sun Qiu.\n\nNext was the fifth drawing. When Zhou Ze saw the scene in this drawing, he immediately turned his head to look at the old Taoist priest. The old Taoist priest had just climbed down from the opposite upper bunk and was now climbing onto Zhou Ze's upper bunk, apparently also interested in what Zhou Ze had found.\n\n\"What's it drawing? Can't see clearly,\" the old Taoist priest asked.\n\nZhou Ze handed the drawing to the old Taoist priest. The old Taoist priest grabbed the ladder with one hand and took the drawing with the other. Then he froze for a moment and fell straight down. Fortunately, it wasn't a high fall, so he wasn't injured, but the old Taoist priest looked as if he had lost his soul.\n\nThe drawing landed on the ground. In the drawing, an old man in a Taoist robe lay there, decapitated, with a black cat nearby appearing to gnaw on his corpse.\n\nZhou Ze turned to the last drawing.\n\nSomewhat unexpectedly, the last drawing was not of himself, but of the flat-headed man. The flat-headed man had a sharp object sticking straight out of his forehead. He was standing perfectly straight. Because the flat-headed man had two moles on his face, it was easy to identify the person in the drawing.\n\nAfter looking at all the drawings, Zhou Ze looked at the dejected old Taoist priest below and suddenly felt a sense of disappointment.\n\nWhy was there a drawing of the old Taoist priest but not of himself?\n\nHmm,\n\nThis feeling was like a pre-determined protagonist in a movie being completely upstaged by a minor extra.\n\nThe old Taoist priest immediately climbed back up, took the other drawings from Zhou Ze's hand, and looked at them all. Then, he asked Zhou Ze tremblingly:\n\n\"Boss, the drawings are all fake, right?\"\n\nZhou Ze got off the bed and washed his hands at the sink, saying, \"Only the two drawings of you and the flat-headed man I haven't seen. I've seen the other four drawings.\"\n\n\"How is that possible? This isn't some Mayan prophecy. This poor Taoist is still alive, and that flat-headed dorm supervisor is still alive too.\"\n\n\"Are you trying to say that a few years ago, there was a talented middle school student in this dorm who started admiring you in advance?\" Zhou Ze countered.\n\n\"This is the ghost's trick, a deliberate deception, trying to sow discord in our ranks!\"\n\nZhou Ze said no more, but motioned for the old Taoist priest to put all six drawings away. Then, Zhou Ze walked out onto the balcony.\n\nIt was almost dawn; the morning light was faintly visible. People always liked to see dawn as a symbol of hope, but sometimes, it was more like the oppressive calm before the darkness.\n\nThe old Taoist priest, with a bitter face, also walked to the edge of the balcony, took out a cigarette, offered one to Zhou Ze, lit one for himself, and then sighed, saying:\n\n\"Boss, these are all fake, right?\"\n\nThe old Taoist priest had already asked this question.\n\n\"I don't know.\" Zhou Ze shook his head. Then, Zhou Ze leaned against the edge of the balcony and continued, \"Do you feel how damp everything is here since we entered this dormitory building?\n\nAnd it also has a musty, earthy smell?\"\n\n\"Dormitory buildings are all like this,\" the old Taoist priest exhaled a puff of smoke.\n\nZhou Ze reached out and rubbed his forehead. Just then, the dormitory bell rang, meaning students should get up for morning self-study.\n\nSome more diligent students had already exited from the ground floor as soon as the bell rang. They were wearing red school uniforms.\n\nMeanwhile, students in the other surrounding buildings were wearing blue school uniforms.\n\n\"Different school uniform colors.\"\n\nZhou Ze pointed downwards. He didn't want to miss any detail now, for a simple reason: from the moment he entered this dormitory building, the string of events that had occurred left Zhou Ze feeling completely without a clue.\n\n\"Maybe it's because junior high and senior high school uniforms are different. This is a junior high dormitory building, and the two outside buildings seem to be high school dorms. This school combines both junior and senior high sections.\"\n\nAs the old Taoist priest spoke, he took out the drawing and looked at it again, feeling increasingly uncomfortable. He even wondered why the person who died so tragically in the drawing wasn't Zhou Ze, but himself?\n\nWhen did I become so important?\n\n\"Look, your flat-headed friend is out.\"\n\nZhou Ze pointed downwards. The flat-headed dorm supervisor teacher walked out to the exit, holding a phone as if making a call.\n\n\"Didn't they call the police?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"No, right?\" the old Taoist priest wondered.\n\nActually, for Zhou Ze and the old Taoist priest, causing a minor disturbance wasn't a big deal; burning some paper money would usually resolve it. The key was that even if the flat-headed supervisor and his group didn't call the police, they wouldn't just act as if nothing had happened.\n\nBefore, they were only focused on catching the ghost and overlooked this detail, but now that they had leisure, they realized something was off.\n\nNo, to be precise, ever since they entered this dormitory building, few things had felt right.\n\n\"Look, he's still alive too.\"\n\nThe old Taoist priest pointed to the flat-headed man standing below.\n\nThis feeling,\n\nReally,\n\nHe's good,\n\nI'm good too.\n\n\"Crack!\"\n\nSuddenly, the sound of glass shattering came from the roof. The old Taoist priest felt a gust of wind brush past his face, and then he heard a commotion and screams from below.\n\nThe flat-headed man standing below was just hit by the glass.\n\nThat piece of glass,\n\nPunctured directly into his forehead,\n\nPerfectly straight.",

    "content": "The bookstore at dawn was quite deserted. Of course, with its exaggerated sign boasting a minimum spend of one hundred yuan, it was destined to rarely be lively.\n\nXu Qinglang was upstairs in his bedroom, sleeping a beauty sleep with a face mask on. After bidding farewell to his restaurant life and escaping the erosion of kitchen fumes on his skin, he had come to increasingly appreciate and cherish it.\n\nHah, a man,\nmust learn to treat himself well, to love himself more.\n\nBai Yingying sat alone at the counter on the first floor, playing a mobile game, \"Chicken Dinner,\" and having a blast.\n\nThe bookstore door was pushed open at this moment. Bai Yingying looked up and saw a little loli in a red dress standing at the doorway. The loli's outfit was truly festive, making her appear even more guileless and adorable.\n\nYawning, Bai Yingying continued to look down at her phone.\n\nThe little loli walked up to the counter. She was a bit short and couldn't reach, so she simply pushed open the small counter door and walked in, standing behind Bai Yingying and watching her play.\n\nAfter a round ended, Bai Yingying stretched, glanced at the little loli, put down her phone, and asked, \"What do you want?\"\n\nThe little loli lifted her delicate chin, sized up Bai Yingying, shook her head, and smiled faintly. \"Your mistress, back then, didn't dare to speak to me in such a tone.\"\n\n\"You said 'back then',\" Bai Yingying shrugged. \"What's the difference between you and me now?\"\nWe’re all dogs, all tied by a man's leash.\nWhy criticize the pot for being blacker than the kettle?footnote:[Literally \"why should the fifty-pace man laugh at the hundred-pace man?\", meaning why criticize someone for a fault when you share a similar one.]\n\nThe little loli sat down on a chair nearby, which gave her a special sense of satisfaction. She was always sensitive about her height and disliked standing below, looking up at people taller than her.\n\n\"Can you compare to me?\" the little loli retorted.\n\n\"Hey, I can even 'ying ying ying'*. What can you do?\nYing ying ying...\"footnote:[\"Ying ying ying\" (嘤嘤嘤) is an onomatopoeia for crying or whimpering, often used sarcastically to describe someone acting overly cute or helpless to gain sympathy, especially from a man.]\n\nThe little loli frowned slightly, unsure how to respond to that.\nAfter all, she was a two-hundred-year-old zombie,\nand she could actually \"ying ying ying\" that man without any sense of incongruity.\n\n\"What are you here for?\" Bai Yingying asked. \"Did your mom go to get her hair done in the middle of the night again and dump you at the bookstore?\"\n\nThe little loli took a sealed envelope from her pocket and tossed it onto the counter. \"Everything he asked me to investigate is in there. The location of that Japanese priest has also been confirmed.\"\n\n\"Why didn't you just call him?\" Bai Yingying tilted her head and asked. \"Oh, I get it. Do you think delivering it in person shows more sincerity and earns you some goodwill with him?\"\n\nThen, a sense of crisis appeared on Bai Yingying's face:\n\"Are you... trying to compete with me for his favor?\"\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nThe little loli slapped the counter,\nscolding Bai Yingying:\n\"Don't think of me as being like you!\"\n\nBai Yingying pouted, muttering, \"Little brats always care about face.\"\n\nThe little loli suppressed her urge to physically confront Bai Yingying and said, \"I couldn't get through to his phone. I couldn't contact him and thought he was in the bookstore, but he wasn't.\"\n\n\"He went out for something,\" Bai Yingying said.\n\n\"He's really busy.\"\n\n\"He's almost getting promoted,\" Bai Yingying said, smiling. It was clear she was genuinely happy for Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Why are you happy if he gets promoted?\" The little loli found Bai Yingying's \"ugly face\" of being enslaved and controlled yet content utterly intolerable.\nBecause she didn't want to become like this stupid zombie in front of her.\n\n\"What? He's my boss. Don't I share in his glory if he does well? Besides, the sooner he gets promoted and moves up, the sooner you can be free, right?\"\n\n\"Whether he does well really has nothing to do with you. You should be thinking about how you're going to spend the next Cold Clothes Festival!\"\nThe little loli couldn't stand Bai Yingying's naive \"sweet and simple\" mode anymore.\nAll those false, beautiful, fresh little things,\nhad to be pricked,\npricked, pricked with a silver needle!\n\nThe little loli and Mrs. Bai knew each other. Due to Mrs. Bai's unique nature, the little loli hadn't laid a hand on her. Both parties kept to themselves.\nYou cultivate your merits, I do my work; peace between us.\n\nBut the little loli was clear about what kind of person Mrs. Bai was. She could even guess Mrs. Bai's purpose in handing her corpse over to Zhou Ze before achieving full merit and descending into Hell.\n\n\"How to spend it? Of course, I have a design.\"\nSaying that,\nBai Yingying opened the computer, clicked on a folder, and said,\n\"I've been designing for a long time, and I've designed many styles.\"\n\nThe little loli saw one bamboo bed after another appear on the computer screen: mandarin duck and butterfly-style bamboo beds, small boat bamboo beds, princess beds, all with various decorations.\nThe little loli was shocked.\nShe,\nalready knew?\n\n\"These bamboo beds aren't cheap to make, but luckily I have enough burial goods. I can sell two items to build them then. Don't you think it would be beautiful to lie on one of these and be burned?\"\n\nThe little loli covered her face with her hand. She didn't know how to talk to this zombie anymore.\nThis wasn't foolishness;\nthis was having a screw loose!\n\n\"You know that day is coming, and you're still here acting as his maid?\" the little loli finally asked.\n\n\"I quite like my current life,\" Bai Yingying said, as if it were the most natural thing. \"It's pretty good.\"\n\n\"Do you think this will move him?\" the little loli retorted.\n\nBai Yingying didn't answer.\n\n\"Last time, a corpse demon could bring him so much merit. Do you know how much merit a genuine two-hundred-year-old zombie is worth?\"\n\nBai Yingying still didn't speak.\n\n\"Forget it,\" the little loli said, giving up. She looked at the envelope she had just thrown onto the counter and asked, \"Where did he go?\"\n\n\"He seemed to go to some school,\" Bai Yingying said. \"He's just one ghost short, and the boss is anxious.\"\n\n\"School?\" The little loli tilted her body, not taking it seriously. \"I'm leaving first. When he gets back, give him the envelope.\"\n\n\"Okay.\"\nBai Yingying nodded, indicating she remembered.\n\nThe little loli got off the chair and was about to leave. As she reached the door, she inadvertently glanced at the young man sitting in a corner of the bookstore, reading.\nThe young man held a book, engrossed in it, occasionally letting out snorts of laughter.\n\nThe little loli stopped.\nWhen she came in,\nwhy hadn't she sensed another ghost in the bookstore?\nThis ghost,\nshe had seen with her eyes,\nnot sensed.\n\nThe little loli pointed at the young man and asked Bai Yingying, \"Who is he?\"\n\n\"A ghost. According to the boss, he's a 'high-level simpleton' who just walked into the bookstore. Because his soul isn't complete, he can't be taken to Hell, so he's staying for now. The boss will send him off once he's dealt with his own matters.\"\n\n\"Incomplete soul?\"\n\nThe little loli walked towards the young man who was reading. The young man didn't even notice the little loli approaching, completely absorbed in the world of his novel.\n\n\"What's his name?\" the little loli asked.\n\n\"Sun Qiu, a middle school student.\"\n\nThe little loli reached out and took the book from his hand.\n\nSun Qiu was stunned, somewhat displeased. \"Little sister, what are you doing? Don't be mischievous.\"\nSaying that, Sun Qiu reached out for the book again.\nHowever,\nin the next moment,\nthe little loli suddenly extended her tongue. Instantly, her tongue lashed out like a whip, striking Sun Qiu's soul hard.\n\n\"Thwack!\"\n\nSun Qiu was whipped to the ground, screaming in pain.\nFor a soul body, the little loli's tongue skill was absolutely terrifying.\n\nBai Yingying immediately stepped out from behind the counter. \"Hey, what are you doing? That's the boss's reserved merit.\"\n\n\"Merit?\" The little loli was somewhat bewildered, even a little amused. She pointed at Sun Qiu, who was on the ground. \"Are all of you at this bookstore idiots?\nThis is not a soul, this is not a ghost!\"\n\nZhou Ze hadn't been in the Ghost Catcher circle for a short time, but of course, he couldn't compare to the little loli. She was a senior Ghost Catcher, naturally having experienced much more.\n\n\"He's not a ghost?\" Bai Yingying was stunned. If he wasn't a ghost, what was he?\n\n\"So, he couldn't be sent to Hell not because his soul was incomplete, but because he's not a ghost at all. Of course, he couldn't pass through the Gates of Hell to be sent below.\"\n\nThe little loli walked up to Sun Qiu, her tongue lashing him repeatedly, making him scream continuously.\n\n\"Look, his soul is just weak, but there's no sign of it dissipating. He's fundamentally an illusory energy body, not a soul body.\"\nThe little loli said with absolute certainty.\n\n\"He's not a ghost, but he deliberately came to the bookstore...\" Bai Yingying immediately realized something, her expression instantly changing.\nA guy who wasn't a ghost came to the bookstore and told a ghost story?\nAnd the boss took the old Taoist to the school?\n\n\"Has anyone new come to Tongcheng recently?\" the little loli asked.\n\n\"The one from Rongcheng has been here.\"\n\nUpon hearing this, the little loli's face showed unconcealed horror, but she quickly suppressed it and asked, \"Anyone else?\"\n\nBai Yingying pondered, and then she suddenly remembered the little girl who said she came from Sanxiang Village that day, and how that little girl had actually knocked her down and tied her up.\n\n\"It seems there really was one, very powerful, the kind that could knock me down in an instant. Oh, by the way, you haven't said, how did this thing come about?\"\nBai Yingying pointed at Sun Qiu and asked.\n\n\"Every Inspector, when advancing to a Judge, is granted a Yin-Yang Brush by the Underworld—it can determine destiny, it can discern right from wrong. And there's also a Yin-Yang Tome, which contains Yin and Yang.\nThis thing should have been born from within the Yin-Yang Tome... a puppet.\"\n\nAfter saying that,\nthe little loli suddenly looked up and burst into laughter,\n\"Hahahahahahaha...\"\nA little loli,\nwith her hands on her hips,\nburst into loud laughter.\nShe seemed to want to create a heroic feeling, but in reality, her pose was utterly comical and adorably chuunibyou.\n\n\"So, the boss is in danger?\" Bai Yingying asked.\n\nThe little loli shrugged, then looked at Bai Yingying and said, \"Shouldn't we be happy? If someone kills him, then you and I will both be free.\"\nYes,\nif Zhou Ze were killed,\nthen the little loli could break that night's truce and regain her freedom!\n\n\"Have you forgotten what kind of person the boss is?\" Bai Yingying suddenly asked.\n\n\"What?\" The little loli was confused.\n\n\"If the boss knows he can't escape, and he's really going to die... given his personality, he might feel too lonely dying alone. Then, at the moment before his death, he might crush your soul-blood and make you accompany him in martyrdom.\"\n\n\"...\" The little loli.",

    "content": "Xiao Pingtou's head was impaled with a shard of glass, like a headdress, and blood slowly began to seep down.\n\nHe stood for several seconds, then staggered a few steps before collapsing amidst the screams of those around him.\n\nZhou Ze had once read some memoirs from Japanese war criminals and soldiers, in which someone had written that headless bodies would still twitch after decapitation, and even eyes in severed heads could move a few times.\n\nPerhaps death came too suddenly, and too swiftly; not only did the person involved not have time to react, but even their body seemed unable to make a timely response.\n\nDownstairs in the dormitory building, chaos had erupted.\n\nZhou Ze leaned his hands on the railing, sighed, and then looked at the old Daoist.\n\nThe old Daoist was currently dazed, his face deathly pale from fright.\n\n\"Boss...\"\n\n\"Ah, see? A perfectly fine person, you practically jinxed him to death.\"\n\n\"...\" The old Daoist.\n\nThe old Daoist felt very wronged; he didn't want this either. He genuinely hoped Xiao Pingtou would live a long life, be hale and hearty, and \"come eighteen times a night.\"\n\nBut he died.\n\nHe died so abruptly.\n\nSo,\n\nOnly one painting remained out of six.\n\nThere was a famous film series called \"Final Destination.\" The old Daoist now felt like a character in it, being explicitly told that he would die, and how he would die.\n\nTruly, it would be better to just die quickly and painlessly in a sudden accident.\n\nAt this moment, the old Daoist actually felt a bit envious of Xiao Pingtou, who had simply died in an unexpected incident without knowing. Now he had to endure the torment of not knowing when he would die.\n\nIt was simply... a fate worse than death.\n\nHe looked at his boss beside him, who was still smoking.\n\n\"Let's go down and see.\"\n\nZhou Ze said, walking out of the dormitory first. The old Daoist naturally didn't dare leave Zhou Ze at this point. He had already made up his mind that he would stick close to Zhou Ze, even if he went to the restroom.\n\nAt the main entrance of the dormitory building, a group of students surrounded Xiao Pingtou's body, and several dorm supervisors were maintaining order.\n\nThe feeling was very strange because at this time, they should be calling 120 and 110. In fact, they had called and done what needed to be done, but it seemed such a major incident—a death in broad daylight—only affected a corner of the school.\n\nThe students in front went to class if they were supposed to, or to the cafeteria for breakfast, as if they didn't care about the incident at all.\n\nZhou Ze flicked his cigarette ash and looked up at the dormitory building.\n\nThe old Daoist was trembling beside him, stealing glances at Xiao Pingtou's body before quickly averting his gaze. The thought of soon following in his footsteps filled the old Daoist with immense dread.\n\nZhou Ze sat down on the steps like an observer, continuing to watch everything around him.\n\n\"Boss, should we go back first?\" the old Daoist suggested.\n\nHe didn't want to stay here anymore; he wanted to return to the bookstore. At least the bookstore could give him some sense of security.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. \"Can't leave.\"\n\nIt wasn't a reply of \"no, we won't go,\" but \"we can't go.\"\n\nThe old Daoist froze, vaguely sensing something was amiss.\n\nZhou Ze turned around and re-entered the dormitory. He went directly into the dorm supervisor's office, found a place to sit, and brewed a cup of tea using their tea leaves.\n\nThe old Daoist stood beside him like a small quail.\n\nHe didn't know what Zhou Ze was planning, but it seemed his boss had grasped some information. Although he didn't know if he was feigning calm or truly calm, at least it gave him a bit more hope.\n\nThe students had all gone to class, and the dormitory building had become much quieter.\n\nThe dorm supervisors hadn't returned either; none of them were back in the office. Perhaps they were busy with Xiao Pingtou's body.\n\nThe police hadn't come.\n\nThe ambulance hadn't come either.\n\nAfter sitting for about half an hour and drinking two cups of tea, Zhou Ze left the office.\n\nAt the entrance of each dormitory room in the hallway, a row of thermoses was placed. Students would take their thermoses out and leave them there before going to class in the morning, and a special auntie would come with a plastic hose to fill these thermoses with boiling water.\n\nBecause this boiling water passed through plastic hoses, it inevitably had a bit of a plastic taste. Students generally didn't drink it, only using it for washing clothes or soaking their feet.\n\nAt that moment, an auntie came with a plastic water gun, preparing to dispense water. She slowly walked from one end of the corridor to the other.\n\nZhou Ze stood there motionless. The old Daoist stood beside Zhou Ze, and the auntie seemed to not see Zhou Ze at all, continuing to walk towards them.\n\n\"Old Daoist, don't you think something's strange? There are too many odd things in this place,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\n\"First, Sun Qiu died but continued to live out of inertia, and no one noticed even when corpse spots appeared on his body. Then there's one accident after another, one bizarre scene after another.\n\nIs this dormitory building a once-in-a-century land of extreme malevolence, which is why so many ghosts and strange entities can emerge?\n\nThen why was there no activity before, but it has suddenly erupted recently?\"\n\n\"Uh... Boss, what exactly do you mean?\"\n\nZhou Ze was silent for a moment, thought about it, and then said, \"I think we should go back.\"\n\n\"Alright.\"\n\nThe old Daoist was more than willing. Regardless of whether he would encounter an accident, if he had to choose between dying here or dying in the bookstore, he would rather choose the latter.\n\nThe two walked together towards the dormitory building entrance. Outside, Xiao Pingtou's body had already been taken care of.\n\nZhou Ze stood on the steps at the entrance, not rushing to go down, but watching the old Daoist walk out step by step.\n\nAs the old Daoist was about to exit the dormitory building's perimeter,\n\nZhou Ze looked up,\n\nHe saw,\n\nThe building was bending,\n\nAs if it were about to collapse.\n\nThe old Daoist, however, was completely unaware and continued walking.\n\n\"Old Daoist, stop,\" Zhou Ze warned.\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\nThe old Daoist took another step out, then turned his head.\n\nIn an instant, from a certain dormitory window above, blood gushed out, sweeping towards the old Daoist. This should be the dormitory where Zhou Ze had been before and found the pen sketch; it should be on the third floor, but now, because of the bizarre bending of the entire building, the window of that dormitory was directly facing the old Daoist.\n\nWhen the blood rushed over, the old Daoist was completely engulfed.\n\n\"F***...\"\n\nThis was the last word the old Daoist managed to utter.\n\nHe was practically on the verge of collapse.\n\nIt didn't matter how many ghosts came; ghosts, he'd seen them before.\n\nBut this building could bend like it was pole dancing.\n\nWho had ever seen that?\n\nDamn it,\n\nYou can't play like this!\n\nZhou Ze turned around and looked at the woman behind him who was still pouring boiling water into the thermos.\n\nHowever, this bottle of boiling water from the woman seemed to never fill up, remaining perpetually above the thermos, with the sound of water continuously emanating from within.\n\nFor those with life experience, the sound changes as the water level rises when pouring boiling water into a thermos, but here, it remained unchanged.\n\n\"Hey, the thermos is leaking.\"\n\nZhou Ze pointed at the thermos, reminding the woman.\n\nThe woman froze slightly, turned her head, and looked at Zhou Ze. Her face was densely covered with \"hornet's nests,\" like countless corns, and some areas were involuntarily closing and expanding.\n\nA very disgusting sight,\n\nTruly disgusting.\n\nThe woman continued to grip the plastic water hose, while the old Daoist outside the dormitory building struggled ceaselessly in the blood. In the blood, several dark figures were vaguely visible slowly approaching him, and in their hands, they held gleaming broadswords.\n\nZhou Ze walked over, preparing to take the hose from the woman's hand.\n\nA ghastly smile appeared on the woman's face.\n\nThe hose immediately twisted, wrapping around Zhou Ze. The inanimate object from before now seemed to have transformed into a living python!\n\nZhou Ze's fingernails grew long.\n\nHe didn't resist the python, allowing it to bind him. He could even hear the crisp snapping of his bones.\n\nHonestly,\n\nIt was somewhat pleasant to hear.\n\nIn the distance, at the hallway entrance, the boy with half a body began to crawl towards them again, wriggling like a mad dog, roaring something.\n\nOn the other side, Sun Qiu, covered in corpse spots, also stumbled towards them, dazed.\n\nXiao Pingtou also appeared, the glass still impaled in his head, blood flowing.\n\nEven the leather shoe that Zhou Ze had destroyed somehow reappeared, making incessant \"drip-drop\" sounds.\n\n\"Is the dagger finally revealed, because you know I've seen through you?\"\n\nZhou Ze muttered to himself.\n\nIn the distance,\n\nThe old Daoist had already submerged in the blood, with only occasional bubbles rising from his nose, clearly indicating he couldn't hold on much longer.\n\nThose dark figures seemed to be closing in on him, and within the blood, a small figure, not human, like a cat, waited for its dinner.\n\nZhou Ze's fingernails didn't sweep around.\n\nInstead, with a decisive and resolute motion, he plunged them directly into his own chest, then twisted them around.\n\n\"Hiss...\"\n\nThe pain was so clear, Zhou Ze's body even began to convulse because of it.\n\nBut at this moment, the surrounding scene began to retreat rapidly. The woman retreated, Xiao Pingtou and the dorm supervisors retreated, the half-bodied boy retreated, the leather shoe began to retreat, and even the bending dormitory building began to return to normal.\n\nEverything, everything seemed to be returning to normal.\n\nDuring this rapid retreat of everything,\n\nZhou Ze seemed to see a girl standing deep in the hallway, looking at him. The girl's appearance was somewhat familiar.\n\n\"Snap!\"\n\nA crisp sound echoed.\n\nThe sound of a book being closed.\n\n\"Thump... pant, pant, pant... cough, cough...\"\n\nThe old Daoist lay prostrate on the lawn, gasping for air and coughing violently, his hands clutching his neck tightly. It took him a while to calm down, then he looked around with a bewildered expression.\n\nHe saw Zhou Ze standing beside him, holding a closed notebook.\n\nThe crisp sound earlier was Zhou Ze closing the notebook.\n\nZhou Ze looked up, still feeling a lingering pain in his chest.\n\n\"Boss... what happened?\" The old Daoist thought he had just died, but how did things suddenly take such a turn?\n\n\"You can think carefully about how we got in,\" Zhou Ze said slowly.\n\n\"We drove here. I tricked the security guard at the school gate to let us in, then we got out of the car, walked to the living area, found Building B, and then we snuck in and saw Sun Qiu, and then we even fought with the dorm supervisor...\"\n\n\"Think carefully again,\" Zhou Ze reminded.\n\n\"Think carefully?\" The old Daoist scratched his head, then a look of shock appeared on his face. \"I... I... we did drive in, but as soon as we got out of the car, we seemed to see a black cat. That black cat was staring at us in the lawn, and I even said we should catch it and keep it as a pet.\n\nThen we walked to the lawn and found the black cat was gone, but there was a notebook on the ground. Boss, you picked up the notebook, and I even asked you what was written or drawn in it... and then... and then we...\"\n\nZhou Ze looked at the slightly worn notebook in his hand,\n\nHe didn't dare to turn any page again.\n\n\"Boss, where's that dormitory building?\" The old Daoist scanned his surroundings, realizing something seemed to be missing.\n\n\"Look at the other dorm buildings nearby. How are they labeled?\"\n\n\"Building 1, Building 2, Building 3...\" The old Daoist counted, then he slowly stopped counting. The buildings here were numbered with Arabic numerals; there was no naming system using English letters!\n\n\"Boss... then Building B, where is Building B?\"\n\nZhou Ze pointed to the notebook in his hand,\n\n\"Building B,\n\nIt's in here,\n\nIt's drawn.\"",

    "content": "It was almost dawn, which meant Zhou Ze and the old Taoist had been standing still on the lawn for a very long time.\n\nFortunately, there were hardly any people walking around the dormitories at this hour, so no one noticed the two men standing there like idiots.\n\nOtherwise, if something unexpected were to happen, there would be no way to attend to it. Just like Tie Guai Li* possessed the dead beggar's body because his own body encountered an accident when his spirit was wandering.\n\nThe old Taoist got into the car, took out the bruise liniment, and rubbed his knees. At this moment, he was a bit disoriented. The previous illusion and the current reality, two feelings that were hard to distinguish, kept assailing him. He couldn't tell which of his aches were real and which were imagined.\n\nIt was like a person feeling disoriented by gravity after just getting out of the water after swimming.\n\nZhou Ze also sat in the passenger seat. In front of him was the notebook.\n\nThe notebook cover was blue, very understated and ordinary.\n\n\"Boss, what exactly happened? How did looking at a notebook turn into that?\"\n\nThe old Taoist had always been curious about this. For some unknown reason, a part of his and the boss's memory after entering the school had been erased, and they had directly entered Block B.\n\nBut in fact,\n\nBlock B didn't exist,\n\nthe dorm supervisor inside didn't exist, the boy with half a body, Zhao Baogang walking upside down, the aunt refilling thermoses with hot water, and so on, none of them actually existed.\n\nBut that feeling of non-existence that was extremely real, that subconscious \"seamless transition,\" it was truly terrifying.\n\n\"Heard of *Painted Skin*?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"The movie, I've seen it,\" the old Taoist replied.\n\n\"It's a story from *Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio*.\" Zhou Ze leaned his head against the headrest. \"It's pretty much the same thing. But in that story, people entered the world of a wall painting, while this time, we entered the world inside this notebook. If I'm not mistaken, the notebook should contain some ink drawings. Everything we saw in that dormitory building was drawn in there.\"\n\n\"Is it that exaggerated?\"\n\n\"Now there's only one question: what the hell is that Sun Qiu?\"\n\nIf Zhou Ze still hadn't realized the problem with Sun Qiu by this point, he would have truly wasted his time.\n\nFrom that guy entering the bookstore and telling the story to himself and the old Taoist entering Pingchao Middle School and being led by a black cat to find this notebook, the whole thing was interconnected.\n\nSomeone was guiding and manipulating behind the scenes, seemingly waiting for all of this to happen.\n\nThis feeling was very uncomfortable. Normal people didn't want to be someone else's puppet.\n\nAnd the scene of the girl deep in the hallway that he saw when he \"closed\" the notebook reminded him of the little girl from Sanxiang Village. She was naive, she was very hungry, and she was very well-behaved.\n\nBai Yingying was even directly knocked down and tied up by the other party.\n\nBefore, Zhou Ze had thought the other party was some elusive expert who did good deeds anonymously, but who knew, she wasn't that simple after all.\n\nZhou Ze could guess the purpose of the six ink drawings found in the dormitory building, especially the one about the old Taoist.\n\nPaintings, like movies, were all fake and not strictly existent. The scenes and characters in the paintings could naturally be unrestrained.\n\nFor example, the dormitory building could bend, and the ghosts appearing one after another inside could do so without any logic or reason. But fakes were fakes; how could they become real?\n\nBy having a living person die inside, by having a real living person die in a fake world, starting from a point and spreading out, it could give originally fake things the ability to influence reality.\n\nLike some financing scams, their hype and all their promotions were basically fake, but they could attract funding in reality, defrauding vast amounts of money. In the end, whether it was real or fake no longer mattered; it had successfully caused chaos in reality.\n\nAnd because he himself was a \"dead person,\" not a living one, the protagonist of that painting became the old Taoist.\n\nZhou Ze reached out and rubbed his forehead. Honestly, this matter was a bit disjointed, and the feeling of being watched and schemed against was unpleasant.\n\n\"Meow!\"\n\nA cat's meow sounded. The old Taoist, who was in the driver's seat applying medicinal wine, froze suddenly and quickly looked out the window. On a nearby overpass, a black cat squatted there, its eyes like sapphires, looking this way.\n\n\"Damn it, this cat's out again.\"\n\nThe old Taoist was quite sensitive to cats. He now recalled that the reason he had suggested catching that black cat back then was because his previous boss had a white cat, and he felt that if Zhou Ze had a black cat, it could effectively boost his image.\n\nZhou Ze got out of the car and looked over, still holding the notebook. On the back of the book was a sticker of a black cat's head.\n\nThe black cat was nearly a hundred meters away from Zhou Ze. It licked its paws, seemingly still not satisfied. Just now, it had been so close to getting a taste of the old Taoist.\n\nZhou Ze didn't run over to catch the cat, nor did he bother to play hide-and-seek with it. He took out his lighter, flicked a flame, and held the bottom of the notebook to it.\n\nScrew your schemes,\n\nI'll just burn it down!\n\nThe black cat froze. It seemed it hadn't expected Zhou Ze to react this way. Its body tensed, then it leaped over directly. The black figure almost flew across the cement road, pouncing on Zhou Ze.\n\nAs expected,\n\nwas this black cat like the spirit of this notebook?\n\n\"Buzz!\"\n\nZhou Ze's left fingernails grew long, and he directly clawed at the black cat pouncing on him.\n\n\"Pfft!\"\n\nThe black cat was sent flying by Zhou Ze, landing on the ground. Its body began to become ethereal, appearing very uncomfortable. It was far weaker than Zhou Ze had anticipated.\n\n\"Hey, are you really going to burn it?\"\n\nA girl's voice came from behind Zhou Ze. Zhou Ze turned around and saw a little girl sitting on top of his car, swinging her legs, as if watching a play.\n\nShe was indeed watching a play, watching from beginning to end.\n\nThe old Taoist poked his head out of the car. Before he could look up, a foot stepped directly on him.\n\n\"Ah, that hurts!\"\n\nThe old Taoist cried out in pain and pulled his head back in.\n\nIt was truly the old Taoist's own fault. The girl was sitting on the car, swinging her legs. If he poked his head out and looked up, wouldn't he expose everything?\n\n\"Who exactly are you?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"I just passed by, and I'm leaving Tongcheng soon. I just want to remind you that this notebook is much more valuable than you think. It's just been contaminated and was accidentally picked up by a student who can draw, and then they drew all those ghost stories about the dormitory on it.\n\nCoupled with being permeated by the students' resentment and negative emotions in this school, it became that way.\n\nBut its function is actually much higher than this; its use is definitely not limited to VR glasses.\"\n\n\"Why should I believe you?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nThe little girl jumped off the car and walked in front of Zhou Ze.\n\nA half-smile,\n\nHer eyes were like stars, completely different from the naive little girl from Sanxiang Village who had come into his bookstore before.\n\n\"Hehe, so much fun. You look so funny.\"\n\nThe little girl reached out, wanting to touch Zhou Ze's face.\n\nZhou Ze's eyes narrowed slightly, but he didn't resist or refuse.\n\nHer palm was very cold, and honestly, not very comfortable.\n\nAs the little girl stroked, she looked up and let out a long breath. \"Do you know, this is a judge's artifact, a fallen-grade Yin-Yang Scroll.\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head, indicating he didn't know.\n\nHe was still a temporary worker.\n\nOnly after becoming a full-time ghost messenger could he be considered official, and then he would have to slowly work his way up to captain, then inspector, and only after that, judge.\n\nIt could be said that the \"judge\" level was too distant for Zhou Ze right now.\n\n\"If I hadn't isolated the scroll's influence, only confining it to one dormitory building, how long do you think it would have taken you to realize that what you were seeing was actually a painting? That the place you were in was actually fake?\"\n\nThe little girl seemed to be talking to herself,\n\n\"I'm leaving. That ring last time and this notebook, consider them my gifts to you. Keep them safe; you'll probably need them later.\"\n\nThe little girl reached out and grabbed forward. The black cat that Zhou Ze had just sent flying transformed into a black light and flew into the girl's palm. Then, the little girl sent it into the notebook.\n\nAt the same time, Sun Qiu, who had been reading in the bookstore, instantly disappeared. The book he had been holding fell to the ground.\n\n\"Keep it safe. Although this thing is badly damaged now, it's still somewhat useful. Later, you can even put some ghosts in it.\n\nLike a beautiful ghost or something, then you can go in and look whenever you want. The experience will definitely blow away current VR adult technology.\"\n\nThe little girl retracted her hand and looked at Zhou Ze carefully again.\n\n\"I'm going down. It'll be hard to come up next time. You can also try to keep a low profile, but there's no need to shortchange yourself. Forget it, you seem to have gotten used to it after your last life anyway.\"\n\n\"You know me?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Uh-huh, do you still think the you of your past life is the real you?\" the little girl retorted.\n\n\"If you want to talk to me about past lives or something, that's too cliché and melodramatic,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Then let me tell you an even more melodramatic story. I do know the you from your past life.\" The little girl blinked, looking at Zhou Ze,\n\n\"And then, you raped me.\"\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze.\n\n\"How's that, melodramatic?\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"Were you that small then?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nHe wanted to know if he had been that beastly in his past life.\n\nThe little girl bent over with laughter,\n\nAnd then slowly began to grow up.\n\nA thin black mist enveloped her,\n\nMaking her face unclear, but she indeed transformed into the appearance of an adult woman.\n\nZhou Ze felt a little relieved mentally.\n\nGood,\n\nNot that beastly.\n\nHowever,\n\nWhat Zhou Ze couldn't see was that the woman's face within the black mist was a wrinkled, chilling old hag's face.\n\nThe old hag wore a dark golden robe and a phoenix crown, exuding endless elegance. Only that face was extremely mismatched with her figure and aura, like a perfect work of art that had been brutally ruined and distorted.\n\n\"I'll wait for you. I'll slowly wait for you to climb step by step, until the day you return to the Underworld to be conferred, until you can remember some things from your past life.\"\n\n\"Don't do that. You'll make me feel like I'm on the wrong set. We're not filming *Chinese Paladin*.\"\n\n\"At that time, I'll torture and kill you again, personally throwing you into the Animal Path. Only then will I get the pleasure of revenge.\n\nYou're growing too slowly, so slowly that I can't stand it. I can only appear to give you a few good things to make you fatten up faster.\"\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze.\n\nSuddenly, he felt that it would be better to have actually been on the wrong set than this.\n\n\"Hehehe...\"\n\nThe woman's figure and the surrounding black mist vanished in an instant, merging into the ground.\n\nShe left,\n\nVery decisively.\n\nThe car door opened, and the old Taoist, with a clear footprint on his face, rubbed his face and got out.\n\nHe snorted discontentedly at the spot where the woman had disappeared:\n\n\"Heh, women.\"\n\n---\n*Tie Guai Li (鐵拐李): One of the Eight Immortals in Chinese mythology. He is often depicted with an iron crutch and a gourd. His origin story includes his spirit leaving his body and returning to find it gone, thus having to possess a dead beggar's body.",

    "content": "On the way back, Zhou Ze drove. Old Dao, in his current state, was not suitable for driving.\n\n\"Boss, is that woman really a karmic debt from your past life?\"\n\n\"What did you hear?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Uh, don't worry, Boss, I'll keep your secret!\" Old Dao immediately patted his scrawny chest.\n\n\"Dead men tell no tales.\"\n\n\"............\" Old Dao.\n\n\"Screech............\"\n\nThe car braked sharply and stopped.\n\nOld Dao jumped in fright,\nHoly cow,\nIs he really going to kill me to silence me?\n\nZhou Ze habitually reached for a cigarette but found he was out. He looked at Old Dao, wanting to ask him for one, only to find Old Dao clutching his knees, trembling.\n\nWas he really that scared?\n\nZhou Ze reached out and patted Old Dao's shoulder,\n\"Hey.\"\n\n\"Ah!\"\n\nOld Dao yelped, looking at Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze found it a bit funny. Was his usual image really that bad, making Old Dao think he would kill him to silence him?\n\n\"Give me a cigarette.\"\n\n\"Oh, okay.\"\n\nOld Dao immediately pulled out a cigarette and handed it to Zhou Ze, then personally lit it for him, cautiously and carefully like an ancient maid, though this maid was a bit too old.\n\n\"Boss, why did you stop the car?\"\n\n\"Stop pretending. Is acting that much fun?\"\n\n\"Uh............\"\n\nOld Dao rolled his eyes internally. Is it easy to serve a heartless B like you!\n\nOld Dao sometimes couldn't understand himself. Why did he always have to deal with a ghost boss instead of living a carefree life? But then he felt relieved, perhaps this was life.\nPerhaps,\nThis was what it meant to be a man.\nIf you didn't seek out some excitement and challenges when you were full of energy, how boring would life be?\nBesides, this current life was something he had never experienced before, and most ordinary people wouldn't either.\n\n\"Boss, why did you stop?\" Old Dao finally asked.\n\n\"To eat breakfast.\"\n\nZhou Ze said, pushed open the car door, and got out.\n\nEat breakfast?\nBoss, did you bring any money? I didn't.\n\nAhead was a row of breakfast stalls, selling Jianbing (Chinese crepes), noodles, steamed buns, and Youtiao (fried dough sticks). This was a small intersection with a lot of traffic, and many people stopped their cars here to eat something.\n\nZhou Ze walked up to a meat soup vendor. The vendor was a middle-aged man.\n\n\"Two bowls of beef soup,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Alright, want it spicy?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\nThe vendor first took out two bowls, put green onions and cilantro in them, then some beef;\nAfterward, he scooped a ladle of soup from a pot kept hot by a coal stove, poured it into the bowls, then poured the soup back into the pot, and then added various seasonings to the bowls before filling them with soup again. He then placed the two bowls on a small table to the side for Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze added more chili to his bowl, ordered two flatbreads, and sat down.\n\nOld Dao arrived then, too. He sat next to Zhou Ze, rubbing his hands, a bit constrained and a bit flattered. Damn, this was the boss's first time treating him!\nThis cheapskate actually treated him!\nShould I cry a little to set the mood?\n\nOld Dao kept having self-destructive thoughts, then saw Zhou Ze methodically tearing the flatbread into pieces and soaking them in the soup bowl.\n\nOld Dao followed suit. Old Dao had traveled extensively in his life and was no stranger to this kind of breakfast. The boss's accent immediately told him he was from Henan.\nAnd for many Henan people, the morning often began with a bowl of soup.\n\nHowever, Old Dao didn't drink or touch it. He just silently watched Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze felt a bit uncomfortable under his gaze and said, \"What's wrong, don't like it?\"\n\n\"No, no, no, I like it, I like it.\"\n\nOld Dao responded evasively, perfunctorily.\nThis soup,\nDefinitely problematic!\nStopping suddenly to eat breakfast was already suspicious, and he was even seriously tearing up the flatbread, looking so formal about it.\n\nOld Dao turned his head and glanced at the vendor again,\nIs this vendor a ghost?\nThen this soup is definitely not clean!\n\nOld Dao felt he had seen through everything. MMP, the boss was up to his tricks again, just like when he told me to leave the dorm building first, and then watched the building bend.\nThis time, he's definitely messing with me again!\nWaiting for me to drink this soup and make a fool of myself!\n\n\"It's a bit hot, I'll drink it later,\" Old Dao explained.\n\nZhou Ze nodded and continued tearing the flatbread in his hand.\n\nOld Dao was actually a bit hungry. He glanced at the vendor again, then stood up and said, \"Boss, this isn't enough. I'm going to buy two steamed buns from across the street.\"\n\nWith that, Old Dao ran across the small road, bought a few plain steamed buns, sat back down, picked up a bun, and bit into it directly, eating with relish.\nDamn,\nEating something you bought yourself is just reassuring, and delicious!\nAnd the *mantou* (steamed buns) on that saleslady's chest were also very big.\n\nAs Old Dao ate, he offered a bun to Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze took the bun, placed it next to his soup bowl, and then looked at Old Dao with a half-smile.\n\nHuh,\nWhy is he looking at me like that?\n\nOld Dao began to murmur to himself again,\nNo way,\nYou're not happy that I didn't fall into your trap and didn't drink this soup?\nHow can you be like this!\nSo, should I drink a little?\n\nOld Dao thought while chewing his bun. It was truly like accompanying a tiger king; none of these ghost bigshots were easy to deal with.\nHowever, this seemingly fragrant soup in front of him—who knew what it actually was? If it were something like grilled centipede or roasted mouse, he might be able to eat it, but the unknown fear of not knowing what it was at all was truly terrifying.\n\n\"Boss, eat. This steamed bun is really delicious,\" Old Dao said with a laugh.\n\nZhou Ze picked up the bun he had just placed on the table and said, \"The table isn't clean; the bun is dirty.\"\n\n\"Then I'll eat this one. I'm not particular; don't waste it.\"\n\nOld Dao took the bun from Zhou Ze's hand and continued to chew on it. Anyway, he wasn't going to drink that meat soup!\nAt worst, he'd find another excuse, saying he was full from the buns and couldn't drink anymore.\n\nZhou Ze looked at Old Dao and shook his head.\n\nHeh,\nDisappointed, aren't you?\nDidn't get your way, did you?\nAm I smart?\nAre you helpless?\n\nOld Dao felt smug.\n\nThen, Old Dao watched Zhou Ze lower his head, pick up the soup bowl, take a sip of soup, then use his chopsticks to pick out a piece of meat and chew it.\nIt was clear that even with a lot of chili and a strong flavor, Zhou Ze still ate with great difficulty and swallowed painfully, which was consistent with Zhou Ze's usual eating patterns.\nHowever, what surprised Old Dao was that the boss actually drank the soup?\nCould it be that he was overthinking things?\nWas there nothing wrong with this soup?\nOld Dao didn't believe Zhou Ze would sacrifice himself just to trick him.\nWas I overly suspicious?\n\nOld Dao watched Zhou Ze continue to painfully drink the soup and eat the flatbread, and finally confirmed that there was nothing wrong with the soup; he had overreacted!\nImmediately, Old Dao also lowered his head and took a sip of soup.\nMmm, very authentic, the flavor is great, absolutely delicious.\nDamn, I almost choked on the bun just now.\n\nOld Dao ate freely and joyfully. Even in the cities of Henan, it was hard to find an authentic soup shop, and to find one with such authentic flavor in Tongcheng, especially on the roadside, was even more precious.\nWith the soup, Old Dao finished both the buns and the flatbread. He even refilled his soup once. Hmm, no charge for refills, very authentic.\n\nZhou Ze ate a third of his bowl, couldn't eat anymore, put down his chopsticks, and sat there.\n\nAfter eating, Old Dao patted his stomach, feeling a bit unsatisfied. Had he not eaten enough?\nAs he wondered whether to order another bowl, Zhou Ze made a gesture for his wallet.\nOld Dao understood immediately, got up, and paid the bill. He had that much discernment.\n\nStanding up, Old Dao took the car keys from the table first and said, \"Boss, I'll drive back. You must be tired.\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. \"You've also had a tough time. I'll drive.\"\n\nThe boss had changed,\nHe had really changed!\nNot only did he treat his subordinates to breakfast and soup, but he also knew how to be considerate of them!\n\nOld Dao hesitated, wondering whether to shed a few tears and take the opportunity to express his loyalty to heighten the atmosphere, when Zhou Ze walked towards the road. Old Dao naturally followed, and then, Old Dao saw Zhou Ze stop in front of the stall where he had just bought the steamed buns.\n\nHeh heh,\nI told you the vendor lady's *mantou* (steamed buns) were big, didn't I? Boss, you hypocrite, Yingying's aren't small either, you can look whenever you want.\nHeh, men,\nHomegrown flowers never smell as sweet as wildflowers.\n\nOld Dao's mind raced with thoughts. He felt that after contact with that person from his past life, the boss seemed to have changed, becoming more down-to-earth.\n\n\"Boss, what filling do you want for your steamed buns? Or just plain white ones?\" The vendor lady asked enthusiastically.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head and pointed at the vendor lady.\n\nDamn it, you beast! We're just looking, and you're already flirting! Do you want to buy the vendor lady's steamed buns?\nOld Dao watched excitedly as the boss flirted.\nHuh, didn't I hear the boss couldn't get it up?\n\n\"Boss, what do you want?\" the vendor lady asked.\n\n\"You, come with me, to where you belong,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nOld Dao froze,\nCrap,\nOld Dao had a bad feeling!\nNo way?\nSeriously?\nIt can't be, can it?\nImpossible, right?\n\nThe vendor lady pursed her lips, and her voice suddenly deepened a bit, saying, \"I died young from illness. My wife is raising three children alone, working two jobs a day, and still coming out to sell breakfast. It's too hard.\nThat's why I thought I'd possess her in the morning, to let her rest a bit.\"\n\nThe voice was still a woman's, but it had clearly changed to another person's tone, likely her husband's.\n\n\"Everyone is pitiful, but don't act pitiful yourself. Possessing your wife severely harms her lifespan.\"\n\nSaying that, Zhou Ze opened the steamer and took out a steamed bun. He gently pressed his thumbnail into it.\n\"Besides, selling these steamed buns to deceive the money of the living, even if it's for your children's tuition, aren't you afraid of harming their yin virtue?\"\n\nThe steamed bun in Zhou Ze's hand slowly began to change,\nTurning into a paper-mâché bun-shaped object, the filling inside was actually a messy, black paste.\n\nOld Dao, to the side, immediately started to vomit:\n\"Ugh!\"",

    "content": "The old Taoist priest was throwing up beside them, everything he had just eaten came back up, a truly miserable sight. On the ground was a puddle of red, white, and yellow, a colorful mess, like a sauce shop had opened.\n\nTears welled in his eyes. The old Taoist priest was filled with regret and hatred. How could he be so unlucky?\n\nWith a thousand precautions and ten thousand careful steps, he thought he had avoided one pit, but he hadn't expected that he would foolishly and freely jump into an even bigger abyss.\n\nWhile jumping, he had even shouted:\n\n\"So weightless!\"\n\n\"Leave her body and come with me,\" Zhou Ze urged. He was the last one; once he sent him back to hell, he could become a regular employee.\n\nPerhaps this was a case of \"what one seeks with diligence is found without effort.\" He had been busy for a long time at the school, even the so-called \"karma from a past life\" had appeared, but he hadn't caught a single genuine ghost. Then, on his way back, he found him (her).\n\nThe woman looked dejected, as if resigned to her fate, but she still spoke:\n\n\"I want to stay with her a little longer. She is willing too. We can still meet in our dreams every night. I can still see my three children.\"\n\nZhou Ze was unmoved. Every dead person has their own lingering attachment to the human world. This is a characteristic of all intelligent life forms; there's always a survival instinct that compels them to seize any opportunity to stay.\n\nEven Zhou Ze himself was the same, but understanding was one thing, rules were another.\n\nMoreover, if this husband's ghost remained in the woman, her body would soon become overwhelmed and develop problems. In the end, it would only cause harm to both.\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nThe woman suddenly pushed aside the stall in front of her, sending the steaming baskets tumbling towards Zhou Ze. Then, she directly turned and began to flee. She wanted to escape; she didn't want to be caught.\n\nZhou Ze pushed aside the steaming baskets. With a light flick of his fingernail, an invisible black mist was released, directly entangling the woman.\n\nThe woman let out a muffled groan and fell to the ground.\n\nZhou Ze took a few steps forward, approached the woman, knelt down, and placed his hand on her forehead. Immediately, a wisp of black ghost was pulled out by Zhou Ze.\n\nIt was a man's face. The man struggled continuously and roared furiously, filled with intense unwillingness and hysteria.\n\n\"She's willing! She's willing to stay with me! She told me in her dreams at night that we would raise the children together! She's willing!\"\n\nThe man argued for himself, then glared at Zhou Ze:\n\n\"She's willing, so why are you meddling?\"\n\n\"I need performance,\" Zhou Ze stated frankly. Ultimately, he needed performance, and he was only one point away now. He had waited several days, so he had no choice but to take him back to complete his task and become a regular employee.\n\nThe man was stunned. Zhou Ze's frank admission that it was for profit left him speechless, because he knew that no matter how much he argued or debated, it wouldn't soften the other party's heart.\n\n\"Let me go home and see my three children again,\" the man pleaded.\n\n\"This time, I promise I won't leave or run away.\"\n\n\"You are not qualified to bargain with me, and I am not making a show.\"\n\n\"My family... there's also... a ghost!\"\n\n\"Alright then, it's only right to let you go home and see them before you leave. There's human kindness beyond the law, right?\"\n\nThe old Taoist priest, who had just finished throwing up, suddenly felt like throwing up again when he heard this.\n\nBut he held back.\n\nHe didn't dare.\n\nThe woman woke up, but she was a little groggy. The old Taoist priest helped her back. Being possessed by a ghost, even if it was her own husband, caused considerable damage to both body and spirit.\n\nFollowing the male ghost's guidance, Zhou Ze started walking towards his home.\n\nThe old Taoist priest was an active person. Although he had joked about the size of her buns earlier, he wasn't so low as to take advantage of the situation now. The woman was already pitiful enough, and he couldn't do such beastly things. So, he simply started chatting with the male ghost:\n\n\"Brother, where are you from? Your wife's accent doesn't sound local.\"\n\nTongcheng dialect is very distinctive; its recognition rate is too high because it's fundamentally on a different channel from Mandarin. However, some local dialects are sometimes so similar to Mandarin that locals unconsciously infuse their Mandarin with a dialectal flavor.\n\n\"Sichuan,\" the man replied.\n\nAt this point, he had somewhat come to terms with it and felt a little relieved. The key was Zhou Ze's attitude, which was truly too different from the compassionate Taoist priests and monks he used to see on television.\n\n\"Then how did you die?\" the old Taoist priest asked again.\n\n\"Died comfortably.\"\n\n\"How did you die comfortably?\" the old Taoist priest pressed.\n\n\"Drug overdose.\"\n\n\"Uh...\" The old Taoist priest immediately became interested, asking like a curious child, \"What does it feel like to take that stuff? Is it really amazing?\"\n\nZhou Ze glanced at the old Taoist priest, who stuck out his tongue and dared not say another word.\n\n\"Heh, of course, it's very comfortable, so comfortable it makes you feel like you're in heaven and hell,\" the male ghost replied.\n\n\"So comfortable that you turned into a ghost, and your family fortune was squandered?\" Zhou Ze began to add insult to injury.\n\nAs a doctor in his previous life, Zhou Ze was well aware of how terrifyingly harmful that stuff was to the human body. Ordinary people only knew that taking it was addictive and would squander money, but in reality, many of its damages to the body were irreversible.\n\n\"Exactly, exactly! Look at you, living such a dog's life! Your wife is working so hard to raise the children, while you died comfortably.\"\n\nThe old Taoist priest immediately grasped Zhou Ze's conversational intent and began to echo him.\n\n\"Heh,\" the man snorted. \"The stuff rich people here take is nothing. God knows how much miscellaneous junk is mixed in. Almost our entire village does this. Buying it from us is purer and cheaper.\n\nAlso, I made money from this. I wanted to earn money for my family. Carrying one trip back could earn 100,000 yuan, equivalent to ten years of hard labor in the fields. With the money I earned, I even opened factories, workshops, and bought large trucks for transportation.\"\n\n\"Brag all you want. If you earned so much money, why are your wife and children so miserable now?\" The old Taoist priest didn't believe him.\n\nThe male ghost seemed to be stubborn with the old Taoist priest and directly said, \"Heh, if I'm lying, I'm a bastard. I was once wealthy, much wealthier than you can imagine.\"\n\n\"After earning your first pot of gold, did you continue to transport it?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Of course, why wouldn't I? Can opening a factory, workshop, or running a transport business make money as fast as transporting this stuff? It's a hugely profitable business! Who would still open a broken factory that can't even break even in three years? It's really meaningless.\"\n\n\"Tsk, tsk, tsk,\" the old Taoist priest clicked his tongue.\n\nIn fact, the old Taoist priest had seen many people like this.\n\nThis male ghost was probably once a poor farmer who took risks transporting that stuff to earn his first sum of money, then turned his life around, and things got better. But this taste of \"eating the marrow and knowing the flavor\" is truly hard to give up. If you tell him to run a factory and live a stable life, he can't, because his values and financial outlook have completely collapsed.\n\nThis is similar to many prostitutes or gamblers. For a prostitute, she can easily earn tens of thousands a month. For a gambler, a single bet can be several thousands or tens of thousands. After their financial outlook is impacted by this, asking them to reform and work diligently in a factory for three or four thousand a month feels meaningless to them.\n\nThen,\n\nPeople are ruined.\n\nIt's hard to start over and live a good life.\n\nWhy do so many people who are determined to quit and reform relapse soon after?\n\nBecause they simply can't live the pace of a normal, ordinary person's life.\n\n\"Then, since you say the whole village there does this, you should know that smoking that stuff is harmful to your health, right? Why did you still smoke it?\" The old Taoist priest asked with some confusion.\n\n\"If everyone in the village smokes, you'll feel like it's nothing. The environment is different,\" the man said wistfully. \"It's like if your father, your uncle, your brother, and your colleagues all smoke, even if 'smoking is harmful to health' is printed on cigarette packs, you'd still think it's no big deal.\n\nAfter all, everyone is smoking.\"\n\nThe old Taoist priest nodded thoughtfully.\n\nImmediately, the old Taoist priest asked again, \"Then where's your money? Did you use it all up before you died?\"\n\n\"I left a lot of money,\" the man said. \"I didn't let my family down, I didn't let my wife and children down.\"\n\n\"Heh,\" the old Taoist priest chuckled.\n\nThis family lived in a garage apartment in a residential complex. The ground floor was originally someone's garage, but it had been converted into a one-bedroom rental.\n\nThe woman was helped into the house. Inside were three children, all staring with wide eyes at Zhou Ze, the old Taoist priest, and their mother.\n\nTwo boys and one girl, all probably elementary school age, with one still wearing a red scarf around his neck.\n\nThe children's clothes were a bit worn, but their faces were clean, and they seemed to be in good spirits. Although their living conditions weren't great, their mother must have taken good care of them.\n\nBut no matter how you looked at it, this family didn't seem to have a large sum of money left by the man after his death, as he claimed.\n\n\"Hey, didn't you earn a lot of money? Why did your wife and children come to Tongcheng and live here?\" the old Taoist priest asked.\n\n\"She wanted to bring the children here; she didn't want to stay in the original village,\" the man replied.\n\nAt this moment, Zhou Ze spoke, \"And the other ghost? Where is it?\"\n\nBoss Zhou always preferred more performance, and he really wasn't interested in relationship columns or charity.\n\nThe male ghost's gaze went to a curtain in the corner.\n\nZhou Ze walked over,\n\nPulled back the curtain,\n\nBehind the curtain was a small plastic bathtub. Crouching inside was a very young-looking man, trembling. On his chest was a strikingly bright, crimson mark.\n\n\"He's my son. After I died, he also got hooked using the money I left at home. Then the money ran out, and he followed my old path, dealing to support his addiction.\n\nHe was unlucky and got caught.\n\nThe quantity was too large,\n\nSent to Rongcheng,\n\nExecuted.\"",

    "content": "\"So, do you think this is a kind of retribution?\"\n\nZhou Ze looked at the man. Honestly, he felt no sympathy for this man, nor for his son who had become a ghost but, like his father, still remained in the living world.\n\nMan proposes, God disposes. Cause and effect, retribution never fails.\n\n\"Retribution for what? I don't believe this is retribution. I trafficked the drugs myself, took the risks myself, earned the money myself. What retribution is there?\"\n\n\"How many people, because of the drugs you brought in, ended up with broken homes, wives separated from husbands, children from parents? They certainly were culpable and went astray, but you, too, are inextricably linked to a primal sin.\"\n\nZhou Ze raised his hand, and the Gates of Hell opened.\n\nHonestly, there was nothing more to say to this kind of person—oh, no, to this kind of ghost. He was too lazy to say anything further.\n\nThe son's ghost was forcibly seized by Zhou Ze. He tried to struggle, but couldn't escape Zhou Ze's control and was directly sent into the Gates of Hell.\n\nZhou Ze didn't rush to check his credentials book. Instead, he casually grabbed the husband's ghost as well. The husband's ghost seemed to accept his fate; he didn't struggle, just looked at Zhou Ze coldly, with a hint of mockery.\n\n\"There are plenty of bad people in this world. Good deeds go unrewarded, while villains thrive for millennia.\nHow many truly face retribution?\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't retort. He grabbed him and also sent him into the Gates of Hell.\n\nEverything settled.\n\nZhou Ze opened his credentials book. The word \"(Temporary)\" next to his position had disappeared, replaced by \"Ghost Catcher.\"\n\nHe had been promoted.\nHe was finally no longer a precarious temporary worker.\n\nAt this moment, Zhou Ze felt a simple joy and pride, similar to what people experienced decades ago when they joined the system and secured a so-called \"iron rice bowl.\" He felt as if he had reached the pinnacle of life, becoming a cut above the rest.\n\nTurning to the next page, a verdict appeared:\n\n*Originally a traveler in the human world, coming vaguely and leaving vaguely;*\n*Alas, blind in eye and also blind in heart, fortune is cold and fate is cold;*\n*Please, sir, do not deal in ill-gotten gains, for home is shattered and kin are shattered;*\n\nThese three lines of judgment should summarize the ghost husband's life. As for the ghost son who was shot, since Zhou Ze collected him first, he was the one who helped Zhou Ze get his promotion. Because Zhou Ze collected the ghost husband later, the first judgment after his promotion was for the ghost husband.\n\nThe meaning of the judgment was simple: for this man, if nothing unexpected had happened, he should have lived an ordinary life. But his greed consumed him, and he squandered all his modest blessings, ultimately losing his fortune and even implicating his children and relatives.\n\nStepping out of the house, which had been set up in a garage, the old Taoist priest felt a bit heavy-hearted. This room full of dolls, this woman who had escaped that drug-trafficking village alone with her three children.\n\nAlas,\nHow pathetic,\nTruly pathetic.\n\nThe old Taoist priest looked up and saw Zhou Ze stretching in front of him, looking quite pleased, showing no distress or sadness over the family's plight.\n\n\"Finally promoted.\"\n\nZhou Ze muttered. He hadn't felt it before, but being stuck at 99% of the performance points for a while had been truly agonizing.\n\nNow his performance chart had refreshed to 0.3%.\n\nThis meant that to qualify as a \"Ghost Constable,\" besides finding a few more ghost catchers like Little Lolita to serve as his subordinates, just on performance alone, he had a long way to go.\n\n\"Boss, that family is truly pitiful.\"\n\nAfter leaving the residential area, the old Taoist priest couldn't help but say.\n\n\"Pitiful for what?\"\n\n\"That woman and those three children, their lives will be difficult from now on.\"\n\n\"Why are you feeling sorry for them? When they were prosperous from crime, enjoying the finest things, they didn't offer to treat you to a takeout meal.\"\n\n\"Uh...\" The old Taoist priest felt his boss made a lot of sense, but also seemed to make no sense at all.\n\n\"When their family was wealthy, the eldest son could casually use drugs, the children could wear new clothes, use more expensive toys, and attend better schools, and his wife could wear gold and silver.\n\nSince they enjoyed the good times together, they should share the burden when things go bad, isn't that the logic?\nUsing dirty money earned from drug trafficking consumes the most blessings. Enjoying it for a while brings retribution for a lifetime. This is fate, and it's self-inflicted. There's no need to pity them.\nI think you should pity yourself instead. You ate so many paper-filled steamed buns, will you be alright?\"\n\n\"Boss, please don't mention that steamed bun...\"\n\nBefore the old Taoist priest finished his sentence,\nHe suddenly let out an extremely foul fart,\nLong and lingering,\nLike \"Erquan Yingyue,\"*\nHeartbreaking.\n\n\"Boss, wait a moment. I need to find a place to relieve myself. I can't hold it in.\"\n\nThe old Taoist priest said, and without bothering to find a restroom, he headed straight for a nearby patch of grass.\n\nAfter about fifteen minutes, the old Taoist priest returned with shaky legs, clearly on the verge of collapsing from diarrhea. It was no surprise; he had eaten too many steamed buns. Others who accidentally bought and ate those buns might also have stomach problems, but the old Taoist priest had witnessed what the buns were made of. The double stimulation, both mental and physical, had directly led to his current situation.\n\nThe two returned to the car. Just as the old Taoist priest was about to drive, he immediately clutched his stomach, saying he couldn't take it and had to go again.\n\nWhen the old Taoist priest walked back this time, his face had started to turn pale.\n\n\"Damn it, they deserve it! That family truly deserves it!\"\n\nAfter such a terrible bout of diarrhea, the old Taoist priest felt no sympathy for that family whatsoever.\n\nThis perfectly illustrated the saying: most people's kindness is actually an emotional response based on their own perspective.\n\nZhou Ze sat in the driver's seat. He dared not let the old Taoist priest drive. After all, Zhou Ze had died in a car accident last time, and he didn't want to experience that again.\n\n\"I'll take you to the hospital.\"\n\nThe old Taoist priest nodded. He had to go to the hospital, otherwise, he might just \"pull\" his old life away.\n\nThe morning had cleared up for a while, but soon it started raining again. The weather lately had indeed been fickle and unpredictable.\n\nZhou Ze drove the car into the People's Hospital parking lot and accompanied the old Taoist priest to register for a consultation. He didn't know if Dr. Lin was there, and he didn't intend to check.\n\nEver since the incident with his sister-in-law, he hadn't contacted her again. This relationship, he thought, should just end there. It was complicated and troublesome, and endlessly agonizing over it was meaningless.\n\nThe old Taoist priest took a glass cup to the restroom to collect a sample for testing. Zhou Ze sat on a long bench outside, taking out the notebook. He didn't dare open it, just fiddled with it in his hands.\n\nThe black cat pattern on the back of the notebook was much clearer than before, and looking at it gave him the feeling that it was also staring back at him.\n\nIn the hospital, people came and went. Not long after Zhou Ze held the notebook, it would occasionally give off a faint tremor. It was very subtle, but through his fingers, it clearly transmitted a sense of agitation to Zhou Ze's mind.\n\nZhou Ze noticed that the notebook would only tremble slightly when people wearing patient gowns or those pushed in on stretchers passed by him, and the degree of tremor varied.\n\nThis was a major discovery. It seemed this notebook could predict the life and death of people around him. When those who were about to die or were critically ill passed by, the tremor became more intense, serving as a warning to its owner that someone nearby was about to kick the bucket.\n\nHis phone rang at this moment. Zhou Ze answered; it was Bai Yingying.\n\n\"Boss, are you alright?\" Bai Yingying asked anxiously from the other end of the line.\n\n\"I'm fine, what's wrong?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Xiao Ke found the Japanese priest's location. She's waiting for you at the bookstore. She's also very worried about your safety, terribly afraid that something might happen to you.\"\n\nAt the bookstore, while saying this, Bai Yingying specifically glanced at the little loli sitting in front of her.\n\nThe little loli's cheeks puffed out in anger!\n\nShe was furious. Even the dullest person could tell that Bai Yingying was trying to put her in a bad light in front of Zhou Ze!\n\nThis just goes to show that women are born strategists in palace intrigues. The seemingly naive Bai Yingying had managed to teach herself and was now miles ahead on the path of vying for favor.\n\n*Yingyingying!*\n\n\"Heh.\" Zhou Ze chuckled. Of course, he could understand the implication in Bai Yingying's words.\n\nLittle Lolita wanted him dead,\nThat was certain,\nJust as he had wished for Little Lolita to meet with an accident in Chengdu and not return.\n\n\"I'll be back in a bit. The old Taoist ate something bad, so I'm with him at the hospital.\"\n\n\"Mmm, okay, boss. Love you, *yingyingying*.\"\n\nAfter hanging up, Bai Yingying looked at the little loli as if to provoke her.\n\nThe little loli's cute nose tilted upwards as she snorted,\n\"Heh, childish.\"\n\n\"I wonder who's childish. I can bet you, if the boss really gets into an accident, he'll definitely drag you down with him before he dies, but not me.\"\n\n\"...\" Lolita.\n\nScheming bitch!\nScheming zombie!\n\n\"Because someone has to attend the boss's funeral,\" Bai Yingying said calmly. \"The boss said he doesn't want ordinary people to attend his funeral anymore. He doesn't want to experience being sent to a crematorium when he's not even dead.\"\n\n...\n\nOn the hospital bench, Zhou Ze was idly scrolling through Weibo when he discovered a major news item: a tornado and hail had struck Yancheng, a city adjacent to Tongcheng.\n\nThe geographical location of Jiangsu and Zhejiang has always been excellent, rarely experiencing earthquakes or other natural disasters. In that area, at most, there might be a heavy rain that causes waterlogging in farmlands. But this time, the tornado strike truly left everyone in the Jiangsu region feeling helpless.\n\nWhen Sichuan suffered earthquakes, many ordinary people in Chengdu were accustomed to it. People could even orderly move their tables and chairs outside to open spaces without buildings, continuing to play Mahjong while waiting for aftershocks to end.\n\nBut people in Jiangsu truly had no experience with such extreme natural disasters.\n\nSome doctors and nurses started running around, as if something had happened and they needed to gather urgently.\n\nDr. Lin, wearing a white coat, also ran past Zhou Ze, then stopped and looked at him with some surprise:\n\n\"Why are you here?\"\n\nDr. Lin was much thinner than before, and her clothes seemed a bit too large for her. A beauty's emaciation is the most disheartening sight, making one involuntarily feel sorrow for her.\n\n\"Accompanying a friend to see a doctor,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\n\"There's been a tornado strike in the neighboring city, and there are many injured. Our hospital is organizing medical teams to go there for disaster relief. I'm leaving right away.\nBy the way, I've already signed the divorce agreement and mailed it to your bookstore, but you haven't sent it back.\"\n\n\"Oh, my bookstore has moved,\" Zhou Ze explained.\n\n\"Alright, we'll talk about it when I get back.\"\n\nDr. Lin left in a hurry; everyone else had already gathered and was ready to depart.\n\nZhou Ze slowly stood up,\nHis expression grave,\nNot because this was his first meeting with Dr. Lin in a while and they were discussing the divorce agreement; in fact, it was a release for both of them.\n\nThe crucial point was,\nWhile Dr. Lin stood in front of him and spoke,\nThe notebook in his hand had trembled very violently.\nAfter Dr. Lin moved away from him, the notebook suddenly became quiet again.\nThis meant,\nShe was very likely to die soon!\n\n---\n*Erquan Yingyue (二泉映月)*: \"Moon Reflected on Erquan Spring,\" a famous traditional Chinese erhu piece known for its melancholic and emotional melody.",

    "content": "Old Taoist Priest walked out of the restroom, holding his \"secretions\" to hand over to the lab for testing. Zhou Ze looked at Old Taoist Priest and said,\n\n\"I have something urgent, I'm leaving first. Can you handle it yourself?\"\n\n\"...\" Old Taoist Priest.\n\nWhen I need care the most, you...\n\n\"Should I call Monkey to keep you company?\"\n\n\"...\" Old Taoist Priest.\n\nAre you sure you're not joking?\n\n\"That's it, take care of yourself.\"\n\nZhou Ze took his car keys and walked out of the hospital.\n\nOld Taoist Priest stood still and sighed, lamenting the hardship of his life. Both of his bosses were a bit heartless and lacked basic human decency.\n\nBut then, Old Taoist Priest felt relieved,\n\nIt's precisely because they don't know how to be human that they all became ghosts.\n\nHeh heh.\n\nOld Taoist Priest chuckled and went to the lab himself. It must be said that maintaining a cheerful disposition definitely played a big role in his ability to stay healthy and live to such an old age.\n\nAs Zhou Ze walked out of the main hall, he saw a minivan and three ambulances driving out. Immediately, he went to the parking lot, drove out his own car, and followed them.\n\nHe didn't call Doctor Lin to tell her not to go. He was also a doctor and clearly understood that doctors indeed have a responsibility to step forward in such situations.\n\nMore than ten years ago, when SARS was rampant, many media reported that numerous doctors and nurses in affected areas resigned or took leave, causing a public outcry. However, in reality, far more doctors and nurses continued to fight on the front lines, and some even contracted SARS themselves.\n\nZhou Ze's car followed behind the hospital vehicles, and together they got onto the provincial highway.\n\nYancheng is truly not far from Tongcheng, and coupled with the fact that the Yangtze River Delta region is mostly plains with an incredibly developed transportation network, rescue forces from various places could quickly arrive and provide assistance when a natural disaster struck Yancheng. The Wenchuan earthquake back then suffered greatly due to transportation issues, as it was a mountainous region with truly worrying road conditions.\n\nIt was precisely after the Wenchuan earthquake that the country has been investing heavily in recent years to rebuild Xichuan's transportation network. If another disaster were to occur, the People's Liberation Army hopefully wouldn't have to risk their lives parachuting in.\n\nHalf an hour later, the highway began to jam. The ambulance siren blared as it used the emergency lane. Some inconsiderate drivers who had occupied the emergency lane immediately made way upon seeing the ambulance, creating a very harmonious scene.\n\nZhou Ze felt a bit awkward. As he followed the ambulance, many drivers nearby gave him the middle finger for his shameless cutting in.\n\nThis made Zhou Ze wonder if he should call Doctor Lin and just ride in the ambulance with her to participate in the rescue. After all, Doctor Lin knew his medical skills. But he decided against it.\n\nLast night, first the school incident, then the breakfast stall incident, and then he successfully became a full-time employee. He hadn't slept for two days and was truly too tired. On this trip, Zhou Ze only wanted to ensure Doctor Lin's safety. If he were to participate in rescue work again, he'd be too exhausted; his body couldn't take it.\n\nBesides, there wasn't a shortage of doctors anyway.\n\nIt must be said that his life as a bookstore owner since his resurrection had indeed changed Zhou Ze a lot. His originally diligent personality had been worn down to be much lazier.\n\nThe rescue teams from Jiangsu's thirteen cities and those arriving from Shanghai certainly weren't foolish enough to all rush to Yancheng city center. Instead, they were dispatched to various reported disaster areas according to unified arrangements.\n\nDoctor Lin's team quickly exited the highway and drove into a village under Funing County.\n\nAt this time, hail was still falling, and even further away, there were small swirling winds, making one wonder if another tornado might form.\n\nMore than half of the houses in the village had collapsed to varying degrees. Most of the old-style houses had completely fallen down. There were many pedestrians on the road, and everyone looked somewhat flustered.\n\nAfter all, many local elders had never witnessed such an extreme natural disaster in their lifetime, so no one had much experience. They used to frequently see mudslides, earthquakes, or typhoons happening elsewhere, but they never expected it to happen to them.\n\nWhen the ambulances arrived, injured residents spontaneously gathered to orderly receive wound treatment and care. Not far away, firefighters were searching and rescuing people from collapsed houses.\n\nZhou Ze parked his car behind and didn't get out. Instead, he sat in the car, watching Doctor Lin busy at the tent. Of course, for now, the situation here seemed fine. The residents' injuries were only minor, nothing serious.\n\nEven those with blood-soaked faces only had superficial wounds; no one was dying, so Zhou Ze didn't need to get involved.\n\nAbout half an hour later, a firefighter ran over and informed them that there were trapped individuals under a collapsed old house over there, and the situation might be urgent, requiring doctors to assist in the rescue.\n\nDoctor Lin and a male doctor immediately ran over. Zhou Ze tossed his cigarette butt and had no choice but to get out of the car.\n\nUnder the collapsed old house, firefighters were already digging, but they clearly encountered difficulties. There were people trapped below, seemingly pinned down. Blind digging might cause the house to collapse again, endangering those trapped.\n\nSome villagers nearby also spontaneously participated in the rescue, but everyone dared not act rashly and could only follow the firefighters' instructions.\n\nWhen Zhou Ze walked over, Doctor Lin was calling out to the trapped people below, confirming their physical condition. Her hair tie was gone, and the wind was strong, blowing her hair around, yet she didn't look disheveled.\n\nIn such a chaotic post-disaster environment, these people in white coats were truly beautiful.\n\nA short firefighter walked past Zhou Ze. The notebook in Zhou Ze's pocket suddenly trembled violently, a tremor no less intense than Doctor Lin's earlier!\n\nSubconsciously, Zhou Ze reached out and grabbed the man's shoulder.\n\nThe firefighter stopped, somewhat surprised, and looked at Zhou Ze: \"Is there something?\"\n\n\"You... be careful.\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't know what to say, momentarily speechless. How could he say, \"Don't go forward, you might die\"?\n\nBut if he didn't go,\n\nWho else would?\n\nThe young, short firefighter also paused,\n\nHe seemed to have never encountered such a situation, but a warmth flowed through his heart. He smiled and said,\n\n\"Understood.\"\n\nThen, this firefighter went to the front and began to tie ropes around himself. Because the collapsed house was originally three stories high, the internal situation was complicated. After discussion, the fire brigade decided to send a short firefighter down first to explore and carry out rescue from inside.\n\nWatching the firefighter tying ropes around himself, Zhou Ze, standing in the crowd, pursed his lips and kept looking up and down.\n\nSo conflicted,\n\nSo annoying.\n\nIf you hadn't walked past me, I wouldn't have known anything. Then, if you sacrificed, I could just feel sad for you and pay my respects.\n\nBut now, I can actually foresee that you're going to sacrifice.\n\nZhou Ze decided that after this incident, he had to find a way to turn off or not carry his notebook with him.\n\n\"Damn it!\"\n\nAfter cursing himself for being a fool,\n\nZhou Ze still pushed through the crowd and walked to the short firefighter, picking up a rope and tying it around himself.\n\nThe firefighters nearby were stunned. One asked, \"Who are you? What are you doing? Don't hinder the rescue!\"\n\nRescue work really needed professionals. Many people participated in rescue out of pure passion, which was truly touching, but such reckless amateur behavior could sometimes lead to themselves and the trapped individuals falling into even more dangerous situations.\n\nDoctor Lin also saw Zhou Ze. She didn't know Zhou Ze had been following her car the whole time, and was a bit surprised.\n\n\"I used to be a special forces soldier, good with my hands. Let me go down.\"\n\nZhou Ze said calmly.\n\n\"Special forces?\" The captain paused.\n\n\"Yeah, have you seen *Wolf Warrior*?\" Zhou Ze asked in return.\n\n\"*Wolf Warrior*?\"\n\nThe captain's face was full of black lines.\n\nWhat the hell are you talking about?!\n\n\"You can ask her, she's my wife.\"\n\nZhou Ze pointed to Doctor Lin.\n\nThe captain looked at Doctor Lin, who suddenly wanted to laugh. What was this about?\n\nBut she knew Zhou Ze's identity and understood that if Zhou Ze was willing to participate in the rescue, he could indeed be much more capable than an ordinary person. At that moment, she also nodded and said,\n\n\"Yes, he's a retired special forces soldier.\"\n\nWith the doctor's assurance, the captain felt relieved. At this time, when help was needed, he was naturally very happy to accept the participation of someone with professional skills.\n\nImmediately, the captain pointed to the short firefighter next to Zhou Ze and said,\n\n\"He Li, you go down with this warrior... no, this comrade.\"\n\n\"Yes, Captain.\"\n\n\"No, I can go down by myself. I find him in the way.\" Zhou Ze said lightly.\n\n\"I won't be in the way!\"\n\nHe Li had already secured his safety rope and walked straight over. With the help of his comrades, he was lowered down through a small opening. Before going down, he glared fiercely at Zhou Ze.\n\nClearly, he was furious at being underestimated by Zhou Ze earlier.\n\nZhou Ze was truly helpless.\n\nI'm rushing to make a selfless contribution, and I still can't stop your sacrifice?\n\nIn the future, whoever wants to be a behind-the-scenes hero can go. It's too frustrating.\n\nZhou Ze could only quickly tie his safety rope and go down with him. The space below was really cramped. Zhou Ze and the firefighter named He Li were about two meters apart, both looking for space to step and descend, trying to make contact with the trapped people below first.\n\n\"Wah wah...\"\n\nNot long after going down, Zhou Ze heard a baby crying below.\n\n\"Hey, hey!\"\n\nZhou Ze called down.\n\n\"We're down here.\" Someone shouted from below.\n\n\"Don't move, we'll be down to rescue you soon, don't act rashly...\" He Li also shouted.\n\n\"My leg is pinned, and my daughter-in-law and grandson are also there. You save them first, save them.\" It seemed to be an elderly person below.\n\n\"Don't worry, old man, we're already starting the rescue...\"\n\n\"Clang...\"\n\nThere was a sound of something being pushed open from below.\n\nThe old man below seemed to have heard his grandson crying and was pushing hard to remove what was on him, intending to check on his daughter-in-law and grandson first.\n\nBut this obviously illegally built three-story house was already in a precarious state. When he moved below, the entire structure was affected. Zhou Ze felt the concrete slab under his feet start to shake again.\n\n\"Old man, don't move, don't move! We're coming down right away, right away!\"\n\nBut the movement continued below.\n\n\"Damn you, you old bastard, stop moving!\"\n\nZhou Ze immediately cursed.\n\nSure enough, cursing was more effective. The old man below stopped moving immediately.\n\nZhou Ze used his fingernails to snap several obstructing steel bars, even prying open concrete seams, and quickly got down. Not far from him, a woman holding a child lay there. The woman's head was bleeding; she wasn't dead, but clearly somewhat disoriented.\n\n\"Give me the child first, the child!\"\n\nZhou Ze yelled at the woman.\n\nThe woman's gaze cleared slightly, and she struggled to crawl over, passing the child through the partition to Zhou Ze. She knew that getting the rescue team to save the child early would get the child out of danger sooner.\n\nZhou Ze took the child and, across the steel bars, handed it to He Li, shouting to him, \"You take the child up first!\"\n\n\"You take the child up first!\" He Li said.\n\n\"Get out, you go up first!\"\n\nZhou Ze's attitude was firm. He wasn't sure if the trapped people below could be rescued, but if this firefighter continued to stay inside, there was a high probability he would truly perish.\n\nForced by Zhou Ze's attitude, He Li could only take the child and return the way he came.\n\nZhou Ze, meanwhile, continued to tear away obstructions with his fingernails, pulling the woman out. Then he untied his own safety rope, tied it around her, signaling for them to pull her up, while shouting:\n\n\"Has the child gone up?\"\n\n\"The child's up, be careful down there!\" Doctor Lin shouted from above, \"The wind's picking up again, be careful.\"\n\nHeh heh,\n\nAlthough they were practically divorced, the sound of a wife caring for her husband was truly enjoyable.\n\nZhou Ze gave the woman a push from below, and she was finally slowly pulled up.\n\nAlright, only one old man left.\n\nZhou Ze passed through and saw the old man sitting on the ground with a bitter expression. A wooden board was pressed against his leg, its ends firmly pinned by concrete slabs.\n\n\"Comrade, you go out first, I'm not in a hurry, this house is about to collapse.\"\n\nZhou Ze rolled his eyes at him,\n\nEarlier, you almost caused us all to die by moving around down here,\n\nAnd now you're starting to light up the lamp of your soul again?\n\n\"Don't talk. I'll lift the board, you try to get your leg out.\"\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\nZhou Ze used his fingernails to tear open the concrete slab's cracks. At this point, a sharp pain shot through his fingertips. Zhou Ze looked down and saw that all ten of his fingers were already bleeding.\n\nEven though these fingernails were miraculous, they weren't electric drills. Constantly dealing with steel and concrete was taking its toll.\n\n\"Push hard!\"\n\nZhou Ze supported the wooden board with both hands.\n\n\"My leg is out, it's out.\"\n\nThe old man shouted.\n\n\"Can you still move?\"\n\n\"Yes, my leg isn't broken, I can move.\"\n\n\"Alright, follow this. You climb up first, grabbing that rope.\"\n\n...\n\n\"You're injured, let me treat your wound.\"\n\nA female nurse treated He Li's wound.\n\nHe Li had several scratches on his body from sharp objects when he was down below.\n\n\"I'm fine, I still need to go down and save people.\" He Li refused.\n\n\"Don't move. That woman is out too, there's only one person left down there. You don't need to go down. Your wound must be treated immediately, otherwise, what if it gets infected?\"\n\nThe female nurse was firm.\n\nHe Li had no choice but to let her treat his wound.\n\nAt this moment,\n\nThe wind picked up again,\n\nMuch stronger than before. The tent rustled loudly, as if it could be blown away at any moment.\n\nHe Li suddenly saw the tree in front, which had been leaning due to the wind earlier, beginning to sway again. He immediately pushed away the female nurse who was treating his wound and rushed out.\n\nThe female nurse fell to the ground, annoyed, and said, \"What are you doing!\"\n\nThat tree couldn't fall, because the direction it was falling was towards the collapsed house. If that tree smashed down, the already precarious collapsed house would surely face a second collapse.\n\nHe Li had been down there and naturally knew that the situation below was unstable, and many areas were not balanced in terms of stress points.\n\n\"Creak...\"\n\nThe big tree began to tilt and fall. It couldn't hold on.\n\nOthers around also noticed this, but they had no time to react and could only watch as the big tree slowly fell.\n\nAt this moment,\n\nA short figure rushed out. He ran towards the direction the big tree was falling.\n\n\"Thud!\"\n\nThe trunk of the big tree hit his shoulder. He immediately spat out a mouthful of blood and knelt down, his knees directly hitting the ground, which even caved in. But the big tree, due to his deceleration, did not directly smash into the ground.\n\nThe surrounding firefighters and villagers immediately rushed over, hugging the big tree, trying to move it away by all means possible.\n\nThe big tree was finally safely moved to the ground.\n\nBut the short figure kneeling on the ground,\n\nCould no longer stand up.\n\nThe old man was pulled up,\n\nThen,\n\nZhou Ze also came up.\n\nDoctor Lin rushed over crying and hugged Zhou Ze. At this moment, Zhou Ze was covered in dust and ash, but Doctor Lin didn't mind at all.\n\nPatting Doctor Lin's back, Zhou Ze indicated that he was fine.\n\nExcept for his fingernails,\n\nIt hurt so much.\n\n\"Whew...\"\n\nHe let out a long sigh of relief.\n\nDoctor Lin began to examine Zhou Ze's body, checking for any wounds that needed treatment.\n\nZhou Ze, meanwhile, pulled out a crushed cigarette from his pocket, lit it, and asked,\n\n\"Where's that short firefighter?\"\n\nHe went up a long time ago, he should be fine, right? If he's fine, you should be fine too.\n\nThis broken notebook couldn't possibly be as mysterious as the omens in *Final Destination* movies, it's not that profound, after all, it's degraded.\n\nUpon hearing this, Doctor Lin's body suddenly stiffened,\n\nZhou Ze slowly furrowed his brows and asked,\n\n\"Where's that firefighter?\"\n\nWhen Zhou Ze walked to the tent,\n\nAnd saw the short body covered by a white sheet,\n\nHe subconsciously clutched the burning cigarette between his fingertips, then suddenly pulled Doctor Lin's hand, dragging her towards his car.\n\n\"What are you doing? What are you doing... you're hurting me.\"\n\n\"Come with me, let's leave here!\"\n\n\"I still have work, I still need to save people.\" Doctor Lin retorted.\n\nZhou Ze's gaze swept over Doctor Lin,\n\nDoctor Lin saw that Zhou Ze's eyes were bloodshot, which was terrifying.\n\nAt the same time,\n\nZhou Ze put one arm around Doctor Lin's head, resting her face on his chest. To outsiders, it looked like a young couple talking,\n\nBut Zhou Ze said:\n\n\"If you don't come with me,\n\nI will kill you,\n\nRight now.\"",

    "content": "In the Nissan, Zhou Ze sat in the driver's seat, and Doctor Lin sat in the front passenger seat.\n\nNormally, a newlywed couple, full of youthful vigor, sitting in a car together would easily find themselves in a romantic situation. Under the spark of passion, even the car itself might shake a little to show respect.\n\nBut at this moment, here, the atmosphere was somewhat awkward.\n\nZhou Ze continued smoking, the image of the small firefighter constantly appearing in his mind.\n\nHe felt a little sad. Perhaps that firefighter still held resentment and hatred towards him at the end, because Zhou Ze had scoffed at him face to face. Yet, at the last moment, he had used his frail shoulders to support the large tree.\n\nOtherwise, if that building had collapsed again, he and the old man would probably not have made it out.\n\nZhou Ze knew his own limits. His body was made of flesh and blood; even as a Ghost Messenger, in that environment, he would still die. If he had entered his zombie state, there might have been a sliver of hope, but at that moment, he was caught completely by surprise and had no time to enter that state.\n\nSo, in the final analysis, that firefighter had saved his life. He had intended to save the firefighter, but in the end, he was saved by him.\n\nThis feeling left Zhou Ze quite emotional, but it was also the firefighter's sacrifice that made him incredibly anxious about the prediction ability of that broken notebook.\n\nWould Doctor Lin also be fated to die?\n\n\"When Yama calls for a man to die at the third watch, he dare not stay until the fifth.\"¹\n\nZhou Ze had already thrown the notebook into the car; he didn't plan to carry it with him anymore. Otherwise, if he walked down the street, seeing \"this one will die soon,\" \"that one might die,\" he would truly be more exhausted than even those super-heroes overflowing with compassion.\n\n\"Out of sight, out of mind.\" Birth, aging, sickness, and death are the norm for humans; you do as you please.\n\nDoctor Lin bit her lip. She didn't know what to say. Zhou Ze's forceful demeanor made her a little uncomfortable, but at the same time, she understood that Zhou Ze wouldn't act this way unless something very serious was about to happen.\n\n\"Can you... explain clearly to me what's going on?\" Doctor Lin asked, wanting an explanation.\n\nZhou Ze licked his lips and said, \"I have an item that can predict a person's recent life and death. It predicted that you would die soon. Before, it predicted that firefighter would die. I tried to save him, but he still died in the end.\"\n\nUpon hearing this, Doctor Lin's expression became solemn.\n\nShe didn't refute Zhou Ze or forcefully demand that he let her out, shouting that she had to die at her post, or that there were many injured people who needed her care, and so on.\n\nShe was very calm. After listening to Zhou Ze's explanation, she calmly accepted his course of action.\n\nZhou Ze was very satisfied with this point; it was also Doctor Lin's most attractive quality. She was truly gentle and understanding. When he was with her, she always made him feel at ease.\n\nHe reached out and took Doctor Lin's hand, feeling that her palm was a little cold. Zhou Ze smiled, \"I'm with you, you'll be fine.\"\n\nDoctor Lin nodded and continued to sit in the front passenger seat. However, she seemed to think of something and asked, \"Will I affect you?\"\n\nDoctor Lin was worried that something unexpected might happen to Zhou Ze because he was trying to save her.\n\n\"We haven't divorced yet, after all.\"\n\nDoctor Lin stopped talking and continued to sit quietly.\n\nThe rescue efforts quickly got on track. Although the wind was still strong, extreme weather like the previous tornado was no longer occurring. With rescue teams arriving from various places, the disaster relief work was proceeding in an orderly manner.\n\nPeople from the hospital had inquired about Doctor Lin's situation, but Zhou Ze had put them off, saying his wife wasn't feeling well.\n\nGiven Zhou Ze's previous \"wolf warrior\"-like rescue performance, the hospital staff wouldn't say anything about Doctor Lin's absence. After all, he and his wife had already done enough.\n\nThere were some snacks and water in the car. Zhou Ze told Doctor Lin to eat something, while he took out his phone and called the little loli.\n\nThe call was quickly connected, and the little loli's dissatisfied voice came through: \"I found the priest for you, but when are you coming back? What if he runs away? Do you know I almost got discovered several times while tracking him? He might already be alerted...\"\n\n\"Shut up.\"\n\nThe little loli immediately fell silent.\n\n\"I have a Book of Yin and Yang in my hand. It's said to be something used by a Judge.\"\n\n\"You actually found that thing?\" The little loli had guessed something when she saw Sun Qiu's ghost before, which was why she thought Zhou Ze would likely die there.\n\nBut what she hadn't expected was that Zhou Ze not only survived safely but also managed to get his hands on that item.\n\nThis matter was absolutely shocking. One must know that the Underworld had a strict hierarchy, and Ghost Messengers were the lowest rank in the Underworld's sequence.\n\nIt was somewhat like two gatekeepers in ancient times, and one day one of them pulled out the Imperial Seal to show off to the other.\n\n\"Can it predict life and death?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"It can sense life and death,\" the little loli corrected.\n\n\"Is it 100% accurate?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"I'm not sure about that, but its accuracy should be quite high. However, it can't be 100% accurate. Even the Books of Life and Death in the hands of the Ten Yama Kings can have problems, let alone one at the Judge's level. Moreover, if I'm not mistaken, the Book of Yin and Yang in your hand should have a problem, its quality has dropped?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then it shouldn't be that accurate.\"\n\n\"Alright.\"\n\nWith that, Zhou Ze hung up the phone.\n\nIn the bookstore, the little loli angrily threw her phone onto the table!\n\nWhat kind of person was this! He just hangs up after he's done talking? Does he only seek me out when he needs something, and kick me aside when he doesn't?\n\nShe had even wanted to remind him that since he went to another city, he should greet the local Ghost Messengers, otherwise it would be a provocation to them.\n\nBesides, that area just had a natural disaster, and they were probably dizzy with busyness. If an outside Ghost Messenger came without giving a heads-up beforehand, it could easily cause misunderstandings.\n\nForget it. You handle it yourself. This old lady isn't serving you anymore.\n\n...\n\n\"You eat some too.\" Doctor Lin handed Zhou Ze a piece of bread.\n\nZhou Ze took the bread, took a very difficult bite, and chewed it with extreme pain.\n\n\"Let's stay here for now,\" Zhou Ze said. \"I'm also not comfortable driving home like this.\"\n\nDoctor Lin nodded in agreement.\n\nAs dusk fell, Zhou Ze told Doctor Lin to sleep and rest for a while, while he stood outside the car.\n\nThe rescue team had already left this village and gone to help in other disaster areas. At present, this village was relatively quiet. Half of the houses, being of good quality, had not been blown down, and many villagers were staying there, while some had already gone to relatives.\n\nZhou Ze stretched. He had a premonition that if they could make it through tomorrow safely, this hurdle would be overcome.\n\nWhen Zhou Ze looked into the car, Doctor Lin was on the phone, telling her younger sister to do her homework properly and not to be lazy watching TV.\n\nZhou Ze also thought that if the Ghost Messenger possessing his younger sister was still around, he could now have one more person to share the burden, as both sides were united in protecting Doctor Lin.\n\nUnfortunately, some things could only be thought about. Zhou Ze did not regret killing that Ghost Messenger.\n\nAs night deepened, Zhou Ze returned to the car and turned on the interior light.\n\nAfter finishing her call, Doctor Lin fell asleep. Zhou Ze kept his eyes open, observing his surroundings.\n\nHonestly, if it were like \"Final Destination,\" where various bizarre coincidences linked together to ensure your death, it would truly be impossible to resist. But he imagined it shouldn't be that terrifying.\n\nAround midnight, Zhou Ze, feeling tired but unable to sleep because Bai Yingying wasn't by his side, suddenly heard the sound of tools striking.\n\nIt was very close, not far in front of where they were parked, at a two-story building that had also been collapsed by the tornado.\n\nIt was possible that villagers were trying to salvage their property from their collapsed homes. Zhou Ze didn't plan to meddle. At this time, he couldn't leave Doctor Lin alone here and go outside to ask if they needed help or anything.\n\nJust then, Doctor Lin, who had slept for a while, woke up. She looked at Zhou Ze with some heartache and reached out to cover him with her clothes.\n\n\"I'm not cold,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Mm.\"\n\n\"What's wrong?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"I want to... relieve myself.\"\n\n\"I'll go with you.\"\n\nZhou Ze looked around. \"Just in the bushes behind the car, no one will see.\"\n\nDoctor Lin was a little embarrassed but nodded nonetheless.\n\nThen, Zhou Ze accompanied her out of the car.\n\nDoctor Lin hesitated for a moment, then, without any shyness or asking Zhou Ze to turn away, right in front of him, she pulled down her pants and squatted.\n\nIn many horror movies, there's always this idiotic plot point where, even though they know it's dangerous nearby, if a girl in the group needs to pee, they foolishly ask their protector to turn away and not look.\n\n\"It's embarrassing, you know.\"\n\nAnd then, an accident happens at that very moment.\n\nZhou Ze certainly wouldn't repeat such a brainless plot and setup. So, he stood perfectly straight, staring intently! Seriously looking! Carefully observing! Ensuring safety, safety first!\n\nSoon, Doctor Lin stood up, her cheeks flushed, and walked back to the car with Zhou Ze.\n\n\"You get in first, I'll get some water from the trunk.\"\n\nDoctor Lin obediently got into the car first and sat in the front passenger seat.\n\nHowever, once she sat down, her body suddenly stiffened.\n\n\"What do you want to drink? Old Xu stored a lot of things here—drinks, mineral water, and milk.\" Zhou Ze called from behind.\n\nDoctor Lin didn't answer, because she found that, at some point, someone had already sat in the driver's seat, and this person looked exactly like Zhou Ze. This person turned his head and smiled at her, softly saying:\n\n\"Quick, he's asking you, what do you want to drink?\"\n\n***\n\n¹ A Chinese idiom meaning that when one's time has come, there's no delaying the inevitable.",

    "content": "The man in the driver's seat indeed looked identical to Zhou Ze, but Doctor Lin knew that the real Zhou Ze was in the trunk getting drinks.\n\nCoupled with what Zhou Ze had told her earlier, she understood that danger could strike at any moment, and now, it already had.\n\nThe man held a notebook, one Zhou Ze had been holding earlier. He was toying with it, seemingly interested, but he didn't open it; he just kept flipping it over in his hands.\n\nHowever, he looked at Doctor Lin much more often than at the notebook. Clearly, in his eyes, Doctor Lin was more important than the notebook.\n\n\"Heh.\"\n\nThe man chuckled softly, leaning back slightly.\n\nThen, a wisp of green smoke drifted from his mouth, carrying a strong hallucinogenic effect. Doctor Lin tried to call out to Zhou Ze in the back, to warn him, but in an instant, she lost consciousness.\n\nEverything happened too quickly, giving her no time for further thought or reaction. She was just an ordinary person, not some special forces agent or queen.\n\nThe man calmly straightened his clothes, opened the car door, and stepped out.\n\nThe moment he exited the car, he transformed into Doctor Lin, her clothes and demeanor perfectly identical, leaving no room for error.\n\nEven the blush that hadn't completely faded from her cheeks was still there.\n\nThis showed that he was an absolute perfectionist, a person who meticulously focused on details.\n\nUnlike the Faceless Woman, his transformations were a refined art, whereas the Faceless Woman's were simply crude applications of change.\n\nHe walked to the back and saw Zhou Ze, who had just closed the trunk and was holding drinks.\n\n\"What's wrong?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"A little scared,\" he said, his voice as gentle as Doctor Lin's.\n\n\"I'm here, don't be afraid.\"\n\nWith that,\n\nZhou Ze put down the drinks and directly pulled him into a hug.\n\n\"...\" he thought.\n\nSimple,\n\nBrutal,\n\nEven he was somewhat caught off guard.\n\nFeeling the warmth from another man, a flash of anger and disgust appeared in his eyes, but he didn't resist. Instead, in an instant,\n\nHe opened his mouth.\n\n\"Pfft!\"\n\nBefore the green smoke could be exhaled,\n\nA hand directly covered his lips, pressing down firmly.\n\nZhou Ze turned his face, looking at him with a half-smile.\n\nHe was a bit confused, but most importantly, the green smoke in his mouth couldn't be coughed out or swallowed, making him very uncomfortable.\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nA knee heavily struck his abdomen. He opened his mouth, letting out a painful groan, and began to curl up on the ground.\n\nHe was somewhat puzzled and looked up at Zhou Ze.\n\n\"On the Road to the Underworld, there's a woman who always likes to cosplay others. Sorry, I've been trained by her, so you're out of luck. Now, whenever someone imitates someone close to me to approach me, I get a special premonition.\"\n\nHaving experienced \"special training\" from the Faceless Woman, Zhou Ze's sensitivity in that regard had been almost completely awakened, like an instinct.\n\nZhou Ze reached out and grabbed his neck. His body was somewhat weak, still in Doctor Lin's form. Dragging him, Zhou Ze walked to the car door and checked on Doctor Lin, finding that she was only asleep and unharmed.\n\nDragged like a dead dog by Zhou Ze, his body twitched slightly.\n\nZhou Ze let go, and he fell to the ground, smoke rising from all over his body, as if a leak had sprung in many otaku's girlfriends, and he began to shrivel.\n\nIn the distance,\n\nA man and a woman approached. The man was very tall, about 1.9 meters, wearing military camouflage, revealing his muscular arms, looking very strong.\n\nThe woman was short, with a face full of freckles, chewing gum and blowing bubbles non-stop.\n\nA wisp of green smoke slowly condensed behind the woman, forming the figure of a female ghost. The ghost wore a long green dress and stood behind the two, somewhat timid, seemingly anxious about being discovered and failing her mission.\n\nHowever, she lowered her head and whispered something to the tall man and the woman.\n\nThe tall man rotated his neck, producing several crisp cracking sounds from his joints, then squeezed his fists without speaking, but this was still a form of intimidation.\n\nThe freckled woman, meanwhile, spat out the gum from her mouth and casually stuck it onto the muscular arm of the man beside her. She took a few steps forward, looked at Zhou Ze, and asked with a smile:\n\n\"Brother, you've crossed the line.\"\n\nWere they local Ghost Messengers?\n\nZhou Ze wasn't entirely sure how Ghost Messengers from one area should interact with those from another, nor was he clear about the tacit understandings between Ghost Messengers. Of the two Ghost Messengers he knew:\n\nOne he had killed,\n\nOne he had captured.\n\nIt seemed Zhou Ze had always been so simple and brutal when dealing with his peers.\n\nLittle Loli had originally wanted to remind Zhou Ze that when he arrived in Yancheng, it would be best to greet the local Ghost Messengers, just as Monk Laitou had visited Zhou Ze when he came to Tongcheng.\n\nSometimes a greeting, a heads-up, could save a lot of trouble.\n\nBut at the time, Zhou Ze had directly hung up the phone, preventing Little Loli's reminder from being said. Perhaps, even if Little Loli had said it, Zhou Ze wouldn't have abandoned Doctor Lin to go \"socialize\" with his Yancheng counterparts.\n\nMoreover, in Zhou Ze's view, the other party had made the first move. The previous stance clearly indicated they intended to use the female ghost to knock out both him and Doctor Lin.\n\n\"So what?\"\n\nFacing the other party's questioning, Zhou Ze retorted.\n\nHe was here to save someone, to save Doctor Lin. At the same time, he had also saved a family. He wasn't here to steal or be a bandit.\n\n\"Brother, your tone makes me mistakenly believe you are the Inspector General himself.\"\n\nThe freckled woman smiled slightly, then reached up, swept her hair aside, and said:\n\n\"Leave the woman in the car, and you can go. We won't pursue the matter of you crossing the line without a greeting.\"\n\nZhou Ze looked at her,\n\nAnd said nothing.\n\nAt first, the freckled girl thought Zhou Ze was considering it,\n\nBut slowly,\n\nThe freckled girl realized Zhou Ze's gaze was like looking at an idiot.\n\nZhou Ze couldn't be blamed; he truly didn't know how to interact with his peers. He had no concept of these tacit understandings, so-called forbidden territories, and such.\n\nPerhaps Zhou Ze's biggest concept of the Ghost Messenger group came from the one who returned severely injured from Rongcheng,\n\nWho, in one night, killed dozens of Ghost Messengers, their Ghost Messenger IDs strewn across the ground like roadside cabbages, easy to pick up by the handful.\n\nSo, it's very possible that Zhou Ze had been led astray at that time.\n\nHe always felt that his peers were just small fry, like experience-giving mobs in an online game.\n\n\"We must keep this woman. She has something we want.\"\n\nWith that,\n\nThe freckled girl took a step forward,\n\nAs she strode,\n\nA gust of陰風 (yin wind) swept over, carrying a thick, oily sensation.\n\nZhou Ze felt his body suddenly become much heavier, and the air around him instantly grew incredibly thin.\n\nThe tall man also walked over at this moment, approaching Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze extended his fingernails,\n\nBut the other party was faster, directly seizing Zhou Ze's wrist, then flipping it over.\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nZhou Ze was thrown against the car door, which consequently dented inwards.\n\nLittle Loli had once given Zhou Ze immense terror,\n\nBut now Little Loli was under his control,\n\nAnd now, that feeling of dread, of being dominated by a senior Ghost Messenger, seemed to return.\n\nThe tall man smiled at Zhou Ze, then reached out and clutched Zhou Ze's neck.\n\n\"You should have just stayed in your Tongcheng. Why run around, and bringing her too? You're bringing a car full of treasure to stroll in front of a bandit's den, deliberately looking for trouble, aren't you?\"\n\n\"What's... wrong with her?\"\n\nZhou Ze was very confused.\n\nIf the other party was after his notebook, that would be easy to understand, as it was the Judge's Yin-Yang Scroll, still a Yin-Yang Scroll even if its quality had fallen.\n\nBut the other party seemed to have the meaning of \"buying the casket and returning the pearls,\" valuing Doctor Lin instead.\n\nWhat was wrong with Doctor Lin?\n\n\"Someone who has been blessed by a Ghost Messenger at the cost of sacrificing their own merit, what do you think she signifies?\"\n\nThe freckled girl looked at Zhou Ze,\n\n\"A rookie is a rookie, can't even see this, or perhaps you can see it, but you're just pretending not to, wanting to play some cliché 'human-ghost forbidden love' story?\n\nYou are a ghost, a dead person, not a person of the Yang realm. Too many ties with ordinary living people will harm her. This is my advice to you, kid.\"\n\nThe freckled girl took the chewing gum from the tall man's arm, put it back into her mouth to chew, then opened the car door and looked at Doctor Lin, who was unconscious inside.\n\n\"I'm very curious, that Ghost Messenger who willingly gave up so much just to bless her, should be of a higher rank than us, how could she be so generous?\"\n\nZhou Ze understood that the Ghost Messenger the freckled girl spoke of was likely the one who had possessed his sister-in-law. Her kindness to Doctor Lin was natural.\n\nIt had even reached a point of obsession. Zhou Ze's current situation was also thanks to her.\n\nZhou Ze seemed to recall that when he killed her, her Ghost Messenger ID was already on the verge of collapsing and ultimately didn't remain. Did this mean that she had already overdrawn her power before, perhaps by dedicating it to the blessing the freckled girl mentioned?\n\n\"Don't touch her.\"\n\nZhou Ze said.\n\nThe tall man held Zhou Ze's neck and found it amusing that Zhou Ze was still warning and threatening him at this moment.\n\n\"Of course, we won't kill her. We only want the blessing on her. We are Ghost Messengers, enforcers of the Underworld; we definitely won't kill living people.\n\nDon't worry, even though you're a rookie, you're still our colleague. We'll give you that much respect. At most, she'll get a severe illness and recover in a year or two, no problem.\"\n\nThe tall man reached out and patted Zhou Ze's face, praising him:\n\n\"You chose a really good skin. Much more handsome than me, this big brute. I'm actually a bit envious of you.\"\n\nThe freckled girl spat the re-warmed gum into her palm and then placed it on Doctor Lin's forehead.\n\n\"Hey, be careful. Don't suck out her soul. If you really kill her, you and I will have to take the blame together,\" the tall man reminded her.\n\n\"Don't worry, she's such a beautiful woman, I wouldn't bear to kill her.\"\n\nSaying this,\n\nThe freckled girl even specifically glanced at the \"rookie\" beside her,\n\n\"After all, she's still the heroine of our colleague's forbidden human-ghost love story, you say...\"\n\nShe suddenly froze,\n\nBecause she saw the rookie, whose neck was being clutched by her companion,\n\nThe malevolent aura on him,\n\nWas getting stronger and stronger...",

    "content": "The tall man only felt a bone-chilling cold transmit from his palm. He subconsciously wanted to let go, because this coldness seemed to have stimulated his soul through his flesh, making him feel a terrifying tremor.\n\nHowever,\n\nhis hand could not be retracted.\n\nBefore, he had been gripping Zhou Ze with his hand.\n\nBut now, Zhou Ze deliberately lowered his jaw, trapping the other's palm firmly against his neck.\n\nThe freckled girl stood up straight, looking at Zhou Ze. She was very wise and rational. The moment that inexplicable ominous aura rose from Zhou Ze, she began to scheme something.\n\nShe immediately smiled and said,\n\n\"Sir, if you are a police chief or patrol inspector in disguise, please reveal your identity directly. We will apologize as we should, and today's matter can be considered as if it never happened?\"\n\nThose who have died once are always smarter than the living and know better when to be pragmatic.\n\nJust as the little loli, gravely injured, submitted to Zhou Ze, it was precisely because they had died that they deeply understood how precious this opportunity was to continue living in such a way.\n\nHell is truly a terrifying place.\n\nIf it were the old Zhou Ze, he might have taken the hint and backed down, but unfortunately, the current Zhou Ze had lost his sanity.\n\nA bronze luster slowly began to rise on his skin, staining his entire body.\n\nTwo fangs slowly grew out, revealing a glaring, chilling sight.\n\nA greenish face,\n\nsilent eyes,\n\ncarrying a natural coldness.\n\n\"Crack...\"\n\n\"Ah!\"\n\nThe tall man let out a cry of pain.\n\nZhou Ze's two fangs directly pierced his hand, and instantly, his entire body began to convulse. This single bite seemed to have almost entirely crippled his physical body.\n\nThe tall man kicked out, wanting to send Zhou Ze flying, at least to break free from him. However, his foot was directly caught by one of Zhou Ze's hands.\n\nHe wanted to kick, he wanted to exert force,\n\nbut his foot remained motionless.\n\nThis young man, whose face he could pat and call \"pretty boy\" just moments ago, seemed to possess terrifying strength within his body, completely dominating him.\n\nZhou Ze raised his head,\n\nwith a \"whoosh,\"\n\nhis fangs tore off a large chunk of flesh from the tall man's palm.\n\nAt the same time, Zhou Ze's fingernails turned a dark red, and the five fingers gripping the other's shoe began to exert force.\n\n\"Snap!\"\n\nA crisp sound,\n\nlike a small firecracker exploding during Chinese New Year.\n\nThe tall man's shoe burst open, along with his foot.\n\nThe tall man retreated with a look of terror, collapsing onto the ground.\n\nZhou Ze lowered his head slightly, leaning sideways, looking at him.\n\nHis gaze was as still as an ancient well.\n\nA moment later, Zhou Ze raised his hand, looked at his palm with some disdain, then squatted down and wiped his hand on the other person's body.\n\nWhat if there was athlete's foot?\n\nWhat then?\n\nIt seemed some habits truly couldn't be changed,\n\nfor example,\n\ncleanliness?\n\nThe tall man lay there on his back, not daring to move. The power dynamic had now completely reversed.\n\n\"Buddy, we can talk this out. You know, even a soul messenger only gets one chance to choose a body.\"\n\nThe freckled woman said to Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze did not respond, as if the woman didn't exist at all.\n\nHis hand slowly moved to the man's chest, his fingertips gently pulling down from the neck.\n\nHis fingernails were like the sharpest scalpel.\n\nA crisp sound of tearing flesh,\n\nthe tall man's chest was completely cut open, but he didn't even bleed. These fingernails were simply too sharp!\n\nThe tall man looked at the woman beside him, his gaze pleading for help.\n\nThe freckled woman could no longer remain calm. She spread her palm, and the surrounding air once again solidified. Immense pressure began to bear down on Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Roar!\"\n\nZhou Ze let out a suppressed roar from his throat. The black mist on his body instantly boiled, and even the air seemed to be tainted with an agonizing heat.\n\nThe freckled woman staggered, took two steps back, and sat on the ground.\n\nHer gaze at Zhou Ze held a heartfelt terror.\n\nDamn it,\n\nwas this still a soul messenger?!\n\nHow could this possibly still be a soul messenger?!\n\nThe freckled girl felt at this moment as if a traitor had emerged among them.\n\nPeople used to say that there was a husky in a wolf pack. Now it was the other way around; a real prairie wolf had infiltrated a group of huskies.\n\nZhou Ze squatted beside the tall man. Wisps of black smoke continuously emanated, and if one looked closely, they could see that the tall man's limbs were completely bound by the black smoke, rendering him unable to move.\n\nZhou Ze was a doctor,\n\nso he was very experienced in performing surgery.\n\nHe meticulously examined the tall man's pathology,\n\nliver,\n\nlungs,\n\nintestines,\n\ntaking them out one by one,\n\ndangling them in front of the tall man,\n\nand then,\n\ntossing them aside.\n\nAt this point, it would have been even better if there were a few medical students present to take photos and notes, and incidentally, offer \"66666\" as flattery to the teacher.\n\nHeaven help him, the tall man was utterly stunned, but he couldn't pass out. He was even numb to the point of not feeling any pain, which was the most excruciating torture—to make you watch with your own eyes!\n\nZhou Ze continued to do as he pleased, like a boy who had discovered a fascinating new toy.\n\nIt had been so long since he had played this kind of human body research game.\n\nHe was a little nostalgic.\n\nMm,\n\nthat was the feeling.\n\nThe human body was truly the most marvelous existence in the world.\n\nIts harmony,\n\nits beauty,\n\nthe structure of every single blood vessel, all so ingenious, coming together to form the framework of life, bearing the weight of the soul.\n\n\"He's a soul messenger, you can't kill him! Aren't you afraid of punishment from the Underworld?\"\n\nThe freckled woman, slumped on the ground, shrieked.\n\nShe was going crazy.\n\nShe was truly going crazy.\n\nThe scene before her,\n\nthe atmosphere before her,\n\nwas even more horrifying than a Shura field in hell!\n\n\"We didn't mean to kill her! We told you, we didn't mean to kill her! We were wrong, but not to the point of death! We didn't want to make mortal enemies with you, really! We didn't want to kill anyone, nor did we want to kill you. You were the one who crossed the line, you crossed the line without warning, so you're also at fault, you're also at fault!\"\n\nThe freckled girl continued to shout.\n\nZhou Ze turned a deaf ear, continuing with his task. A moment later, he clapped his hands, his examination finished.\n\nThen,\n\nhe lowered his head,\n\nopened his mouth,\n\nand began to inhale.\n\n\"Hiss...\"\n\nLike a bowl of water poured into a boiling oil pot, it instantly exploded.\n\nThe tall man's black soul was pulled out and vanished into Zhou Ze's mouth.\n\nHis corpse began to rapidly decompose, turning into a putrid liquid.\n\nZhou Ze raised his head,\n\nclosed his eyes,\n\nthe taste of a soul,\n\ntruly delicious.\n\nSlowly, Zhou Ze stood up and walked to the freckled girl.\n\nThe freckled girl instinctively scrambled backward. She was scared, truly scared. Even in front of the Patrol Inspector, she had never felt such clear fear!\n\nZhou Ze tilted his head, slowly moving forward, but still faster than her crawling.\n\nSlowly,\n\nZhou Ze caught up to her speed,\n\nslowly,\n\nZhou Ze reached her side,\n\nslowly,\n\nZhou Ze lifted his foot,\n\nslowly,\n\nZhou Ze brought his foot down, stepping on her abdomen.\n\nEverything was slow, like a melodious piano piece, with its unique rhythm.\n\n\"Pfft...\"\n\nOne kick,\n\npiercing through,\n\nlike a nail,\n\npinning the woman down directly.\n\nBlood foam continuously bubbled from the woman's mouth, and her body trembled and contorted incessantly.\n\nI said so much,\n\nanalyzed so much with you,\n\nexplained so many principles,\n\ntold you so many consequences,\n\nyou still want to kill me, then kill me,\n\nbut can you, from beginning to end,\n\nnot say a single word?\n\nThis was the freckled woman's biggest grievance at the moment. It seemed that in the other's eyes, the two of them were ants not even worthy of dialogue.\n\nZhou Ze had already landed the first kick.\n\nHe let out a burp,\n\nlooking somewhat helpless,\n\nit was truly conflicted to face delicious food when already full.\n\nThen,\n\nhe raised his foot again,\n\nstill slowly raising it,\n\nstill slowly bringing it down,\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nHer head exploded,\n\nsolving the woman's problem with freckles.\n\nAlong with the woman's soul, which was pulverized by the surrounding black mist, her corpse quickly decomposed, merging with the ground.\n\nThen,\n\nZhou Ze seemed somewhat bewildered.\n\nHe stood in place,\n\napparently contemplating something.\n\nIt seemed that having swallowed a soul messenger's soul once before, and then again now,\n\nthis time,\n\nhis existence lasted a bit longer than the previous two times.\n\nBut a longer duration also brought more trouble.\n\nFor example:\n\nWho am I?\n\nWhere am I?\n\nWhere am I going?\n\nHe was indeed pondering these questions. After much thought, he turned his head and saw Dr. Lin sitting in the car.\n\nHe walked over, leaned in,\n\nlowered his head,\n\nand rubbed his fangs against Dr. Lin's delicate face.\n\nSome drool also dripped, landing on Dr. Lin's forehead, and then flowing down, covering her entire face, making Dr. Lin's face somewhat blurry.\n\nHe seemed to enjoy this feeling, to be very infatuated with it.\n\nThen,\n\nhis gaze fell upon the notebook that had been left on the driver's seat, not taken by the female ghost in green.\n\nHe reached out and picked up the notebook.\n\nAs the notebook neared Dr. Lin, it began to tremble violently, signifying that she would soon die.\n\nThis was the warning from the Yin-Yang Record. It was said that the Book of Life and Death in Yama's hands recorded everyone's time of birth and death, possessing supreme rules.\n\nThe Yin-Yang Record, derived from the Book of Life and Death, also possessed similar functions.\n\nThe notebook trembled violently, continuously warning its owner,\n\nthis woman,\n\nis about to die!\n\nZhou Ze looked at the notebook with some bewilderment, as if looking at a strange new toy.\n\nHowever,\n\nit was clear that this toy was not much fun; the vibrating sensation annoyed him even more.\n\n\"Roar!\"\n\nHolding the notebook in front of him,\n\nZhou Ze let out an angry roar at it.\n\nThen,\n\nthen,\n\nthen,\n\nit really did quiet down.\n\nIt stopped shaking...",

    "content": "It was morning, and the sun had finally come out. It was a beautiful day with a gentle breeze, a stark contrast to yesterday's windy, rainy, and tornado-ridden chaos.\n\nDr. Lin squinted, finally waking up from her comatose state of last night.\n\nUpon waking, she noticed her face felt dry, as if something was clinging to it, even sticking to her eyes. She gently wiped her face with her hand, opened her eyes, and saw white streaks on her palm.\n\nPulling down the rearview mirror, she saw her face was covered in these white stains, with a strong odor.\n\nThough Dr. Lin was inexperienced, she was a doctor, and information was readily available in this era. It was no longer the ancient times when mothers showed erotic paintings to their daughters before marriage to impart knowledge.\n\nThese marks on her face…\n\n...seemed to be... semen stains.\n\nInstinctively opening the car door, Dr. Lin felt a surge of panic. The bizarre events of last night still left her with a lingering fear. Then, she saw Zhou Ze, covered in blood, sitting on the ground leaning against the car door.\n\nZhou Ze was truly miserable, his entire body seemed to have no good skin, like a prisoner who had just been tortured and thrown out to fend for himself.\n\n\"Ah Ze, Ah Ze!\"\n\nDr. Lin immediately knelt down, calling Zhou Ze's name. She was terrified something might have happened to him.\n\nThis time, the coma duration was much shorter than before, as if his body was slowly getting used to it. Perhaps it was also due to devouring a few souls of the Underworld Messengers, which had nourished and strengthened some parts of him.\n\nIn any case, after only half a night in a coma, Zhou Ze actually opened his eyes at Dr. Lin's calls.\n\nHis eyes met Dr. Lin's face, and Zhou Ze gasped, complaining with difficulty:\n\n\"Still putting on a face mask this early in the morning.\"\n\nDr. Lin was both exasperated and amused, but Zhou Ze, in his current state, couldn't be hit nor could she bear to scold him. She could only pull out a wet wipe from the car and clean her face.\n\nAs she wiped, she also tried to discern if it was indeed semen. It seemed not to be.\n\n\"I'll call for an ambulance,\" Dr. Lin said.\n\n\"Don't...\"\n\nZhou Ze weakly shook his head,\n\n\"Call the bookstore... let Old Daoist bring... bring his monkey... here.\"\n\nDr. Lin hesitated, suppressing her professional instinct to call 120, and chose to follow Zhou Ze's instructions. She used Zhou Ze's phone to call the bookstore.\n\nOld Daoist answered the phone. He immediately understood that his boss must have gone on a rampage again.\n\nWithout further ado, he said he would set off immediately with the monkey.\n\n\"Where are we going now?\" Dr. Lin asked Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Let's just find a place to settle down first,\" Zhou Ze said. \"Help me into the car. You drive and find a small motel. Oh, right, check the bushes over there, see if there's anything like a driver's license, and pick it up for me.\"\n\nDr. Lin immediately went to search the bushes ahead. It was actually quite easy to find. There were two spots in the bushes with obvious oil stains, as if pork lard had been splashed on them in the middle of the night.\n\nOf course, Dr. Lin couldn't possibly discern that it was actually corpse oil.\n\n\"Is this it?\"\n\nDr. Lin found two small notebooks and handed them to Zhou Ze.\n\nBoth Underworld Messenger certificates were yellowed but not damaged, meaning they were still usable.\n\n\"This is it.\"\n\nZhou Ze motioned for Dr. Lin to put these two things away, then, with her help, he got into the car.\n\nThere was almost no large, intact, uninjured part on his body, but fortunately, Zhou Ze was used to it by now, and with Dr. Lin sitting beside him, he wasn't screaming in pain.\n\nHowever, because of the recent tornado, many residents whose homes were damaged or collapsed chose to temporarily stay in motels. Consequently, all motels, large or small, from this village to the small county town, were basically full.\n\nDr. Lin drove to the end of the county town and got out to inquire at a small motel.\n\nZhou Ze, meanwhile, slumped in the passenger seat,\n\nLooking out the car window,\n\nAt the sky.\n\nAt that moment, an old man carrying a vegetable basket walked past the car door.\n\nThe old man was truly ancient, with a full head of white hair and a goatee. His figure was stooped, but he still walked with a sturdy gait.\n\nMost importantly, as the old man walked past Zhou Ze, Zhou Ze clearly felt his gaze being pricked.\n\nThe old man stopped, looked at Zhou Ze in the car, a bit puzzled. He knocked on the glass and asked:\n\n\"Young man, were you affected by the disaster?\"\n\nMeaning, was he injured in the tornado?\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"Why aren't you going to the hospital?\" the old man asked curiously.\n\n\"Poor.\"\n\n\"...\" the old man.\n\nAfter a moment of hesitation, the old man reached in, examined Zhou Ze's injuries, and said, \"These superficial wounds are really evenly distributed, all over your body.\"\n\n\"Hm.\"\n\nAt this moment, Dr. Lin returned. She glanced at the old man standing by the car window and said to Zhou Ze:\n\n\"Still no rooms.\"\n\n\"Where would there be rooms now?\" The old man shook his head and said, \"Never mind, come stay at my house. My courtyard is large.\"\n\nDr. Lin looked at Zhou Ze, asking for his opinion.\n\nZhou Ze nodded. He actually didn't know why the old man suddenly decided to help him. After all, in this day and age, if you didn't have tens of millions in wealth, you wouldn't dare casually help people on the street.\n\nThe old man's house was indeed very large, built in a courtyard style. As Zhou Ze got out of the car, the old man helped Dr. Lin assist Zhou Ze into a room.\n\nHe was quite strong.\n\nAfter lying down in the room, the old man said he would go prepare some Chinese medicine for Zhou Ze and then left.\n\nDr. Lin sat by Zhou Ze's side. She was also a bit incredulous that they could meet such a warm-hearted person on the road who even took them back to his home.\n\n\"There are still many good people in this world,\" Dr. Lin sighed.\n\nZhou Ze, meanwhile, looked at the photo frame hanging on the wall beside the bed. It contained many medals and certificates, as well as some group photos. If he wasn't mistaken, the old man must have been a soldier before.\n\n\"Are you hungry?\" Dr. Lin asked.\n\n\"Not really,\" Zhou Ze shook his head.\n\n\"Girl, can you cook?\"\n\nThe old man walked in, holding a jar of ointment.\n\n\"Yes, I can,\" Dr. Lin replied.\n\n\"Then you go cook. I'll apply some ointment to him. It's very effective for external wounds.\"\n\nDr. Lin glanced at Zhou Ze again. Evidently, she was still a bit uneasy leaving Zhou Ze alone in the room.\n\nZhou Ze nodded at her, signaling her to go.\n\nThe old man sat by Zhou Ze's bed, patted the bedspread, and said, \"Isn't it shameful or ill-mannered?\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head.\n\n\"Then take off your clothes. Never mind, I'll help you.\"\n\nThe old man reached out and helped Zhou Ze take off his shirt. Looking at the dense, numerous injuries on Zhou Ze's body, he smacked his lips and said:\n\n\"Tsk, tsk, injuries like yours were rare even on the battlefield.\"\n\n\"Sir, you used to be a soldier?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"I was. When we fought the Japanese devils, I was still young and only knew how to use a red-tasselled spear. When we fought Chiang Kai-shek, I formally enlisted, and then I went to Korea, and also to Southern Tibet.\n\nI was lucky; I didn't die and wasn't badly injured.\"\n\n\"You're blessed with great fortune.\"\n\n\"The King of Hell won't take me, what can I do? You tell me, I still get such a large stipend every month, and I can't contribute anything to the country. It would be better if the King of Hell sent an Underworld Messenger or something to take me away.\"\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Alright, it's applied. Your physique, though it looks delicate, feels quite robust to the touch. You have a good foundation, are you a martial artist?\"\n\n\"Sort of,\" Zhou Ze said evasively.\n\n\"Do you know why I brought you into my home?\" the old man asked.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head.\n\n\"You're pleasing to the eye.\"\n\n\"That's a good reason.\"\n\n\"When a person lives to my age, they can do whatever they please. I don't want to worry or consider so many things.\"\n\nDinner was prepared by Dr. Lin, but Zhou Ze didn't eat much.\n\nAfter dinner, the old man invited Zhou Ze to play chess, while Dr. Lin went to the old man's inner room, a collection room, to look at antiques.\n\nZhou Ze lay on the bed, facing the chessboard. The old man made a move, Zhou Ze said a move, and the old man placed the piece for Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze's chess skills weren't great, but the old man deliberately let him have a rook, which he never moved, allowing for a back-and-forth game.\n\nAs they played, it got dark. Zhou Ze received a call from Bai Yingying.\n\nShe said that Old Daoist encountered traffic police on the way. His car and he were impounded because of unlicensed driving. The monkey had no choice but to hide in the nearby bushes, not daring to let the police see it, otherwise the charge of privately raising a nationally protected animal would add to Old Daoist's crimes.\n\nThis caught Zhou Ze off guard. He had thought Old Daoist would come with the monkey sooner so he could recover better. He didn't expect Old Daoist to run into trouble himself. It seemed not only did he not have a driver's license, but Old Daoist had also been driving without one all this time.\n\n\"What's wrong?\" the old man asked after Zhou Ze hung up.\n\n\"My friend who was coming to pick me up ran into some trouble on the way. They probably can't make it tonight.\"\n\n\"If they can't come, just stay here. You're pleasing to my eye.\"\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze.\n\nAfter the chess game, the old man yawned, looking ready for bed. He waved at Zhou Ze, put away the chessboard, and said he was going to his room to sleep.\n\nAfter the old man left, Dr. Lin came in.\n\nHowever, her expression was grave.\n\n\"What's wrong?\"\n\nZhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Ah Ze, this old man is a bit strange.\"\n\n\"What's so strange? Didn't you say he was very kind before?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"It just makes me a bit uncomfortable. Also, this courtyard house is a bit peculiar.\"\n\n\"It's alright, I'm here,\" Zhou Ze comforted her.\n\nDr. Lin nodded, feeling a little more at ease.\n\nWho knew Zhou Ze hadn't finished speaking, and continued:\n\n\"I'm here, but you know my current condition. If something happens, you have to remember to carry me and run. Don't leave me behind.\"\n\n\"...\" Dr. Lin.\n\n\"I'll go get some hot water to wipe your body.\"\n\nDr. Lin got up and left. When she returned from the kitchen with hot water, she happened to see that the room next to Zhou Ze's, which was the old man's room, seemed to be lit.\n\nAs she got closer, she heard the sounds of drinking and finger-guessing games, and the old man's voice was among them, a cacophony of human voices.\n\n\"Old Li, you have guests tonight?\"\n\n\"Yes, a girl and a boy.\"\n\n\"That girl is really pretty, like a landlord's daughter.\"\n\n\"You were secretly looking at her?\"\n\n\"Looking doesn't cost a piece of flesh, so what?\"\n\n\"That boy is even better looking,\" a voice suddenly said.\n\n\"You rascal, I've always thought there was something off about you. So you really don't like women, you prefer that kind.\"\n\n\"Like him? I don't dare to like him. It depends on whether he likes us or not.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"If he doesn't like us, then we won't be able to drink or eat meat or live like this anymore.\"",

    "content": "Doctor Lin quickly entered Zhou Ze's room. This time, she was certain there was something wrong with this courtyard. Before, there were only three people in the courtyard: herself, Zhou Ze, and that old man. Now, suddenly, the old man's room next door had a large group of people having a lively time drinking and chatting at night. How was that possible?\n\nMoreover, what they were saying clearly had a hidden meaning.\n\n\"Ah Ze, there's something wrong with this courtyard. We should leave.\"\n\nZhou Ze put down his phone and yawned. Honestly, he was indeed tired, but he couldn't sleep without Yingying beside him. The most painful thing was needing sleep both physically and mentally but being unable to fall asleep.\n\n\"The room next door, I just heard a lot of people talking.\"\n\nDoctor Lin continued.\n\n\"It's fine, it's fine.\"\n\nZhou Ze waved his hand,\n\n\"You were startled yesterday. Just rest for a few more days and you'll be fine.\"\n\nActually, after close contact with ghosts, living people inevitably get affected, similar to being infected with a similar magnetic field. Then they can see and hear things that are normally invisible. After a while, when the magnetic field dissipates, they'll be back to normal.\n\nOx tears have a similar effect.\n\nDoctor Lin picked up a towel and began wiping Zhou Ze's body. Zhou Ze seemed to enjoy it, though from her technique, Doctor Lin's serving skills were indeed not as good as Yingying's.\n\nAfter wiping him clean, Doctor Lin put down the towel, bit her lip, and said:\n\n\"I didn't mishear. If you know what's going on and want me not to overthink it, I can try not to.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\nDoctor Lin said no more, took off her coat, and lay down on the bed, but on her side, arm propped under her head.\n\nFrom Zhou Ze's perspective, he could only see her back, a slender yet curvaceous figure, very enticing.\n\nActually, women like this, with a bit of flesh, are indeed more attractive.\n\nZhou Ze continued to scroll on his phone. Since he couldn't sleep and was bored, he could only blame that unreliable Daoist priest. If the Daoist priest were here now, with Monkey's help, his injuries would heal much faster.\n\nThe old man's ointment was indeed effective. The wound still felt cool, but it was still far from Monkey's mud.\n\nDoctor Lin's breathing gradually became steady. He didn't know if she was asleep or not.\n\nBut slowly, the sounds from next door grew louder: the sounds of drinking games, bragging, and even a man singing Huangmei Opera in a falsetto voice.\n\nIt felt like someone had placed ten televisions next door, all playing different programs.\n\nZhou Ze saw Doctor Lin's body stiffen on one side, and one hand instinctively covered her ears.\n\nShe wasn't asleep.\n\nAnd trying to sleep while living next door to a group of \"those things\" was indeed too difficult for her.\n\nZhou Ze tapped the wooden bed frame with the corner of his phone and rebuked:\n\n\"At this late hour, show some class! Don't disturb others' rest.\"\n\nAfter Zhou Ze shouted, the other side immediately quieted down, becoming silent as a tomb.\n\nZhou Ze continued to play with his phone.\n\nHe didn't know how long he played, but his phone was connected to the charging cable, so he wasn't worried about it running out of power. It was past 2 AM.\n\nZhou Ze couldn't hold it in anymore.\n\nHe had actually been thinking about it all day.\n\nHe had held it in until now.\n\nHe looked at Doctor Lin, who was still lying on her side beside him, reached out to support himself on the edge of the bed, and tried to get up. However, his injuries were indeed quite severe, and Zhou Ze couldn't lift himself, falling back with a \"creak.\"\n\nDoctor Lin turned over and looked at Zhou Ze, asking directly:\n\n\"Need to use the restroom?\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\nDoctor Lin helped Zhou Ze out of bed, and they walked out of the room together.\n\nThere were no toilets in the rooms of the Siheyuan. There was a toilet in the diagonal corner, a separate small room, a rural squat toilet, with a wooden frame above for people to sit on, and a pit or a large jar below.\n\nActually, this old man didn't seem to be short on money. His monthly allowance was probably quite substantial. Moreover, Doctor Lin had been invited to visit the old man's collection room, which contained many excellent artifacts. Selling one or two of them could easily buy a house.\n\nZhou Ze leaned one hand against the wall and was about to unbuckle his belt with the other when Doctor Lin directly reached out and unbuckled it for him.\n\nThis surprised Zhou Ze. At this moment, Doctor Lin truly acted like a wife tending to her sick husband; everything was so natural, without the slightest pretense.\n\nZhou Ze let her do as she pleased, slowly closing his eyes, waiting for his \"water pipe\" to be taken out by a pair of soft hands, and then he just needed to open the valve and let the water flow. After he finished, his \"water pipe\" would probably be held and shaken dry.\n\nHowever,\n\nJust then,\n\nA very unfriendly voice came.\n\n\"Need help?\"\n\nIt was the old man's voice.\n\nThe old man had gotten up in the middle of the night to use the restroom.\n\nDoctor Lin, who was just squatting down to unbuckle Zhou Ze's belt, looked up at Zhou Ze upon hearing the voice.\n\nZhou Ze really wanted to shout \"continue\" \"don't stop,\"\n\nBut he gritted his teeth and pretended to be calm, saying, \"Let him come.\"\n\nDoctor Lin looked at Zhou Ze with some concern.\n\n\"He can't possibly push me into the latrine pit, can he?\" Zhou Ze smiled. \"I know what I'm doing.\"\n\nDoctor Lin nodded and walked out of the restroom. The old man walked in.\n\n\"What a coincidence. When you get old, you don't sleep soundly at night, always getting up to pee. That thing also has problems; it's not like you young people. Always frequent urination, urgency, and incomplete voiding.\"\n\nWith the old man's help, Zhou Ze finished urinating. The old man supported Zhou Ze with his arm, his back to Zhou Ze, which allowed Zhou Ze to free his hands to turn on the tap, thus avoiding embarrassment.\n\nThe old man helped Zhou Ze walk out of the restroom, and Doctor Lin was waiting outside to take over.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head, \"You go back and rest first. I'll go chat with the old man in his room.\"\n\nThe old man was stunned for a moment when he heard this, but he still nodded and said, \"Alright.\"\n\nThis old man was similar to the old Daoist priest, switching between different regional dialects. The old Daoist priest had traveled widely across the country when he was young, and the old man was probably similar, having followed the army to fight since he was very young, so his accent naturally became mixed.\n\nEntering the old man's room, the room was a bit small because a large black curtain divided it into two halves.\n\nZhou Ze only saw the old man's bed and a small tea table. There was only room for these things here.\n\nThe old man settled Zhou Ze on the bed and made him a pot of herbal tea.\n\n\"Lift the curtain, let me see,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Nothing to see. It's not suitable to look at these things at night.\"\n\n\"I want to see it,\" Zhou Ze insisted.\n\n\"Alright, if you want to see it, I'll show you. Actually, there's nothing shameful about it.\"\n\nThe old man also seemed to be in high spirits. He stood up, walked to the side of the black curtain, and then vigorously pulled it open.\n\nThis action was somewhat like a flag bearer at Tiananmen Square unfurling the national flag during the flag-raising ceremony.\n\nThe curtain was pulled back,\n\nRevealing a six-tiered platform, with each tier progressively higher. And on the platform were densely packed spirit tablets.\n\nBelow the platform was a table with offerings such as aged yellow wine, cured meat, and two incense sticks burning there.\n\n\"How lively,\"\n\nZhou Ze said.\n\nThe old man was excited, rubbing his hands excitedly, and said, \"I don't know why, but I just like the look of you, kid.\"\n\nYou've said that many times today.\n\n\"I just wanted you to come to my house and stay.\"\n\nThe old man picked up the yellow wine from the offering table, took a sip, smacked his lips, and his spirits grew even higher. He pointed to the tablets on the shelf and said:\n\n\"Come, let me introduce them to you.\n\nThis is our Company Commander Chen. I was young then, only knew to call him Company Commander Chen with everyone else, didn't know his full name. He sacrificed himself in '45, hit by an enemy mountain cannon, his body wasn't even fully recovered. What a pity, the Japanese surrendered that year, and he didn't live to see it.\n\nThese are Wang Gouzi, Zhao Sanquan, Wu Wazi, also from my squad. They sacrificed themselves during the push into the Dabie Mountains. Our regiment was responsible for rear-guard action.\n\nThese are Zhou Zhou, Sun Decai, Qin Liangyou, who sacrificed themselves in the Huai'an Campaign. That battle, tsk tsk, was fierce.\n\nThese are Zhao Peng, Sun Zhigang, Zhai Dazhuang, Ge Shufeng... They sacrificed themselves in Korea. Do you know about the American gasoline bombs? When I went to find them, they were all roasted. Damn it, even now I remember the smell of roasted human flesh. It made me not dare to eat meat for ten years afterward. Of course, it wasn't easy to get meat back then either.\n\nThis is Zhu Houquan, this is...\"\n\nThe old man rattled off many names, including where these people sacrificed themselves, and whether they were in his squad or company at the time. He spoke in great detail, meaning he had kept the information of these deceased comrades firmly in his heart and had never forgotten it.\n\nAnd Zhou Ze sat by the bed,\n\nConstantly nodding,\n\nA little awkward, as he was injured and couldn't get up.\n\nActually, Zhou Ze had figured it out: the old man couldn't see. He couldn't see that the room was actually densely packed with people.\n\nEveryone was either sitting on the floor, leaning against the wall, or sitting by the table with the offerings, some picking their ears, some reading a book, some dozing off.\n\nWhenever the old man introduced someone's name,\n\nThat person would look up, glance at Zhou Ze, and smile kindly, as if to acknowledge and meet him.\n\nZhou Ze returned the smile and nodded.\n\nThe old man finished his introductions, his voice seemingly a bit hoarse. He picked up the yellow wine from the table and took another sip.\n\n\"Great, how about it, young man, were you scared?\n\nI'm telling you, with our lineup, even a ghost official wouldn't dare enter this door!\"\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze.\n\nThe old man let out a long sigh and lamented, \"Young man, I truly like the look of you!\"\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Don't laugh at me, but as I said earlier today, I was never a coward in battle back then. I always charged to the front, but damn it, I just couldn't die. It was always my comrades falling around me. Sometimes, after a battle, I'd be the only one left in the whole squad.\n\nI don't understand why I never died and have lived until now, and quite well too. Just dabbling in antiques or whatever, and the money comes in.\"\n\n\"A life of wealth.\"\n\nZhou Ze said.\n\nThis was truly a life of wealth. If the old man hadn't joined the army and had instead gone into business or something else, he surely would have risen to success and prosperity.\n\n\"Hehe, to hell with a life of wealth. I've realized it. My comrades sacrificed themselves one by one, but I didn't die. Heaven wants me to live, to make a home for them, so that after they sacrifice themselves, they can still have a place to gather.\n\nIn the past, we couldn't afford wine or meat. Now that times are better, we can eat meat, drink wine, and snore while sleeping without worrying about marching the next day. My purpose in living is precisely this.\"\n\nZhou Ze looked at the old man and said nothing.\n\nZhou Ze also looked at the room full of people. To be honest, this was the first time Boss Zhou hadn't looked at these ghosts with a performance-oriented mindset.\n\n\"Don't laugh at me, but in recent years, as I've gotten older, I don't sleep as soundly. So every night before bed, I have a bit of yellow wine.\n\nHeh,\n\nIt really works.\n\nEvery night after I fall asleep,\n\nI dream of my old comrades. We all sit around a table, drinking, eating meat, and chatting up a storm.\n\nIt's such a joy,\n\nIt's as if they all really live in my house!\"",

    "content": "Zhou Ze didn't say anything until he finally walked out of the old man's room. He just silently admired in his heart that the old man was indeed born with a blessed life. Living with dozens of亡魂 (dead souls), he was completely unaffected and even his luck remained good.\n\nThis kind of fate was enviable.\n\nZhou Ze also didn't ask if those military souls were willing to go to hell. Perhaps their obsession was simply because the old man was still alive, and the old man was willing to offer sacrifices to them. Coupled with their past camaraderie, they were able to gather at the old man's house, drinking and chatting every night as the old man fell asleep.\n\nIt was a leisurely and peaceful life, and it didn't affect anyone around them. As a ghost messenger, he could completely let them be.\n\nIt was estimated that when the old man reached the end of his life, his soul would truly join the ranks of his comrades. Then they would all go to hell together, and the journey on the Yellow Springs Road wouldn't be lonely.\n\nIt was like fighting battles, traveling north and south in the past; as long as they were together, they wouldn't feel fear. It was all the same path, just follow the red flag.\n\nIf Zhou Ze forcibly took away these military souls, the old man would be greatly affected, almost completely disrupting the old man's original rhythm of life. Zhou Ze was genuinely worried that the old man might suffer some accident as a result.\n\nNo matter what, the old man had sincerely helped him. It would be a bit unreasonable for him to harm the old man in return.\n\nHowever, because of Zhou Ze's interruption, tonight's gathering in the old man's house ended quickly, and there was no more sound from the next room.\n\nPerhaps those military souls knew in their hearts that whether they could continue to stay here was entirely up to Zhou Ze's whim.\n\nAfter returning to the room, Dr. Lin helped Zhou Ze lie back on the bed. She was still lying on her side, looking at Zhou Ze. There had been a few twists and turns tonight. Zhou Ze couldn't sleep to begin with, and Dr. Lin hadn't slept very soundly either.\n\nHe reached out and gently caressed her hair in his hand. Zhou Ze enjoyed this feeling very much.\n\nIt had nothing to do with kinship, nothing to do with love, nothing to do with responsibility. Any normal male would feel happy with a beautiful woman lying next to him, even if he couldn't do anything.\n\n\"The experiences of the past two days have been very rich,\" Dr. Lin said.\n\nZhou Ze nodded. For an ordinary person, it was already difficult to accept that her husband had been brought back to life through borrowed corpse. At the same time, she had also experienced a series of supernatural events. It was a good thing Dr. Lin was very strong.\n\n\"Will I always see those things?\" Dr. Lin asked.\n\n\"No, it'll be fine in a couple of days. When we go back, you should take some time off and rest well.\"\n\nDr. Lin nodded; she was always very obedient.\n\n\"Are you doing well recently?\"\n\n\"Very good,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\n\"That's good.\"\n\nDr. Lin snuggled up to Zhou Ze and slowly closed her eyes, seemingly falling asleep again.\n\nZhou Ze still couldn't sleep. He simply took out the two ghost messenger badges. The centers of both badges had turned white and had obvious creases, meaning they could only endure one more \"owner recognition\" at most.\n\nTwo badges meant two official positions in hand. In the human world, people who could get official positions could walk with their noses in the air. In the underworld, these two items were even more sought after.\n\nHowever, Zhou Ze hadn't thought about how to use them. He had originally thought of finding two of those dozens of military souls to inherit them, but then it seemed impossible.\n\nIt wasn't that Zhou Ze had some kind of psychological潔癖 (purity obsession), but purely because the conditions for inheriting a ghost messenger badge were truly strict: it had to be a soul with a physical body.\n\nOrdinary souls, even if they could possess a body, were not truly \"borrowing a corpse to return a soul\" and did not meet the requirements.\n\nThose who could truly inherit this could only be him, Tang Shi, and Liang Chuan—these \"hell stowaways.\" The purpose of this badge was not to give you magical power or strength. In fact, it was only a symbolic function.\n\nIt could add luster, whitewash your gray identity, nothing more.\n\nIt was like bandits in ancient times, after their power grew, accepting the imperial court's amnesty to gain official positions. Ordinary commoner farmers didn't have this kind of treatment.\n\nTherefore, these two badges were actually quite useless—\"食之無味棄之可惜\" (tasteless to eat, a pity to discard).\n\nTo find other \"hell stowaways\" was incredibly difficult. Tang Shi once said that she searched in the human world for half a year before finding Liang Chuan, and then later found Zhou Ze himself.\n\nNow, all told, there were only three people.\n\nZhou Ze's fingertips rubbed against the ghost messenger badge. Suddenly, Zhou Ze discovered that under the stimulation of his fingernail, the badge actually emitted a blue smoke.\n\nThe smoke had a pleasant, refreshing scent.\n\nThen Zhou Ze saw that the badge seemed to be more damaged than before, so he stopped this action immediately.\n\nThis was indeed too luxurious, more luxurious than smoking the highest-grade cigars.\n\nHe put down the badge booklet and took out his phone, planning to get through tonight. Tomorrow, he would have Dr. Lin drive him back to the bookstore in Tongcheng. Xu Qinglang and the others should be working on the old Taoist's matter, which would probably require burning a large sum of paper money.\n\nFortunately, whether the old Taoist returned or not wasn't a big deal.\n\nThe key was to find that monkey.\n\nBut soon, Zhou Ze heard \"faint, rustling\" movements from the courtyard wall, as if something was climbing over it.\n\nThe sound grew louder, and it seemed there were quite a few things climbing the wall. Gradually, the noise also woke up Dr. Lin.\n\nDr. Lin's sleep quality tonight was truly concerning; she was woken up shortly after falling asleep each time.\n\nIt was like people with yin-yang eyes often had troublesome lives. When you could perceive things that ordinary people couldn't, it was indeed a very vexing matter.\n\nDr. Lin's current state would probably last for another day or two. She would only return to normal after her body's \"magnetic field\" dissipated. Moreover, she had to be careful not to catch a cold, otherwise she would easily get sick.\n\n\"Outside, there's a sound?\" Dr. Lin asked Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\nDr. Lin thought it was the \"noisy\" people next door from earlier, but it wasn't. One could only blame Zhou Ze for being idle just now, damaging the ghost messenger badge to make it emit a fragrance. This fragrance wasn't just pleasant to Zhou Ze; it also instinctively attracted some nearby solitary spirits and wild ghosts.\n\nThis was business, Zhou Ze thought, and he planned to get up and \"sign for a package\" outside.\n\nBut at this moment, from the next room, the old man came out again, seemingly heading to the outhouse.\n\nWhen one gets old, pipes are prone to rust, dripping and leaking; it's quite common.\n\nThis made Zhou Ze a little worried. Although solitary spirits and wild ghosts were usually just a few here and there, incapable of causing major trouble, the old man was old after all. If he were to be affected, the consequences could be quite serious.\n\nIf the old man had stayed in his room, protected by that group of comrades, there would naturally be nothing to worry about. But now that he had come out, there was a certain probability of an accident.\n\nMilitary souls were very different from ordinary dead souls. Their range of activity was actually very small, and they adhered to their \"discipline.\" The restrictions of this world on them were indeed stricter than on other dead souls.\n\nGeneral Chen Yi once wrote the poem, \"去泉台招舊部，旌旗十萬斬閻羅\" (Going to the netherworld to gather old troops, ten thousand banners will cut down King Yama). However, in reality, as a stability-maintaining institution of the underworld, it could tolerate you, a solitary spirit, floating around generally, making minor mischief. But if you were to form a group to cause trouble, then sorry, the underworld was not to be trifled with.\n\nMoreover, when Zhou Ze entered the courtyard earlier, he hadn't sensed the presence of those military souls. It wasn't until he entered the old man's room and the old man lifted the curtain that he saw the room full of people. This meant that these military souls could only move within the limited area of the room.\n\nNo matter what, he was the one who attracted the ghosts. He couldn't let the old man suffer because of him.\n\n\"Help me up,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nDr. Lin helped Zhou Ze out of bed.\n\nAs the two of them reached the doorway, they heard a conversation outside.\n\nIt sounded like a man and a woman.\n\n\"In the room on the left, there are so many people, they look so fierce,\" the woman said.\n\n\"Yes, but they can't come out. Don't be afraid, I'm here,\" the male ghost said.\n\n\"The room on the right, like us, also has a man and a woman. The man seems to be injured,\" the woman added.\n\nDr. Lin also heard the conversation and looked at Zhou Ze with some concern.\n\nZhou Ze, however, wasn't worried. He actually hoped they would rush directly towards his side, saving him the trouble of going out.\n\n\"No, that man is even more terrifying than everyone in the left room combined. He gives me goosebumps. Don't provoke him.\"\n\nDr. Lin looked at Zhou Ze in surprise.\n\nZhou Ze subtly raised his head,\n\nPlaying along with the man and woman's rhythm to show off in front of his girlfriend.\n\nThis ghostly couple knew their place.\n\n\"We can't go to the left, and we can't go to the right. So where is that scent coming from? There's only an old man in the outhouse. Maybe it's from him,\" the woman muttered.\n\n\"We can only try our luck there. This siheyuan is too spooky, even spookier than our graveyard.\"\n\nThe male and female ghosts seemed to have reached a consensus and prepared to target the old man.\n\nActually, Zhou Ze had underestimated the attraction of that scent to ghosts. This male and female pair had clearly been ghosts for many years, almost becoming *ghost spirits*.\n\nThe common saying \"ghostly clever\" was not just a simple adjective; it was also a noun. Any being, after cultivating to a certain degree, could become a *spirit*.\n\nThe old man, having had some wine, was a bit dizzy. His hand kept fumbling, but he just couldn't grasp his \"water pipe.\" He was very frustrated.\n\nThe male and female ghosts rushed directly into the outhouse.\n\nJust as Zhou Ze, supported by Dr. Lin, walked out of the room to deal with the situation,\n\nThey heard two horrified screams from the man and woman:\n\n\"There are ghosts!\"\n\n\"There are ghosts! There are ghosts!\"\n\nThen, as Zhou Ze watched, the man and woman swiftly shot through the courtyard wall and fled in a panic.\n\nDr. Lin looked disbelieving, even finding it unsettling, and murmured:\n\n\"That old man, is he also a ghost?\"\n\nA ghost, walking around alive, and even leading himself and Zhou Ze home? Eating with them, playing chess?\n\nZhou Ze shook his head and corrected her:\n\n\"They weren't shouting 'there are ghosts,'\n\nBut 'there is nobility,'\n\nThe nobility of a distinguished person.\"\n\nWith a distinguished person here, gods and ghosts retreat.",

    "content": "Zhou Ze suddenly felt that this old man was a treasure. Not long ago, the old Taoist priest had chatted with him about whether to enshrine a God of Wealth or a Guan Gong statue in the bookstore.\n\nNow that he thought about it, there was no need for those statues; simply inviting this old man to live in the bookstore would ensure its flourishing *feng shui*.\n\nZhou Ze had met noble people before, but this old man was almost noble to the point of being a *bug*.\n\nStill, the same could be said: he went to serve in the military. If he had pursued other professions, or if the grand historical background of his era had been different, he would undoubtedly have achieved extraordinary success.\n\nHowever, everyone's fate is different, and so are their choices. Perhaps for the old man, choosing to be a soldier and fighting alongside his comrades was the most unregretted choice.\n\nEven at ninety years old, he could still happily reunite with his comrades \"in his dreams\" every night. In this lifetime, he never felt that he had lived in vain, nor that he had wasted his life by giving up other more wonderful things.\n\nThe old man had said that he had no children, so if he left, he would truly be gone completely.\n\nPerhaps, he was still alive now, genuinely treating his home as an inn, a gathering place for his comrades who sacrificed themselves years ago.\n\nActually, from another perspective, Zhou Ze felt that the couplet hanging at the entrance of his bookstore would be more suitable for the old man's doorstep:\n\n*Listen to it as a hypothesis; this is what I heard.*\n\nZhou Ze himself, in his current state, found it difficult to reach such a level. Especially after achieving success, he had become very pragmatic in his actions and lost his former lazy and leisurely disposition.\n\nMeanwhile, the old man, in this *siheyuan*, was living in a state of \"who first awakes from the great dream, I myself know my life's course.\"\n\nHe was free and unconstrained. Though the *siheyuan* was small, his memories stretched far.\n\nEverything remained quiet until daybreak.\n\nIn the morning, Xu Qinglang drove to the *siheyuan*, with the old Taoist priest in the passenger seat. The monkey had also been found.\n\nWhen Zhou Ze was helped into the car, the old Taoist lowered his head, feeling very embarrassed.\n\nHis boss was very weak after his *Wushuang* attack.\n\nYet, on his way to deliver *mana potions* and *health potions*, he was pulled over by traffic police for driving without a license.\n\nFor Xu Qinglang to bail him out, he not only used some connections but also burned quite a bit of *joss paper*. Even though Boss Zhou hadn't said anything, the old Taoist himself felt a pang in his heart.\n\n\"Old Taoist,\" Zhou Ze began.\n\n\"Yes, Boss,\" the old Taoist glanced at his boss in the back seat, feeling very guilty.\n\n\"Let's go learn to drive together sometime soon, and get a driver's license.\"\n\n\"Uh... alright.\"\n\nActually, both Zhou Ze and the old Taoist knew how to drive, but Xu Le didn't have a license, and the old Taoist had never bothered to get one. If they were to actually take the test, it would just be a formality.\n\nAll the way, Xu Qinglang kept looking at Doctor Lin in the back through the rearview mirror;\n\nWatching her wipe Zhou Ze's face, watching her peel fruit for Zhou Ze, watching her carefully ask Zhou Ze where he felt uncomfortable.\n\nIn short, the entire car was filled with the smell of *dog food*.\n\nThe old Taoist didn't care. Anyway, every one of his ghost bosses always had endless romantic luck with women and female ghosts. This kind of thing couldn't be envied. If one wanted to envy it,\n\nthey would have to die first.\n\nThe old Taoist didn't want to die, so he was willing to endure the loneliness of being a bachelor. Zhou Ze used to ask him why he didn't find a partner and live a good life. The old Taoist replied that his ambition was to roam the four corners of the world.\n\nIf he married, he would have to disappoint so many fallen women waiting for his comfort; it would truly be their loss. So he could only sacrifice himself for the sake of everyone.\n\nTwo hours later, Xu Qinglang parked the car in front of Doctor Lin's house.\n\nBefore Doctor Lin got out, she specifically said, \"I'll send another copy of the agreement. Just sign it and mail it back to me.\"\n\nZhou Ze felt a bit disappointed. Although this trip wasn't long, it was quite eventful. However, after all their detours, it seemed they had resumed the rhythm they had before they set off.\n\nDivorce agreement.\n\nZhou Ze nodded, not trying to make her stay, nor saying anything else. He just waved to her, reminding her to rest well. After these uninspired, unnecessary words were spoken, Doctor Lin went upstairs and home. Xu Qinglang restarted the car, and twenty minutes later, they were back at the bookstore.\n\nThe old Taoist got out first, taking the monkey to dig in the mud.\n\nXu Qinglang opened the car door for Zhou Ze, handed him a cigarette, and chuckled, \"If you're really interested, be a bit bolder.\"\n\n\"And then Doctor Lin will think I'm good in bed and leave me 3,000 yuan in the nightstand?\" Zhou Ze countered.\n\n\"............\" Xu Qinglang.\n\n\"Actually, this is good. I'm not a person of the living world. Too much entanglement with me wouldn't necessarily be good for her.\"\n\n\"This isn't a romance drama; where would there be so many convoluted plots? Frankly, if it had been Doctor Lin who arrived in that Maserati that day instead of the Faceless Woman, you two would probably be nearing your delivery date by now.\"\n\nZhou Ze suddenly felt that Xu Qinglang made a lot of sense, and he couldn't find a retort.\n\n\"Of course, if all else fails, IVF is very convenient now anyway, and the Lin family has money. You can tell her parents that they've found a son-in-law who 'can't get it up,' and if they want grandchildren, they'll have to do IVF. I reckon the Lin family would be very willing to spend money on you.\"\n\nZhou Ze looked at Xu Qinglang in surprise.\n\nHe thought Xu Qinglang had gone bad.\n\nThe formerly honest and loyal Old Xu had actually learned to retaliate, and right after Zhou Ze had just satirized him.\n\nTruly, the world was going to the dogs and people's hearts were no longer pure.\n\nZhou Ze wanted to get out of the car with Xu Qinglang's help, but a white figure ran straight over, gently picked Zhou Ze up, and carried him into the bookstore, saying at the same time:\n\n\"Boss, the water temperature is all set.\"\n\nAfter Bai Yingying bathed Zhou Ze, she carried him upstairs to the bedroom. Tea and fruit were already laid out in the bedroom. Zhou Ze drank half a cup of tea, and Yingying, with great care, used her thigh as a pillow for Zhou Ze. Her hands massaged Zhou Ze's head just right, helping him slowly fall asleep.\n\nThis,\n\nwas life.\n\nThis,\n\nwas existence.\n\nWhen he woke up, it was already night. He ate something with plum juice, and then, with Bai Yingying's help, Zhou Ze went downstairs and sat on the sofa.\n\nSoon, Xu Qinglang also came downstairs. He was wearing a burgundy suit, his hair perfectly combed, and he seemed to have sprayed some cologne.\n\n\"So flashy, where are you off to?\" Zhou Ze asked, waving the newspaper in his hand.\n\n\"None of your business,\" Xu Qinglang glared at Zhou Ze.\n\nThat look perfectly conveyed the meaning of \"cheating on one's spouse.\"\n\nAfter tidying himself up in the mirror again, Xu Qinglang, feeling pleased with himself, asked Bai Yingying:\n\n\"How's this outfit?\"\n\n\"Very beautiful,\" Bai Yingying said.\n\n\"Before this outfit, you were a streetwalker fluttering in the Parisian night. After this outfit, you're the highest-priced male escort king in Shanghai.\"\n\nZhou Ze said, then took a sip of coffee.\n\n\"I didn't ask you.\"\n\nXu Qinglang dismissively waved his hand at Zhou Ze,\n\n\"Someone who can't get it up isn't qualified to talk so much.\"\n\nXu Qinglang said, looking at Bai Yingying and giving her a knowing look.\n\nBai Yingying's face turned red, and she clasped her hands, twiddling her fingers. Actually, the boss's...\n\nXu Qinglang left, taking a taxi. The bookstore still seemed to faintly carry his flamboyant scent.\n\nBai Yingying refilled Zhou Ze's coffee and said, \"Boss, Xiao Ke is still waiting for your reply about that Japanese priest.\"\n\n\"Tell her to keep an eye on it. I'm not feeling well lately.\"\n\nBai Yingying nodded, indicating she understood.\n\n............\n\nWhen he reached the door of the room,\n\nXu Qinglang hesitated.\n\nAt the same time, in his pocket, he had six thousand yuan in cash.\n\nShe had contacted him again. He didn't want to come, but he felt that some things needed to be made clear.\n\nFor example, he wasn't the male prostitute she mistook him for. So, he came, not only to return the three thousand yuan she left him last time but also to give her another three thousand yuan.\n\nThen he would very solemnly and seriously tell her,\n\nYou were great,\n\nI was very satisfied,\n\nThis is your service fee.\n\nWhew...\n\nA man,\n\nmust rise from wherever he was looked down upon.\n\nHe pressed the doorbell of the guest room.\n\nThe door opened.\n\nThe woman inside was graceful and poised. She must have just showered, without makeup, yet she was even more alluring. Her exposed skin stirred an impulse as if a devil had descended.\n\n\"I...\"\n\nXu Qinglang cleared his throat. He had just uttered one word when his lips were blocked by another pair of lips.\n\nThen,\n\n*heavenly lightning struck earthly fire*,\n\nfriction generated heat, igniting a raging inferno,\n\neverything proceeded logically,\n\nand then,\n\nthey had a fantastic time.\n\nAfter three rounds,\n\nXu Qinglang did not fall asleep. Although he was very, very tired, like an old ox exhausted from plowing, he forced himself to keep his eyes open.\n\nHe reached for his clothes. He had to pay, this time he would pay first!\n\nDignity,\n\nhe could not forget his dignity!\n\nA man with over twenty properties,\n\nmust have his dignity!\n\n\"What are you doing?\"\n\nThe woman lay in bed, holding a slender cigarette.\n\n\"Paying.\"\n\nXu Qinglang was unbuttoning his suit pocket.\n\n\"Slap!\"\n\nA stack of money was taken from under the woman's pillow and thrown in front of Xu Qinglang,\n\neasily tens of thousands.\n\nXu Qinglang was stunned.\n\nHe suddenly felt that the few thousand yuan in his pocket,\n\nseemed a bit too little to offer.\n\nHis dignity seemed to have been trampled upon once more, riddled with holes.\n\n\"I'm very satisfied with you, extremely satisfied,\" the woman said.\n\n\"I'm also very satisfied with you,\" Xu Qinglang retorted without weakness.\n\n\"Satisfied with my price, right?\"\n\n\"............\" Xu Qinglang.\n\nSoon, Xu Qinglang regained his composure, stacked the money on the bed, grabbed the woman's hand, and put the money back into her hand.\n\n\"I don't want your money, and I'm not... huh? Your wrist?\"\n\nHe hadn't noticed it last time.\n\nHe hadn't noticed it during the three rounds just now.\n\nNow Xu Qinglang noticed it.\n\nOn the woman's left wrist, there were twenty dense scars. A few of the scars were new, not yet fully healed.\n\n\"Every time I make love with a man I'm satisfied with, I feel very pleased. When I'm pleased, I want to leave something to commemorate it, something to remind me of this joyful and beautiful time in the future.\n\nLike today.\"\n\nThe woman pulled out a razor blade from somewhere with her right hand,\n\nright in front of Xu Qinglang,\n\n*Pfft*\n\nA sound,\n\na fresh red cut appeared,\n\nThe woman looked up,\n\nopened her mouth,\n\nand kept inhaling sharply,\n\nShe must have been in great pain, but her expression was one of extreme pleasure, like someone addicted to drugs finally getting their fix.\n\nThen,\n\nthe woman took the still-burning cigarette butt and directly pressed it onto the new scar.\n\n\"Hiss...!\"\n\nThe woman took a deep breath,\n\nthen sighed:\n\n\"Comfortable...\"",

    "content": "Xu Qinglang felt his scalp tingle. He had seen many ghosts and wasn't afraid of them, but this living, breathing person who had just \"shared a cloud and rain\"* with him filled him with an unspeakable dread.\n\nThe woman glanced at him, seemingly amused by his trembling, terrified demeanor. She reached out and gently tapped his chin.\n\n\"So cute, like a little quail that makes one's heart ache.\"\n\nThe woman's fingers were somewhat cold. Xu Qinglang shivered, immediately put on his clothes, and got out of bed, not daring to look at her. He left the money on the bed, didn't pick it up, and practically fled, opening the door and running out.\n\nCompared to last time, when he woke up to three thousand yuan on the nightstand, Xu Qinglang felt like he was an even bigger failure today.\n\nHe felt somewhat lost. After leaving the hotel, he squatted by the roadside curb and lit a cigarette.\n\nThis woman has mental problems.\n\nBut ignoring her scarred wrist, she was truly beautiful.\n\nIt seemed there was no such thing as absolute perfection in this world. Heaven always seemed to habitually create a flaw in beautiful things, as if that conformed to its aesthetic.\n\nFor most men, a beautiful, high-skilled woman from a respectable family who was willing to give you money and be your friend with benefits seemed like a very pleasant arrangement.\n\nIn fact, Xu Qinglang had somewhat entertained such thoughts before. That feeling of having no worries, no impact on one's life, solely pursuing a moment of fleeting pleasure, was enough to make one drop all defenses and willingly sink into it.\n\nHe reached up and ruffled his hair, feeling a little distressed.\n\nJust then, a pair of high heels appeared behind Xu Qinglang. He turned his head and saw the woman.\n\nThe woman was still smoking. Her wrist was covered by her sleeve, showing no trace of injury. She bent down, looking at Xu Qinglang. The deep cleavage of her chest was so unfathomable, enough to make most men's eyes fixated.\n\n\"Little brother, was big sister scared you?\"\n\nXu Qinglang shook his head, avoiding her gaze, and continued smoking his cigarette.\n\n\"Well, I'm leaving. I'll call you again when I'm in a better mood. Oh, and here's your money.\"\n\nThe woman took money from her bag.\n\n\"I don't want it. I'm not short on money.\"\n\nThe woman paused, as if looking at a stubborn baby, and said,\n\n\"What a coincidence, neither am I.\"\n\n\"Whoosh!\"\n\nThe woman tossed several tens of thousands of yuan in cash directly into the air. Banknotes began to flutter, drawing the attention of many passersby. Then she got into her car parked nearby and drove away.\n\nXu Qinglang sat amidst the fluttering banknotes, which made him involuntarily recall a scene from the movie *God of Gamblers* he watched as a child.\n\nThere, too, money was thrown into the air, and Chow Yun-fat and the woman danced gracefully in the rain of banknotes.\n\nSniffing, Xu Qinglang silently stood up.\n\nHe walked a few steps away,\n\nThen stopped,\n\nAnd looked back. There was a pile of money on the ground.\n\nHeh,\n\nAm I short on money?\n\nHe turned around and continued walking forward.\n\nAt this moment, several passersby on the street, seeing Xu Qinglang leave, instinctively began to gather, intending to pick up the money.\n\nXu Qinglang stopped again,\n\nAnd quickly walked back to where he was,\n\n\"I'm not short on money, but that guy is. If he knew I didn't even pick up the money on the ground for some 'face,' he'd curse me to death!\"\n\n***\n\n\"Achoo!\"\n\nIn the bookstore, Boss Zhou, who had been reading newspapers for half the night, let out a loud sneeze.\n\n\"Boss, are you catching a cold?\" Bai Yingying asked with concern.\n\n\"Heh, someone must be thinking of him,\" the old Daoist priest muttered, counting on his fingers. \"Tsk tsk tsk, so it must be.\"\n\n\"The floor is a bit dirty, needs another mop,\" Zhou Ze said slowly.\n\nThe old Daoist priest immediately pulled a long face, begrudgingly picked up the mop, and started cleaning.\n\nJust then, a Porsche stopped in front of the bookstore. A finely dressed, elegant woman entered. The woman was around thirty, exuding a graceful air from head to toe.\n\n\"Wow, she's so beautiful, like a lotus emerging from water,\" Bai Yingying exclaimed from the side.\n\nThis was normal, as the woman was indeed beautiful, the kind that became more captivating the more you looked at her.\n\n\"The dewdrops on the lotus haven't been wiped off yet.\"\n\nZhou Ze chuckled.\n\nThe woman's cheeks were flushed, her eyes moist, and she carried a relaxed air, like the earth newly nourished by spring rain, pregnant with new life.\n\n\"Who is the boss?\"\n\nThe woman scanned her surroundings and asked.\n\nZhou Ze frowned. Who was the boss?\n\nCould this high school girl holding coffee be the boss?\n\nCould that old farmer grunting and mopping the floor be the boss?\n\nThere were only three people in the shop.\n\nWho was the boss?\n\nAre you blind?\n\nZhou Ze curled his lips, ignoring her. Anyway, she was a living person, not a ghost.\n\nAs a result, no one actually responded to the woman.\n\nBai Yingying went to organize the counter, the old Daoist priest continued mopping,\n\nZhou Ze continued to lounge on the sofa.\n\n\"I have something important to discuss. I'm looking for your boss. Wang Ke recommended me.\"\n\nUpon hearing Wang Ke's name, Zhou Ze slowly sat up straight.\n\nThe woman saw Zhou Ze, walked over, and sat on the sofa opposite him.\n\nShe spoke directly:\n\n\"My husband has been having some psychological issues recently. He keeps thinking he's seeing ghosts. I asked Dr. Wang to see him, and Dr. Wang recommended me here to you. He said you're an expert in this field.\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't answer the woman. Instead, he took out his phone, intending to chew out Wang Ke. They had agreed Wang Ke wouldn't create trouble for him, but here he was pushing a difficult case his way.\n\nDid his previous promises mean nothing?\n\nThere were limits to helping and caring for friends, after all. Zhou Ze had never considered himself a living Lei Feng.\n\nBefore he could dial the number,\n\nA bank card was thrown onto the coffee table by the woman.\n\n\"There's a million in this card. The password is 003003.\"\n\nZhou Ze's process of calling Wang Ke to reprimand him was interrupted. Zhou Ze felt angry. Didn't you see I was about to make a call?\n\nWhat's the meaning of throwing a card on the coffee table, saying there's a million inside, and even telling me the password?\n\nDon't you know that a single piece of burial goods my maid casually throws out is worth hundreds of thousands?\n\nDon't you know that the old man who mops my floor can make a fortune by just livestreaming sales of冥鈔*?\n\nHaven't you seen that my hired cook owns over twenty properties?\n\nZhou Ze put down his phone,\n\nReached out,\n\nAnd picked up the card.\n\nSigh,\n\nHe was still too kind, too focused on friendship.\n\nHe still had to help his friends.\n\n\"This is a deposit,\"\n\nThe woman added.\n\nZhou Ze's hand trembled slightly.\n\nSigh, his injury hadn't fully healed yet, so his body was a bit weak. His hand was trembling just picking up a small card.\n\n\"Yingying, we have a guest. Why aren't you serving coffee?\" Zhou Ze called out to the counter, clearly displeased.\n\n\"Coming!\"\n\nBai Yingying immediately brought over the coffee.\n\nThe woman calmly watched Zhou Ze. She enjoyed the feeling of using money to make people submit.\n\nWhether in bed or out of it, whether men or women, her money was always effective.\n\n\"Tell me about your situation. How old is your husband?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"He's ninety-three this year,\" the woman replied.\n\nZhou Ze unexpectedly looked at the woman a second time.\n\n\"Yes, I'm with him because I'm after his money and inheritance. Then I told him we were true love, and the old man, feeling good about himself, believed it.\"\n\nThe woman continued to speak calmly:\n\n\"Thank you for your honesty.\"\n\n\"Even if I weren't honest, you'd still think that way.\"\n\nThe woman picked up the coffee, took a sip, and frowned slightly.\n\n\"No sugar.\"\n\n\"I don't like sugar,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nThe woman put down the coffee. \"Anyway, whenever you have time, you can come to my house and see my husband. He's been too paranoid recently, making normal married life impossible.\"\n\n\"Pfftt...\"\n\nZhou Ze, who was drinking coffee, choked.\n\nBai Yingying carefully helped her boss wipe his mouth with a tissue, then retreated.\n\n\"Begging your pardon, but I think you should be hoping he kicks the bucket soon.\"\n\n\"Hm, he was almost dead before, practically bedridden. But ever since he started claiming to see ghosts, his spirits have visibly improved.\"\n\nThe woman continued, looking troubled:\n\n\"At this rate, I don't think he'll be dying anytime soon, I mean, of natural causes.\"\n\n\"I understand. And then, what's your intention in asking for my help?\"\n\n\"To fix his current state. I don't care if it's a psychotic version of senile dementia or if he's truly being haunted. I want him to return to normal, and then continue to lie in bed and quietly wait to die, just like before.\"\n\n\"Alright, I agree. I'll do my best to cure your husband's illness.\"\n\nA cold smile surfaced on the woman's lips,\n\n\"Hypocrite.\"\n\n\"By the way, did your husband say who was bothering him?\n\nI mean, what's the identity of the ghost haunting him?\n\nDoes he know them?\"\n\n\"His ex-wife, his son, his daughter, his grandson, his granddaughter, and his great-grandson, great-granddaughter.\"\n\nThe woman counted on her fingers,\n\n\"Many, many people.\"\n\n\"Excuse me, are they already...?\"\n\n\"Five years ago, their entire family had a gathering on a cruise ship, and then they encountered an accident. The cruise ship sank, and everyone on board perished. That is, his entire family, except for him, who happened to be ashore on business that day, all died.\"\n\n\"Hmm.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded upon hearing this.\n\nIn that case, it was entirely possible that the old man was being tormented by lingering spirits, or it was a mental issue caused by excessive psychological pressure.\n\n\"Then how long have you been married to him?\"\n\n\"Five years.\"\n\nThe woman still replied calmly.\n\nZhou Ze didn't ask further questions, instead continuously weighing the bank card in his hand.\n\nThis was a muddy water, no, quite possibly a cesspit.\n\nIf he stepped in, he might get himself dirty, at the very least, he would smell the stench.\n\n\"A deposit of one million, and five million upon completion,\" the woman looked at Zhou Ze, her smooth fingers lightly touching the back of Zhou Ze's hand.\n\nBai Yingying watched from the side and pouted. So old, and still trying to seduce men!\n\nYingying hadn't considered that in terms of age, everyone else in the bookstore, including the old Daoist priest, combined wouldn't be as old as she was.\n\n\"Plus, I'll sleep with you three times.\"\n\nThe woman added.\n\nBai Yingying's face grew even uglier.\n\nGānlínniáng!*\n\nShameless!*\n\nZhou Ze calmly moved the woman's hand away,\n\nAnd said:\n\n\"How about canceling the latter condition and changing it to eight million?\"\n\n---\n* 巫山雲雨 (wūshānyúnyǔ): A Chinese idiom literally meaning \"clouds and rain over Mount Wu,\" often used euphemistically to refer to sexual intercourse.\n* 冥鈔 (míngchāo): Spirit money or joss paper, paper offerings burned in traditional Chinese ancestor worship and funerals.\n* 甘霖娘 (gānlínniáng): A vulgar expression in some Chinese dialects, roughly equivalent to \"damn your mother\" or \"motherfucker.\"\n* 湊表臉 (còubiǎoliǎn): A colloquial and somewhat crude term meaning \"shameless\" or \"disgraceful.\"",

    "content": "The woman gave him her business card, set a time, and provided the address, indicating that Zhou Ze should visit her home tomorrow at noon.\n\nAs soon as the woman left, Bai Yingying stood beside Zhou Ze, timidly saying:\n\n\"Boss, tomorrow, can you let the old Taoist priest mind the store? I'll go with you.\"\n\n\"Hm? What's wrong?\"\n\n\"Look at you, Boss, you're still injured. The old Taoist priest's meager skills are fine against ordinary people, but against ghosts, he's useless beyond fumbling in his pants. It's not safe to take him, so take me instead.\"\n\n\"…………\" The floor-mopping old Taoist priest.\n\n\"Alright,\" Zhou Ze nodded in agreement. Actually, from how Bai Yingying single-handedly pulverized that Corpse Ghoul last time, her combat power was indeed very strong.\n\n\"It's fine, Boss has problems in that area, you know that. What are you worrying about?\n\nAlthough one million for sleeping with a woman is indeed too expensive, for such a top-tier beauty, one million for one night isn't a loss. See, even this Boss gave up.\"\n\nThe old Taoist priest, having finished mopping the floor, wiped his sweat and comforted Bai Yingying.\n\nThough the old Taoist priest had never been married or started a family, hadn't he at least seen a pig run even if he hadn't eaten pork?\n\n\"Old Taoist priest,\" Zhou Ze called out, holding his coffee cup.\n\n\"Here, Boss, what's up?\"\n\n\"The floor is dirty.\"\n\n\"Dirty? Impossible! I just mopped it clean!\"\n\n\"Oh.\"\n\nZhou Ze gently tilted his coffee cup, spilling coffee onto the floor.\n\n\"It's dirty now. Mop it again.\"\n\n\"…………\" The old Taoist priest.\n\nIn the latter half of the night, Zhou Ze went upstairs to rest. Xu Qinglang returned close to morning, completely drunk, and went straight to his room on the second floor after arriving at the bookstore.\n\nBy the time Zhou Ze woke up the next morning, Xu Qinglang hadn't emerged from his room yet.\n\n\"Where is he?\"\n\nZhou Ze looked at the takeout breakfast in front of him, immediately knowing that the household chef was absent.\n\n\"He got drunk last night and hasn't woken up yet. He reeked of alcohol when he came back,\" the old Taoist priest explained.\n\nZhou Ze nodded, saying nothing more.\n\nAfter breakfast, Zhou Ze changed into casual clothes, then turned his head and called out to Bai Yingying:\n\n\"Bring me my cane.\"\n\nBai Yingying and the old Taoist priest were arguing about something behind the counter. Hearing Zhou Ze call her, she immediately ran over with the cane, then frantically winked at the old Taoist priest.\n\n\"What's wrong?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Nothing, I was just reminding the old Taoist priest to tell Old Xu to wake up and cook dinner tonight. Boss, you're still recovering, and takeout isn't nutritious.\"\n\n\"It's fine.\"\n\nLeaning on his cane, supported by Bai Yingying, Zhou Ze walked out of the bookstore and took a taxi.\n\nStanding behind the counter, the old Taoist priest scratched his head helplessly and pulled out an electric wheelchair.\n\nTo curry favor with the boss, he had ordered this electric wheelchair immediately after the boss went 'Rampage' in Yancheng last time. He had just been thinking of giving it to the boss as a surprise gift.\n\nWho knew that the zombie insisted she wouldn't let him present it, even saying he might die if he did?\n\nOh dear,\n\nThis female zombie is becoming more and more jealous. I'm a man, surely I can't compete with you for favor?\n\nShe even dared to threaten to kill me.\n\nThinking this, the old Taoist priest helplessly reached out and pressed a button on the wheelchair.\n\nThe wheelchair began to play music:\n\n\"Woo woo woo woo woo... Little, little scholar, carrying his schoolbag to school...\"\n\nWhile playing music, the wheelchair also started moving on its own, spinning in place.\n\nSo joyful, so joyful.\n\n\"I'll give it to the Boss when he comes back tonight.\"\n\n………………\n\nAfter taking a taxi to the address, Zhou Ze was somewhat surprised to see not a mansion, but a rural residence.\n\nA three-story house with its own courtyard wall. While such a house was spacious and offered much freedom, it wasn't actually expensive, at least not compared to the woman's casual gesture of throwing down a card worth a million. Living here seemed a bit mismatched.\n\nHe rang the doorbell.\n\nA woman wearing house clothes and an apron emerged from inside. Only after she opened the door did Zhou Ze realize that this woman, who looked more like a respectable housewife than a respectable housewife, was the same one who had visited his bookstore yesterday.\n\nClothes make the man, or woman. The woman now looked completely different, at least in temperament, compared to yesterday.\n\n\"Please come in.\"\n\nThe woman bowed slightly, motioning for Zhou Ze and Bai Yingying to enter, then closed the door.\n\n\"After my husband fell ill, he insisted on moving here. This used to be his old home, treated as an ancestral residence for decades, unused. A few years ago, it was renovated and this house was rebuilt.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded, simultaneously stepping into the hall. The hall's layout was also very ordinary, like any regular home. On the south wall hung a divine image, whose identity Zhou Ze honestly didn't recognize.\n\nThere were also incense and candles, and a table.\n\n\"My husband is on the second floor. Please follow me.\"\n\nThe woman kept her gaze down, seemingly this was her demeanor at home—a perfect, good wife.\n\nBai Yingying kept staring at her. Although she had faith in her boss,\n\nBut,\n\nHeh, men!\n\nThey went up the stairs to the second floor. As soon as the balcony door was pushed open, Zhou Ze saw the hallway of the balcony covered in talismans of all kinds.\n\nBai Yingying instinctively took a step back. Zhou Ze shook his head, signaling her not to be afraid.\n\nThese talismans were all merely for show.\n\nWalking further in, the door to the second room was opened. Zhou Ze saw it was a tatami-style room. An old man with white hair, just skin and bones, sat there, mumbling to himself, as if chatting and talking with someone.\n\nZhou Ze also noticed one thing: from the main entrance, or rather, from the road outside the main entrance all the way to every corner of this house, there were surveillance cameras.\n\nPresumably, even the bathroom was no exception.\n\nTherefore, in this place, the woman had to keep up appearances. The old man must have had contingencies for his inheritance; wealthy people weren't usually too foolish.\n\nZhou Ze sat down next to the old man, reached for a bottle of red wine, poured a glass, and took a sip.\n\nIt tasted good. He was a man who knew how to enjoy himself.\n\nThe old man was probably \"playing\" with his great-grandchildren, constantly making cooing noises like he was teasing children and telling them stories.\n\nZhou Ze leaned back and listened. For now, it seemed the old man had mental problems, as Zhou Ze didn't see any ghosts in the room.\n\nBai Yingying stood at the doorway, then after a while, felt a bit bored and walked out onto the balcony, looking at the view of the farmland outside.\n\nThe woman brought over some dim sum and placed it before Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head, indicating he didn't need any, then clapped his hands and called out:\n\n\"Old man, is this your great-grandson?\"\n\n\"Ah?\" The old man's eyes were somewhat cloudy, but within that cloudiness, there was an unusual excitement.\n\nThe woman had previously said that her husband was already bedridden, waiting for him to pass away so she could inherit the estate. Now, however, the old man was sometimes delirious, sometimes perfectly normal, but his spirits were improving day by day; he could eat, move, and get out of bed. It was said to be a final burst of energy before death, but wasn't it lasting too long?\n\n\"Yes, my great-grandson. Come, Junjun, say hello to this uncle.\"\n\nThe old man motioned for the 'great-grandson' in front of him to come over.\n\n\"Oh, so well-behaved.\"\n\nZhou Ze praised, even though he saw absolutely nothing.\n\nNext,\n\nIt was time for Boss Zhou and the old man to chat. The old man talked about his business, recounting how he started from humble beginnings in middle age and how he later improved his family's life.\n\nZhou Ze initially didn't know much, but later learned that the old man's ancestral home was Tongcheng, but he had smuggled himself to Southeast Asia when he was young and made his fortune there. After the reform and opening up, he returned, cut off his previous smuggling business, whitewashed his identity, and invested as an overseas Chinese returnee.\n\nTruly, this old man was a minor legend; his rags-to-riches story could be a motivational autobiography.\n\nZhou Ze listened with great interest. The old man even had his great-granddaughter and great-grandson recite ancient poetry and sing. Zhou Ze still saw nothing, but he clapped and cheered nonetheless.\n\nThe whole process was a bit like those young celebrities filming movies with green screens, where a stunt double films the scene, and then the star's face is digitally pasted on later.\n\nAs they chatted, the woman came again.\n\n\"Husband, Mr. Zhou, lunch is ready. We can eat now.\"\n\nAt the woman's words, the old man's previous amiability vanished. He became fierce, a ferocity that seemed like bravado, yet he roared with fear:\n\n\"They're all downstairs, they're all downstairs! I'm not going, I'm not going! They're all downstairs waiting for me!\"\n\nThe old man, shouting, curled up on the tatami, looking utterly terrified.\n\nThe woman, somewhat helpless, looked at Zhou Ze, motioning for him to come down for a meal.\n\nZhou Ze stood up and bid the old man farewell.\n\nJust as he was about to leave, his hand was gripped by the old man.\n\nThe old man said very seriously, \"Don't go down. They are down there. They are down there. They were sent back by the Dragon King of the Sea. They will eat you. Seriously, if you go down, you'll die!\"\n\n\"Hmm, don't worry. I'm sent by Sun Wukong to return the Ruyi Jingu Bang. Don't worry.\"\n\nZhou Ze reached out and patted the old man's shoulder, taking advantage of the old man chewing on his last sentence to slip away.\n\nThe three walked together from the balcony towards the staircase.\n\nThe woman quietly asked, \"Is there a way to treat him?\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head and said, \"Let Wang Ke examine him. This old man probably has psychological issues or a rare type of Alzheimer's. There are no ghosts around him.\"\n\n\"Then there's no need to refund the deposit. Just have lunch before you go. I'm better at French and Japanese cuisine; my Chinese cooking skills are only average.\"\n\nIf there were ghosts, Zhou Ze would have seen them.\n\nIt was a pity; this business couldn't be done.\n\n\"Come back! Come back!\"\n\nThe old man suddenly stood at the room door and shouted.\n\nZhou Ze looked back, then continued to walk downstairs with the woman.\n\n\"Then there's no need to refund the deposit. Just have lunch before you go. I'm better at French and Japanese cuisine; my Chinese cooking skills are only average,\" the woman said modestly.\n\nThey descended the stairs and reached the hall. Honestly, Zhou Ze truly wanted to sample the woman's cooking.\n\nTherefore, to marry into a wealthy family and achieve the status of an old husband and young wife, one truly needed some real skill. This path was not easy.\n\nIf you just wanted to lie on your dorm bed watching TV and fantasizing, it would likely remain a fantasy forever.\n\nHowever,\n\nWhen Zhou Ze turned into the living room,\n\nHe froze.\n\nBai Yingying behind him also froze.\n\nAround the table in the hall,\n\nPeople were seated,\n\nOld and young, male and female, four generations under one roof.\n\nTheir entire family, neatly seated there,\n\nEach person staring at the rice bowl in front of them, with a pair of chopsticks stuck upright in each bowl.\n\nAt the same time,\n\nEvery one of them was soaking wet,\n\nWater droplets occasionally dripped from their chins and the hems of their clothes,\n\nThe living room floor was already wet,\n\nAs if it had just been mopped.",

    "content": "Zhou Ze's lips parted, then he instinctively grabbed the woman who was still walking forward.\n\nThe woman looked at Zhou Ze, somewhat surprised, not knowing what he intended.\n\n\"I take back what I just said.\"\n\nZhou Ze gently twisted his neck,\n\n\"Your house, it's really not clean.\"\n\nA thoughtful expression appeared on the woman's face.\n\n\"Don't worry, I'm not some charlatan.\"\n\n\"I believe you're not a charlatan.\" The woman said very seriously, \"Besides, it's only a few million; being scammed, it's no big deal.\"\n\nThat remark,\n\nIt stung,\n\nSo grating.\n\nA few million like a few hundred, just for peace of mind?\n\nWhat a spendthrift woman.\n\nZhou Ze silently mourned for the old man upstairs. Why bother at such an old age? All the family wealth he painstakingly built up would fall into this woman's hands?\n\nFortunately, Zhou Ze still had some professional ethics. This woman hired him, so he wouldn't stir up more trouble.\n\nOf course, in Bai Yingying's eyes, Zhou Ze and this woman at this moment truly seemed like partners in crime, a living, breathing modern-day version of Wu Dalang and Pan Jinlian.\n\nIf it were made into a TV series, the boss and this woman would be typical villains!\n\n\"Your husband isn't mentally disturbed; there really are unclean things here. Let's not talk about money for now; we can discuss it slowly after I've handled things here.\n\nYingying, take her upstairs.\"\n\n\"Boss, you alone...\" Bai Yingying didn't want to go up; the boss was injured.\n\nZhou Ze wanted to poke his maid's forehead with his middle finger right then. It didn't matter if something happened to him, but if something happened to this woman, who would he get his final payment from?\n\nThe woman was very obedient. Even though she couldn't see anything, she at least showed an attitude of \"I believe,\" actively stepping back.\n\nShe really was a smart woman, sensible, capable of changing her demeanor; wanton in bed, ladylike out of bed, good at cooking and acting, and could even pretend to be understanding.\n\nZhou Ze glanced at Bai Yingying again. Sigh, his own Yingying had so much to learn.\n\nUnder Zhou Ze's stern gaze, Bai Yingying could only accompany the woman upstairs; she needed to protect this woman and the old man.\n\nNext, the entire hall was left with only that family and Zhou Ze.\n\nThese people had maintained upright postures, like elementary students in class, sitting perfectly straight, even the oldest grandmother.\n\nThat grandmother should be the old man's original wife upstairs.\n\nOrdinary people, even if a deceased relative's soul lingered to visit, would at most be one or two. But this old man, good heavens, an entire family, four generations under one roof. Zhou Ze counted, and there were actually twenty-some people.\n\nThe scale of this \"family reunion\" was indeed immense; no wonder the old man was so terrified.\n\nIf it were his old wife returning, or a child, or a granddaughter, that would be acceptable. But an entire family returning together would scare anyone stiff.\n\nLeaning on his crutch, Zhou Ze approached them. The closer he got, the more clearly Zhou Ze perceived a chilling sensation constantly assailing him, and the surrounding air carried a strong salty and damp smell.\n\nThis family of the old man's was said to have perished at sea when their cruise ship had an accident. As for whether there were any hidden truths, Zhou Ze didn't know, nor did he want to know.\n\nRegardless, this family before him, when counted, was a considerable achievement. He could just collect them.\n\n\"Gulp...\"\n\n\"Gulp...\"\n\nThe sound of water began to emanate,\n\nThe water sounds came from these people's necks. From the oldest grandmother to the youngest child of a few years old, their necks were distended, like bloated frogs.\n\nImmediately after,\n\n\"Ugh...\"\n\nIn the hall, everyone began to vomit.\n\nTurbid seawater mixed with sand poured from their mouths, even carrying some dead fish and shrimp!\n\nThe hall before had only looked like it had just been mopped,\n\nBut now,\n\nIt was like a seafood market, emitting a strong stench of seafood, like the smell of a certain room in a love hotel that had been used continuously for a month without the sheets being changed.\n\nZhou Ze covered his nose with his hand and lifted his foot, only to find that the seawater had risen to his ankles.\n\nThe hall was like a reservoir, and these twenty-odd people were like twenty-odd faucets at the edge of the pool, releasing water into it.\n\nThe water accumulated without dispersing, slowly filling the hall.\n\nZhou Ze leaned over and placed a hand on the shoulder of a middle-aged man, his fingernails growing out and piercing directly into the man's shoulder.\n\n\"Sizzle, sizzle, sizzle...\"\n\nThe sound of oil frying echoed, and thick black smoke began to rise from the middle-aged man's body, but he remained seated, motionless, as if completely submitting to Zhou Ze's actions.\n\n\"Snap...\"\n\nA crisp sound came from under Zhou Ze's foot,\n\nAnd then,\n\nA greenish belt wrapped around Zhou Ze's arm. Zhou Ze subconsciously retreated; this belt was very agile and shot right over.\n\nWhen one end of the belt lifted and was less than a millimeter from Zhou Ze's eyes, it stopped.\n\nThis was no belt; it was clearly a sea snake, entirely green.\n\nThe sea snake flicked its tongue. After gaining a perfect attacking posture, it stopped, seeming to only want to deter Zhou Ze.\n\nThe water around them began to increase, as if the contents of these twenty-odd people's stomachs would never run out. At this point, the water level in the living room had reached Zhou Ze's waist.\n\nThis was false, yet it was real.\n\nZhou Ze could choose to escape this sensation, then choose to leave, but that would mean admitting defeat, stepping down from the ring.\n\nNot to mention whether he'd get his service fee, he wouldn't be able to collect these souls for his业绩¹.\n\n\"Plop...\"\n\nThe painting hanging on the living room wall was also washed down by the water and slowly floated towards Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze had previously thought this idol was strange, because in ordinary homes, people usually hung images of Maitreya Buddha, Guanyin, or the God of Wealth in their halls, but the deity in this painting was clearly not a common one.\n\nThe figure in the painting was a man, with a fish-like body but human hands and feet, riding a two-headed dragon. It was definitely a god, but ordinary households almost never hung this; it was quite unconventional.\n\nAt this moment, the sea snake seemed to be slowly contracting its body. Zhou Ze also felt a clamping force on his wrist; this was a warning, the second warning.\n\nWarning Zhou Ze,\n\nThat this matter,\n\nHe didn't need to interfere.\n\nThe painting slowly floated in front of Zhou Ze, touching his body.\n\nZhou Ze frowned slightly and thought hard. Finally, he remembered who this deity in the painting was!\n\nSo, he really had to thank himself for reading more books after becoming a bookstore owner. He'd sit on the sofa downstairs, drinking coffee and reading books when he had nothing to do, and he'd specifically brushed up on ancient supernatural stories.\n\nThis was...the Sea God!\n\nFor people today, when the Sea God is mentioned, the first thoughts are usually Mazu or Poseidon. However, in Chinese mythology, there is actually an older Sea God.\n\nA passage from \"Shanhaijing, Great Wilderness East\": \"In the isle of the Eastern Sea there is a god, with a human face and bird body, wearing two yellow snakes as earrings, and treading on two yellow snakes, named Yu Guo. The Yellow Emperor begat Yu Guo, Yu Guo begat Yu Jing, Yu Jing resides in the Northern Sea, Yu Guo resides in the Eastern Sea, thus being the Sea God.\"\n\nThe ancient Sea God. Moreover, considering the old man upstairs started his business in maritime smuggling, hanging this idol in his home was understandable.\n\nBut what did this mean?\n\nA group of deceased relatives who died at sea suddenly returning for revenge five years later?\n\nWho brought them back?\n\nWho allowed them to return?\n\nPeople who died in remote places, especially those who died unnaturally, their souls are actually very difficult to return. That's why in folk customs, when burning scriptures and joss paper, there is an indispensable step called \"summoning the soul,\" meaning to bring back the souls of those being commemorated to enjoy the incense and offerings from their descendants.\n\nAnd those who died at sea, they either went directly to hell, or even if they could remain as souls, they'd be like in \"Pirates of the Caribbean,\" only able to sink to the bottom of the sea or drift around with some ghost ship.\n\nNow, this entire family, neat and tidy, came back together, sitting properly, to visit the old man. Without external force pushing them, without the tacit approval of a certain party,\n\nIs it possible?\n\nCould it be,\n\nDid the Sea God truly become enraged?\n\nIt's almost certain that there was something suspicious about the deaths of the old man's family, and the old man married this woman that very year.\n\nIf a certain great deity truly became enraged and came to mete out punishment and retribution,\n\nWould he, a mere ghost messenger,\n\nTruly have no right to stop it?\n\nMoreover, to go against a sea entity for the sake of \"making money,\"\n\nIsn't that a bit foolish?\n\nZhou Ze looked up. The woman and the old man should be upstairs. The woman wanted the old man to die of natural causes to inherit his estate, and spiritual entities wouldn't be caught on surveillance.\n\n\"Hey, buddy, let's talk about something. Can the old man die a more natural death?\n\nAnd then, can I take the old man's new wife upstairs with me?\"\n\nZhou Ze asked the painting.\n\n\"Hiss!\"\n\nThe sea snake suddenly became enraged,\n\nAnd directly opened its fangs, biting towards Zhou Ze's chest.\n\nZhou Ze's eyes narrowed. He had been on guard against this snake. He immediately gripped the snake's tail with his fingertips, and the tongue stopped mere centimeters from Zhou Ze's chest.\n\n\"You won't even talk? Give me some room for negotiation, Big Brother.\"\n\nZhou Ze said with a bitter smile.\n\nAlthough I'm a ghost messenger, the lowest-ranking Yin Division cadre, I'm still a cadre, after all. Don't ignore me like this, big shot.\n\n\"Hiss, hiss, hiss, hiss!\"\n\nThe sea snake twisted its body frantically,\n\nWith a \"crunch,\"\n\nThe snake's body broke directly, and its head flew to Zhou Ze's chest, biting into his body.\n\nIn an instant,\n\nZhou Ze felt not bodily injury, but a sharp pain in his soul, as if his soul had been pierced by the snake's fangs, leaving two holes.\n\nCold sweat immediately poured down, and Zhou Ze knelt down, one hand on the ground to prevent himself from falling into the \"water.\"\n\n\"Hoo... hoo...\"\n\nZhou Ze forcibly pulled the snake's head out,\n\nHis black fingernails directly crushed the snake's head.\n\n\"You're being unreasonable...\"\n\nZhou Ze muttered, his face growing darker and darker,\n\nThen, he slowly looked up, and in the depths of his eyes, black light flowed,\n\n\"Then I'd like to see if you can actually come ashore from the sea and show off!\"\n\n***\n¹ 业绩 (yèjì): performance, achievement, accomplishment. In this context, it refers to the number of souls Zhou Ze collects as a ghost messenger, which would count towards his professional performance or quota.",

    "content": "\"I say, little sister, is your boss's side job a Taoist priest or a monk?\"\n\nOn the balcony, the woman took out a thin cigarette and silently puffed on it. At home, under surveillance, she would never smoke; she always deliberately maintained the image of a good, virtuous wife.\n\nBut for some reason, at this moment, she felt restless and wanted to calm her emotions with a cigarette.\n\n\"You've got it backward. Running the bookstore is the side job,\" Bai Yingying replied.\n\n\"Oh, how interesting.\"\n\nThe woman reached out to help Bai Yingying tidy her hair bun, and said softly, \"Did he brainwash you? You worship him so much?\"\n\nBai Yingying looked at the woman with a gaze that suggested she was looking at an idiot.\n\nThe woman shook her head. She didn't believe it, but as she had said, since Wang Ke recommended him, she was willing to throw a few million *yuan* away to try.\n\nThe old man, curled up at the bedroom door, looked at his wife and Bai Yingying, waving and shouting, \"Come in! Quickly, hide inside! They'll come, they're coming, they really are coming!\"\n\nThe woman ignored her husband and continued to smoke her cigarette.\n\nBai Yingying paid him even less mind. She was worried about her boss downstairs, wondering if anything unexpected would happen to him.\n\nThe boss had just unleashed his full power in Yancheng, and now his physical condition was very poor. In other words, his skills were still on cooldown, and the risk factor would naturally increase.\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nThe living room door downstairs was pushed open.\n\nZhou Ze, covered in cold sweat, stumbled out. He was drenched from head to toe, as if soaked in sweat.\n\n\"Huff… huff…\"\n\nLying on the ground, Zhou Ze gasped for air, as if air was precious to him, extremely cherished.\n\n\"Boss!\"\n\nBai Yingying on the balcony called out anxiously.\n\nZhou Ze scrambled to his feet, picked up the cane that had fallen beside him, and waved to her, signaling Bai Yingying not to come down. Then he walked back into the living room.\n\nAbout ten minutes later,\n\nZhou Ze tumbled out again. This time, Zhou Ze lay for a full five minutes before slowly getting up. Supporting himself with his cane, Zhou Ze looked a bit shaky.\n\n\"Boss…\"\n\nBai Yingying called out again.\n\n\"Don't come down. Protect them. I refuse to believe that a mighty dragon can't overpower a local snake!\"\n\nZhou Ze continued to walk inside.\n\nThe woman blew out a smoke ring and said, \"What a convincing performance.\"\n\nEvidently, she thought Zhou Ze was putting on a show, just like those Taoist priests performing rituals, simply to entertain the audience and earn money.\n\n\"Uh…\"\n\nThe woman was speechless,\n\nBecause Bai Yingying's hand was directly gripping her neck,\n\nHer feet were already off the ground. This high school girl had effortlessly lifted her with just one hand.\n\n\"This isn't a performance.\"\n\nBai Yingying said very seriously,\n\n\"If anything really happens to the boss, rest assured, I will definitely take it out on you.\"\n\n\"He… he himself… for… for money…\" the woman struggled to retort.\n\n\"You're a woman, don't you know a basic principle?\" Bai Yingying retorted.\n\n\"What… what…\"\n\n\"That is, don't reason with a woman.\"\n\n...\n\nZhou Ze re-entered the living room. By now, the living room was almost completely flooded with liquid, and the twenty-odd people were still continuously spitting out water.\n\nIt was truly endless, a genuine deluge.\n\nAnd the sea snake, which Zhou Ze had initially decapitated, had now transformed into a water python, with a thick, barrel-like body, swimming back and forth, exuding immense pressure.\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, the giant python's body was also bruised and battered, with many places missing scales. Clearly, it had been severely wounded in its repeated clashes with Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Hiss hiss hiss…\"\n\nThe water python charged again.\n\nZhou Ze raised his head, gritting his teeth, and extended his hands. The tips of his fingernails were bleeding again, clearly reaching their breaking point from the strain.\n\nHis body was indeed somewhat weak from the previous exertions in Yancheng.\n\nIf he were at his peak, Zhou Ze felt he wouldn't be in such a sorry state.\n\nThis was just a sea snake, even if it claimed the title of a Sea God; it was still just a snake. In a one-on-one fight, he wouldn't be intimidated.\n\nZhou Ze was actually worried that if a 'Sea God' truly existed in this world, his choice this time might provoke them.\n\nOf course, they hadn't given him a choice either.\n\nZhou Ze wanted to back down, to retreat. He preferred not to fight, to avoid poking the tiger's whiskers if possible, but the other party's attitude was too aggressive, not giving him any room to back down.\n\nBoss Zhou loved money, and he loved performance, but he loved his life more.\n\n\"Hiss hiss…\"\n\nThe water python's body collided with Zhou Ze again, sending him tumbling to the ground, his face pale. But Zhou Ze's fingernails, seizing the opportunity, plunged into the water python's body, extracting a red halo of light, which he instantly crushed!\n\nNext, the water python and Zhou Ze lay on the ground together, staring at each other.\n\nThe water python tried to coil up several times but failed. Zhou Ze also wanted to get up, but he couldn't.\n\nOne man and one snake, staring each other down, refusing to concede defeat, locked in a stalemate.\n\n\"Aren't you tired?\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nThe water python didn't respond, just stared intently at Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Did the Sea God really send you?\" Zhou Ze continued to ask.\n\nThe water python still didn't respond.\n\nZhou Ze took a deep breath. You could actually talk to a person, but with a beast,\n\nHow do you talk?\n\nAs if discerning Zhou Ze's thoughts, the water python suddenly raised its head, its gaze filled with anger as it stared at Zhou Ze.\n\nHuh,\n\nJust like that monkey,\n\nCan it directly sense people's thoughts?\n\n\"Buzz!\"\n\nThe water python began to tremble. In an instant, its body started to disintegrate, but from its shattering body, countless thumb-sized small snakes began to emerge.\n\nThis dense swarm of creatures began to surge towards Zhou Ze like an overwhelming tide!\n\n\"Get lost!\"\n\nZhou Ze propped himself up with both hands, forcibly raising his head. His fingernails directly pierced into the floor, and wisps of black energy were squeezed out, forming a protective circle around him. All the small snakes that touched the black energy were annihilated.\n\nThe stalemate between the man and the snake seemed destined to continue. Both were at the end of their ropes, but they stubbornly persisted.\n\nAnd at this moment, the twenty or so people who had been acting as \"faucets\" uniformly closed their mouths. Then, they slowly began to stand up.\n\nThey didn't walk towards Zhou Ze, nor did they walk towards the water python. Instead, they lined up, like elementary school students leaving school in the evening, and headed towards the staircase.\n\nThey were,\n\nGoing upstairs!\n\nZhou Ze wasn't sure if his arrival had stimulated them to act, or if he had just coincidentally arrived at the right time.\n\n\"Hiss hiss hiss...\"\n\nOne fearless little snake actually penetrated Zhou Ze's black aura, its body compressing, then springing up, directly burrowing towards Zhou Ze's ear.\n\nZhou Ze felt a slick sensation in his ear; the thing was still trying hard to burrow deeper.\n\nBut there were even more small snakes all around. Zhou Ze didn't dare pull his hands out of the floor, otherwise he would experience the feeling of a \"snake pit.\" It's said that ancient tyrannical rulers liked to play this game, throwing condemned people into snake dens.\n\nBut the disgusting sensation coming from his ear was truly too clear. If he didn't stop it, who knew where that thing would burrow to.\n\nTongcheng had a tradition of temple fairs. Zhou Ze remembered going to one with the orphanage when he was little. At the fair, there was a tent where for two *yuan* a ticket, a woman lay on a bed covered by a mosquito net, surrounded by many small snakes.\n\nThe woman would perform for the ticket-buyers, which involved taking a small snake, stuffing it into her nostril, and then the snake would slowly crawl out of her mouth.\n\nAs an observer then, it was astonishing, but Zhou Ze certainly didn't want to experience it himself.\n\nBut Zhou Ze had no other options now. He hadn't brought the Yin-Yang Scroll with him, because that thing would vibrate like a dildo when it encountered someone near death, annoying him endlessly.\n\nRight,\n\nHe also had a bronze ring, but he didn't know what it was for. He had the ring on him, but what if putting it on killed him instead? Then he'd truly have no one to cry to.\n\nDeep breaths, deep breaths, continuous deep breaths.\n\nThe slick thing in his ear was still burrowing inward, causing an unbearable itch.\n\nZhou Ze could only subconsciously lean his face, pressing his ear with his shoulder and arm, hoping to dislodge the thing.\n\nAt this moment, Zhou Ze suddenly remembered he still had two Ghost Messenger badges in his left pocket.\n\nAll in!\n\nPulling his hands out of the floor, Zhou Ze quickly took out a Ghost Messenger badge. Before the surrounding snake swarm could rush in, Zhou Ze rubbed his bloodied fingernail hard against the badge. Green smoke continuously rose from the badge, and then the badge began to crack, clearly rendered useless.\n\nBut the green smoke continued to rise, like a match being lit.\n\n\"Crack!\"\n\nZhou Ze tossed the Ghost Messenger badge out the door.\n\nThe massive swarm of small snakes instantly abandoned Zhou Ze and pounced towards the Ghost Messenger badge outside.\n\nIt seemed that because the water python had split into so many tiny fragments, the intelligence of each individual had also been averaged out. Zhou Ze felt as if he had just been playing fetch with a dog.\n\nAnd the family who had been heading upstairs also frantically rushed down, running into the snake swarm outside the living room. Clearly, the peculiar scent emitted when the Ghost Messenger badge burned had an incredibly strong attraction for ghostly entities!\n\nAt that moment, Zhou Ze didn't relax or pause to catch his breath. He immediately reached out and grabbed the portrait, unhesitatingly tearing it open with his fingernails.\n\n\"Rip!\"\n\nWith a crisp sound,\n\nThe portrait tore open, and the small snakes inside and outside the house slowly began to evaporate. The family also slowly melted away.\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nA gust of ghostly wind blew through, and the living room door closed.\n\nFinally,\n\nEverything returned to calm.\n\n\"Huff… huff…\"\n\nZhou Ze knelt on the ground,\n\nSo tired,\n\nCompletely exhausted,\n\nBut,\n\nNow it seems,\n\nPerhaps the Sea God wasn't so impressive after all.\n\nBoss Zhou was momentarily filled with a strong sense of accomplishment, feeling incredibly good about himself.\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nIt seemed like the wind was picking up outside,\n\nThe wind continuously battered the door frame,\n\nAt first, Zhou Ze didn't pay it any mind, but slowly, he realized something was wrong. The floor was still shaking and tilting.\n\nZhou Ze used his last bit of strength to prop himself against the wall and stood up, staggering to the door,\n\nReaching out,\n\nHe pushed open the living room door,\n\nOutside,\n\nTo his shock,\n\nLay a vast, boundless ocean!",

    "content": "\"Oh, great sea, you are all water...\"\n\nZhou Ze leaned against the doorframe, looking at the surging waves outside. He felt a bit helpless and had a headache, much like the feeling of standing up from a pile of corpses after a battle, only to find a group of enemy cavalry appearing before him.\n\nIt was as if all his previous efforts were a joke, a farce, utterly meaningless.\n\n\"Boss! Come quickly, Boss!\"\n\nBai Yingying suddenly called out from above, as if in an emergency.\n\nZhou Ze looked up, then tried to stretch his hand outside. The touch was cold, exceptionally real.\n\nIn truth, everyone knew this was fake, it had to be fake.\n\nThis wasn't some mythical tale of the Dragon King flooding Chentang Pass to kill Nezha. Zhou Ze couldn't possibly believe that the Sea God would really cause a great flood to drown Tongcheng, just to bother him, a Ghost Messenger.\n\nFirstly, the other party probably didn't possess such exaggerated powers.\n\nSecondly, even if he did, he wouldn't dare to do so.\n\nThe seawater was fake, but the problem was, it could deceive all your senses, making you feel from top to bottom that you were drowning.\n\nThis could be a form of hypnosis, but it surpassed mere hypnosis. Ghosts typically used such methods to lure and kill people, but when this one used it, it was even more terrifying.\n\nZhou Ze believed that even if he made a wooden raft and drifted out now, the Sea God could probably make him drift on the sea for ten days to half a month without change, literally letting him die of thirst, hunger, or drowning.\n\nLeaning against the wall, Zhou Ze slowly walked up the stairs. Bai Yingying had just called him.\n\nAs Zhou Ze laboriously came up the stairs, he found that he wasn't standing on the second floor of a residential house, but on the deck of a cruise ship.\n\n\"Boss, it's changed here.\"\n\nBai Yingying stood on the deck, calling out to Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Where are that old man and woman?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nBai Yingying had been assigned to the second floor to protect the old man and the woman, but now Bai Yingying was alone.\n\nThen, Zhou Ze instinctively sat down on a nearby chair, letting out a long sigh. There was a parasol above him, and drinks and alcohol next to him.\n\nZhou Ze was truly tired. His body, after being subjected to his continuous exertions, was incredibly lucky not to have fallen apart. Now, even a slight movement would cause all his joints to protest and ache.\n\n\"I'm not sure. I just felt a blur before my eyes, and then I found myself on a cruise ship.\"\n\nBai Yingying looked around and continued:\n\n\"Although I know all this is fake, similar to the illusion my Lady used before, it's really so realistic. Even the salty taste in the air is the same.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded, picked up the cup next to him, poured himself some ice water, took two sips, and said:\n\n\"If I'm not mistaken, this cruise ship should be the one that had the accident five years ago. Look around, that family should be here.\" Zhou Ze reminded her.\n\n\"What do we do if we find them?\"\n\n\"I don't know either. I can't perform illusions.\"\n\nZhou Ze reached out and massaged his temples. *When in Rome, do as the Romans do*, he thought. Since the Sea God wasn't willing to give up, he could only wait and respond. The disparity in their strengths was, after all, on different levels.\n\nIn fact, Zhou Ze had always been on the hot seat. The crucial reason was that the Sea God's position was too high, disdaining to talk to him, and naturally even more disdainful of negotiating terms with him.\n\nBai Yingying obediently went upstairs to search. The cruise ship had three levels: a middle deck level, an upper level, and a cabin level. Soon, Bai Yingying came down from above and said:\n\n\"No one upstairs.\"\n\n\"Then go down and check again.\"\n\nBai Yingying went down again. When Zhou Ze had come up earlier, the downstairs was still the original living room, but when Bai Yingying went down again, it had turned into the ship's cabins.\n\n\"Boss, still no one.\" Bai Yingying reported after checking.\n\n\"No one?\"\n\nThis surprised Zhou Ze as well.\n\n\"Yeah, I checked every room downstairs, confirmed no one. Not even a single crew member. This cruise ship is just stopped on the sea by itself.\"\n\n\"This shouldn't be.\"\n\nZhou Ze muttered to himself,\n\nThose in high positions always liked to play tricks with \"cause and effect\" cycles, perhaps because it seemed more prestigious, just like Patriarch Bodhi tapping Sun Wukong's head three times.\n\nBefore, when he saw the sea and then the cruise ship, Zhou Ze thought that the Sea God intended for them to witness what exactly happened five years ago.\n\nOr perhaps, the Sea God wanted to both punish those he intended to punish and also display a high-level maneuver, leaving you thoroughly impressed, clapping your hands and exclaiming:\n\n\"Oh,\nso that's how it is,\nindeed,\nhow unexpected,\n666666666!\"\n\nBut now you only produce a vast sea and a cruise ship, and besides me and Bai Yingying, there are no extras?\n\nHow is this script supposed to proceed?\n\nCould it be that the Sea God's battery is low, so he only managed half and couldn't complete the rest?\n\n\"Check again, see if there's any other information.\"\n\nZhou Ze could only grit his teeth and stand up, first heading downstairs. Bai Yingying went upstairs to check again.\n\n\"Please don't be a half-finished product due to low battery.\"\n\nZhou Ze could only inwardly plead. Because if the Sea God was just setting up a stage to show off in front of him, a Ghost Messenger, the worst outcome would be the Sea God's success, having shown him up, then the people who were supposed to die would die, he wouldn't have saved anyone, and the final payment would be gone. But after that, they could all go home.\n\nBut if it's a half-finished product, how is this script supposed to continue?\n\nAre he and Bai Yingying just going to stand here awkwardly?\n\nGod knows how long this illusion can last. He's completely clueless about this, and Bai Yingying might know a little, but she's just a dabbler. He can't possibly stay in this wretched place for decades, a whole cycle, waiting for Bai Yingying to become more powerful or for himself to evolve further before they can leave?\n\nDuring this time, not only was there no plum juice, but there was no food either. His body couldn't endure going without food for so long.\n\nLost in thought, Zhou Ze even specifically stuck his head out the porthole to look at the sea below.\n\nAre there any fish?\n\nIf there were fish, he could survive by eating them.\n\nBut upon looking, Zhou Ze suddenly noticed a mass of black material below the waterline on the side of the ship, clinging there like seaweed, continuously swaying with the waves, but never leaving the deck area.\n\nZhou Ze instinctively bent down, extending his cane to try and poke it in the water, but failed, almost falling into the sea himself.\n\nWith his current physical state, comparable to an eighty-year-old grandfather, falling in would truly mean drowning. He wouldn't even be able to thrash a few times in a dying struggle.\n\n\"Yingying.\"\n\nZhou Ze called up to her.\n\n\"Thump-thump-thump...\"\n\nBai Yingying quickly ran down.\n\n\"Boss, what's wrong?\"\n\n\"Go into the water and see what this is.\" Zhou Ze pointed below and said.\n\nBai Yingying leaned over and also noticed the black mass of seaweed. She immediately leaped down.\n\nHer posture was graceful,\nher movements standard,\nthe splash was minimal.\n\nAfter entering the water, Bai Yingying continued to dive due to inertia. Zhou Ze waited above.\n\nAbout half a minute later, Bai Yingying surfaced. At this point, the female zombie was completely soaked, and even her skin color was somewhat pale. Zhou Ze didn't think it was because the seawater was too cold and Bai Yingying was freezing.\n\nZombies afraid of cold?\n\nIs that even possible?\n\n\"What is that?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Boss, they... they...\"\n\n\"Hurry up and tell me.\" Zhou Ze urged.\n\nThis concerned whether he and Bai Yingying could leave this cursed place.\n\n\"They're all down there, Boss, the whole family, all of them.\"\n\nBai Yingying pointed below.\n\n\"All down there?\" Zhou Ze was surprised, and then realizing something, he pointed at the black seaweed below and said, \"Is that hair?\"\n\n\"Yes, it's hair.\" Bai Yingying affirmed.\n\n\"They all drowned?\"\n\n\"Uh...\"\n\nBai Yingying showed a very bewildered expression, a little conflicted, a little difficult, and a little helpless.\n\nIf it weren't for the distance being too far and his cane not being long enough, Zhou Ze would have wanted to raise his cane and tap her head. At a time like this, she was still soaking in the water and trying to be cute?\n\n\"Boss, you jump down and see for yourself. It's not easy to describe.\" Bai Yingying simply said.\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze.\n\nIf I could jump down, why didn't I just jump down earlier instead of calling you?\n\n\"Boss, come down, I'll catch you.\" Bai Yingying opened her arms. \"The things down there, you really have to see them for yourself.\"\n\nZhou Ze hesitated for a moment, then simply dropped his cane, turned around, and actually leaped off the deck.\n\nThere was a \"plop\" as he entered the water,\n\nand then Zhou Ze was held by Bai Yingying.\n\n\"Boss, take a deep breath. I'll take you down. If you need to breathe, just pinch my chest.\"\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze.\n\nImmediately after, seeing Zhou Ze take a deep breath, Bai Yingying directly took Zhou Ze down. Her physical quality was very strong, even surpassing professional swimmers, so even with Zhou Ze as a burden, she was still agile underwater.\n\nOnce underwater,\n\nZhou Ze first saw a large iron cage leaning against the side of the ship, as if nailed in place.\n\nInside this iron cage was a large offering table, on which sat a deity statue and a spirit tablet, unmistakably belonging to the Sea God. Even the offerings on it were fixed in place, remaining stationary relative to the iron cage underwater.\n\nAt the same time,\n\ninside the iron cage,\n\ntwenty-plus people,\n\nmen, women, and children,\n\nwere constantly drifting with the waves inside the iron cage.\n\nSome were at the bottom,\nsome in the middle.\n\nA woman, probably around twenty years old, was the most pitiful.\n\nHer head was caught in a gap at the very top of the iron cage, accidentally fixed in place,\n\nand her hair extended outwards,\n\nabove,\n\nfloating,\n\nfloating...\n\n——\n\nSorry, everyone, Long is feeling a bit unwell today and also has some matters to attend to, so the update is late. There will be another chapter in the early hours of the morning.\n\nDon't panic,\nHold tight to Long!",

    "content": "Zhou Ze looked on in shock; this display was too grand.\n\nEven the Taoist priests in TV shows, setting up an altar for a sacrifice, didn't have such a grand setup. In ordinary temples, a sacrifice with some fruit and a pig's head was already considered quite well-off.\n\nAnd here,\n\nIt was a live sacrifice!\n\nMore than twenty living people,\n\nThat whole family,\n\nWere intentionally placed here, as offerings, to the Sea God!\n\nZhou Ze had a unique background; he had even been to hell and had seen many people and ghosts over two lifetimes. Logically, there weren't many things that could shake his mind.\n\nBut the scene before him caused Zhou Ze to lose control of his composure in an instant.\n\nIt must be known that among them were not only elderly women with completely white hair and wrinkled skin but also very young children. These people should have had their own lives, their own laughter and joy, but now they were all confined here. They couldn't even drift freely like fish, only crashing from one side of the cage to the other with the waves.\n\nEven after death, they were still kept in captivity!\n\nThe person who arranged and prepared all this seemed almost afraid that their meticulously prepared offerings would spill out, causing the Sea God to not eat fully, comfortably, or sufficiently, showing such thoughtful care.\n\n\"Gulp...\"\n\nHis body was a bit weak now, which meant his breath-holding time was shorter. Zhou Ze reached out and lifted Bai Yingying's wrist, which was wrapped around his waist, signaling her to bring him up for air.\n\nHowever,\n\nBai Yingying was unresponsive, as if she felt nothing.\n\nZhou Ze pinched her hand,\n\nShe remained unresponsive, unmoving.\n\nZhou Ze grabbed her arm,\n\nShe still seemed completely unaware.\n\nZhou Ze turned his head and glared at her.\n\nHe then realized that Bai Yingying had her eyes closed!\n\n\"I can't see,\n\nI can't see anything, la, I can't see.\"\n\nZhou Ze's right index fingernail grew longer,\n\nBai Yingying's body suddenly trembled,\n\nShe immediately embraced Zhou Ze and surfaced,\n\n\"Hoo... hoo... hoo...\"\n\nAfter catching his breath, Zhou Ze felt much better. He didn't dwell on Bai Yingying's earlier little trick and simply said,\n\n\"Let's go up.\"\n\n\"Alright, Boss!\"\n\nBai Yingying also didn't mention what had just happened. Then, like a small King Kong, she wrapped her right arm around Zhou Ze's waist, carried him like a rag doll, grabbed the side of the boat with her other hand, and climbed straight up.\n\nClean, swift, and effortless.\n\nZhou Ze sat on the chair first, catching his breath while waiting for some of the water to drip off his clothes, otherwise, his clothes would be too heavy and difficult to wear.\n\n\"Boss, what exactly was going on down there just now?\"\n\n\"You don't know?\"\n\n\"How could I know?\"\n\n\"Wasn't your lady once found having an affair with a scholar and then drowned in a pig cage?\"\n\n\"Uh...\"\n\n\"Someone is using living people as sacrifices, offerings to the Sea God,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"As sacrifices? Offerings?\" Bai Yingying was astonished. Even as a zombie, she found such a thing too cruel and utterly inhumane.\n\n\"So what's going on now? We're here, and there's an iron cage full of corpses down below. What's all this for?\"\n\n\"I'm not sure, but I have a feeling that this matter might be inextricably linked to that old man or that woman. At the very least, that old man definitely has a hand in it.\"\n\nWhy would the old man definitely be involved?\n\nAnd the fox spirit might be an exception?\n\nBai Yingying thought to herself.\n\nJust then, the wind picked up, and it was strong. The previously calm sea suddenly became turbulent with waves, causing the yacht to sway back and forth constantly, as if it could capsize at any moment.\n\nZhou Ze continued to sit in the chair. To be honest, he was feeling a bit helpless right now. If he were a Judge now, perhaps he would have the qualifications for an equal exchange with the other party, but his current self was clearly not taken seriously by them.\n\nOf course, the most important question at hand was, in traditional beliefs, was this Sea God considered good or evil?\n\nDid he accept the offerings and give the sacrificers a corresponding return, or did the sacrificers' actions make him feel anger and desecration, so he specifically came to punish them?\n\nAt his level, traditional notions of good and evil should be difficult to constrain his actions, right?\n\n\"Clang...\"\n\nWaves of seawater crashed over, and the yacht's swaying motion grew increasingly violent. Bai Yingying stood firm, one hand gripping Zhou Ze's shoulder, helping him stabilize on the deck.\n\n\"Boss, the boat's going to capsize.\"\n\n\"I know.\"\n\nZhou Ze leaned on Bai Yingying's arm and managed to stand up. When he looked ahead, he found what appeared to be land—no, to be precise, it should be an island, an island of considerable size.\n\n\"Whoosh!\"\n\nA harsh sound of metal friction rang out, and the yacht finally gave way, completely flipping over. Bai Yingying was quick-witted, grabbing Zhou Ze and leaping into the sea before the yacht capsized.\n\nSo, Zhou Ze was lucky. How many drowning victims, before they drowned, wished they had a Bai Yingying by their side.\n\nBai Yingying swam while keeping Zhou Ze's head above water so he could breathe fresh air. Zhou Ze was meticulously cared for, like a baby kangaroo nestled in its mother's pouch.\n\nHe could only tilt his head up, breathing and spitting out the splashes of water that got into his mouth and nostrils,\n\nWhile... looking up at the sky.\n\nFinally, Bai Yingying reached the shore.\n\nZhou Ze lay on the beach, breathing heavily.\n\n\"Boss, there's another person lying over there.\"\n\nBai Yingying suddenly pointed towards the beach and said.\n\nZhou Ze turned to look and, indeed, there lay a young man, dressed in tattered clothes. If Zhou Ze himself was a salted fish before, then that one was a salted fish about to be roasted dry.\n\n\"I'll go kill him.\"\n\nBai Yingying said, adhering to her policy of nipping any potential danger in the bud.\n\nZhou Ze reached out and stopped Bai Yingying, shaking his head and saying, \"Don't you feel like that guy looks a bit familiar?\"\n\n\"Familiar?\" Bai Yingying strained to look, and finally, she seemed to recall something, saying, \"He looks so much like that old man. Is he the old man's son? Oh no, or maybe his grandson.\"\n\n\"No, that's not right,\" Zhou Ze denied.\n\nAt this moment, a python crawled out of the seawater.\n\nThis python also looked somewhat familiar to Zhou Ze; it really resembled the one he had fought before, except this snake now appeared smaller, and its scales weren't as thick as before.\n\nThe snake slowly crawled onto the young man's body. There was no hint of murderous intent or ferocity about it, and it seemed completely unaware that Zhou Ze and Bai Yingying were standing right beside it. It simply stared at the person beneath it.\n\n\"Boss, this snake is almost a spirit,\" Bai Yingying suddenly said.\n\n\"I can tell.\"\n\nThis python exuded a sense of wisdom and human-like emotion, somewhat reminiscent of the monkey Zhou Ze first encountered.\n\nThe python opened its mouth, not to bite the young man in front of it, but to bite its own body, creating an opening. Then, the snake's body coiled around the young man, bringing the wounded part of itself to the man's mouth.\n\nAt first, the python's blood slowly dripped into the man's mouth. Soon, the man seemed to regain some consciousness and began to actively suck the snake's blood. The color in his face also slowly returned.\n\nFinally, the man let go, let out a long sigh, and then opened his eyes. When he saw the python for the first time, the man trembled all over in fear.\n\nThe python didn't linger, but swam directly back into the sea from the beach, leaving a puddle of blood on the ground.\n\nAfter the python entered the sea and swam away, the man immediately scrambled up, kowtowing several times towards the direction the python had gone, muttering something, and then reached down to pick up a remaining snake scale from the ground.\n\n\"What is he shouting?\" Bai Yingying asked. The man's dialect was quite thick, and Bai Yingying couldn't hear very clearly.\n\n\"He's thanking the Sea God for saving him,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\nThe man walked into the island's forest and disappeared.\n\n\"So the question is, Boss, how do we leave?\"\n\nBai Yingying asked, tilting her head. Then, as if something occurred to her, she asked,\n\n\"I think being Robinson Crusoe here would be quite nice too.\"\n\nThere was \"Robinson Crusoe\" in the bookstore, and Bai Yingying had read it in her spare time.\n\nZhou Ze felt that his maid had been acting a bit strangely lately, as if she had watched too many Korean dramas and gone a bit silly.\n\nJust then, the yacht that had capsized earlier reappeared on the sea.\n\n\"Wow, Boss, the boat is back.\"\n\n\"I can see that.\"\n\nThe yacht had returned again, but this time, there were people on board, and many of them.\n\nAn old man sat in a wheelchair, being pushed off the boat by an attendant. The attendant was a woman, her face veiled in white gauze, but from her figure and demeanor, she also looked somewhat familiar.\n\n\"Her chest has sagged a bit, her butt has gotten a bit fatter, and her waist has thickened a bit. Boss, if you reverse the aging process a bit, wouldn't she resemble a certain someone?\"\n\nIt was that woman, the old man's wife.\n\nMany people disembarked from the ship. The old man sat in a wheelchair, with an IV drip hanging, evidently, he didn't have much time left.\n\nJust then, Zhou Ze's gaze sharpened instantly. He saw another priest disembarking from the yacht—an Asian priest.\n\nYes, that's right,\n\nThis guy was the one who stole his ashes!\n\nHowever, this priest looked a bit younger now, with fairer skin, a round face, and an innocent appearance.\n\nHe walked up to the old man, who motioned for the woman to leave. The woman walked away, quite far, as some things were not convenient for her to know, and she was very self-aware and discreet.\n\nThe old man seemed to be saying something to the priest, who nodded in agreement.\n\nThen,\n\nThe old man pulled a black scale from his embrace.\n\nThe priest looked at the scale, then lowered his head and whispered something in the old man's ear.\n\nUpon hearing this, the old man's face first showed shock, then struggle. He seemed to be hesitating, agonizing, and finally, he looked at his still-hanging IV drip and then at the graceful woman standing in the distance.\n\nHis fingers clenched the scale tightly, veins protruding.\n\nThen he gritted his teeth, his face full of brutality,\n\nAt the same time, he nodded.\n\nThe priest bowed slightly beside him.\n\n\"Boss, their voices are too low, I can't hear them.\"\n\nBai Yingying said with some helplessness. She tried to walk forward to get closer to the old man and the priest, but no matter how far she walked forward, the distance between them and her increased proportionally.\n\nZhou Ze waved his hand,\n\nSaying, \"No need to listen.\"\n\n\"Then how do we leave here?\" Bai Yingying was a little anxious.\n\n\"We can leave,\" Zhou Ze smiled. \"Actually, there is no Sea God at all.\"\n\nBai Yingying didn't understand, but Zhou Ze himself didn't understand. Yes, there was no Sea God.\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\n\"There is no Sea God, only a snake that was mistaken for one.\"\n\nZhou Ze looked up at the sky and shouted,\n\n\"You couldn't beat me, and I seriously injured you. This illusion can't last much longer, can it?\n\nEspecially now that I know you're not actually the Sea God, this illusion has lost ninety-nine percent of its deterrent power. Do you think you still have a chance to kill me in here?\"\n\n\"Fizz, fizz, fizz...\"\n\nA snake's head slowly emerged from the sand next to Zhou Ze.\n\nAll the surrounding illusions began to shatter.\n\nZhou Ze was now sitting on the living room floor, and Bai Yingying was standing next to him. Everything around them had returned to normal.\n\n\"I didn't intend to kill you with this...\"\n\nThe python, scarred from Zhou Ze's fingernails, actually spoke human words at this moment, though its voice was somewhat sharp.\n\n\"Tsk, tsk.\" Zhou Ze reached out, patted the snake's head, then looked up, somewhat helplessly, and said, \"You actually wanted to kill me directly at first. You didn't expect that I could get you into this state, so you changed your approach and resorted to circumvention.\"\n\nIf the hard way didn't work, it tried the soft way.\n\n\"He deserves to die...\" the python said.\n\n\"I have a monkey at home; you two should have something in common. But given your condition, you clearly won't live much longer before turning to dust. It's a pity.\"\n\n\"He deserves to die...\" The python seemed capable of only that one sentence.\n\nZhou Ze did think of the monkey, recalling his struggle with that monkey in the hospital back then, and the eventual outcome, including how his conscience was \"eaten\" because of it.\n\nThe same choice, but this time, Zhou Ze's choice was different. He raised his hand and said very seriously,\n\n\"That woman shouldn't die.\"\n\nThe python hesitated for a moment, then nodded slightly, as if agreeing.\n\nThen, Zhou Ze lowered his hand and looked elsewhere.\n\nThe python nodded at Zhou Ze, rubbed its forked tongue against Zhou Ze's arm, and then, dragging its broken body, slithered towards the stairs.\n\nBai Yingying was a bit confused, looking at Zhou Ze and asking, \"Boss, didn't that snake save him? If it saved him back then, why does it want to kill him now?\"\n\n\"It's simple. Sixty years ago, this python had just gained sentience and was cultivating to accumulate good deeds. So, it actively saved the young man who was washed ashore and near death after a shipwreck.\n\nThe young man survived, then prospered, earning a lot of money and becoming very wealthy and influential. Then the young man became an old man, riddled with disease and close to death.\n\nThe old man didn't want to die; he still had so much money and wanted to continue enjoying his life.\n\nFor others, beyond medical intervention, extending one's life was basically impossible. But the old man was different; he had seen the 'Sea God' when he was young. He regarded the snake that saved him as the Sea God.\n\nSo, the old man decided to use this to extend his life. He believed that if the Sea God saved him once sixty years ago, then sixty years later, the Sea God should be able to save him again.\n\nHe also found a rogue sorcerer...\"\n\nWhen speaking of that Japanese priest, Zhou Ze's eyes flashed with intense killing intent.\n\nThat scoundrel, this time, once his injuries healed, he must be killed. No matter what else came up, he absolutely had to be killed!\n\n\"That priest gave him a method for sacrificing to evil gods, which was to use the lives of his own relatives to extend his own life.\"\n\n\"Ah...\" Bai Yingying exclaimed, \"So the family who drowned on the yacht five years ago?\"\n\n\"Didn't you see it? They were specially arranged by the old man for the sacrifice. He used his wife, sons, daughters, grandsons, great-grandsons, and so on, all as sacrifices to extend his own life.\"\n\n\"Then what?\"\n\n\"He succeeded. Because he had that scale in his hand, and the method the priest gave him wasn't baseless, so he succeeded.\n\nDidn't you see? Five years ago, the old man was in a wheelchair, ready to kick the bucket at any moment, but five years later, he can actually walk on his own and even have marital relations with his charming wife from time to time.\n\nHe succeeded, he really succeeded.\"\n\n\"So that means this python and the old man reached an agreement?\" Bai Yingying asked. \"Then why does this python want to kill him again five years later?\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head,\n\n\"There was no agreement. The python was tricked, badly tricked by that old man. It was originally cultivating for many years, following a very orthodox path, but because of the old man's sacrifice using its scale, it was passively forced into the sequence of evil gods, which is abhorrent to heaven and earth. Its efforts of the past century were largely ruined.\n\nIt was like a poisoned blessing; the python was unknowingly knocked out.\n\nPerhaps that python even suffered some problem because of it, and it took five years to partially resolve it. Then, at all costs, even risking its own life and death, it came to land to seek revenge on this old man!\n\nIt was the one who saved him, but he ended up tricking it.\"\n\nBai Yingying nodded thoughtfully, \"So, there's no Sea God at all?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\"\n\n\"Then, Boss, did you let it go up for revenge this time?\" Bai Yingying asked.\n\nThe implication was, you didn't do that with the monkey last time.\n\n\"I'm severely injured and can't beat it anymore. I don't want to risk my life,\" Zhou Ze explained.\n\nBai Yingying pouted, pointing to herself.\n\nMeaning, \"A snake that you nearly beat to a pulp, I can handle it.\"\n\n\"You're just a little girl, you're even afraid of mice and cockroaches, how could you possibly stop it, right?\"\n\nUpon hearing this, Bai Yingying understood,\n\nShe immediately clasped her hands over her chest and swayed,\n\n\"Ying ying ying,\n\nYes, really,\n\nI'm so scared.\"\n\n——————\n\nPS: This chapter is over 5,000 words.

    "title": "第一百六十三章 她必須死",
    "content": "The matter had concluded; the previous voyage, including the island and all, felt like a fleeting dream, ultimately, it was over.\n\nSpeaking ill of it, spirits and monsters truly can't be presented in a dignified manner; otherwise, this world wouldn't revolve around \"humans.\" However, the deficiencies in human nature always provide them space to act, and some people even enjoy digging their own graves.\n\nZhou Ze wasn't sure if he should immerse himself in the worldview of ghosts or humans. In many instances, his own self-positioning was somewhat vague, so most of the time, he simply considered himself an observer.\n\nWatching flowers bloom, watching them wither; watching people laugh, watching ghosts cry.\nAfter seeing too much of anything, one eventually becomes numb.\n\nZhou Ze let Bai Yingying help him back up to the second floor. Everything here remained unchanged; even upon entering the room, Zhou Ze still saw the old man sleeping soundly on the sofa.\n\nBai Yingying was puzzled and asked, \"Not dead?\"\nThat python was released by Zhou Ze; could it be that it failed to kill the man?\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. The man was already dead; the dark aura on the old man’s *Yintang* (space between eyebrows) couldn't be concealed. Even if he didn't die instantly, he would perish in an extremely painful manner within the next few days, suffering immensely.\n\nThe woman lay on the ground, her skirt lifted, revealing a large expanse of her body.\nZhou Ze stared for a while.\nBai Yingying pouted beside him.\n\nAfter a moment, Zhou Ze walked over and helped the woman tidy her clothes. They were both sound asleep. Many of the things that had happened to them earlier were akin to a dream, yet their fates had already changed several times over.\n\nZhou Ze walked around the house two more times. Behind a wall, he discovered half a snake's body, a small, green snake, already dried into a jerky.\n\nMoreover, the house's door was somewhat unusual, with many strange patterns carved onto it. Zhou Ze asked Bai Yingying to help him make rubbings of these patterns.\n\nThen, Zhou Ze didn't wake the woman to ask about the remaining payment and left directly with Bai Yingying.\n\nAfter returning to the bookstore, about a week passed. Xu Qinglang also recovered from the terrifying atmosphere of that night and began to be responsible for everyone's three meals at the bookstore.\n\nCoupled with one or two ghosts visiting the bookstore every night for business, Boss Zhou's life was quite fulfilling. Most importantly, his body had largely recovered.\n\nSome matters that should have been resolved long ago also needed to be put on the agenda, such as the priest who had been causing trouble for five years; he deserved to go to hell.\n\n\"Call Lin Ke, let's meet at the bookstore tomorrow at noon,\" Zhou Ze told Bai Yingying, who was pouring him tea.\n\n\"Okay.\" Bai Yingying immediately pulled out her phone to send a message, then asked, \"Boss, are we going to find that priest?\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded. Although the primary reason for the old man's family's death was the old man's own \"deluded\" selfishness, that priest also played a significant role in promoting it.\nFurthermore, the priest had stolen his ashes; this debt definitely needed to be settled.\n\n\"Boss, you seem to have forgotten something very important,\" Bai Yingying reminded him.\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"The final payment, there's still eight million due.\"\n\n\"Heh.\"\nZhou Ze chuckled.\n\n\"Boss, you can't be like that. Just because she's pretty, you're not going to charge her? Being pretty doesn't put food on the table.\"\n\n\"That one million *yuan* deposit should last for a long time. I already gave you the money I borrowed from you, right? Go redeem your two burial objects.\"\n\n\"No, Boss, how can you live like this? You don't know the cost of living unless you manage a household. You casually dismiss eight million as nothing; how are you going to live your life in the future?\nIt's eight million *yuan*, not eight hundred *yuan*!\"\nBai Yingying spoke with the tone of someone who believes men are indeed unreliable.\n\n\"Boss, there's news in the paper.\" The Old Taoist, who had just finished mopping the floor, walked over with a newspaper.\n\nThe old man had died, and it made the newspaper. Many people attended his funeral. The cause of death was attributed to severe illness, which he couldn't overcome.\nThe old man had been a respectable person in life.\nHis funeral was grand. In fact, that's how this world is: many people might be glorious in public, but who knows about their debauchery behind the scenes? One persona in front of people, another behind them—this kind of reversal has long made the public numb.\n\n\"Ah!\"\nBai Yingying suddenly cried out!\n\n\"What's wrong?\" Zhou Ze, who was holding his tea, was startled by her scream and spilled some tea.\n\n\"Look here, Boss,\" Bai Yingying pointed to another page and said.\nZhou Ze looked over. The headline read:\n\"Wealthy Widow Donates All Assets.\"\n\nIt was that woman; she had donated all the assets she could inherit.\n\"Why would she do that?\" Bai Yingying found it difficult to understand.\n\nThen, Bai Yingying looked at the calm-faced Zhou Ze and asked, \"Boss, did you know this already?\"\nZhou Ze shook his head.\n\n\"Eight million *yuan*, your eight million was also donated to Project Hope.\"\n\"Let it be donated then.\"\n\n\"Boss, what do you mean, 'let it be donated'?\nThis is money being donated, not eight million *yuan* of essence being donated.\nBesides, Boss, I'm poor too. I want to buy more burial objects. Why don't you donate some to me too?\"\nBai Yingying leaned in, acting cute.\n\n\"What eight million *yuan*?\" Xu Qinglang walked over, holding coffee.\n\n\"It's about that very rich female client I told you about last time. She said she'd pay an eight-million-yuan final installment after her troubles were resolved, but her husband died, and she donated all the inheritance,\" Bai Yingying explained to Xu Qinglang.\n\n\"Is it that exaggerated?\" Xu Qinglang was also startled; the donated amount must be in the hundreds of millions.\n\n\"Oh, look who's here,\" the Old Taoist pointed at the doorway and said.\n\nStanding at the entrance was a woman, dressed in a black gown, veiled in black gauze.\nMany men are familiar with this attire:\nthe attire of a widow.\n\nThe woman walked in, nodded slightly at Zhou Ze, and said, \"I'm returning to my hometown county to live. My apologies for your final payment.\"\n\n\"Hey, what do you mean, 'my apologies'? Do you know how poor my boss is? He can't even pay salaries, and you swallowed eight million *yuan* of his!\" the Old Taoist boldly exclaimed.\n\n\"Old Taoist, the floor's dirty.\"\n\"Huh?\"\nThen, the Old Taoist saw Zhou Ze pretend to spill his tea on the floor and immediately shut up, wisely.\n\n\"I'm truly sorry, but you won't mind, will you?\" the woman looked at Zhou Ze and said.\n\n\"I don't mind. I just hope that when my living conditions improve and I go eat barbecue on a cruise ship, it'll be calm.\"\n\n\"You jest.\"\n\nThe woman turned around and pushed open the door, walking out. She seemed to have come specifically to say these words.\n\nAt this moment, Xu Qinglang finally came to his senses. She was too similar, truly too similar. Although she wore a black veil over her face, her voice and figure were exactly like that woman's!\n\nXu Qinglang immediately prepared to chase after her, but his hand was firmly clasped by Zhou Ze.\n\n\"What are you doing!\" Xu Qinglang yelled at Zhou Ze.\n\n\"No matter what relationship you have with her, you'd best not go.\"\n\n\"Impossible, there are some things I must get clear!\" Xu Qinglang insisted.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head somewhat helplessly, then stood up, \"Alright, I'll go with you.\"\n\nImmediately, Zhou Ze and Xu Qinglang walked out of the bookstore together. The woman was still walking ahead. Xu Qinglang quickly caught up and directly grabbed the woman's shoulders with both hands.\n\nThe woman's body trembled, and she asked, \"Little Quail, what do you mean by this?\"\n\nXu Qinglang's Adam's apple bobbed a few times, but he didn't know what to say—should he mention his own fleeing in disarray?\n\n\"Your hand.\"\nAfter all, she was a woman he had been intimate with; though it was a fleeting affair, it was a bond forged through the exchange of bodily fluids.\n\nXu Qinglang reached out and grasped the woman's wrist. It was covered in scars. \"This is a special ointment I brought from my hometown; it can remove scars.\"\n\nThe woman looked at Xu Qinglang with a half-smile, then at Zhou Ze standing beside her. Finally, her gaze settled on Zhou Ze.\n\n\"I didn't know you had a relationship with him,\" Zhou Ze explained.\nThe woman nodded, indicating she believed him.\n\nThen she actively hugged Xu Qinglang tightly.\nXu Qinglang was stunned.\nShe was wearing a widow's dress, and Zhou Ze was standing beside them. Xu Qinglang immediately felt at a loss.\n\nThen,\na dry retching sound ended the awkwardness.\n\n\"Ugh...\"\nThe woman threw up.\nShe vomited blood.\nIt splattered all over Xu Qinglang.\nThen she slumped down weakly.\n\n\"What's going on! What's going on!\"\nXu Qinglang yelled, looking at his blood-soaked hands.\nThe woman had collapsed to the ground, unconscious.\n\n\"She took poison,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Then resuscitate her, save her, what are you standing here for, what are you doing!\"\nXu Qinglang shook Zhou Ze's arm with one hand.\n\n\"Can't save her,\" Zhou Ze said calmly.\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"She chose to die.\"\n\n\"How could she choose to die?\" Xu Qinglang asked, puzzled.\n\n\"She has to die.\"\n\nZhou Ze lit a cigarette and said, \"Call 120. She took the poison herself, it has nothing to do with you. Or, you can burn some joss paper. Anyway, come back after you've handled her.\"\n\nTurning around, Zhou Ze walked back into the bookstore.\n\nBai Yingying saw Zhou Ze return alone and immediately asked, \"Boss, where's Handsome Xu?\"\n\n\"He has something to take care of.\"\n\n\"With that woman?\" Bai Yingying looked enlightened. \"That woman must have been overcome by his looks, abandoned you, and taken a liking to Handsome Xu, right?\"\n\n\"She died.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Died.\"\n\n\"How could she have died?\"\n\n\"Committed suicide.\"\n\n\"How could she commit suicide?\"\nIn Bai Yingying's view, that woman was materialistic, a gold-digger, and loved enjoyment. How could such a person commit suicide?\n\n\"Why did Daji die?\"\n\n\"What?\"\nBai Yingying didn't understand why her boss suddenly asked her that.\n\n\"You know the story of *Investiture of the Gods* (Fengshen Bang), right?\"\n\n\"I know,\" Bai Yingying replied.\n\n\"Then, why did she die in the end?\"\n\n\"Because she was a bad woman! She harmed loyal officials and the innocent. She deserved to die!\"\n\n\"Hmm, initially, it was because King Zhou was disrespectful in the Nuwa Temple. Nuwa was enraged, so she sent down three fox spirits, including Daji, to bewitch King Zhou and accelerate the end of the Shang Dynasty's destiny.\nIn the end, Daji succeeded. The Shang Dynasty fell, and Daji originally thought she could return to report her mission because her task was indeed completed.\nJiang Ziya chased her, and she ran to find Nuwa. Nuwa said:\nYou deserve to die.\nI told you to bewitch King Zhou to end the Shang Dynasty's destiny early, but I didn't tell you to harm loyal officials and exploit the common people.\nThen,\nNuwa killed Daji.\"\n\n\"This... Boss, do you mean...\"\n\n\"The design of the house, and the snake jerky hidden in the house for several years, plus the old man eventually living in that house only with her.\"\n\n\"That's how it is...\" Bai Yingying mused thoughtfully.\n\n\"So, she had to die.\"",

    "content": "Zhou Ze closed his eyes. He couldn't sleep, but he liked the feeling of lying on the sofa by the glass window, bathed in sunlight.\n\nIn his previous life, he was always working, operating by the surgical table, rarely stopping. In this life, he could finally make up for it.\n\nAfter listening to Zhou Ze's explanation, Bai Yingying seemed to understand, and yet not entirely. But at least one thing was certain: Zhou Ze had actually known about this beforehand.\n\nAnd because of that, the boss wasn't bothered about the remaining eight million yuan final payment. No, it was probably because the boss knew that the woman wouldn't come to a good end, so he couldn't be bothered to ask her for it. It wouldn't be recouped anyway.\n\nBai Yingying ran her hands through her hair and stomped over to the bar counter.\n\nThe old Taoist was eating peanuts with the monkey, one for him, one for the monkey. Man and monkey were eating with relish. When Zhou Ze and Bai Yingying were explaining earlier, the old Taoist had listened nearby, then smiled and walked away.\n\n\"Old Taoist, let me ask you a question. Did you understand what the boss just said?\" Bai Yingying reached out and nudged the old Taoist's shoulder.\n\n\"Huh?\" The old Taoist turned his head, looking at Bai Yingying with some surprise, then said, \"Didn't the boss just explain it to you?\"\n\n\"I didn't entirely get it.\" Bai Yingying took a deep breath, then exhaled heavily.\n\nThough the old Taoist looked old, he wasn't even half her age. Bai Yingying felt that she wasn't as perceptive as him on some matters.\n\nThis was natural, actually. Although Bai Yingying was two hundred years old, most of her time was spent lying in a coffin, only talking and chatting with Mrs. Bai's ghost. So, essentially, she still maintained the innocence of a sixteen or seventeen-year-old girl.\n\n\"Actually, this matter is very simple. It's like why Nuwa wanted to kill Daji. A sage, naturally, must be glorious and pure. How can there be any blemish?\n\nSo, whether Daji completed her mission or not, she was destined to die. To overthrow the Shang dynasty, what else could be done besides harming loyal officials and oppressing the common people?\n\nYou know, in *Investiture of the Gods*, even if King Zhou was tyrannical, there were still many immortals and forces helping him. Jiang Ziya's fight wasn't smooth either. Therefore, Daji was definitely the best teammate.\n\nBut, in reality, from the moment Daji was sent out, she had already been condemned to a suspended death sentence.\n\nHow many powerful figures in ancient times treated their 'blades' this way? When the powerful needed them, these 'blades' helped them eliminate those they didn't want to see. When the mission was complete, they were discarded like 'dead rabbits and cooked hounds'.*\n\nBreak the blade and show it to the world.\n\nSee,\n\nThe criminals have been executed by my great self. I am still so pure and untainted.\"\n\n\"Then that woman?\"\n\n\"Didn't the boss say he found some formation and that half-dried snake in the house?\n\nThat was placed by that woman, of course. The old man was so rich, why did he end up living in the ancestral house? Whose hands designed and arranged the house?\n\nClearly, the old man was tricked, though he brought it upon himself and doesn't deserve sympathy. But speaking objectively, someone led him step by step into a trap.\n\nEven if the snake in the sea hadn't had problems, it would have been hard for it to come to land for revenge, let alone it already had problems. So, it's certain that someone acted as a go-between. Who could it be? Only that woman fits best.\"\n\n\"She was the snake's accomplice?\" Bai Yingying said, then shook her head. \"No, the boss and that snake had an agreement not to kill that woman. The snake agreed to that back then.\"\n\nThe old Taoist looked at Zhou Ze, who was still \"feigning sleep\" over there, and said, \"It's not about some snake or whatever. This matter is very simple. Lord Haishen was annoyed with that old man. It's unclear if it was because the old man did something wicked when he made his fortune years ago, or if he committed many dirty deeds under Lord Haishen's name. Didn't that old man do sea smuggling?\n\nSo, that woman was like the Daji sent by Lord Haishen. In fact, this humble Taoist even thinks that the old man was so selfish to an inhuman degree that he could sacrifice his entire family, which might have been due to that woman's bewitchment.\n\nOr, another possibility, Lord Haishen was annoyed with that snake and felt that if the snake became a spirit, it might affect him. So, he set up a trap to ensnare the snake as well. In the end, the snake came to land for revenge even at the cost of its own demise, and Lord Haishen was happy to see it happen.\n\nAnyway, no matter what, that woman had to die. If she died, Lord Haishen would still be Lord Haishen, maintaining his greatness and purity.\"\n\n\"Then, that woman is really pitiful,\" Bai Yingying sighed.\n\n\"There's nothing pitiful about it. This is fate, unchangeable. Look, even the boss has accepted it.\"\n\nZhou Ze stood up at this moment, glanced at the old Taoist and Bai Yingying who were still muttering, and walked upstairs.\n\nPushing open the bedroom door, Zhou Ze walked to the window, lit a cigarette. On the windowsill, there was a scroll painting. This was what Zhou Ze had asked the old Taoist to buy the day after that incident.\n\nThe old Taoist had gone to great lengths to find an identical portrait of Lord Haishen, as very few households still hung his image.\n\nZhou Ze unfolded the scroll,\n\nLooked at the painting for a long time,\n\nFinally,\n\nHe took out a lighter, lit a corner of the paper, and placed it on the security bars of the windowsill, watching it slowly burn to ashes.\n\n\"What are you sad about?\"\n\nThe little loli's voice came from behind Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Don't you know to knock before entering?\" Zhou Ze said, a little displeased.\n\n*Biu!*\n\nThe little loli's figure appeared outside the door, then knocked.\n\n\"Dong dong dong...\"\n\n\"Come in.\"\n\n*Biu!*\n\nThe little loli's figure appeared inside the room again.\n\n\"Whose portrait are you burning?\" the little loli asked.\n\n\"None of your business.\"\n\n\"Alright, I won't meddle. I came because I received information from that stupid zombie.\"\n\n\"I said tomorrow.\"\n\n\"But he's going to Shanghai tonight, then taking a 10 PM flight back to Japan,\" the little loli reminded him.\n\n\"Why didn't you tell me about this earlier?\"\n\n\"I just found out about his flight information,\" the little loli said, as if she had been very quick.\n\n\"Then where is he now?\"\n\n\"One of his three hiding spots, I guess. Before, he would rotate them daily, but today, I'm not sure if he'll stick to the pattern.\n\nHowever, I think it's more likely he's at one particular location.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because when I was tracking him, I noticed that in the house at that location, I could always sense another inexplicable aura. Although it was very faint and insignificant, it had some peculiarities compared to the other two places.\n\nSince he's preparing to return to Japan, he probably wants to take some things back, like his most successful research results?\"\n\nAfter saying that, the little loli took two steps back and said to Zhou Ze:\n\n\"Anyway, it's your decision.\"\n\n\"Call Yingying, you and I will go to that place.\"\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\nZhou Ze changed into a black hoodie and went downstairs, simultaneously calling out to Bai Yingying. Bai Yingying immediately followed him into the car, without even asking what they were going to do.\n\nOnce Bai Yingying was in the car, she noticed the little loli sitting beside her. This time, the little loli was clearly only bringing her soul form, not her physical body.\n\n\"Stupid zombie, you wouldn't even know if someone sold you off one day,\" the little loli scoffed.\n\n\"You're jealous of me.\"\n\n\"Who's stupid enough to be jealous of you?\"\n\n\"You're just jealous of me.\"\n\n\"I am not jealous of you!\"\n\n\"You're still jealous of me.\"\n\nThe little loli stopped talking. She felt it was too foolish to continue arguing on this topic.\n\nZhou Ze took out his phone and said to the little loli, \"Give me the address.\"\n\nThe little loli rattled off the address. After Zhou Ze successfully located it, he started the car. Not long after driving off, a call came in.\n\nZhou Ze initially wanted to hang up, but seeing it was Xu Qinglang, he answered directly.\n\n\"Hello, how's it going over there?\"\n\n\"How many people were in the old man's family?\"\n\n\"Why are you asking that?\"\n\n\"Just answer me.\"\n\nZhou Ze closed his eyes, thought for a moment, and said, \"Including the old man, twenty-four.\"\n\n...\n\nMeanwhile, in the emergency room of the affiliated hospital, Xu Qinglang sat alone on a bench in the hallway, his head bowed, looking at the tiled floor.\n\nFinally, the doctor came out, and the police also approached.\n\nPerhaps because burning joss paper had avoided much trouble and complications, neither the doctor nor the police questioned Xu Qinglang about the woman's death. Of course, Xu Qinglang was not a suspect in this matter anyway, because the woman had left a suicide note selfie on her social media before taking her own life.\n\nThis suicide was a foregone conclusion.\n\nWatching the nurse push out the stretcher, covered with a white sheet, Xu Qinglang stood up, walked to the stretcher, and said:\n\n\"I'd like to see her again.\"\n\nThe two nurses exchanged glances. Misunderstanding that Xu Qinglang and the woman who had committed suicide by poisoning were in a romantic relationship, they hesitated for a moment, then nodded.\n\nXu Qinglang lifted the sheet and looked at the woman's serene face. She was still so beautiful.\n\nXu Qinglang had witnessed her charm and romance in bed,\n\nBut now, she was cold.\n\nHe couldn't say he was sad, nor terribly upset, just a little disappointed and wistful.\n\nXu Qinglang took the woman's wrist and looked at the scars on it, his fingers gently tracing over them, counting each one. These scars must have been self-inflicted, one by one, over the past two months or so.\n\nShe seemed to have been preparing, and counting down, for the end.\n\nXu Qinglang raised his head, walked to the window in the hallway, pushed it open, and let the wind blow in.\n\nHe felt he shouldn't be sad or feel pity for the woman lying there, but humans are such emotional creatures.\n\nWhat she had done, what she had done to others, who she was, etc.,\n\nBut she had been in bed with him, so there was an instinctive sense of affection and closeness.\n\nTaking a long breath,\n\nXu Qinglang instinctively reached for a cigarette, then remembered he was in a hospital, and put it back.\n\nHe had just counted,\n\nOn the woman's wrist,\n\nThere were,\n\nTwenty-four scars.\n\n---\n* *狡兔死走狗烹 (jiǎo tù sǐ zǒu gǒu pēng)*: An idiom meaning \"when the cunning rabbit is dead, the hounds are cooked.\" It describes the act of discarding or eliminating subordinates or tools once they are no longer needed.",

    "content": "大人物有大人物的算計，小人物有小人物的目標，很多時候，兩者之間並不矛盾。\n\n\n\n  富豪老頭的事兒那位海神到底在其中有多少的戲份，周澤不得而知，或許，等以後有朝一日，當周老闆賺到足夠的錢覺得可以去享受一下買艘遊艇去海上飄一飄的氛圍時，興許可以找到一個答案。\n\n\n\n  眼下，他需要做的是，將那個從頭到尾不停搞事情出鏡率奇高的日本神父，給掐死，然後送到火葬場焚化了之後用他的骨灰拌咖喱雞腿飯。\n\n\n\n  按照導航，周澤將車到了一個老小區門口，這個小區應該是某個事業單位很早以前的集資建樓，已經快要拆遷了，裡面的住戶也搬得差不多了，顯得有些破舊和雜亂，但還有零星幾戶里依舊還住著人。\n\n\n\n  通城已經入夏了，但走進這裡之後，你卻能感到絲絲涼意，這不是什麼鬼怪的影響，只是純粹的人少地方所給人的一種特殊的心理暗示。\n\n\n\n  「三樓最左邊的那個屋子，裡面住著一個在通城打工的青年，租的房子。」小蘿莉解釋道。\n\n\n\n  周澤點點頭，沒做太多的猶豫，直接走了上去，雖說現在還不確定那位神父到底在不在裡面，但如果自己三人只是在下面傻傻地等的話那就未免太傻了一些。\n\n\n\n  來到三樓，屋門是鎖著的，周澤用自己的指甲打開了門，推開進去之後，發現裡面一塵不染，乾淨得讓人有些違和。 \n\n\n\n  人住的地方，真的不可能這麼幹淨，甚至連每個角落，都沒有一絲一毫的灰塵，再貼心的保潔公司也很難做到這個程度。\n\n\n\n  牆壁，\n\n\n\n  瓷磚，\n\n\n\n  窗台，\n\n\n\n  甚至連馬桶，都泛著一種光澤。\n\n\n\n  白鶯鶯看著裡面的情況，忽然有些擔心，她知道老闆是有潔癖的，所以她生怕自家老闆對這裡的乾淨程度很是喜歡之後也以這種方式來要求自己和老道把書屋弄得這麼幹淨。\n\n\n\n  如果這樣的話，自己以後除了陪老闆睡覺就只能不停地打掃衛生了，連吃雞的時間都沒有了。\n\n\n\n  屋子裡，沒人，小小的套一，也藏不住人。\n\n\n\n  周澤蹲下來，指甲在瓷磚上颳了刮，然後看了看自己的指甲縫，裡面夾著一些晶瑩的物質。\n\n\n\n  是的，\n\n\n\n  這間屋子這麼幹淨的原因就在這裡，倒不是說它真的被打掃得多好，而是因為有一層類似油蠟一樣的物質附著在上面，給出了一種「這裡很乾淨」的欺騙視覺。\n\n\n\n  甚至，連床上的被褥上，都附著著這個東西。\n\n\n\n  「人不在。」小蘿莉說道。\n\n\n\n  「我沒瞎。」周澤回答道。\n\n\n\n  「那去換下一個地方？」 \n\n\n\n  小蘿莉聳了聳肩，找那個日本神父是周澤給她的第一個任務，她之前監視和跟蹤了很久，付出了很大的心力，如果在收網之時沒有成功的話，那自己之前的辛苦也就都白費了。\n\n\n\n  吃力不討好，做了這麼多卻功虧一簣，還不如這頭蠢殭屍在人家旁邊只知道傻乎乎「嚶嚶嚶」所增加的好感多。\n\n\n\n  「啪。」\n\n\n\n  小蘿莉抽了自己一巴掌，\n\n\n\n  我這是在想什麼鬼東西？\n\n\n\n  「你幹嘛？」白鶯鶯看著小蘿莉問道。\n\n\n\n  「打蚊子。」\n\n\n\n  白鶯鶯搖搖頭，\n\n\n\n  你忘了今天是靈魂體來的，打蚊子？\n\n\n\n  「那人應該會很快回來。」周澤伸手指了指灶台位置。\n\n\n\n  說是灶台，其實也就是一個電磁爐放在小桌上，旁邊還有一些調味品以及蔥姜蒜。\n\n\n\n  因為周澤注意到了，整個房間，只有這塊區域沒有染上那種蠟油，意味著它剛被使用過，砧板上還有切好的配菜。\n\n\n\n  可能是對方做飯時切好了配料，卻記起來自己似乎沒買菜。\n\n\n\n  好吧，這個解釋有點傻，但目前來看，好像真的有這麼傻的可能。\n\n\n\n  「去外面再等等。」 \n\n\n\n  周澤把屋門關上，然後站到了樓道口那裡。\n\n\n\n  小蘿莉的靈魂慢慢地飄了起來，然後坐在了欄杆上，兩條小腿一搖一晃，天真爛漫可愛至極。\n\n\n\n  白鶯鶯嘟了嘟嘴，也不知道為什麼，她就認準了這個小蘿莉最終會走向和自己爭寵的道路，或許，這就是女人的知覺吧。\n\n\n\n  所以，白鶯鶯也不甘示弱，雙手撐著欄杆，像是在眺望遠處的風景，但把自己後面的曲線凸顯得淋漓盡致，一副蓬門今始為君開的架勢。\n\n\n\n  周澤站了一會兒，在旁邊的台階上背對著兩個較勁的女人坐了下來，點了一根煙。\n\n\n\n  其實，\n\n\n\n  有時候想想，\n\n\n\n  周老闆上輩子混得並不差，但三十歲的人了，卻一直是光棍兒，連戀愛都沒談過，這並不是沒有原因的。\n\n\n\n  當初的林醫生哪怕沒現在有氣質沒現在發育得好，但也絕對不差，且對自己有著小迷妹的崇拜，結果自己連人家名姓都沒記得住，純當是一條分配到自己手下實習的醫學狗來使用。\n\n\n\n  這樣子的人不注孤生，\n\n\n\n  誰注孤生？\n\n\n\n  一大一小兩個女人在那裡爭相鬥艷得起勁兒，現在卻有種表演給瞎子看的感覺，當下，兩個女人也就安分了下來。\n\n \n\n  抽完一根煙，周澤想起了老許，反正現在也只是在等人，周澤正好抽空給老許打了個電話。\n\n\n\n  老許在感情方面還很嫩，是個雛兒，所以很多時候難免走心過多，那個女人死了，他心裡應該不是很好受。\n\n\n\n  電話打通了，那邊傳來一聲有氣無力地「餵」。\n\n\n\n  「你還好吧？」周澤問道。\n\n\n\n  「還好。」\n\n\n\n  「看開點。」\n\n\n\n  「嗯。」\n\n\n\n  「有些事情，往後看，只能算是你人生中的一次經歷，一次回憶，等以後你就明白了。」\n\n\n\n  電話那頭沉默了許久，\n\n\n\n  周澤以為許清朗在感傷著，因為自己的安慰而受到了觸動，但過了一會兒，許清朗稍微提了點聲音回應道：\n\n\n\n  「你是過來人？」\n\n\n\n  這是反問的語氣。\n\n\n\n  大家都是雛兒，我還開了苞，你還是個處，你來安慰我？\n\n\n\n  「我結婚了。」周澤提醒道。\n\n\n\n  許清朗那邊又沉默了，他忽然覺得周澤真是自己這輩子所見過的最不要臉的一個人。\n\n\n\n  「我還快離婚了。」周澤又道。\n\n\n\n  此時應該有《一剪梅》的BGM響起，襯托出周老闆的憂鬱和故事。 \n\n\n\n  許清朗繼續沉默，這不要臉的等級又提升了一個量級。\n\n\n\n  強行給自己加戲加故事加滄桑？\n\n\n\n  一時間，老許都不知道如何去反駁。\n\n\n\n  「總之，你看開點吧。」\n\n\n\n  說完，周澤掛斷了電話，他覺得再通話下去，惱羞成怒的老許會開始反擊。\n\n\n\n  嗯，這種假意安慰其實是傷口撒鹽的行為才是真朋友！\n\n\n\n  「有人來了。」\n\n\n\n  白鶯鶯開口道。\n\n\n\n  因為這棟樓住戶真的很少很少，所以前面也很少有人經過，現在有一個穿著白色短袖的男子提著一個塑膠袋往這裡走，很大可能就是他們想要找的人。\n\n\n\n  周澤側過身，看向了下面。\n\n\n\n  果然，那個年輕男子提著塑膠袋從這個樓道開始往上走。\n\n\n\n  男子沒什麼異常，白淨的臉蛋，精緻的皮膚，給人一種弱化版許清朗的感覺。\n\n\n\n  周澤覺得自己的審美似乎出現了一些問題，別的男人都是在外面看女人時習慣性地拿外面的女人和自家老婆去比一比。\n\n\n\n  而自己現在是在外面看男人時，習慣性地把那些看起來還不錯的小白臉拿去和許清朗對比。\n\n\n\n  男子手中的塑膠袋沉甸甸的，他走上來後，先是看見了坐在台階上的周澤，又看見了站在欄杆邊的白鶯鶯。 \n\n\n\n  到最後，\n\n\n\n  他的目光又看向了坐在欄杆上搖晃著雙腿的小蘿莉，\n\n\n\n  且特意在小蘿莉的身上多看了幾眼，臉上露出了垂涎的目光。\n\n\n\n  「就是他。」\n\n\n\n  小蘿莉開口道。\n\n\n\n  她是靈魂體來的，\n\n\n\n  能看見自己的人，絕對有問題。\n\n\n\n  白鶯鶯向前一步，企圖抓住男子的肩膀，男子猛地後退一步，手中的塑膠袋砸了過去，白鶯鶯伸手拍開了塑膠袋，結果灑落出十幾隻豬蹄子滾落在了地上。\n\n\n\n  「咔嚓…………」\n\n\n\n  白鶯鶯的手指扣住了對方的肩膀，但對方卻在此時不退反進。\n\n\n\n  只聽得「嗡」一聲響，白鶯鶯沒動，她力氣比對方大得多，但對方這種氣勢和反應讓白鶯鶯一時沒有準備。\n\n\n\n  扣住對方肩膀的手指剎那間鬆開了。\n\n\n\n  好滑，\n\n\n\n  不光是皮膚滑，\n\n\n\n  連他身上衣服都好滑！\n\n\n\n  男子翻身，想要跳過樓梯下去逃跑，而坐在台階上的周澤卻在此時伸手，指甲瞬間長出來，刺入到男子的小腿位置。\n\n\n\n  「啊！」 \n\n\n\n  男子發出了一聲慘叫，摔落在了地上，周澤上前，手指直接扣住了對方的脖頸。\n\n\n\n  男子的身體不停地抽搐著，大概是周澤那一指甲的傷害其實還在繼續的發酵。\n\n\n\n  小蘿莉飄然起身，來到了男子面前。\n\n\n\n  男子翻了翻白眼，他看著周澤，目光裡帶著畏懼和驚恐，他似乎想要說些什麼，但他好像連話都說不利索了，只能在喉嚨里不停地發出：\n\n\n\n  「啊啊……啊啊……啊啊……」\n\n\n\n  「那個日本神父，在哪裡？」周澤問道。\n\n\n\n  「啊啊……啊啊……啊啊……」\n\n\n\n  「你能好好說話？不能說話的話我只能把你解決了。」\n\n\n\n  「啊啊……啊啊……啊啊……」\n\n\n\n  小蘿莉此時低下頭，伸手放在了男子的喉嚨位置，像是在傾聽著什麼。\n\n\n\n  「他說什麼，你翻譯一下。」周澤問道。\n\n\n\n  小蘿莉皺皺眉，很是不可思議，\n\n\n\n  然後看著周澤，道：\n\n\n\n  「他在喊你，\n\n\n\n  爸爸？」",

    "content": "“Ah, ah… ah, ah… ah, ah…”\n\nThe young man was tied up in the corner, unable to move, but he kept yelling at Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze already knew what he was yelling about after the little loli translated it for him earlier.\n\n“Ah, ah… ah, ah… ah, ah…”\n\n“Gag him.” Zhou Ze was getting impatient.\n\nHe’d just gotten a million *yuan* and hadn’t even had time to enjoy it before a son popped out.\n\nTsk, tsk.\n\nBai Yingying nodded, picked up a rag, and directly stuffed it into the man’s mouth. The man couldn’t make a sound now, but his excitement was still evident.\n\nIt was as if the ugly duckling had found the swan’s home; his joy was truly overflowing, as if he couldn’t wait to burrow into Zhou Ze’s embrace and rub against him.\n\n“What exactly is this thing?” Bai Yingying asked the little loli beside her.\n\nThe little loli tilted her nose upward and let out a soft “hmph,” adopting a posture that said, *I don’t talk to people with low intelligence.*\n\n“What exactly is going on?” Zhou Ze asked.\n\n“It’s obvious. You said your ashes were stolen. Setting aside the extreme possibility that the Japanese priest is a fanatical admirer of yours and wanted to collect your ashes to take home, the rest is actually easy to guess. That Japanese priest knew some of your secrets and began to research them.\n\nFor example, cultivating zombies similar to you. Actually, the Japanese really do have that tradition. For instance, many so-called demon gods in Japanese mythology were cross-bred. They’re a mix of you and me, with very messy characteristics.”\n\nBai Yingying looked at the little loli explaining endlessly, and her sense of crisis intensified again.\n\n“Heh.”\n\nZhou Ze let out a dry laugh.\n\nUsing his own ashes to develop derivatives of himself?\n\nThinking about it, it was quite interesting.\n\n“Actually, I’ve always been curious about one thing.” The little loli tilted her head, looking at Zhou Ze, “You don’t seem curious about your past secrets at all.”\n\n“What do I need to be curious about? I am who I am.”\n\n“Mmm-hmm, a different kind of fireworks.”\n\nThe little loli stood up, her figure drifting, passing through the door,\n\n“I’ll go out and take a look. If that priest returns here, I should be able to spot him in advance.”\n\nInside the room, only Zhou Ze, Bai Yingying, and the captive remained.\n\nBai Yingying pointed at the captive and asked, “Boss, how do we deal with your son... this guy?”\n\n“Is there any chance of saving him?” Zhou Ze asked.\n\n“He’s actually infected with zombie poison, and very deeply. If it were at the beginning, there might have been a way to solve it, but now, it’s basically hopeless. Moreover, if left unchecked, he could very well turn completely into a walking corpse, with an instinctive urge and craving for fresh human blood and flesh.\n\nHe’s not a zombie, and he doesn’t qualify to be in our sequence.”\n\n“But he still seems to have some consciousness now.”\n\n“That’s just an illusion, Boss. From the moment he started calling you 'Papa,' it meant that the original him, that soul, that consciousness, had already been annihilated. He’s more like an infant now, relearning and perceiving this world from his new perspective. And because he has countless ties to you, he instinctively feels a sense of closeness to you.”\n\n“Then dispose of him.”\n\nZhou Ze said.\n\nSince he couldn’t be saved, it was better to deal with him. Keeping him was like keeping a ticking time bomb that could harm ordinary people. Zhou Ze wasn’t so soft-hearted at this moment.\n\nBai Yingying nodded, reached out and grabbed the man’s neck. Then, as if she remembered something, she said to Zhou Ze:\n\n“Boss, can you turn your head away and not look?”\n\nBai Yingying didn’t want the boss to see her rough side.\n\nZhou Ze turned his head away.\n\nThen, he heard only a “crunch,”\n\nWhen he turned back, he saw that the man’s head had already been twisted off by Bai Yingying.\n\nA high school girl, holding a human head,\n\nStill curiously examining the wound on the neck; this scene looked very bizarre.\n\nIt was full of youthful vitality mixed with hair-raising horror.\n\nThe head was twisted off, but no blood splattered out. It was clear that the blood vessels at the broken part of the wound had long since clotted and shriveled, with black threads intertwined within.\n\nJust then, a wisp of black mist spewed from the nostrils of the head in Bai Yingying’s hand. A man’s face condensed in the black mist. He looked towards Zhou Ze, expressing gratitude, and then slowly dissipated.\n\nHe was liberated.\n\nHe was indeed liberated, but he also lost the chance to re-enter reincarnation due to his special encounter. However, this kind of ending was actually a form of happiness.\n\nZhou Ze gently rubbed the tip of his nose, his breathing also becoming slightly heavier.\n\nTo be honest, his desire to kill that Japanese priest had grown even stronger now. From the moment that guy stole his ashes, many of the things he’d experienced recently had continuously increased his hatred for that Japanese priest.\n\nBai Yingying put down the head and washed her hands at the faucet.\n\n“Boss, you must kill that priest. He actually wants to add cross-breeds to our species, and that person, he was so pitiful.”\n\nBai Yingying said seriously.\n\nThis sounded as if she was worried that her and Zhou Ze’s future offspring would be impure.\n\n“He’s here. I’ll hold him off; you two come down!”\n\nThe little loli let out a piercing shriek that ordinary people couldn’t hear, then plunged down from the balcony.\n\nThat Japanese priest wasn’t an ordinary person. Letting him walk up the stairs and into the room by himself would introduce too many variables. Who knew if he’d sense something was wrong and just run away?\n\nSo the little loli charged in directly. Her goal was to entangle the opponent at all costs, giving Zhou Ze and Bai Yingying time to surround him.\n\nThe Japanese priest stood there, having just sneezed. He pulled out a handkerchief to wipe his nose, his eyes a bit red, clearly having a cold.\n\nBut just as he put down his handkerchief, a large tongue appeared in his line of sight!\n\nThe priest quickly retreated. The tongue swept horizontally multiple times, drawing a circle around him, trapping him inside.\n\n“It’s you again. You’ve been following and monitoring me multiple times. Do you really think I didn’t know?!\n\nI thought you were just fulfilling the local ghost messenger’s duty of supervision, but I didn’t expect you to actually make a move. I’m a living person; you can only manage the dead!”\n\nThe priest was calm and composed. Clearly, he had long been aware of the little loli’s surveillance.\n\nThe little loli remained silent, her feet hovering in the air, her mouth wide open, her long tongue twitching incessantly.\n\n“I’m leaving Tongcheng today. You could have turned a blind eye as before. Although the Underworld is strict and inviolable, do you, a ghost messenger like you, truly have the face to represent the Underworld?!”\n\nThe priest made hand seals,\n\nStepping in a *Yu* gait,\n\nIn an instant, gusts of strong wind raged. The little loli’s tongue began to break, and after supporting for a short while, it shattered into pieces.\n\nThe little loli closed her mouth, her lips wriggling for a moment, and then her figure began to retreat.\n\n“Are you scared already?”\n\nThe priest smiled faintly, with a hint of smugness.\n\nBut in the next moment, his expression changed. A white figure charged directly towards him.\n\nThe priest flipped his hands downwards, and two scalpels appeared in his grip, cutting directly at the rapidly approaching white figure!\n\n“Clang!”\n\nThe sound of metal clashing rang out.\n\nThis was the sound of the scalpels cutting into the opponent’s body.\n\nThe priest’s eyes narrowed. To possess such a formidable physique, this was a zombie!\n\nBai Yingying took the two slashes from the priest head-on, while her shoulder slammed hard into the priest’s chest.\n\n“Bang!”\n\nThe priest was sent flying backward, falling heavily to the ground.\n\nBai Yingying didn’t pursue him further. Instead, she stood still, as if calming the *sha* energy within her body. The opponent’s scalpels carried a sacred power that stimulated the flow of *sha* energy within her.\n\nIn comparison, the physical damage was secondary.\n\nAfter landing, the priest quickly stood up, propping himself with one hand. The little loli’s presence here didn’t surprise him; she had maintained a mutual understanding of non-interference for a while.\n\nBut the appearance of this female zombie made him feel a bad omen.\n\nTurning his head,\n\nThe priest indeed saw Zhou Ze appearing not far behind him.\n\n“Heh…”\n\nZhou Ze squeezed his wrist, walking step by step towards the priest.\n\n“Sir, I think there might be a slight misunderstanding between us. You can let me explain.”\n\nZhou Ze didn’t respond, continuing to walk towards him.\n\n“Sir, you should know the general course of events, but I truly bear no ill will towards you. I’m just very curious about your past. I just want to help you find your past and uncover your secrets.”\n\nZhou Ze still didn’t respond, continuing to close the distance between himself and the priest.\n\n“Sir, you must understand my sincerity. You know, I have always admired Chinese culture and revered Chinese myths and legends.\n\nThis is a cultural centripetal force and cohesion. I am deeply impressed by Chinese culture and am willing to dedicate my heart and soul to understanding it.”\n\nZhou Ze still didn’t respond, continuing to walk forward. At the same time, Zhou Ze’s long, inky black fingernails slowly grew out.\n\n“Everything I said is true. In my opinion, you are also a part of Chinese culture, so I couldn’t help but want to study you.\n\nYou see how fluent my Chinese is? That just shows how fascinated I am with Chinese culture.\n\nDon’t believe me?\n\nI can even sing Chinese songs for you!\n\nDon’t you Chinese people just love it when foreigners speak Chinese and sing Chinese songs, making your hearts swell with pride and joy?\n\nSo incredibly hyped!”\n\nThe priest took a deep breath. At first, he still harbored a sliver of hope, but seeing Zhou Ze approach him step by step without hesitation, he simply stopped pretending.\n\nHe plunged the two scalpels into his palms, and blood flowed out, soaking the scalpels.\n\nThe priest slowly put away his previous smile and said in a deep voice:\n\n“I’ve said so much; you should at least say a few words before you make a move, or else I’ll be so embarrassed.”\n\n“*Baka*.” Zhou Ze said.\n\n“…” The priest.\n\n——————\n\nIn Dragon’s memory, for many, many years, no supernatural book has entered the top ten of the monthly ticket general list.\n\nLast month, we were first on the new book monthly ticket list!\n\nEven after Dragon said he couldn’t take it anymore after two consecutive new book periods and needed to rest and be chill about competing for rankings, at the end of the month, we were still tenth on the overall monthly ticket list.\n\nWe have already created many records belonging to the supernatural category.\n\nLet’s push forward one more step.\n\nEvery step,\n\nWe are creating new records!\n\nMonthly tickets,\n\nWe need monthly tickets!",

    "content": "For a long time, no, to be precise, his entire last life, Zhou Ze was someone who couldn't fight.\n\nHe hadn't learned martial arts, nor had he practiced Taekwondo; he wasn't even very familiar with basic martial arts forms.\n\nBecause of this, when he first saw Bai Yingying wake up, in Xu Qinglang's words, Bai Yingying stood in the bookstore, her \"tyrant's aura\" fully unleashed, like a big burly man.\n\nAnd Zhou Ze, with his fingernails, charged forward scratching wildly like a betrayed wife attacking a mistress, scratching Bai Yingying until her spirit exploded, directly causing her to turn from \"Bai Yingying\" to \"Bai Yingying (whining)\".\n\nIn the half-year he had been a grim reaper, Zhou Ze had become aware of some of his own issues, but he hadn't tried to improve.\n\nThere were many reasons for this, but the biggest reason was... laziness.\n\nA single skill, well-honed, was enough to conquer the world; when facing ghosts and ordinary people, his fingernails were already sufficient.\n\nEven if he encountered a stronger opponent, he could still activate his \"Musou.\"\n\nAlthough he knew little about how his \"Musou\" came to be, following the lazy principle of \"when in Rome, do as the Romans do,\" Zhou Ze used it quite happily. The only side effect was that he would be paralyzed for a long time afterward.\n\nSo, even though he knew he couldn't fight, Zhou Ze wasn't afraid when facing a fight, and he gradually developed the misconception that \"I'm very good at fighting.\"\n\nThe priest stepped forward, brandishing a scalpel with extreme speed, the blade aimed directly at Zhou Ze's glabella.\n\nZhou Ze didn't dodge; \"no matter how many paths you take, I take only one.\" His right hand shot out directly towards the priest's face.\n\nThe result of this would be that the priest's scalpel could pierce Zhou Ze's temple, but the priest himself would have five \"skylights\" opened on his head by Zhou Ze to let some air in.\n\nThe priest hadn't expected Zhou Ze to be so resolute. Even with the advantage of an ambush, he still chose to fight in a fierce, life-for-life manner.\n\nThen,\n\nThe priest chickened out.\n\nHe withdrew his hand and retreated. Zhou Ze didn't grasp the priest's face, only brushed his chest.\n\n\"Slam!\"\n\nBlack mist swept out like a whip,\n\nThe priest was knocked to the ground. Although he quickly rolled and stood up on his knees, in this single exchange, he was clearly at a disadvantage.\n\nBai Yingying watched her boss's ferocity, her mouth wide open.\n\nVaguely, she seemed to recall the fear of being \"violently poked and prodded\" by her boss the first time she met him in the bookstore.\n\nThat was truly her and her boss's \"life is but a first meeting.\"\n\nThe little loli watched from the side, chewing on her tongue as if it were chewing gum, then suddenly let out a giggle.\n\nShe had figured it out: Zhou Ze actually couldn't fight at all.\n\nPitiful, that idiotic zombie next to her was still infatuated.\n\nDon't you know your boss might really die at the hands of that shit priest if you don't help?!\n\nCan't you have some idea of how much stamina your boss actually has?\n\nThe priest sprang up again, moving quickly. This time, he didn't dare to charge directly at Zhou Ze but chose to maneuver, as he was also somewhat intimidated by Zhou Ze's \"wide-open\" fighting style and couldn't quite get a read on him.\n\nMoreover, he knew that Zhou Ze's true terror was when he transformed into a zombie. He had fought Zhou Ze in that state before, breaking several ribs, and his injuries were considerable. And at that time, Zhou Ze had just battled the Temple God, Lady Qingyi.\n\nJust like that, the priest and Boss Zhou fought back and forth, truly like a proper duel: you advance, I retreat; you retreat, I advance; you maneuver, I maneuver. It was quite exciting.\n\nZhou Ze was full of confidence, and the priest was trembling, truly creating the impression of a master-level showdown. At least from the perspective of special effects and action scenes, it was more aesthetically pleasing to the audience than contemporary so-called martial arts masters just throwing wild \"turtle punches.\"\n\nFinally, Bai Yingying realized what was happening and charged forward again, joining the fray.\n\nThe little loli also didn't dare to continue watching from the sidelines. Although she greatly hoped the priest could kill Zhou Ze instantly, allowing her to gain her freedom, she didn't dare to gamble. If Zhou Ze didn't die and discovered she had been watching idly from the sidelines, then she would be the one to die.\n\nBai Yingying's fighting style was more direct than Zhou Ze's. She actively took on damage for Zhou Ze, completely devoted to protecting her master. Combined with her excellent physical condition, she wasn't at a disadvantage even when directly confronting the priest. This freed up more opportunities and space for Zhou Ze to attack. Additionally, with the little loli constantly providing sneak attack support, the priest was truly miserable.\n\nAfter several gruesome wounds were inflicted on him by Zhou Ze, the priest's gaze sharpened. Blood once again covered his scalpels, and then he plunged both knives into the concrete ground, simultaneously forming a hand seal.\n\nInstantly, a barrier appeared. The little loli, during a sneak attack, directly crashed into the barrier, causing her soul to become unstable, forcing her to retreat.\n\nThis barrier had a restraining effect on all dark entities, and Zhou Ze and his two companions, strictly speaking, were not of the righteous path; they would all be restrained.\n\nThe little loli knew when to quit, absolutely refusing to give herself a chance to be severely injured.\n\nBut Bai Yingying was much more straightforward,\n\nShe continuously slammed herself into the barrier. Even though evil aura scattered from her body with each impact, making her visibly suffer, she still gritted her teeth and continued to ram it, intending to smash the barrier into pieces!\n\n\"What a big simpleton.\"\n\nThe little loli snorted disdainfully.\n\nAnd it was at this moment that Zhou Ze also plunged his fingers into the ground, a black light beginning to emerge in his eyes. Then, he slowly began to pull his hands outward!\n\nThe scalpels the priest had plunged into the ground slowly began to be drawn out by an invisible force. Coupled with Bai Yingying's continuous impacts, the barrier began to become precarious.\n\nBeads of sweat had appeared on the priest's forehead. His peripheral vision began to dart around, clearly understanding that in this situation, it would be difficult to win. Especially knowing that Zhou Ze hadn't even unleashed his full power yet, and he was already so passive, continuing to stalemate would only lead him deeper into trouble, and he might even truly perish here.\n\nSo, he decided to flee, to find an opportunity to escape.\n\nBlood began to seep from Zhou Ze's fingers, as if they had been cut by sharp blades. At the same time, Zhou Ze roared at the little loli nearby:\n\n\"If he doesn't die today, you'll die in his place.\"\n\nA threat,\n\nA naked threat!\n\nThe little loli was stunned. She hadn't expected Zhou Ze to say such a thing. Although she had always been Zhou Ze's subordinate, subdued by him, her proud nature refused to truly become a servant like Bai Yingying. She had always maintained her haughtiness.\n\nShe constantly reminded herself that she was different from that idiotic girl, Bai Yingying!\n\nBut Zhou Ze's words completely shattered her pride.\n\nThese words could be translated to mean: you are my dog, and if you can't catch the prey, then this dog can be cooked and eaten.\n\nIt was very realistic, tearing apart all tenderness.\n\nThe little loli glared angrily at Zhou Ze. She now wished she could kill this man directly, dismembering him!\n\nBut she still flashed, transforming into a black light, and charged directly at the priest.\n\n\"Rise!\"\n\nZhou Ze forcibly pulled out his bloody hands,\n\nThe scalpels the priest had plunged into the ground immediately flew out.\n\nBai Yingying delivered a blow, which the priest barely blocked by bringing his arms together. But the little loli appeared directly behind the priest, her entire soul taking the opportunity to pierce into the priest's body.\n\n\"Ah ah ah ah ah!!!!!\"\n\nFrom the priest's mouth, the pained screams of a man and a little girl erupted.\n\nBai Yingying delivered an elbow strike, slamming it heavily into the priest's chest. The priest was sent flying like a fly, and Bai Yingying quickly followed up, directly pinning him down, simultaneously smashing her fists repeatedly onto his chest.\n\n\"Thud!\"\n\n\"Thud!\"\n\n\"Thud!\"\n\nA continuous barrage of heavy punches,\n\nDull thuds echoed throughout the neighborhood, but the priest's body showed an unusual toughness. Under Bai Yingying's zombie-like punches, it only emitted sounds of bone grinding. If it had been an ordinary person, they would have probably been pounded into a pulp by Bai Yingying long ago, and a very chewy kind of pulp at that.\n\n\"Ah!\"\n\nJust then, the little loli, who had previously burrowed into the priest's body, shot out, her soul somewhat fragmented, much dimmer and more transparent than before.\n\nShe pointed at the priest and said, \"There's something wrong with his body!\"\n\nYes,\n\nThere was definitely something wrong with this body.\n\nBai Yingying, who had been fiercely pummeling him, knew this deeply, as if she were chewing a piece of beef full of tendons, unable to break it down no matter how much she chewed!\n\n\"Whew...\"\n\nThe priest seemed to have made some kind of decision. His eyes began to be replaced by crimson, and his muscles started to shrink.\n\nBai Yingying was stunned,\n\nHoly crap,\n\nWhy did this feel so familiar?!\n\nThe priest seemed to be in great pain, and it was clear that he was doing this out of necessity, because he also knew that his research had not been successful at all; it was still in the failed stages of experimentation.\n\nBut he had no choice,\n\nOtherwise, he would soon be pounded into elastic meat pulp by this female zombie, mixed with a little flour, and kneaded into \"peeing beef balls\" to be boiled in a hot pot.\n\n\"Roar!\"\n\nThe priest's body stiffened. Bai Yingying delivered a punch to his head.\n\n\"Thud!\"\n\nThe priest crashed down again, creating a pit in the ground before bouncing back and directly colliding with Bai Yingying, sending her staggering back several steps.\n\n\"Ugh... Ugh...\"\n\nThe priest slowly stood up, his body swaying slightly, half his face green, half gray, looking like Ouyang Feng who had practiced the Toad Skill. In short, his entire being was filled with a sense of chaos and eeriness.\n\nBai Yingying was about to charge again but was held back by Zhou Ze's hand.\n\n\"Take a rest, don't get yourself too badly injured.\"\n\nBai Yingying nodded obediently upon hearing this, but looked at Zhou Ze with some concern, meaning, 'Boss, can you handle this alone?'\n\nZhou Ze appeared very nonchalant,\n\nAnd walked a few more steps forward,\n\n\"Cough cough...\"\n\nHe coughed a few times softly,\n\nSeemingly trying to get the priest's attention.\n\nThe priest's eyes fixed on Zhou Ze,\n\nHis expression constantly shifting,\n\nFirst hatred,\n\nThen anger,\n\nThen doubt,\n\nFollowed by confusion.\n\n\"What did you call me?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nThe priest tilted his head, continuing to stare at Zhou Ze, his throat making \"gurgling\" sounds,\n\nHe covered his mouth, tightly covering his mouth, as if trying to stop something,\n\nBut the craving was overflowing, utterly unstoppable.\n\nZhou Ze opened his arms,\n\nHis expression gentle,\n\n\"Come,\n\nDaddy loves you.\"\n\nFinally,\n\nThe priest couldn't hold it in any longer.\n\nHis experiment had one major flaw that he didn't know about, because he had only stolen Zhou Ze's ashes from his previous life for the experiment, but he hadn't been able to capture Zhou Ze to participate in the experiment!\n\nFinally, the hand covering his mouth slipped,\n\nThe priest shouted excitedly:\n\n\"Otou-san...\" (Daddy)\n\n————————\n\nPS:\n\nCurrently 9th on the monthly vote overall list,\n\n5th in fan squads,\n\nBut I (Dragon) feel,\n\nWe can go even higher!\n\nTo those with monthly votes, please cast your votes for me (Dragon)!",

    "content": "There's a story like this: a highly skilled blacksmith first forged an extremely sturdy cage, then crafted an equally strong iron lock.\n\nHe then walked into the cage he had made, carefully feeling its strength, when suddenly, the lock hanging on it fell shut.\n\nHe was trapped inside. Because his shop was quite secluded and business wasn't good, by the time he was discovered, he had long since died of thirst or starvation in the cage.\n\nAnd the Japanese priest before them now was like the blacksmith in the story, meticulously crafting an iron cage and an iron lock, only to end up locking himself in.\n\nThe priest, after all, was different from the young man whose head Bai Yingying had twisted off upstairs moments ago to end his suffering. He was more advanced, with a stronger capacity for endurance.\n\nTherefore,\n\nhe still retained a part of his sanity.\n\nWhen that young man called Zhou Ze \"Papa,\" the elation, the overflowing joy, the immense excitement were truly genuine expressions, moving one to tears.\n\nBut when this Japanese priest called out \"Otou-san,\" it was with extreme awkwardness, shyness, shame, suppression, and a coy resistance, much like a female protagonist in some melodramatic TV show who has been drugged by a villain.\n\n\"Otou-san!\"\n\nAfter calling out, a look of horror flashed in the Japanese priest's eyes. How could things have turned out this way? He had a very ominous premonition, and this premonition told him that events had taken a turn towards an extreme more terrifying than death.\n\nThings had come to this point, a glimmer of hope appeared, at least from Zhou Ze's perspective, it certainly was.\n\nHe continued to spread his arms, and facing that \"Otou-san,\" he nodded gently, responding with a soft,\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\nWith a response came interaction, and with interaction, that impulse grew even stronger!\n\nThe Japanese priest's eyes were wide, he could no longer control himself.\n\n\"Otou-san!\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"Otou-san!\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"Otou-san! Otou-san! Otou-san!!………………\"\n\nThe first time was awkward, purely accompanied by a slight dryness and pang of pain.\n\nThe second time was much easier, after all, the first time had laid the groundwork.\n\nAfter that, everything became second nature. The struggling person gave up struggling, because they were already numb.\n\nZhou Ze slowly squatted down, patting his hands towards the priest, as if teasing a corgi at home, calling it over for a rub.\n\nThe priest staggered towards Zhou Ze, then, in front of Zhou Ze, actually lay down. His face twitched and trembled, his subconscious telling him he absolutely couldn't do this, but that impulsive and intimate urge from the depths of his heart directly shattered his rationality.\n\n\"Good boy, no more struggling.\"\n\nZhou Ze said softly to him.\n\nThe priest slowly closed his eyes.\n\nHe had, in a way, resigned himself.\n\n\"Pfft...\"\n\nHowever, Zhou Ze showed no subsequent warmth. His sharp fingernails directly pierced the top of the priest's head.\n\nThe priest's body began to tremble incessantly, but his face revealed a sense of enjoyment.\n\n\"Thunder, rain, and dew are all blessings from the sovereign,\"*\n\nThis saying was vividly interpreted on his person.\n\nWhy Bai Yingying was so respectful to Zhou Ze now was for the same reason. In ordinary human society, one could still shout the slogan \"Are kings, marquises, generals, and chancellors born to be so?\" But in the genes of other species, the subordinate obeying the superior is an ingrained habit, difficult to change, and difficult to resist.\n\nThe little loli walked to Zhou Ze's side, looking at the priest below, who was both enjoying and being tormented. She pursed her lips and then spoke,\n\n\"Aren't you considering taking a godson for real? After all, the difference between you and the Grand Eunuch is not that big.\"\n\n\"This son, I cannot afford to take,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\nYes, taking this Japanese priest home, even if not as a son but as a pet, seemed like a good decision. After all, there were already quite a few strange people in his bookstore; one more priest wouldn't hurt.\n\nBut Zhou Ze didn't have a hoarding habit, and this priest was too dangerous. Zhou Ze wasn't sure how long this \"father-son\" relationship could last, and he didn't know when this priest might \"wake up\" on his own.\n\nKeeping a dog was fine; a dog at least knew loyalty. But keeping a venomous snake was playing too dangerously; he might actually get bitten by it one day.\n\nThe priest's body slowly began to turn black. The black aura from Zhou Ze's fingertips was continuously pouring into his body, furiously destroying his flesh.\n\nThis torment lasted about twenty seconds. The priest stopped moving; his entire body had turned a dark purplish-blue.\n\nZhou Ze withdrew his fingernails, but at the same time, he extended his other hand forward, clenching his palm tightly.\n\n\"Ah!\"\n\nA black soul was clutched by Zhou Ze. It was the priest's face, twisted with struggle and boundless rage.\n\nBecause he couldn't imagine that his final outcome would be like this, voluntarily offering himself up in such a shameful manner, extending his neck to the other party, awaiting the execution.\n\nThis ending was too stifling, too unbearable. He was truly unwilling, extremely, extremely unwilling.\n\nHe still had other methods, other secret techniques. Even if the situation was truly critical, he was not without a chance to escape with his life.\n\n\"Yingying,\" Zhou Ze called out.\n\n\"Here, Boss.\"\n\n\"Find some gasoline and burn his body for me.\"\n\n\"Okay, Boss.\"\n\nZhou Ze casually took out a small stack of Hell Bank Notes from his pocket and burned them with a lighter.\n\nThis would ensure that when he destroyed the body in the residential area, no outsiders would come to see it, and no one would accidentally intrude.\n\nHell Bank Notes could be exchanged for money, but they could also ward off trouble. This kind of use, where one hadn't done anything wrong but simply wanted to avoid trouble, had always been smooth.\n\nThe priest's soul in Zhou Ze's palm continued to struggle, and after a while, he began to beg again.\n\nEven in death, the soul of such a person was somewhat different from that of an ordinary person.\n\nZhou Ze ignored him, keeping him there.\n\nBai Yingying found gasoline, placed it on the ground, and then silently walked out again.\n\nA moment later, Bai Yingying returned, carrying a barbecue grill. She set the grill down next to them.\n\nZhou Ze was stunned.\n\nThe little loli was also stunned.\n\nZhou Ze pointed to the barbecue grill and asked,\n\n\"What is the meaning of this?\"\n\nBai Yingying looked a bit bewildered, then looked up and asked Zhou Ze, \"Boss, aren't we barbecuing him?\"\n\n\"You like to eat this?\" Zhou Ze pointed at the Japanese priest's body.\n\nBai Yingying shook her head, \"Boss, didn't you say you wanted to mix his ashes with rice?\"\n\nSaying this, Bai Yingying even pulled out a bag from beside her.\n\n\"I even specially bought rice.\"\n\n\"…………\" Zhou Ze.\n\nThe little loli beside them laughed like a pig.\n\nZhou Ze really wanted to caress Bai Yingying's head and gently ask her if she was doing it on purpose.\n\nBut he decided against it, because Bai Yingying was truly the type of person who might take his \"exaggerated metaphors\" made in anger seriously.\n\nAt least, you couldn't blame her for this.\n\n\"I didn't finish the second half of my sentence,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Huh?\" Bai Yingying.\n\n\"I want to mix his ashes with rice and feed it to my Yingying for supper.\"\n\nBai Yingying's expression instantly became a sight to behold.\n\n\"Just burn him first, then find a public restroom and toss the ashes,\" Zhou Ze said, no longer teasing the female zombie.\n\nOne couldn't blame Zhou Ze for being so particular about ashes, because most people couldn't experience the situation of having their ashes stolen and then seeking revenge on the thief.\n\nSo, special circumstances call for special measures. Since you stole my ashes, I'll retaliate with yours, an eye for an eye.\n\nBai Yingying began pouring gasoline on the priest's body. The priest's soul was frantically jumping up and down, but Zhou Ze just made him watch.\n\n\"Boss, I'm lighting the fire.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\nBai Yingying lit the fire, and the priest's body began to burn. For a moment, the smell of roasting meat filled the air.\n\nA sense of despair emanated from the priest's soul.\n\nHowever, as it burned, Zhou Ze suddenly noticed something amiss and took a step forward.\n\nBai Yingying also let out a startled sound, because she saw the body in the fire slowly sitting up.\n\n\"Boss, do bodies do that when they're burned?\" Bai Yingying asked Zhou Ze.\n\nWhy ask Zhou Ze?\n\nBecause Zhou Ze had experience.\n\nIn fact, theoretically, a corpse suddenly twitching or sitting up during cremation could also be explained scientifically.\n\nZhou Ze didn't have time to explain,\n\nbecause soon, no scientific explanation would be needed.\n\nThe body didn't just sit up,\n\nit actually stood up.\n\nHere, take the pen,\n\nhow do you explain this?\n\nFrom the flames, the corpse walked out. It still had embers on it and was still burning. Its clothes had long since disintegrated, and its skin was already a gruesome sight.\n\nBut it still walked out. Its eyes had been closed, and even though its entire face was a bloody, pitted mess, when it stepped out of the firelight, it slowly opened its eyes.\n\nIn its eye sockets,\n\nthere was an empty void,\n\nbut soon, two green halos of light appeared, radiating a peculiar glow.\n\nFor some reason, when this fellow walked out, Zhou Ze felt a telepathic connection with him, as if this fellow was another self, completely pure, without any impurities.\n\n\"Ugh...\"\n\nIt opened its mouth,\n\nbut no words came out.\n\nThe priest's soul, clenched in Zhou Ze's palm, was incredibly excited at this moment. He had succeeded, his research had actually succeeded in this unforeseen way!\n\nHowever,\n\nZhou Ze lifted him up,\n\nand then,\n\nlet go.\n\nThe priest was stunned,\n\nhe was just set free like that?\n\n\"Ugh...\"\n\nBut in the next instant,\n\nthe corpse suddenly moved. It opened its mouth, revealing black fangs, and bit directly into the priest's soul, then tore at it frantically.\n\nThe priest didn't even have time to scream before his soul was torn to shreds by his own corpse in an extremely brutal manner!\n\nAfter doing all this,\n\nthe corpse raised its head again, looking at Zhou Ze.\n\nThe two of them stared at each other;\n\nthen,\n\nthe corpse silently bent down,\n\non one knee,\n\nand knelt.\n\n---\n*雷霆雨露皆是君恩 (léi tíng yǔ lù jiē shì jūn ēn): An idiom meaning \"All things, be they thunder or rain, are blessings from the sovereign.\" It implies that a subordinate should accept whatever the superior bestows, whether it be punishment or favor, as a form of grace or benevolence.",

    "content": "“What the hell is that?”\n\nThe old Taoist priest watched an adult draped in black gauze emerge from the car, wondering if the boss and the others had gone out for revenge. Not only did they not lose any members, but they came back with an extra person?\n\nAnd this person was so strange, completely covered from head to toe, not even their eyes showing.\n\nCouldn't even tell if it was a man or a woman.\n\nSo mysterious,\nA person in black?\nHmm?\nNo,\nAnd they smelled good,\nLike Brazilian BBQ.\n\nThe old Taoist priest put his nose close to the person and sniffed. So fragrant, very aromatic. He then turned to Zhou Ze and asked:\n\n“Boss, did you go for BBQ?”\n\n“Ugh…”\n\nThe little loli beside them couldn't bear it, especially when the old Taoist priest blissfully sniffed that thing. It was truly disgusting.\n\nShe was very glad she hadn't brought her physical body today, otherwise she would have puked.\n\n“Brought them back to help with housework. If you need anything done, you can ask them,” Zhou Ze said.\n\n“Huh?”\n\nThe old Taoist priest was startled.\nDarn it!\nHe had previously mocked Bai Yingying for constantly trying to compete with the little loli for affection, and now his own status was being infringed upon?\n\nEven this job of cleaning, living by the whims of ghosts, earning no salary, and having to offer sacrifices to ghosts from time to time—someone was trying to take it from him?\n\nIs there no justice left in this world!\nJob competition is too brutal nowadays!\n\n“Go give them a bath. Be gentle,” Zhou Ze said.\n\n“A bath?”\n\nThe old Taoist priest paused, then asked:\n\n“Is it a woman?”\n\n“Yes, it's a woman, so you need to be gentle. They have severe autism.”\n\nHearing this, the old Taoist priest\nHehe,\nSubconsciously rubbed his calloused hands.\n\n“Is this, appropriate?”\n\n“I trust your character.”\n\nZhou Ze patted the old Taoist priest on the shoulder,\nIndicating, *I have high hopes for you*.\n\nThen, Zhou Ze said to the masked person: “Follow him. Do whatever he tells you to do.”\n\nThe masked person walked over to the old Taoist priest, very obedient.\n\nThe old Taoist priest was a bit shy, but still led them to the bathroom.\n\nZhou Ze and the others also entered the bookstore. Bai Yingying poured Zhou Ze a cup of coffee. Zhou Ze took a sip, then said:\n\n“Go lock the bathroom door.”\n\n“Alrighty.”\n\nBai Yingying quickly went and locked the door.\n\nA moment later,\nHorrified screams came from the bathroom, followed by the old Taoist priest continuously banging on the bathroom door, looking utterly miserable.\n\n“Boss, let me out! Let me out!”\n\n“Clean them up first,” Zhou Ze said.\n\n“…” Old Taoist priest.\n\nAbout half an hour later, the old Taoist priest emerged, his face a mix of green and white. He didn't eat dinner and sat alone at the bar, contemplating life.\n\nThe visual impact had indeed been too strong, almost causing the old Taoist priest to collapse internally.\n\nThe little loli went back; she had been out of her spiritual body for too long and needed to return to slumber.\n\nAt dinner, Xu Qinglang still hadn't returned, likely still feeling melancholic. Zhou Ze had to order takeout again.\n\nFollowing Zhou Ze's instructions, Bai Yingying went out and bought a few sets of clothes, the kind that cover the entire body. These were hard to find, so Bai Yingying could only buy a few Spider-Man and Iron Man outfits. After dressing the person in them, they looked much more normal.\n\nThis way, they could move around the bookstore and do things normally in the future, without worrying about scaring anyone.\n\nAfter dinner, Zhou Ze looked at the old Taoist priest, who was still sitting there absentmindedly, feeling a bit sorry for him.\n\nIn his heart, there was also some guilt.\nRight then,\nZhou Ze walked over and stood in front of the old Taoist priest.\n\nThe old Taoist priest looked at Zhou Ze blankly,\n*I'm so wronged,*\n*I want to cry.*\n\n“Boss…”\n\n“It's okay. Try to look on the bright side.”\nZhou Ze comforted him.\n\n“Boss, next time, can you give me some psychological preparation beforehand?”\n\nIt wasn't that the old Taoist priest was too naive. It was because those around ghosts were all strange people, and it wasn't impossible for a shy girl to ask him to help her bathe and chat about life.\n\nBut when he, with anticipation and excitement, helped that person undress,\nWhat was revealed was a large area of burnt skin, with pus oozing from all over…\n\nImagination was full,\nReality was skeletal.\nThis huge discrepancy was enough to make the old Taoist priest break down. He even felt that he might contract the same problem as the boss because of this incident.\n\nThis was the boss's revenge, definitely revenge. It was his fault for constantly talking about his \"prostitute-protecting\" deeds in front of the boss.\n\nIt was like talking about how spoiled and disobedient one's son was in front of a eunuch—asking for death.\n\n“Don't worry, it won't happen again next time.”\n\n“Mm, thank you, boss.” The old Taoist priest took a deep breath and asked: “Boss, what is this thing?”\n\nThat fellow, he wasn't even considered human anymore.\n\n“It's that Japanese priest,” Zhou Ze replied.\n\n“What?” The old Taoist priest was startled.\n\n“You can ask Bai Yingying about the specific process. Anyway, he's quite safe now, completely under my control. You can really have him help with cleaning and stuff in the future.”\n\n“Alrighty.” Hearing this, the old Taoist priest finally felt a little better.\n\n“You're getting old. It's not suitable for you to do too much of this kind of work in the future. You should also pay more attention to your health.”\n\n“Don't worry, boss, this humble Taoist priest is in great health. I can go for half an hour at a time, making them feel like earning my money is truly difficult and a torment.”\n\n“Oh.”\n\nJust then, Xu Qinglang walked in from outside. He went to the bar, poured a glass of red wine, and drank it in one go.\n\nClearly, he was quite dejected.\n\nZhou Ze patted the old Taoist priest on the shoulder again, saying: “Don't worry, next time I ask you to do something, I'll definitely let you know beforehand.”\n\n“Thank you, boss.”\n\n“He'll be sharing a room with you and sleeping with you from now on. This is advance notice.”\n\n“…” Old Taoist priest.\n\nZhou Ze walked up to Xu Qinglang and said, “What's wrong? Still dispirited?”\n\n“I'm fine. It's not like I can't get over it.” Xu Qinglang licked his lips with his tongue, then poured another glass of red wine and continued drinking.\n\nZhou Ze didn't know how to comfort him; he'd probably get over it himself in a while.\n\n“Old Zhou, do you think there are really gods in this world?” Xu Qinglang asked.\n\n“Probably, given that I'm a ghost messenger.”\nIf there's one, there can be two; if there are two, there can be three; if there are three, there can be all things.\n\nXu Qinglang nodded. “So, there's also a sea god?”\n\n“If you think so, then there should be.”\n\n“That sea god is a real piece of work.”\n\n“Maybe he's not even a human. Could be a giant sea turtle that became a spirit, who knows.”\n\nAt the bookstore entrance, a group of students walked in. The leader was a girl, about seventeen or eighteen, likely a high school student.\n\n“Boss, there are so many of us, can we get a discount?”\n\n“What discount? I'll pay for everyone,” a chubby male student said.\n\nSubsequently, these students sat together and began copying each other's homework.\n\nEveryone copied very seriously and solemnly, as if they were truly doing it themselves.\n\n“It feels like going back to the old days,” Xu Qinglang said, pointing at the students with one hand holding his wine glass.\n\n“I never copied; others copied me,” Zhou Ze chuckled.\n\n“I know, you're a top student, a scholar,” Xu Qinglang poured Zhou Ze a glass of wine too.\n\n“A milk tea for everyone,” the chubby boy called out, gesturing.\n\n“Alright.”\n\nXu Qinglang nodded and went to the back kitchen to start making milk tea.\n\nA while later, the chubby boy himself came over and asked, “Is the milk tea ready?”\n\n“I'll bring them out when they're done,” Bai Yingying said.\n\n“Forget it, I'll wait. I'm already done copying anyway.”\n\nThe chubby boy played on his phone beside them, then pulled out a cigarette and lit it with his back to his distant classmates.\n\nSoon, Xu Qinglang had all the milk teas ready and sealed.\n\nThe chubby boy took one cup of milk tea and inserted a straw, then took a few more cups and walked over to his classmates.\n\nBai Yingying then took the remaining milk teas on a tray and delivered them.\n\nA moment later, Zhou Ze actively got up and walked over to the students, looking left and right, which made the students who were copying their homework feel very unnatural, as copying homework was not something glorious.\n\nHowever, Zhou Ze also noticed an exception: a girl who was dressed slightly more simply but looked very delicate was not copying; she was doing her own work.\n\nThen she would share the completed parts with the surrounding classmates for them to copy.\n\nThis was a very natural thing; among a group of academic underachievers, there had to be one academic overachiever to be the pillar.\n\n“The ice is melting, drink it quickly,” the chubby boy said to the top student girl, while pushing the milk tea closer to her.\n\nThe girl shook her head, indicating she wasn't thirsty, and at the same time said, “Next time, don't come here. It's too expensive.”\n\n“It's not expensive, not expensive. I have plenty of pocket money,” the chubby boy boasted. “Drink some, this shop's milk tea tastes really good, very carefully made. I came here last time, and it's also sold very expensively.”\n\nHearing this, Zhou Ze suddenly wanted to tell this chubby classmate that the milk tea and drinks sold in their bookstore were all instant powdered “Xiang Piao Piao” mixed by Xu Qinglang in the back kitchen. Old Xu had become lazier and lazier ever since he realized he needed to start taking care of himself.\n\nThe girl hesitated, put down her pen, and reached for the milk tea.\n\nBut just as Zhou Ze walked past, his arm bumped it, and the milk tea fell to the ground, spilling some.\n\n“Oh, I'm sorry. I'll get you another one.”\n\nZhou Ze bent down and picked up the milk tea from the floor.\n\nThe chubby boy looked up, glaring at Zhou Ze, “What are you doing, just wandering around here for what!”\n\n“Alright, don't be angry, it's just a cup of milk tea,” a classmate beside him advised.\n\nZhou Ze ignored the chubby classmate and walked back to the counter with the milk tea, saying to Xu Qinglang:\n\n“Brew another packet.”\n\nXu Qinglang nodded.\n\nZhou Ze walked out and stood at the bookstore entrance, smoking.\n\nAt this moment, Bai Yingying happened to be sitting behind the bar playing \"PUBG Mobile\" on her phone. Seeing the milk tea Zhou Ze brought back on the counter, she simply took it and drank it herself. After all, it had only fallen on the ground, no one had drunk it yet, and it wasn't dirty.\n\nShe didn't need to eat, but sometimes needed to replenish some water.\n\nAnother half hour passed,\nAmong the group of students, those who finished their homework began to leave one by one.\n\nFinally, only the chubby classmate and the female academic overachiever remained. The chubby classmate said eagerly:\n\n“Shall I call a taxi to take you home?”\n\n“No need, I'll take the bus home.”\n\nThe female academic overachiever tidied her backpack and walked out of the bookstore.\n\nThe chubby classmate sighed, stood up, and went to the counter to pay the bill first.\n\n“Nine hundred in total,” Xu Qinglang calculated by headcount, with a minimum consumption of one hundred.\n\n“Alipay.”\n\n“Okay.”\n\nThe chubby classmate paid the bill and turned to leave when he saw Zhou Ze walking in from outside.\n\nHe snorted through his nose; the chubby classmate was clearly very displeased with Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze smiled at him,\nThen, as the chubby classmate walked past Zhou Ze,\n\n“Slap!”\n\nA crisp sound,\nZhou Ze slapped the chubby classmate directly across the face.\n\nA human figure was slapped out of him. The chubby classmate spun in a circle, feeling dizzy, seemingly unaware that he had just been slapped.\n\nHe looked at Zhou Ze in a daze and said, “What happened to me?”\n\n“You walked into the door. Go home quickly.”\n\n“Okay, thank you, boss.”\n\nThe chubby classmate nodded and smiled at Zhou Ze, then walked out of the bookstore.\n\nInside the bookstore,\nA short man was left behind,\nThe man knelt there, trembling.\n\n“Nice haircut,” Xu Qinglang said, leaning on the bar.\n\nYes, this short man's haircut was indeed unique,\nOthers' Mohawks were already unconventional enough,\nHis was even more exaggerated,\nOn his head,\nA knife was stuck.\n\n——————\nWe're about to drop out of the top ten. Do any of you still have monthly votes? Please cast them for the Dragon!\nDon't panic,\nHold tight to the Dragon!",

    "content": "As the saying goes, \"Lust is a knife to the head.\" The true nature of this guy, this ghost, was actually already obvious.\n\nIn fact, both in ancient and modern times, people have often held a great deal of tolerance for the term \"licentiousness.\"\n\nIn ancient times, a scholar's licentiousness, his lingering in the pleasure quarters, was considered a very elegant thing. Even in modern times, when a \"player\" brags about his conquests, you might not agree with his lifestyle, but you wouldn't necessarily feel he's committed a heinous crime.\n\nAll of this, after all, is built on the foundation of mutual consent.\n\nIt could be \"sweet talk,\" \"lonely companionship,\" or \"a clean transaction of money and goods.\" People are quite open-minded in this regard.\n\nBut the kind of pervert who likes to use force and despicable means often suffers society's contempt and scorn. It's said that in prison, the lowest status is typically held by sex offenders.\n\nThe man knelt there, kowtowing repeatedly to Zhou Ze, hoping Zhou Ze would spare his life.\n\nThe bookstore was actually Zhou Ze's execution ground, especially after Zhou Ze became a full-fledged official. This place was considered a special location. Various ghosts from outside would instinctively want to approach the bookstore, either stumbling in directly through the door, or attaching themselves elsewhere or connecting with the bookstore in other ways.\n\nBoss Zhou was fishing; whoever wished to take the bait was welcome.\n\nActually, at first, Zhou Ze hadn't noticed that there was a ghost lurking on the chubby student. Yes, Xu Qinglang hadn't noticed either.\n\nZhou Ze only noticed that the chubby student was secretly putting something into a cup of milk tea. As for what kind of medicine it was, everyone knew well enough; it certainly wasn't cold medicine.\n\nBased on the principle that this was his own store, and according to legal regulations, he had to protect the personal safety of customers who consumed goods in his store, so Boss Zhou had no choice but to intervene.\n\n\"Hey, you saw it early, didn't you?\" Xu Qinglang said to Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Ah, mm.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded silently.\n\nThere was no need to explain this matter. If the people around you think you're awesome and amazing, let this beautiful misunderstanding continue.\n\n\"Heh heh, the way you walked up and slapped that guy, directly slapping a ghost out of him, honestly, it looked quite unexpected, a bit like the style of a Celestial Master from Longhu Mountain.\"\n\nOld Xu was still hyping him up, and Zhou Ze continued to be silent, accepting these praises.\n\nHe actually wanted to say that he had only intended to give that fellow a slap to teach him a lesson, purely because he found him annoying and wanted to hit him. At most, he'd beat him up later and burn some joss paper. But he unexpectedly discovered that the lecherous ghost attached to the chubby student had actually been slapped out by him.\n\nIn fact, Zhou Ze had also wondered why he and Xu Qinglang hadn't seen this lecherous ghost before. The reason, he thought, could only be one: everyone has lust in their hearts.\n\nEveryone has that impulse, that restlessness, that desire. This desire is similar to the pursuit of money and power; it's an expression of human nature. And because of this, the lecherous ghost could rely on that cover to hide itself.\n\nWhether the ghost existed or not, that chubby student actually had lust, so that was its best camouflage.\n\nZhou Ze opened the Gate of Hell, grabbed the short, lecherous ghost on the floor with one hand, and prepared to send it to hell.\n\n\"Spare me, spare me, spare me...\"\n\nThe lecherous ghost was still begging,\n\nBut all it did was beg for mercy; it offered no other useful words, such as \"spare me and I can give you something,\" or \"spare me and I can tell you some important news.\"\n\nHmm,\n\nIn this situation, Boss Zhou was still fiercely righteous and utterly impartial.\n\nFinally, the lecherous ghost was thrown into the Gate of Hell.\n\nTonight's revenue could be considered an addition.\n\n\"Do you think every lecherous ghost has a knife above its head?\" Xu Qinglang asked.\n\n\"Do you remember that high-hatted teacher we met before?\" Zhou Ze retorted.\n\n\"Mm, but that one was wronged; this one probably doesn't count.\"\n\nThat high-hatted teacher was clearly wronged, but under the power of public opinion, even Zhou Ze's fingernails couldn't remove the high hat on his head.\n\nPerhaps, Hell seems to have this tradition, or perhaps it's because Hell is simply too large, and the officials in the Underworld are rather lazy and inefficient in governing, so they prefer a \"one-size-fits-all\" approach. Most of them carry on the \"verdicts\" of the mortal world.\n\nThose who wear hats wear hats, those who are tattooed are tattooed. Whatever conclusion is reached in the mortal world, the Underworld inherits that conclusion, greatly reducing the workload of the Underworld. As for whether anyone is wronged within it, sorry, no one cares.\n\nWith a deal done for the day, Boss Zhou wasn't inclined to stay up until dawn. He went to the bathroom, took a shower first, and then went upstairs in his bathrobe.\n\nWatching Zhou Ze climb the stairs, Xu Qinglang took another sip of red wine and looked at the problematic milk tea cup that Zhou Ze had brought over earlier. The milk tea was already gone.\n\nXu Qinglang stretched. Of course, Xu Qinglang knew who had drunk it, and the person who drank it seemed to have sensed something was amiss and had secretly gone upstairs earlier.\n\nHeh heh.\n\nOld Xu's gaze wandered, awaiting a good show.\n\nPushing open the bedroom door, Zhou Ze sensed a slight chill.\n\nHe wasn't afraid of the cold, but the strikingly different temperature in the bedroom compared to outside still caught Zhou Ze's attention.\n\nHe looked up at the air conditioner; it wasn't on. So why was it so cold?\n\nOn the bed, Bai Yingying lay there, covered by a quilt, still wriggling continuously.\n\nZhou Ze was slightly displeased. He had told her countless times not to get on the bed before showering. It was a disrespect to the bed. Of course, most importantly, Boss Zhou had a phobia of germs.\n\nNo matter how beautiful or pretty you were, if you dared to get on his bed without showering, sorry, he would kick you off.\n\n\"Cough cough...\"\n\nHe coughed by the bed.\n\nIn the past, Bai Yingying would probably have been scared and immediately gotten up to admit her mistake, promising never to do it again.\n\nBut this time, Bai Yingying still lay on the bed, not moving.\n\nNo, she moved a little.\n\nBut it was only to use her legs to flip over, clasping the quilt between her thighs. Soft \"Ying Ying Ying\" sounds emanated from within the quilt.\n\nYing Ying Ying... Ying Ying Ying...\n\nSometimes soaring, sometimes melodious, sometimes passionate, sometimes deep.\n\nHe lifted the quilt.\n\nBai Yingying turned on her side and looked at Zhou Ze. Her eyes were seductive, her hair disheveled, her face flushed, her lips red and teeth like pearls. She truly evoked pity.\n\nMaking one want to gallop directly, until one's horse-hide wrapped corpse returned to battle.\n\n\"Did you wet the bed?\"\n\nZhou Ze asked.\n\nThe atmosphere killer,\n\nThe innocent destroyer,\n\nThe man who should be sent to the stake — Ze,\n\nWas once again illustrating the reason why he was still a bachelor at thirty in his previous life.\n\nBai Yingying bit her finger, slowly curled up her body, and then she sat up, placing her hands on Zhou Ze's shoulders, cooing seductively:\n\n\"Boss... I want... Ying Ying Ying...\"\n\nZhou Ze smiled,\n\nHis smile was a bit helpless.\n\nHe first looked down at the quilt he had just lifted and thrown onto the floor, which was now stiff enough to be used as a chopping board.\n\nThen he looked at Bai Yingying's thighs.\n\nYou want,\n\nBut I wouldn't dare give.\n\nThis is a normal human body. If I really gave it to you, tomorrow I'd have to go to the hospital to find Doctor Lin for an amputation due to frostbite.\n\n\"That milk tea, you drank it?\"\n\nZhou Ze suddenly remembered something and asked.\n\n\"Milk tea... What milk tea... Ying Ying Ying... I want it, Boss... Ying Ying Ying...\"\n\nSaying that,\n\nBai Yingying leaped up,\n\nHer physical prowess was not something an unpowered Zhou Ze could resist. Zhou Ze was directly tackled to the floor by her.\n\nA dull thud sounded from the floor.\n\nDownstairs, Xu Qinglang looked up, a little dejected and melancholic. He poured another glass of red wine.\n\nThe old Daoist, who was playing cards with the monkey, also looked up, somewhat puzzled, at the ceiling above.\n\n\"Boss, I really like the smell on you, I really do, Ying Ying Ying...\"\n\nBai Yingying transformed into an overbearing female CEO, pinning Zhou Ze down, undressing him while flirting.\n\nZhou Ze's face showed a hint of helplessness.\n\n\"Yingying, back off.\"\n\n\"Boss, just give it to me...\"\n\n\"... ...\" Zhou Ze.\n\nThis wasn't a matter of giving or not giving,\n\nNor was it a matter of *getting hard* or not *getting hard*,\n\nDo you not have any idea whether what you have down there is a water curtain cave or an ice cave?\n\nAt that moment, Zhou Ze hardened his heart, and he had no choice but to harden his heart. His right fingernails grew out. He didn't dare to pierce Bai Yingying, but merely stroked her back with his fingernails.\n\n\"Ahhhhhhh!!!!\"\n\nBlack mist began to enter Bai Yingying's body. Bai Yingying was so stimulated that she fell to the ground and began to roll around. Zhou Ze did not stop, continuing with his fingernails.\n\nBai Yingying twisted and turned, screaming incessantly.\n\nShe feared the boss's fingernails the most.\n\n...\n\nDownstairs,\n\nXu Qinglang, who was drinking red wine, spewed it out with a \"pfft,\" looked up, somewhat surprised. That fierce?\n\nThe old Daoist was so scared that the playing cards in his hand dropped to the floor. He looked up again at the ceiling.\n\nHoly crap,\n\nIs the boss unleashing his power?\n\nOld Xu and the old Daoist were both deeply wounded at that moment.\n\nIt was the profound and bitter hurt of being outdone in an aspect where a man must never concede.\n\n...\n\nAfter a long while, Zhou Ze retracted his fingernails.\n\nBai Yingying, lying on the ground almost collapsed, her eyes finally regained clarity. As if she had vented completely, she looked at Zhou Ze blankly:\n\n\"Boss, what just happened?\"\n\n\"You said your back was a little itchy, so I helped you scratch it.\"\n\n\"Oh, thank you, Boss.\"\n\n\"Go take a shower,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Okay, Boss.\"\n\nBai Yingying leaned on the wall and slowly walked downstairs, wobbling and struggling with each step.\n\nShe saw Xu Qinglang and the old Daoist looking at her with sympathetic gazes.\n\nFrom then on, for a long time, neither Xu Qinglang nor the old Daoist ever brought up the subject of *getting hard* in front of Zhou Ze again.\n\nAccording to the old Daoist,\n\nHe couldn't boast anymore, he really couldn't. He sought out unfortunate, pitiful women, but the boss had KO'd a zombie.\n\nHow could they even compare?",

    "content": "The next morning, Zhou Ze was, as usual, sitting on the sofa by the bookstore's glass window, reading the *Yangtze Evening Post*.\n\nIn front of him sat a cup of coffee and a small slice of cake.\n\nBoss Zhou's life was just that leisurely, that unproductive, that lacking in ambition. He was just drifting along, taking things as they came.\n\nInitially, Xu Qinglang had criticized Zhou Ze for living such a purposeless life, saying he was too much of a slacker, that he was practically wasting his second chance at life.\n\nMost importantly, he was wasting his \"golden finger.\"\n\nAnd then...\n\nAnd then Xu Qinglang couldn't change Boss Zhou's continued idleness. Instead, he himself was assimilated by Boss Zhou.\n\nOriginally, a second-generation rich kid who, despite owning over twenty apartments, still ran his own noodle shop and hadn't lost his life's ambition,\n\nwas slowly bent by Boss Zhou,\n\nand also became a slacker who started taking care of his skin and grooming himself.\n\nActually, Zhou Ze felt his current life was quite good. The bookstore had many novels, including quite a few transmigration stories where the protagonists, after being reborn, were all full of bitter resentment, or aiming for imperial power, or conquering the world.\n\nOld Dao, with nothing to do, would flip through these books and always say that the boss was different from the people in the books.\n\nBut Old Dao himself could also understand. Books, after all, were fake, and if the protagonists in the books were really like their boss, just sunbathing and loafing around every day,\n\nwho would read them?\n\nWould readers come just to watch you sunbathe, sunbathe, sunbathe again, and keep sunbathing?\n\nThe priest in the Spider-Man costume was diligently cleaning, missing no detail. He always executed Zhou Ze's instructions without any discount.\n\nBai Yingying was somewhat relieved, thankful that this \"colleague\" was a man, otherwise she'd have to face competition again.\n\nAfter his initial bewilderment, Old Dao had gotten used to the priest's presence. Though at first, when they slept in the same room at night, he'd always smell roasted meat, he had slowly grown accustomed to it.\n\nNow, Old Dao could finally take a break, finding a sofa to lie on like his boss, sipping tea, reading some 'yellow books,' and leisurely enjoying life.\n\nDaytime business had always been very slow.\n\nThere were hardly any customers.\n\nSo,\n\nthe bookstore owner was sunbathing and reading the newspaper,\n\nOld Dao was drinking tea and reading 'yellow books,'\n\nXu Qinglang was mixing his new cocktail,\n\nBai Yingying was playing *Honor of Kings* on her phone,\n\nthe little monkey, having stolen and eaten Old Dao's peanuts, was now lying there asleep.\n\nThe whole house,\n\nexuded an air of idleness,\n\ncompletely out of sync with the bustling atmosphere of the Nanda Street commercial district outside.\n\nIt wasn't until noon that a customer finally walked in.\n\nXu Qinglang looked up and saw a young man enter. The man was quite tall and seemed delicate, but his face was covered in stubble, indicating he'd been neglecting himself lately due to some recent troubles.\n\nBeing disturbed annoyed Xu Qinglang greatly. He glanced back at the \"Minimum consumption 100\" sign and wondered if his place wasn't 'black' enough.\n\nShould he change it to \"one thousand\" next time?\n\nOtherwise, there'd always be people who, thinking they had a bit of money, would come in and disrupt him, wanting to experience a \"petite bourgeoisie\" atmosphere.\n\nThis place was clearly for ghost business, so why were living people always crowding in for fun?\n\nOne hundred yuan just to sit here, read a book, and drink some instant coffee or milk tea,\n\nwasn't that stupid?\n\nThe man pointed at the cocktail glass in front of Xu Qinglang and said,\n\n\"A cocktail.\"\n\nThen, the man sat down in front of Xu Qinglang.\n\nXu Qinglang nodded. Although he felt very uncomfortable being disturbed, he was, after all, from the catering industry, and wouldn't really take it out on a customer.\n\nImmediately, a cocktail was quickly mixed and placed before the man.\n\nThe man took a sip, seemingly satisfied. Then he leaned on the bar, resting his head, and just watched Xu Qinglang.\n\nAt first, Xu Qinglang didn't think much of it, but the other party just stayed there, taking a sip of his drink, then continuing to watch him, taking another sip, continuing to watch him.\n\nXu Qinglang felt like he was being treated as a snack to go with the drink.\n\n\"Feast for the eyes\" was mostly a compliment when applied to women, but Old Xu always thought of himself as a man.\n\nOh no,\n\nhe *was* a man, not \"thought of himself as.\"\n\nThis made Old Xu uncomfortable, and he said with some displeasure, \"Do you want more drinks?\"\n\n\"You're really handsome.\"\n\nThe man suddenly chuckled.\n\nHe had a lecherous look on his face.\n\nXu Qinglang let out a long breath and licked his lips. He was about to hit someone.\n\n\"Hey, you're so pretty, a lot of men must like you, huh?\"\n\nThe other party asked again.\n\nXu Qinglang rolled up his sleeves, ready to fight.\n\n\"There must be, hehe. Do you want to hit me? Do you think I insulted you?\"\n\nThe man looked up at Xu Qinglang, then pointed at his own face,\n\n\"Go ahead and hit me. Hit me right here.\"\n\nWith him being so obnoxious,\n\nXu Qinglang was actually a little hesitant to hit him, but still said in a low voice,\n\n\"My orientation is very normal.\"\n\n\"Oh.\"\n\nThe man responded, sounding a bit disappointed, then picked up his glass and took another sip.\n\n\"So, someone's taken a fancy to you?\"\n\nBoss Zhou, having finished his sunbathing, walked over at that moment.\n\nThe man at this point seemed drunk, or perhaps he was originally just angry, as he immediately smashed the glass in his hand on the floor.\n\nWith a crisp \"bang,\"\n\nthe glass shattered into pieces.\n\nThe \"Spider-Man\" who had been cleaning stopped. He walked over, looked at the customer, then at Zhou Ze.\n\nMeaning,\n\nshould he kill this person?\n\nSpider-Man was already exuding killing intent.\n\nZhou Ze waved his hand.\n\nSpider-Man immediately retreated and went back to cleaning elsewhere.\n\n\"Sorry, I'll pay for it.\"\n\nThe man took out his wallet.\n\n\"Broken up?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nThe man shook his head. \"Lost my job.\"\n\n\"Understood.\" Zhou Ze shrugged.\n\nThe man looked at Xu Qinglang, paid first, then said, \"Can I get another drink?\"\n\nXu Qinglang nodded, made him another drink, then specifically pointed to the glass and said, \"This glass is a work of art, bought for two thousand yuan.\"\n\nThe implication was, if he smashed it again, it would cost two thousand in compensation.\n\nThe man froze for a moment, laughed awkwardly, then took a sip.\n\nZhou Ze sat down next to him and said to the man,\n\n\"If you don't mind, you can tell us what's making you unhappy so we can be happy.\"\n\n\"…………\" the man.\n\nThe man forced a bitter smile and said,\n\n\"I used to be the deputy director of logistics at Tongcheng University.\"\n\n\"You're a director so young.\" Old Dao chimed in at this point, \"Your family must have some serious connections, right?\"\n\n\"…………\" the man.\n\n\"Don't mind them, keep going.\" Xu Qinglang urged, \"You haven't gotten to the tragic part yet.\"\n\n\"…………\" the man.\n\nThe man nodded and said, \"Because there were stray dogs biting people on campus, I was held accountable and dismissed. My previous job was in charge of campus safety.\"\n\n\"Then you deserve it. You neglected your work.\" Old Dao analyzed from the side.\n\n\"But the thing is, last year I planned to take the security guards and round up all the stray dogs on campus. We did, but then we were stopped.\"\n\nThe man took a deep breath, then exhaled heavily.\n\n\"Stopped by the leaders?\"\n\n\"Stopped by the students.\" The man replied.\n\n\"Uh... why did they stop you?\"\n\n\"They said what we were doing was too cruel, heartless. Because we had contacted the local stray animal shelter, and they were also under a lot of pressure and couldn't take in so many stray animals. Our plan was to send away those we could, and for those we couldn't place, we would put them down directly.\"\n\n\"Put them down directly? Tsk tsk, how cruel.\" Old Dao clicked his tongue, \"But it's also true, you can't have them posing a danger to students on campus, otherwise things would get serious.\"\n\n\"Later, I remember a student wrote an article online exposing what we were doing, and it was even picked up by the media, with the headline:\n\n*'Can a university that can't even tolerate a stray dog tolerate a person?'*\"\n\n\"Tsk tsk, that's a good cap to put on it.\" Old Dao commented.\n\n\"At the time, it was because students hung banners and protested, obstructing our actions. In the end, that matter was left unsettled and couldn't proceed.\"\n\nThe man wiped his mouth, then moved his glass aside before he dared to forcefully bang on the table, venting his frustration:\n\n\"The worst part is, last week, two female students were attacked by a pack of stray dogs on campus at night. Both were bitten and sent to the hospital!\n\nThen the school investigated, and the responsibility fell on me, and they fired me directly!\"\n\nThe man banged on the table again forcefully,\n\n\"I'm not convinced, really not convinced. Back when I was preparing to have the security guards solve this problem, not only did the students at school curse me, but a large group of people online cursed me too. Because of this, I even received criticism and disciplinary action.\n\nNow the stray dogs have bitten people, and I'm still the one taking responsibility, it's become my dereliction of duty again.\"\n\nOld Dao heard this, reached out and patted the man's shoulder,\n\nThis guy was really unlucky.\n\n\"There's nothing we can do about it. After all, protecting small animals is 'politically correct' now.\"\n\nXu Qinglang prepared a fruit platter and pushed it in front of the man, as if to comfort him.\n\nThe man grumbled and complained for a while longer, then despondently walked out of the bookstore. Whether he continued to drink away his sorrows at a small restaurant or went home to sleep was unknown.\n\nOld Dao turned his head to Xu Qinglang and asked, \"Old Xu, what was that 'correct' thing you just said?\"\n\n\"Politically correct.\"\n\n\"Oh, right, that thing. I really dislike that term now. My live stream was shut down several times because of it, saying I was mocking some group or something, it's ridiculous. I can't even speak properly anymore, if I'm not careful, I've offended someone. Why are those people so sensitive?\"\n\nOld Dao streamed live, and though he was old, he was also very trendy.\n\n\"Political correctness is necessary,\" Zhou Ze said, \"but now it's becoming more and more distorted, being abused.\n\nWhen society's emotional protection of certain groups surpasses the pursuit of truth, it means there's a problem.\"\n\n\"Exactly, that's the feeling. Boss, what you said is so insightful and brilliant. No, Old Dao needs to find a pen and paper to write this down, to ponder and understand it thoroughly.\"\n\nOld Dao knew his job: cleaning was secondary; his primary duty was to shower the boss with \"66666\" when needed.\n\n\"Alright, let's not talk about this anymore. What's for lunch?\" Zhou Ze asked Xu Qinglang.\n\n\"Stir-fried chives with eggs, stir-fried chives with wood ear mushrooms, stir-fried chives with sliced pork, stir-fried chives with beef penis, chive egg drop soup...\"\n\n\"Hmm?\" Zhou Ze.\n\n\"To replenish you. You must have been tired last night,\" Xu Qinglang said with a look of concern.\n\n\"…………\" Zhou Ze.\n\nAh,\n\nAfter much hesitation,\n\nZhou Ze glanced over and saw that Bai Yingying was still intently playing *Honor of Kings*,\n\nSo he subtly,\n\nnodded.\n\n————————\n\nRequesting monthly votes, to help the bookstore return to the top ten on the overall list.\n\nDragon rolls for monthly votes,\n\nRolling over...\n\n...Rolling back...\n\nIn short,\n\nFire your monthly votes at the dragon!",

    "content": "For lunch, Zhou Ze didn’t eat much, maintaining an aloof and reserved posture as if he didn't need much nourishment. He ate only a little, washing it down with plum juice.\n\nThe old Taoist, however, ate a lot, frantically, with the vigor of a “Lian Po, old yet still able to eat.” More than half of the dishes on the table ended up in the old Taoist’s stomach.\n\nBy the afternoon, the old Taoist kept glancing outside the bookstore, seemingly eager to go out and spread some “love.” Anyway, the Spider-Man could handle the cleaning now, making his job much easier.\n\nHowever, at three o'clock in the afternoon, Zhou Ze's phone rang.\n\nThe caller ID showed an unknown number. Zhou Ze answered, and a very hoarse voice came from the other end:\n\n“Help me… help me…”\n\nZhou Ze tilted his head slightly, holding the phone a little further away from himself. The static on the other end was very heavy, like a string of small firecrackers going off.\n\n“Hello?” Zhou Ze asked again.\n\n“I’m in General’s Mountain, save me… save me…”\n\n*Snap!*\n\nZhou Ze hung up the phone immediately, tossed it onto the coffee table, and picked up his coffee to take a sip.\n\nXu Qinglang, next to him, looked up at Zhou Ze and casually asked, “Whose call was that?”\n\n“A prank call, a cry for help.”\n\n“What if it was real?” Xu Qinglang asked with a smile.\n\n“It said General’s Mountain, but that’s too far. Too lazy to go.”\n\nBoss Zhou was a trouble-averse individual. Why run around when he could sit in his bookstore and wait for business to come to him? Zhou Ze didn’t even bother to think about the true reason behind the call, nor did he have time to discern whether it was real or fake. He wasn't God, nor was he a Powerpuff Girl, going wherever he was needed.\n\n“Boss, this humble Taoist wants to go out and buy some daily necessities.” The old Taoist came over to ask for leave.\n\nZhou Ze was about to nod in assent when his phone rang again. It was still the unknown number. Zhou Ze simply put it on speaker.\n\n“Hello?”\n\n“Save me… save me… I’m in General’s Mountain… they’re going to kill… going to kill… General’s Mountain… General’s Mountain…”\n\nThe voice was clearer than before, but there was still a lot of static.\n\n“Save me… save me… I’m in General’s Mountain… they’re going to kill… they’re about to kill… children… women… they are executioners… executioners…”\n\nXu Qinglang and the old Taoist exchanged glances. If it was a prank, it was possible, but no one usually paid attention to Zhou Ze's private number; only they would contact him. Who would be so bored as to prank him?\n\nSo… what if it was real?\n\nBut how would you explain why a randomly dialed number would land on Zhou Ze’s phone? Wouldn't they call 110 for help themselves?\n\nNow, neither possibility seemed to make much sense.\n\nZhou Ze hung up the phone again, rubbing his temples.\n\n“What’s for dinner tonight?” Boss Zhou asked.\n\nClearly, Boss Zhou’s trouble-averse nature was still working hard, trying to avoid this strange cry for help. Real or fake, he just didn't want to go out, okay?\n\n“Spaghetti, perhaps,” Xu Qinglang said.\n\n“Oh, right, old Taoist, you said you wanted to go out. Go ahead, just remember to come back early.”\n\n“Alrighty.”\n\nThe old Taoist left excitedly, strutting out, feeling as vigorous as a young man.\n\n“Yingying, help me buy an unregistered phone card,” Zhou Ze told Bai Yingying.\n\n“Okay, Boss.”\n\nBai Yingying left the shop and returned shortly. Although China strictly enforces real-name registration for phone cards, unregistered cards could still be bought everywhere; they likely had someone else’s ID registered to them.\n\nAfter swapping the card, Zhou Ze dialed 110. The operator quickly answered the emergency hotline.\n\n“Hello, this is the Tongcheng Police Service Desk…”\n\n“I want to report something. Someone said there’s a murder case in General’s Mountain. You’d better check it out. I don’t know if it’s true or false. That’s all.”\n\n“Please wait a moment, did you say General’s Mountain?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Could you please provide your contact information and address? We will send someone to get in touch with you.”\n\nZhou Ze hung up the phone again, then removed that phone card and put his original card back in.\n\nWith his own card back, Zhou Ze hesitated. “Something feels off.”\n\n“What feels off?” Xu Qinglang asked.\n\n“I can’t put my finger on it, but it just feels wrong somewhere.”\n\n………………\n\nThere were some clubs on South Street, but their prices and class were too high. Although the old Taoist had a decent amount of money in his pocket, he preferred comforting those older, faded women. Of course, no matter how old or faded they were, they were still around his daughter’s age, which was quite beastly. But if they were his granddaughter’s age, that would be worse than a beast!\n\nTaking a taxi to Gangzha, the old Taoist, familiar with the area, found a foot massage parlor. The rolling shutter door was closed, but the old Taoist knew that didn’t mean it was closed for business.\n\nHe smoked a cigarette outside for a while, and then the rolling shutter door was pulled open. An old man, younger than the Taoist, emerged from inside and exchanged a smile with him.\n\nThe bond of “brothers-in-law.”<sup>1</sup> Ten years of cultivation to share a boat, a hundred years to share a pillow, a thousand years to be a brother-in-law.\n\nThe old Taoist bent down and went inside.\n\nInside, there was a heavily made-up woman, around forty, who told the old Taoist:\n\n“Bro, I’m going to take a shower first. Wait for me, okay?”\n\n“Alright, alright.”\n\nThe old Taoist sat down on the sofa, facing the television. The woman was washing herself inside, and the old Taoist outside was already in a state of heightened anticipation.\n\nBut then, the news broadcast on the television made the old Taoist’s mouth drop open.\n\n“Our station’s latest news: new progress has been made in the murder case that occurred in General’s Mountain a week ago. The police have identified the suspect, a young man named ‘Ye Qing.’\n\nThe police’s wanted poster is now released: Ye Qing, male, 25 years old, formerly employed at Tongcheng Waterworks, a friend of the deceased family. On the day of the incident, he went on vacation to General’s Mountain with the deceased family.\n\nAfter the incident, Ye Qing’s whereabouts have been unknown. Anyone with information is asked to contact the police. The police are offering a reward…”\n\nThe old Taoist stared at the television screen, stunned.\n\nJust then, the woman finished her shower and came out. Seeing the old Taoist staring at the news, she smacked her lips and said:\n\n“It happened last week. A family of three, all murdered. Their heads were even cut off and haven’t been found yet. It’s truly tragic. The couple was quite young, and the child was only about five years old, a girl.”\n\nThe old Taoist suddenly stood up.\n\nBased on his experience solving cases with his previous boss, he keenly sensed that the phone call his boss received before he left was definitely unusual!\n\n“Sis, brother didn’t bring his medicine today. I’m leaving first, okay?”\n\nWith that, the old Taoist ran straight out of the foot massage parlor.\n\n………………\n\nBy the time the old Taoist took a taxi back to the bookstore, he found Zhou Ze wasn’t on the first floor. Spider-Man sat there, motionless. Xu Qinglang sat behind the counter, with cucumber slices on his face.\n\n“Where’s the boss?” the old Taoist asked.\n\nXu Qinglang pointed upwards without speaking.\n\nThe old Taoist immediately ran upstairs and pushed open the door to the boss’s bedroom.\n\nIn the bedroom, the boss was lying on the tatami, his head resting on Bai Yingying’s lap, while Bai Yingying massaged his head.\n\nThe boss looked exhausted, as if he was burdened by a million responsibilities and incredibly hard-working. Bai Yingying, on the other hand, looked like she was deeply concerned about how tired, hardworking, and over-stressed her boss was.\n\n*Pah!*\n\nDog and bitch!\n\nThe old Taoist inwardly snickered.\n\nThen, he righteously declared:\n\n“Boss, something’s happened.”\n\nZhou Ze turned his head slightly to look at the old Taoist standing at the door. “What is it?”\n\n“Boss, in General’s Mountain, there was a murder case last week. A family of three was killed. Not only has the murderer not been found yet, but even the heads of the three victims haven’t been found.”\n\n“Oh,” Zhou Ze responded. No wonder the police took his alarm call so seriously; it made sense now.\n\n“Boss, that phone call you received might be a message from an insider,” the old Taoist reminded him.\n\n“Mm-hmm,” Zhou Ze responded again. Then, he continued to immerse himself in Bai Yingying’s perfectly timed massage.\n\n“…” the old Taoist.\n\nHe understood now. The boss probably already knew, but he was probably just afraid of trouble. This \"trouble\" might not only refer to the hassle of investigating the matter but also the trouble of a *Yama<sup>2</sup>* privately meddling in mortal affairs. The latter might be even greater and more sensitive.\n\nThis made the old Taoist a bit exasperated; the emperor wasn't worried, but the eunuch was, which was the most frustrating situation.\n\nJust then, Zhou Ze’s phone rang again. It was on the bedside table, charging. Zhou Ze frowned, clearly not wanting to answer, so he didn’t ask Bai Yingying to get it for him.\n\nThe old Taoist rushed over, saw it was still the unknown number, and immediately pressed the answer button.\n\n“Save me… save us… I’m in General’s Mountain… they’re here… they’re here… they’re going to kill… kill…”\n\nZhou Ze dug into his ears.\n\nDidn’t hear, didn’t hear,\n\nI’m deaf,\n\nI’m deaf,\n\nMy ears are out of whack.\n\nBut then, a little girl’s painful,慘聲尖叫: “Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah!!!!!!!!” suddenly came from the phone.\n\nZhou Ze opened his eyes, looking helpless and conflicted.\n\nThe call on the other end was hung up.\n\nThe old Taoist swallowed, took out his own phone, walked over to Zhou Ze, and held it up to his boss. “Boss, this is a photo of the victim family’s daughter.”\n\nA photo of an innocent five-year-old girl was placed in front of Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze glanced at it and then looked away, but the old Taoist continued to hold the phone screen towards Zhou Ze’s eyes.\n\nLook,\n\nTake a look,\n\nCan you bear it?\n\nCan you?\n\nAre you even human?!\n\nOh, no, even ghosts wouldn’t bear it, right?\n\n“Boss, investigate it. This girl’s head hasn’t even been found yet,” the old Taoist urged.\n\nZhou Ze remained silent.\n\n“Boss, I think the person who called is very suspicious; it’s like they were at the scene.”\n\nZhou Ze sighed, gave up the struggle, and then silently stood up.\n\nHe told Bai Yingying, “Help me find a set of casual clothes and sneakers.”\n\n“Okay, Boss.” Bai Yingying immediately got up to find clothes.\n\nZhou Ze then looked at the old Taoist, smiling, “With your level, you’re trying to analyze and solve cases?”\n\n“Huh?” The old Taoist looked a bit bewildered.\n\n“Who am I?” Zhou Ze asked.\n\n“A Yama, Boss.”\n\n“Then what was that unknown call to me?”\n\n“It was…”\n\n“A ghost call.”\n\n---\n<sup>1</sup> 連襟 (lián jīn): refers to the husbands of two sisters or the husbands of two female cousins, a colloquial and somewhat humorous term for brothers-in-law in certain regional dialects, often implying a close, familiar relationship.\n<sup>2</sup> 鬼差 (guǐ chāi): literally means \"ghost envoy\" or \"ghost official.\" In Chinese mythology, these are the underworld officials or escorts who guide or apprehend spirits. In this context, it implies Zhou Ze has a supernatural role related to the deceased or the afterlife.",

    "content": "開車的是許清朗，不是周澤一定要和許清朗在一起，而是因為自己和老道都沒有駕駛證。\n\n\n\n  試想一下，如果自己和老道兩個人開車出去後，半路再遇到交警，再因為無證駕駛被扣下，那樂子就大了。\n\n\n\n  上次老道已經以身試法過一次了，這一次，總得小心一點。\n\n\n\n  白鶯鶯和蜘蛛俠留在了書店裡看店，周澤沒讓他們跟過來。\n\n\n\n  將軍山位於通城郊區，和臨近的揚州接壤，開車過去還是挺遠的，從書店出發，一路上沒什麼耽擱，大概一個半小時後，才抵達了目的地。\n\n\n\n  長三角平原是沒什麼山的，就算是有，也只是小山，放在四川和放在東北那幾個多山的區域，根本就不值一提。\n\n\n\n  這就像是南方人沒見過雪見到雪很激動一樣，你讓平原地區的人第一次開車進山路，也會激動得很。\n\n\n\n  將軍山也是近些年才得到了開發，上頭開了幾家比較大型和上檔次的溫泉山莊，算是吸引了一些客流，附近一些村民也辦起了小民宿，但還沒到形成規模的時候。\n\n\n\n  許清朗直接把車開入了一家叫「溫雅溫泉度假山莊」的店裡，他在這裡訂了房間，其實，被害的一家三口當時也是住在這裡，不過他們並不是死在裡頭，而是死在下山的山路上。\n\n\n\n  但哪怕是這樣，這件事對這家酒店生意的影響也是極為恐怖的。 \n\n\n\n  最明顯的就是許清朗原本訂的是一千五一天的帶院子室內溫泉池子的小別墅，前台居然直接熱情地免費給他升級成了帶小四合院日租金五千的房間。\n\n\n\n  而且無論是前台還是迎賓，服務態度簡直好得跟見到親爹媽一樣，熱情得不能再熱情。\n\n\n\n  後來，周澤才知道，現在整個酒店，似乎只有自己這一波的客人。\n\n\n\n  先進了房間，許清朗讓服務生給溫泉池子放水，他打算先去泡一泡，之前周澤喊他出來時已經說好了的，他只負責開車，其餘的事情不管，畢竟周澤喊他的時候他還在做美容。\n\n\n\n  老道倒是殷勤，不停地在網上查著案件資料，周澤則是坐在藤椅上，面前的茶几上放著手機。\n\n\n\n  讓周老闆去跟警察一樣四處找線索，找蛛絲馬跡，這不現實，而且這些事情警察比自己更精通，畢竟術業有專攻嘛，周老闆只需要負責接電話就可以了。\n\n\n\n  其實，周澤真的不是很願意多事兒，也不願意沾惹這些麻煩，但電話里傳來的那個女孩兒的慘叫聲，實在是太讓人難受了。\n\n\n\n  再加上，既然這次很大可能是「鬼來電」，既然是有鬼參合的事兒，自己出手去管的話，也就可以名正言順了。\n\n\n\n  只是，之前連打好幾次的電話，等周澤到了將軍山之後，卻反而沒了動靜，安靜得不得了。 \n\n\n\n  許清朗已經進池子開始泡澡了，他還給自己加了玫瑰精油這些東西，躺在裡面不時地撩撥著水花，還把自己的大腿伸展出來輕輕地撫摸，這姿態，真的很像早些年的香港三J片裡的唯美畫面。\n\n\n\n  辣眼睛，\n\n\n\n  真的太辣眼睛了，\n\n\n\n  如果不知道他是男的還好，你還能欣賞欣賞，\n\n\n\n  但你知道他是男的，就覺得很噁心。\n\n\n\n  「老闆，要不我們還是先去案發現場看看？」老道主動道。\n\n\n\n  周澤很想拒絕，但是繼續留在賓館裡看著院子裡的許娘娘作妖似乎是更痛苦的一件事，當下也就點點頭，跟著許清朗說了一聲後，和老道一起出了酒店。\n\n\n\n  屋子裡就剩下自己一個人，許清朗覺得更加的愜意，一般來說，溫泉池子的水有沒有料，就看你在水裡泡一會兒看看手上腳上有沒有起白皮，如果起白皮了就意味著這水跟大澡堂里沒啥區別。\n\n\n\n  老許一個人泡得美滋滋，雙臂撐開，姿態舒展，旁邊放著酒店送的便宜紅酒，至少，那股子的意境兒許清朗是泡出來了。\n\n\n\n  「叮咚…………叮咚…………」\n\n\n\n  門鈴聲響起。\n\n\n\n  許清朗有些不甘願地從池子裡走出來，披上了浴袍，打開門後，許清朗看見一個服務生端著三杯牛奶和一些零食過來。 \n\n\n\n  「先生，這是酒店送您的。」\n\n\n\n  「好，謝謝。」\n\n\n\n  接過了東西，許清朗關上門，把東西隨手放在了茶几上，然後又脫去了浴袍，重新走入了池子裡。\n\n\n\n  泡著泡著，當自己快要睡著時，許清朗忽然聽到了「喀嚓喀嚓」的聲音，像是有老鼠在咬東西一樣。\n\n\n\n  許清朗一開始以為自己幻聽了，可能溫泉泡久了，整個人也有些飄飄然了，但這個聲音卻還在一直繼續著。\n\n\n\n  回過頭，看向屋子客廳那邊，許清朗並沒有看見人或者老鼠。\n\n\n\n  「咕嘟…………咕嘟…………」\n\n\n\n  聲音還在繼續，\n\n\n\n  就在客廳里。\n\n\n\n  抿了抿嘴唇，許清朗再度從池子裡走出來，重新披上了浴袍。\n\n\n\n  雖說他也不是什麼普通人，住在這裡也確實沒什麼害怕的，但眼下畢竟周澤不在，如果自己真遇到什麼事兒，還是有一點點麻煩的。\n\n\n\n  當家的不在，就沒了主心骨啊。\n\n\n\n  客廳里檢查了一遍，讓許清朗有些疑惑的是，當自己走入客廳時，之前響起的聲音又消失不見了。\n\n\n\n  許清朗在客廳沙發上坐了下來，然後目光看向了面前的茶几，茶几上有服務生剛送來的零食和牛奶。 \n\n\n\n  但是零食那邊卻缺了一大塊。\n\n\n\n  被老鼠偷了？\n\n\n\n  許清朗默默地拿起手機，他覺得事情有點詭異，雖然那一家子不是死在這家酒店裡的，這家酒店還在正常營業，但又怎麼能證明這家酒店就一定乾淨？\n\n\n\n  只是，萬一真的是老鼠或者其他小動物偷吃的東西，自己這樣給周澤打電話讓他回來，到時候會不會被笑話？\n\n\n\n  許清朗有些猶豫，他在沙發後面尋找，在茶几下面尋找，他希望看見一隻老鼠或者松鼠之類的東西在這裡躲著，這樣子他就放心了。\n\n\n\n  只是，找來找去，還是沒找到小動物的蹤跡。\n\n\n\n  許清朗又走到了外面院子裡，沒下池子，就站在池子旁邊，等著。\n\n\n\n  「咔嚓咔嚓…………」\n\n\n\n  咀嚼的聲音又響起來了，許清朗目光在客廳里逡巡著，終於，他確定了聲音來源位置！\n\n\n\n  當下，\n\n\n\n  許清朗直接沖了過去，掀開了那裡的茶座，還是一無所獲，聲音也直接消失，但在這裡，還有一個小冰箱。\n\n\n\n  在冰箱裡？\n\n\n\n  許清朗伸手，慢慢地攥住了冰箱把手，然後直接把冰箱打開。\n\n\n\n  冰箱裡放著可樂和啤酒，並沒有其他什麼東西。 \n\n\n\n  長舒一口氣，許清朗覺得自己還真怕看見什麼東西在裡頭，那個畫面，想想都讓人覺得頭皮發麻。\n\n\n\n  「天地無極，玄心正法！」\n\n\n\n  許清朗掐著手印，然後取出了一枚護心鏡，直接放在了客廳正中央的茶几上，然後默默地坐在沙發上。\n\n\n\n  溫泉也不去了，\n\n\n\n  其他地方也不去了，\n\n\n\n  就一個人坐在這裡發著呆。\n\n\n\n  「滴答…………滴答…………」\n\n\n\n  客廳掛鐘不停地作響，但先前不斷襲擾人的咀嚼聲音就似乎真的因為許清朗坐在這裡，而沒有再出現過。\n\n\n\n  坐了大概半個多小時後，許清朗再次拿起手機，這次他準備給周澤打電話了，問問他們什麼時候回來，畢竟到了晚飯的點了。\n\n\n\n  許清朗是不會說自己被不知道什麼玩意兒給嚇得連溫泉都沒泡舒坦的。\n\n\n\n  但不知道怎麼的，手機顯示沒有信號，電話怎麼打就是打不出去。\n\n\n\n  許清朗從沙發上站了起來，\n\n\n\n  事情到了這一步，如果他還沒能察覺到詭異的氛圍就真的是白混了。\n\n\n\n  「叮咚…………叮咚…………叮咚…………」\n\n\n\n  門鈴聲再度響起。 \n\n\n\n  許清朗一邊環視四周一邊走向了大門那邊，打開門。\n\n\n\n  換了一個女性侍者，對方手裡拿著一件未開封的浴袍，遞了過來。\n\n\n\n  「這是你要的新浴袍。」\n\n\n\n  「什麼？」\n\n\n\n  許清朗愣了一下，他什麼時候要過新浴袍？\n\n\n\n  「是這個房間啊，說你們需要額外一件浴袍。」女服務員又看了一眼門牌號，確認了一下，道：「沒錯，那我先走了，祝您度假愉快。」\n\n\n\n  女服務員走前關了門，\n\n\n\n  許清朗抱著這件沒開封的新浴袍走了回來。\n\n\n\n  「嘩啦啦…………」\n\n\n\n  池子裡的熱水，又在放了起來，無緣無故地自己放了起來。\n\n\n\n  而後，之前被自己關上的冰箱門居然又被打開了。\n\n\n\n  茶几上送來的零食，又少了一些。\n\n\n\n  拿起手機，該死，手機信號還是一格都沒有。\n\n\n\n  慢慢地，許清朗覺得自己快被折磨瘋了，這不是他疑神疑鬼，他沒脆弱到那種地步，這的確是一些詭異且匪夷所思的事情正在他身邊實實在在地發生著。\n\n\n\n  許清朗想要洗把臉，他走到了衛生間，把浴袍放在一邊，然後彎下腰洗臉，等到他準備拿洗面奶時，卻忽然發現自己剛剛放在洗臉池旁邊的那件新浴袍不見了。 \n\n\n\n  許清朗抬起頭，對著鏡子，\n\n\n\n  卻發現在鏡子裡，\n\n\n\n  自己的身邊，\n\n\n\n  站著三個人，\n\n\n\n  一個男人一個女人，還有一個小朋友。\n\n\n\n  他們三個人，都穿著浴袍，\n\n\n\n  渾身上下濕漉漉的，面色蒼白，\n\n\n\n  就這樣比比直直地站在他許清朗的身邊。\n\n\n\n  許清朗下意識地歪了歪頭，想看得更仔細一些，\n\n\n\n  鏡子裡那一家三口也一起跟著許清朗的動作歪頭，\n\n\n\n  「噗通」\n\n\n\n  「噗通」\n\n\n\n  「噗通」\n\n\n\n  三聲悶響，\n\n\n\n  一家三口，\n\n\n\n  三顆頭顱，\n\n\n\n  一起滾落。",

    "content": "In this situation, an ordinary person would either be scared senseless or start screaming hysterically.\n\nFortunately, Xu Qinglang himself was considered a practitioner of metaphysics, albeit with only a smattering of knowledge. Still, he wouldn’t be utterly terrified by these so-called “unclean things.”\n\nHe was just a little helpless. He was minding his own business, soaking in the hot spring, and when he went out to look for their Boss Zhou, he didn’t find them. But here he was, minding his own business, and they came looking for him.\n\nXu Qinglang silently calmed his mind. He knew that ordinary ghosts could only attack you by finding your inner weaknesses. As long as you didn't panic, you could greatly restrain their influence.\n\nHowever, what surprised Xu Qinglang was that this family didn’t seem to intend to trouble him. They began to squat on the floor, their hands constantly fumbling on the bathroom floor, as if searching for something.\n\nAt first, he didn’t understand, but soon Xu Qinglang figured it out: they were looking for their heads!\n\nYes, initially they had heads, but now their heads were gone, and they were searching for them.\n\nThe news reports of the case also stated that the police found their bodies, but the heads of the family of three had yet to be found.\n\nThe ancients valued being whole when buried, even eunuchs in ancient times would have tailors sew their \"treasures\" back on to be buried with them, let alone their heads.\n\nWhile they were fumbling on the floor, Xu Qinglang tiptoed out of the bathroom and returned to the living room.\n\nHe lit a cigarette, and the previous tension had vanished. Perhaps the unknown was the most terrifying. The tension from the previous anomalies mostly came from the unknown. Now that he knew who was behind the mischief, he felt much more at ease.\n\nHe glanced at his phone again, finding there was still no signal, so he couldn’t directly contact Zhou Ze. Xu Qinglang sighed and simply curled his legs, turning on the TV.\n\nThe TV was showing the children's channel, playing the animation *Boonie Bears*.\n\nXu Qinglang watched from the side. He didn't flee the room in a panic. He knew that Zhou Ze was looking for them, and furthermore, it seemed that this family were victims. Their greater obsession was finding their heads, so they wouldn’t have too much aggression or resentment.\n\n*Boonie Bears* finished, and *Detective Conan* started playing next.\n\nXu Qinglang frowned and changed the channel. Watching Conan at this moment felt strange.\n\nBut coincidentally, after switching to a local channel, it was reporting on the General Mountain massacre case and the police's pursuit of suspects and search for the victims' heads.\n\nThis made it even more unnerving.\n\nThe ghosts of the deceased family of three were right there in the room. Was there any more live broadcast than this?\n\nXu Qinglang instinctively wanted to change the channel again,\n\nBut he suddenly noticed that the family of three had crawled in front of the TV and stopped, as if they were also watching the news.\n\nAfter a moment of hesitation, he decided not to change the channel.\n\n...\n\nBy the time Zhou Ze and the old Taoist priest returned, Xu Qinglang had already fallen asleep on the living room sofa.\n\n“Oh, what a graceful posture.”\n\nThe old Taoist priest walked over, wanting to pat Xu Qinglang’s thigh to wake him up, but thought better of it. He was afraid he might turn himself gay. The old Taoist priest was very particular about his reputation, having maintained his “knowing the difficulties and pressing forward” for seventy years, and he didn’t want to stray into the wrong path now.\n\n“Hey, wake up,” Zhou Ze called out.\n\nBut there was no response, which surprised Zhou Ze. Was he sleeping that deeply?\n\nZhou Ze then took two steps closer to Xu Qinglang and noticed a faint dark mist hovering over Xu Qinglang’s brow. Had he been possessed by an evil spirit?\n\nExtending a fingernail, Zhou Ze poked Xu Qinglang’s brow with his index finger. Xu Qinglang’s brow was pierced, and a few drops of black blood emerged. Then he slowly opened his eyes and stretched.\n\n“Is there something wrong with this room?” Zhou Ze asked, looking around.\n\nXu Qinglang had clearly been invaded by malevolent aura just now, but Xu Qinglang wasn't an ordinary person, which indicated that something very ominous had been in this room recently.\n\n“I saw that family, right here in this room,” Xu Qinglang said.\n\n“What?” The old Taoist priest was startled and quickly ran to his boss’s side, ready to protect him.\n\nIt was the old Taoist priest who had previously declared they would investigate the case to avenge the family of three, and it was also he who was now frightened. He was the type to love dragons but fear them in reality.\n\n“That family of three, here?” Zhou Ze was somewhat bewildered. “That shouldn’t be. I asked the front desk earlier, and that family of three stayed in a different room, not ours. And that room is currently suspended from renting out. They said they plan to invite monks and Taoist priests for a ceremony after things calm down.”\n\n“It’s genuine, a family of three, crawling around in this room, looking for their heads,” Xu Qinglang affirmed. “Was I asleep just now?”\n\n“Yes,” the old Taoist priest responded.\n\n“Then I must have been with them for too long, and my body was invaded by the malevolent energy,” Xu Qinglang shook his head. Clearly, he was still somewhat groggy.\n\nIn traditional Chinese medicine, there's a saying that evil qi entering the body can cause colds and fever. Xu Qinglang's current state was similar, like a severe cold.\n\n“But that family of three didn’t do anything to me. They were looking for their heads. Whether the murderer is found or not, they can’t descend to hell without their heads,” Xu Qinglang speculated.\n\n“But the problem is, the first time I entered this room, and now the second time, I haven’t felt anything unusual,” Zhou Ze said, somewhat puzzled. “If the souls of that family of three were truly lingering here, it would be impossible for me not to see them. At the very least, I wouldn’t be able to detect even a trace.”\n\nAs a Ghost Catcher, if he couldn't even tell if there were ghosts in a room, he might as well retire.\n\n“But I’m sure I saw them,” Xu Qinglang affirmed. Then he thought for a moment and said self-deprecatingly, “Perhaps I have some talent that even I haven’t discovered.”\n\n“That’s impossible.”\n\nThe old Taoist priest pouted, too lazy to see Xu Qinglang being conceited, and directly said, “Boss, I think the reason Old Xu can see what we can’t is very simple.\n\nThere must be something Old Xu did that we didn’t, so the trigger conditions are different, and naturally, the things seen are also different.”\n\n“So, what is it that he did that we didn’t?” Zhou Ze asked.\n\n“Skincare, BB cream, face masks…” The old Taoist priest counted on his fingers.\n\nXu Qinglang simply had more cosmetics than Bai Yingying, although the female zombie was an exception—she was eternally youthful, forever sixteen, so she didn't need makeup or whitening.\n\nAs he was speaking,\n\nThe old Taoist priest seemed to remember something,\n\nThen pointed to the hot spring pool in the courtyard outside:\n\n“Hot spring bath! He was the only one who bathed, none of us did!”\n\n...\n\nThe old Taoist priest was the first to undress and enter the pool. The water in the pool was still warm. The old Taoist priest added some hot water and lay in it, feeling utterly wonderful.\n\nHowever, when Xu Qinglang came to bathe, the old Taoist priest felt a pang of jealousy.\n\nYes, if it had been a woman, he wouldn't have been jealous, but it was a man.\n\nThat smooth, delicate skin, those slender and graceful legs, that somewhat hazy countenance in the steam—the old Taoist priest instinctively covered a certain area with his bath towel.\n\nThen he lowered his head and silently recited the few Taoist scriptures he knew.\n\nIt’s over,\n\nIt’s over,\n\nMy lifelong reputation is ruined now.\n\nLooking at Concubine Xu’s skin and figure, then at his own scrawny body, protruding ribs, and skin like old elm bark, the old Taoist priest silently sighed again, lamenting how time ages a person.\n\nHe remembered back when he first became a monk, how all the female pilgrims used to praise him as a handsome Taoist priest.\n\nTime is a butcher’s knife, a butcher’s knife indeed.\n\nOld Xu also felt a bit awkward; he wasn’t very used to bathing with others. In fact, many people are like this, similar to college men's bathhouses, where there are always some shy boys who have to wear underwear to bathe.\n\nWhen Zhou Ze walked over from inside, the old Taoist priest and Xu Qinglang both looked his way.\n\nThe old Taoist priest thought, with the boss’s useless appearance, he probably has a lot of flab. Even if the boss isn’t fat, he eats little and exercises little, so after taking off his clothes, his physique probably isn’t even as good as mine.\n\nBut when Zhou Ze walked over, both the old Taoist priest and Xu Qinglang were surprised.\n\nZhou Ze’s body showed several unhealed scars, giving him the look of a war movie protagonist. His muscles were well-defined; he wasn’t a bodybuilder, but the lean and refined physique he revealed after undressing truly dazzled the two men in the hot spring pool, as if their eyes were made of titanium alloy.\n\n“That’s not fair,” the old Taoist priest muttered, somewhat speechless. How could a man who spends all his time basking in the sun, reading newspapers, and then lying on a maid’s lap groaning have such a good physique?\n\nActually, Zhou Ze knew the reason: every time he unleashed his full power, his physical condition would improve, and he indeed didn't need to exercise much.\n\nThe three of them sat in the pool.\n\nThe old Taoist priest began pouring rose essential oil and scattering petals, then used a bath towel to scrub himself.\n\nThe steam from the hot spring slowly rose,\nand even their vision gradually became blurry.\n\n“You’ve poured too much essential oil,” Xu Qinglang complained.\n\n“It’s free anyway, so why not use it all?” the old Taoist priest scoffed.\n\nImmediately after, the old Taoist priest, who was scrubbing himself, suddenly felt a leg gently rubbing against his calf. The leg was very smooth and tender.\n\nConcubine Xu’s leg?\n\nIt must be. The boss’s legs have a lot of muscle, so the touch isn’t the same.\n\nHehe,\n\nAlas,\n\nHehe,\n\nAlas,\n\nThe old Taoist priest was extremely conflicted. He really didn’t want to turn gay, but at this moment, he couldn’t help but feel his mind wander.\n\nThat leg began to move deeper,\n\nOh,\n\nOh,\n\nOh oh oh,\n\nThe old Taoist priest instinctively gasped,\n\nHis voice changed pitch.\n\nJust then, the old Taoist priest’s heart jolted, and he told himself: “No, no, I can’t turn gay, I can’t!”\n\n“Old Xu, what do you mean? Can’t you bathe properly?” the old Taoist priest yelled at Xu Qinglang.\n\n“Are you sick?” Xu Qinglang replied languidly.\n\n“Then why are you teasing me? If you have the guts, tease the boss! I’m not into that!”\n\n“...” Zhou Ze.\n\n“Who’s teasing you?”\n\n“Hey, still not admitting it!”\n\nThe old Taoist priest reached into the water, grabbed that leg, and pulled it up with all his might, then stood up himself.\n\nI’ll make you admit it,\n\nI’ll make you admit it!\n\n“Haha, I got you!”\n\nThe old Taoist priest stood up, only to find the boss and Xu Qinglang staring at him in a daze. This time, he saw clearly that Xu Qinglang was sitting at the other end of the pool, with the boss between them. His leg couldn't possibly be that long.\n\nThe old Taoist priest swallowed hard,\n\nTurned his head,\n\nAnd saw the thigh,\nwhich he was holding in his hand...",

    "content": "A segment of a thigh, clutched in the old Daoist priest's hand. When the old Daoist priest looked at it, he was so startled he even forgot to drop it.\n\nJust then, Zhou Ze and Xu Qinglang emerged from the pool. The two quickly changed their clothes in the living room.\n\nAfter they left, the old Daoist priest finally came to his senses, hastily threw away the thigh, and fled the hot spring pool as if his life depended on it. He had intended to get dressed, but seeing the boss and Xu Qinglang directly open the room door and prepare to leave, he simply grabbed a bathrobe, wrapped it around himself, and followed them out of the hotel.\n\nThe old Daoist priest was, after all, not Xu Qinglang; he didn't have the guts to stay alone in a haunted house.\n\nThis resort mountain village had a large layout, resembling a villa district, with very well-maintained green spaces. Typically, after checking in at the front desk, a greeter would specifically drive an electric sightseeing cart to take guests to their chosen villa. If one wanted to dine or go out, they could also call the front desk to arrange pickup and drop-off.\n\n\"Is it going to rain today?\" The old Daoist priest looked up at the sky. Dark clouds covered the sky, as if a thunderstorm was imminent.\n\nZhou Ze didn't answer, continuing to walk forward. Xu Qinglang followed behind Zhou Ze, his expression solemn.\n\nThey had experienced the events at Sanxiang Village, so they weren't unfamiliar with this kind of setting. As for the old Daoist priest, due to his exceptionally strong vitality, he hadn't fully grasped the situation since he hadn't entered Sanxiang Village last time.\n\nAfter walking for about five minutes, they reached the reception building. The left side of the first floor of the building was the restaurant, serving breakfast, lunch, and dinner.\n\nWhen Zhou Ze and the other two walked into the building, they noticed many people, like the old Daoist priest, dressed in bathrobes, entering from outside and heading directly into the restaurant to eat.\n\n\"Oh, it seems rich people enjoy themselves this way, huh? Eating in a bathrobe really adds flavor!\"\n\nThe old Daoist priest was a bit shy at first, but seeing everyone else like this, he relaxed.\n\nZhou Ze first walked towards the reception desk and found that the staff there were gone. Aside from the restaurant, the rest of the place was empty, with no one in sight.\n\nFinally, Zhou Ze had no choice but to enter the restaurant.\n\n\"Hello, sir, please show your room card.\" There were uniformed waiters here.\n\nXu Qinglang handed over the room card. The person swiped it, verified the room type and number of diners, and nodded.\n\n\"Enjoy your meal.\"\n\nSubsequently, the three walked inside.\n\nThere were quite a few people inside; it was a buffet. Zhou Ze and Xu Qinglang found a place to sit down.\n\n\"Boss, why don't I get some food for us to stave off our hunger first?\" the old Daoist priest suggested.\n\nZhou Ze looked at the old Daoist priest, then pointed at someone nearby.\n\nThe old Daoist priest followed the direction and saw a pretty young woman sitting there eating. She looked quite good.\n\nThe young woman picked up the milk in front of her, took a sip, and then with a \"plop,\" her eyeball actually fell out and directly into the milk cup.\n\nThe old Daoist priest subconsciously swallowed.\n\nThen, the young woman reached into the milk cup and stirred, finally retrieving her eyeball and putting it back into her eye socket.\n\nThe old Daoist priest swallowed twice more in succession.\n\n\"Still want to eat?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nThe old Daoist priest immediately shook his head and sat obediently beside Zhou Ze.\n\nSuch gratitude,\n\nTruly, an overwhelming sense of gratitude.\n\nThis was the first time the boss hadn't deliberately tricked him; he even specifically told him the food here wasn't edible!\n\nPerhaps because he was used to being \"teased,\" the old Daoist priest felt even more grateful to Zhou Ze at this moment. He had genuinely fallen for such tricks far too many times before.\n\nIncluding the incident with the steamed buns last time, which almost made him lose half his old life, though he couldn't really blame the boss for that one.\n\n\"Are there any big ghosts here?\" Xu Qinglang whispered.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. He wasn't sure. The last time in Sanxiang Village was due to the influence of that bronze ring. The bronze ring was still on him now; normally, when in the bookstore, he would have Bai Yingying keep it in the bedroom, but when going out, he definitely carried it with him, just in case he might need it sometime, purely for luck.\n\nAs for the Yin-Yang Scroll, Zhou Ze couldn't carry it with him. What if he encountered a child again and it vibrated a few times? Should he save them or not?\n\n\"Let's just watch for now.\"\n\nZhou Ze lightly touched his face, which was covered in a layer of sweat.\n\n\"The humidity here is extreme,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nXu Qinglang nodded. \"I feel it too, like we're still soaking in the hot spring.\"\n\nThe old Daoist priest could only listen from the side, his gaze scanning around. He saw a young man at the opposite table eating noodles while gnawing on his own fingers, treating them like garlic, eating with great relish.\n\nHe saw the chef preparing rice noodles by stirring with his arm directly in the pot, and scooping them out with his bare hands when done, even as his arm turned bright red from the heat.\n\nGood heavens,\n\nThe old Daoist priest watched until he couldn't bear to look anymore, lowering his head.\n\nHe silently put on a thoughtful expression.\n\nHe wasn't particularly panicked or scared; after all, the boss was right there. If the sky fell, the tallest one would bear the brunt.\n\nIn truth, since ancient times, places with many ghosts often signify two possible situations.\n\nOne is the presence of a great ghost, similar to a ghost king, under whose command various mountain spirits, wild monsters, and lonely ghosts would naturally gather, such as the former Lady Bai or the Black Mountain Demon from \"A Chinese Ghost Story.\"\n\nAnother possibility is the influence of a special magical artifact, just like Sanxiang Village last time, which existed due to the influence of that bronze ring.\n\nIf it were merely the influence of a magical artifact, the problem would be smaller, as magical artifacts have no good or evil, nor any intelligence. But if this General Mountain was the domain of some ghost king, then the problem would be much larger.\n\nZhou Ze wasn't afraid of angering that ghost king; he simply didn't want to add too much trouble.\n\nHe came here merely because of that \"ghost call.\" He only wanted to complete his original plan. Of course, if he could take all the ghosts here, that would be for the best; the newly promoted Boss Zhou's performance was quite pitiful right now.\n\n\"That family of three is here,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nAt the entrance, the family of three walked in and sat down at the table next to Zhou Ze and the others. The daughter sat in her seat, while the father and mother went to get food.\n\nThen,\n\nThe father and mother brought back a lot of food.\n\nThe family of three sat stiffly in their chairs, facing the food on the table, motionless.\n\nThey had no heads, so they naturally couldn't eat.\n\n\"Is that them?\" Zhou Ze asked Xu Qinglang.\n\n\"Yes, it's them,\" Xu Qinglang confirmed with a nod.\n\nZhou Ze understood, rose, and walked over, sitting in the empty seat next to the father.\n\n\"Can you speak?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nThe family of three remained silent.\n\n\"I'm here to help you. You can tell me who killed you. You're looking for your heads, right? I can help you.\"\n\nZhou Ze explained.\n\nThe family of three continued to be silent.\n\nZhou Ze pointed at the little girl.\n\n\"She's so young, her life had just begun, and she was murdered. Aren't you, as parents, angry?\"\n\nAt this moment,\n\nThe wife's arm rose. She dipped her finger into the soup in front of her, then, using the liquid, began to write on the table.\n\nZhou Ze watched carefully,\n\nThen his expression changed.\n\nNot because the woman wrote anything shocking,\n\nBut because the woman seemed unaware that she still had a piece of green vegetable clutched between her fingers. As she wrote a character, the vegetable leaf also swept back and forth across it.\n\nZhou Ze couldn't understand what was being written at all!\n\nBut the woman was still writing diligently; she wanted revenge for her daughter. Yet, the more seriously she wrote, the more frustrated Zhou Ze became; he just couldn't understand it.\n\n\"The writing's smudged. Take the vegetable leaf off,\" Zhou Ze reminded her.\n\nJust then,\n\nA few waiters at the front service desk shouted, \"Mealtime over!\"\n\n\"Clatter, clatter...\"\n\nEveryone who was dining stood up simultaneously, even Zhou Ze and the old Daoist priest followed suit. Then, everyone in the restaurant, including the chefs and waiters, began to line up and walk out. Everything was orderly, as if rehearsed countless times.\n\nThe family of three did the same, rising and heading towards the exit.\n\nZhou Ze reached out to grab the husband's wrist, but the husband passed directly through him. Zhou Ze extended his claws, but still couldn't grasp them.\n\nAt this point, Zhou Ze grew angry. All his fingernails extended, and black mist immediately spread out.\n\nHe was ready to cause trouble.\n\nHe wasn't going to play charades with them anymore.\n\nHowever, the claws, which had previously been effective against spiritual bodies, seemed to have lost all their utility at this moment. The people around them continued to go about their business, completely unaffected.\n\nZhou Ze frowned slightly.\n\nThey...\n\nThey weren't ghosts?\n\nIf not ghosts, not souls, then what were they?\n\nSoon, everyone in the restaurant was gone, leaving only Zhou Ze, the old Daoist priest, and Xu Qinglang.\n\n\"Boss, what happened just now?\" the old Daoist priest stepped forward and asked. He had just seen the boss strike a pose and thought he was about to flip the table, but who would have thought, it was all thunder and no rain?\n\n\"These guys aren't departed souls,\" Zhou Ze stated with certainty.\n\n\"If not departed souls, then what are they?\" the old Daoist priest was baffled.\n\n\"It might be a kind of magnetic field,\" Xu Qinglang speculated. \"There might be some mineral deposits in General Mountain that have caused the magnetic field here to change, just like lightning can record images from a long time ago.\" He added, \"Ghosts exist everywhere, but this many is clearly impossible. Perhaps this supernatural phenomenon has recorded all the traces of ghost activity over the years, giving us the illusion that there are many ghosts here?\"\n\nJust then, Zhou Ze's phone rang. Zhou Ze answered; it was still the unknown number.\n\nThis time, the voice on the other end of the phone was incredibly clear:\n\n\"Save me... save me... I'm at General Mountain... save me... save me...\"\n\n\"We're also at General Mountain, where the hell are you!\" the old Daoist priest roared directly into the phone.\n\n\"They're coming... they're coming... coming... ah...\"\n\nA scream came from the phone.\n\nThen there was a burst of static,\n\nAnother confusing ghost call, with no valuable information.\n\nHowever, just as Zhou Ze was about to hang up,\n\nAnother voice suddenly came from the other end of the phone:\n\n\"Amitābha!\"\n\n\"It's the bald monk!\" the old Daoist priest exclaimed excitedly. \"The bald monk, there's a bald monk causing trouble here! This poor Daoist has finally discovered the truth!\"\n\nZhou Ze frowned and exchanged a glance with Xu Qinglang. Zhou Ze asked, \"Did that voice just now sound familiar?\"\n\nXu Qinglang also nodded. \"It does sound a bit familiar.\"\n\nNext,\n\nA second sentence came from the phone:\n\n\"Amitābha, this poor Daoist has finally found you, hehehe!\"",

    "content": "\"Amitabha, this poor Daoist has finally found you, hehehe!\"\n\nWhen this sentence came out from the phone,\n\nZhou Ze and Xu Qinglang both turned their gazes to the old Daoist beside them.\n\nThe expression on the old Daoist's face was very rich and colorful: there was shock, panic, bewilderment, and helplessness.\n\nYes,\n\nZhou Ze and Xu Qinglang had said before that the voice sounded a bit familiar.\n\nNow it was proven that this was indeed the old Daoist's voice.\n\nHowever, because the human voice transmitted from a phone inevitably gets distorted and altered, and Zhou Ze and Xu Qinglang hadn't expected the old Daoist's voice to appear in it, they were caught off guard.\n\nBut the phrase \"Amitabha\" followed by \"this poor Daoist\" was the old Daoist's usual habit, especially the subsequent \"hehehe,\" which perfectly encapsulated the old Daoist's \"base demeanor.\"\n\nThe old Daoist was a Daoist priest; his real name might sometimes be forgotten even by himself. His name was Lu Fangweng. Lu You in ancient times was also known as \"Fangweng\" and was called Lu Fangweng, but despite sharing a name with an ancient great poet, the old Daoist's conduct was much less principled.\n\nEngaging in illicit trades, wandering the jianghu,* for decades through trials and tribulations, he had done almost everything. He always considered himself a Daoist priest, yet he had not an ounce of the discipline expected of one. Aside from the inexhaustible ancestral talismans he kept hidden in his trousers, which still had some effect, there was almost no other feature of a Daoist to be found on him.\n\nEven his usual catchphrase, \"Wuliang Tianzun,\" he often mispronounced as \"Amitabha.\"\n\nSeeing the Boss and Xu Qinglang looking at him,\n\nThe old Daoist gave an awkward smile,\n\nAnd pointed to his face, saying:\n\n\"You can't possibly think that I, this poor Daoist, am the mastermind, can you?\"\n\nAlright,\n\nGenerally speaking,\n\nIn a suspense drama, the most unremarkable and unlikely character at the beginning often steps forward at the end, tearing off their mask to surprise everyone that they are the killer, while those who are boisterous and immediately suspected at the beginning are often innocent.\n\nBut when it came to the old Daoist,\n\nHe's the mastermind?\n\nHe's standing behind, orchestrating all of this?\n\nXu Qinglang and Zhou Ze both shook their heads slightly, \"Let's go out first.\"\n\n\"Hmm, right.\"\n\nThe two turned around and walked out of the restaurant.\n\nThe old Daoist was initially a bit nervous, afraid the Boss and the others had misunderstood something, but seeing the Boss and Old Xu directly giving up on their suspicion, the old Daoist suddenly felt a bit let down.\n\nThis feeling of being \"trusted\" didn't seem to be all that pleasant.\n\n\"Boss, why don't you two reconsider for a bit...\"\n\nZhou Ze and Xu Qinglang continued walking forward without looking back.\n\n\"Just pretend, even...\"\n\nThe old Daoist felt somewhat helpless and could only follow them out.\n\nFrom exiting the restaurant until they returned to the rented villa, they didn't see any other pedestrians along the way. The three returned to the side of the hot spring pool.\n\nZhou Ze first stepped into the hot spring, submerged his face, and when he lifted his head, he wiped away the water droplets from his face. The dark clouds and oppressive atmosphere in the sky had vanished.\n\nIt seemed he was right; the entrance was indeed this hot spring.\n\nThe old Daoist and Xu Qinglang had also returned; everyone's clothes were soaked. Clearly, the space they had been in before was not an entirely separate place, but rather a supernatural \"environment\" that relied on the real world.\n\nFor example, when they were lying in the hot spring earlier, Zhou Ze and the others were unclothed. It was only when the old Daoist fished out a leg from the pool that they ran out of the pool, put on clothes, and left the room.\n\nBut now, their clothes were still on them, and the old Daoist was still wrapped in a bathrobe.\n\nThe hot spring pool was a bit like a hypnotist's pendulum, allowing you to see more things, but in reality, you might just be seeing \"illusions,\" and you yourself were still walking and moving in reality.\n\nSometimes, Zhou Ze couldn't help but wonder if many of the lunatics in this world, who spout nonsense and are labeled by those around them as \"mentally ill, abnormal,\" actually mean that they can truly see a \"world\" that exists within reality but is completely invisible to ordinary people.\n\nOf course, this is like how among the numerous natural and accidental deaths reported each year in various countries, many homicides are actually hidden and never discovered or prosecuted. The specific circumstances within these cases are truly unknowable.\n\nXu Qinglang took off his clothes, changed into a bathrobe, then walked up to Zhou Ze, motioning for Zhou Ze to take off his wet clothes as well. Afterwards, he hung both their clothes on a hanger outside to dry.\n\nZhou Ze sat on the living room sofa, toying with his phone.\n\nThe old Daoist sat nearby, making tea with freshly boiled water from an electric kettle, and proactively handed a cup to Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze took the teacup, swirled it, and said, \"Old Xu, have you seen a movie called 'The Shining'?\"\n\n\"That horror movie?\" Xu Qinglang asked.\n\n\"Hmm, I think the situation we're in now is somewhat similar to 'The Shining'—a reality and illusion that are hard to distinguish, plus the scene where the former residents who died here and nearby were all dining together. It's very much like the photograph in 'The Shining'.\"\n\n\"So, what's your point?\" Xu Qinglang took a sip of tea. \"Are you getting greedy?\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head, \"I don't want to deal with the secrets of this place for now. It's here, and there'll be plenty of opportunities later. To be honest, I've almost forgotten why we came here.\n\nForget it, let's find the killer of that family of three first before anything else. The key is that ghost call; I need to figure it out, otherwise, I just feel uncomfortable.\"\n\nSpeaking of the ghost call, Zhou Ze looked at the old Daoist again. How did the old Daoist's voice appear on the phone?\n\nCould it be that the person on the phone was a ventriloquist, skilled in imitating the old Daoist's voice and mannerisms?\n\n\"Ding-dong... Ding-dong...\"\n\nSomeone was pressing the doorbell outside.\n\nThe old Daoist got up and opened the door. A waiter stood outside, asking with some concern, \"Hello, I just wanted to ask if you need any assistance?\"\n\n\"Assistance?\" The old Daoist was a bit puzzled.\n\n\"It's like this, I saw the three of you wandering and talking in the restaurant earlier. I called out to you, but you didn't respond, so I specifically came over to ask if you're hungry and would like to dine, we can start a bit earlier, as there aren't many guests checked in right now.\"\n\n\"No, thank you,\" the old Daoist refused.\n\n\"Alright then, I won't disturb your rest,\" the waiter smiled and nodded.\n\nThe old Daoist closed the door, then called out to Zhou Ze and the others inside, \"Boss, the hotel waiter came to see if we were all sleepwalking, haha.\"\n\n\"Next time, let's not all go in together. At least one or two people should stay outside and watch,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nXu Qinglang nodded, \"I look terrible now. I'll go wash my face and do my skincare first. We can make further plans tonight.\"\n\n\"Okay, let's rest first,\" Zhou Ze agreed.\n\nImmediately, Zhou Ze rose from the living room and walked to the hot spring pool, pointing to it, \"Old Daoist, you initially found a human leg here, right?\"\n\n\"Yes, a woman's leg, I guess. If it were a man's, it would probably be...\" The old Daoist said, subtly glancing around the room.\n\nHe had genuinely mistaken it at first, thinking Old Xu was teasing him.\n\n\"Drain the water from the pool,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nThe old Daoist nodded. By this time, the hot spring pool had cooled down; the water was still warm, but there was no steam. The old Daoist, barefoot, went down and pulled out the stopper, and the water slowly began to drain.\n\n\"The human leg, it should be real.\"\n\nZhou Ze lit a cigarette and said quietly:\n\n\"This whole thing seems a bit big. That family of three just seems to be a trigger. That family of three had their heads cut off, and now there was a leg in this hot spring pool.\"\n\nHe exhaled a puff of smoke,\n\n\"After the case of the family of three, this hot spring hotel was still able to operate because that family of three died on their way down the mountain after checking out, not in the hotel itself.\n\nBut the facts don't seem to be this way. Old Xu said earlier that the family of three was fumbling around in their hotel room for their missing heads. Now, it seems that at some unknown time in the past, someone dismembered a body here and left a leg. Although the leg is not visible now, since we could see it in that state, it means it once appeared.\"\n\n\"Boss, are you suspecting the murderer is internal staff of this hotel?\"\n\n\"Not just that,\" Zhou Ze flicked the ash from his cigarette. \"I'm even starting to wonder if this is a hot spring resort or a slaughterhouse.\"\n\nSaying that, Zhou Ze tried to make his left fingernails grow long. A black mist immediately condensed in his palm, and then Zhou Ze inserted his fingernails into the edge of the hot spring pool.\n\nThis was a method Zhou Ze used to find nearby spirits in the past; now he was just trying it casually, as he had no other leads anyway.\n\nWho knew it was better not to try,\n\nBut once he tried, he found that there were indeed black footprints here,\n\nThis trail of footprints extended from the hot spring pool all the way into the living room.\n\nReally there?\n\nZhou Ze looked up and followed the trail of footprints.\n\nThe footprints turned a corner in the living room and went straight into the bathroom.\n\nAt this moment, Xu Qinglang was washing his face with facial cleanser in the bathroom, applying skincare products to his face in front of the mirror, meticulously smoothing them on.\n\nAnd the footprints,\n\nAfter extending to the bathroom vanity, they started to go upwards, implying that the thing had climbed onto the vanity.\n\nAfter climbing onto the vanity,\n\nWhere did it go then?\n\nZhou Ze reached out and patted Xu Qinglang on the shoulder.\n\n\"What?\" Xu Qinglang asked, continuing to pat his face in the mirror.\n\nZhou Ze gently rubbed the mirror surface with his fingernail,\n\nXu Qinglang stopped patting,\n\nBut his reflection in the mirror,\n\nWas still diligently and meticulously patting its face,\n\nShowing no sign of stopping.\n\n\"Slap, slap, slap...\"\n\n---\n*Jiānghú (江湖): Literally \"rivers and lakes,\" refers to a wandering, vagabond lifestyle, often associated with martial arts, vagrants, and outlaws.",

    "content": "So, when you have nothing to do, don't always look in the mirror;\n\nThis habit is really bad.\n\nBecause you don't know,\n\nIs the person in the mirror truly your reflection, merely mechanically following your every move;\n\nOr,\n\nIs he just treating you like a fool, playing with you, silently chuckling and snickering behind your back when he sees you haven't discovered his existence yet?\n\nThe one in the mirror stopped patting his face after about seven or eight seconds. He stood in the mirror, initially still trying to imitate Xu Qinglang's current posture.\n\nBut then he thought,\n\nLooking at Zhou Ze and Xu Qinglang's expressions, he knew it would be meaningless to continue feigning.\n\nBefore, he had treated others as fools, applying skincare products with a man, smacking his face, and found it very amusing. Now, continuing the act would be treating himself as a fool.\n\nHe quietly retreated, his figure shrinking further and further away, smaller and smaller. He wanted to leave this place.\n\nZhou Ze believed that even police academies, when teaching methods for apprehending criminals, wouldn't teach how to catch a criminal who hides in a mirror.\n\nBut now, he faced this very problem.\n\nFirst, breaking the mirror was impossible; the person inside probably wished for him to do so. But to enter the mirror?\n\nZhou Ze reached out to try; his hand couldn't penetrate it. Evidently, this attempt failed. Of course, Zhou Ze hadn't held much hope to begin with.\n\nIf mirrors could really be penetrated by just anyone, then the number of children who accidentally fell into mirrors and went missing each year would definitely be far greater than those who drowned swimming in rivers.\n\nThat jerk in the mirror became smaller and smaller as he ran. He even turned his head with interest and made a \"throat-slitting\" gesture towards Zhou Ze and the others, truly arrogant.\n\n\"Heaven's ultimate infinity, profound heart's righteous law!\"\n\nXu Qinglang formed a hand seal, and a heart-protecting mirror was slapped directly onto the mirror surface.\n\nIt must be said that Old Xu, whether in his hand seal motion or the way he took out the heart-protecting mirror, was impeccable, exuding the air of a profound mystic. But after the heart-protecting mirror was applied, the person in the mirror merely tilted his head, seemingly still smiling. Clearly, Old Xu's method was ineffective.\n\n\"Old Daoist, your crotch!\"\n\nZhou Ze shouted.\n\nOld Daoist instinctively reached for his crotch,\n\nAnd then,\n\nHe actually pulled out another talisman!\n\nBear in mind, Old Daoist wasn't wearing his robes now, but a bathrobe! This meant that after changing clothes, Old Daoist had transferred the talisman with him!\n\n\"By the swift decree of the Grand Pure Old Lord, listen to my command, Buddha of the West!\"\n\nMuttering a rather nonsensical incantation, Old Daoist directly pressed his talisman onto the mirror.\n\nThe talisman glowed red for a moment, and the image in the mirror twisted. The person inside seemed to emit a faint cry of pain, but he still didn't come out. And perhaps because he was stimulated by the talisman, he, who had originally intended to stay and show off, now genuinely began to prepare his escape.\n\n\"Any more?\" Zhou Ze urged Old Daoist.\n\nHe refused to believe that if ten or eight talismans were stuck on this mirror, the fellow inside wouldn't be forced out.\n\nOld Daoist rummaged again, then spread his hand, revealing only a few black, curly hairs in his palm.\n\nNothing else.\n\n\"None left, Boss. Only brought one today.\"\n\nBy now, the person in the mirror was just a small black dot, almost vanishing.\n\nZhou Ze closed his eyes, spread his hands, and all his fingernails elongated. Layers of black mist began to rise from his palms. For Zhou Ze, only one method was left to try.\n\nFaced with an irrational situation, it seemed he had to try an irrational approach.\n\nUnder the bewildered gazes of Old Daoist and Xu Qinglang, Zhou Ze clasped his hands in front of him and adopted a tug-of-war stance.\n\nIn reality, Zhou Ze hadn't grabbed anything, but he was pulling backward as if he really held something, and he was pulling quite strenuously.\n\nIs it really that exaggerated?\n\nIs your imagination that vivid?\n\nOld Daoist's mouth twitched. He wanted to tell his boss that this method was even less reliable, but then Old Daoist's jaw stiffened, because he saw the guy in the mirror, who had been reduced to just a dot, slowly running back.\n\nOh my goodness!\n\nBoss actually pulled him back!\n\nOld Daoist suddenly felt he couldn't understand this world anymore. This works too?\n\n\"Help me!\" Zhou Ze shouted.\n\nHelp you?\n\nXu Qinglang and Old Daoist paused, then joined in, pretending to help Zhou Ze pull. Xu Qinglang felt like he was one of the ministers in \"The Emperor's New Clothes,\" doing something very foolish, but the crucial point was that as he and Old Daoist joined in, the speed at which the guy in the mirror retreated actually increased!\n\n\"If you believe in your heart you can pull him back, you can. He's in the mirror, but in reality, he's more in our eyes,\" Zhou Ze said something very philosophical.\n\nThe mirror's function is to reflect light; it merely acts as a medium. Rather than saying there's something in the mirror, it's more accurate to say there's something in one's eyes.\n\nOf course, this involves many philosophical arguments, and going into detail would be too troublesome.\n\nAs they pulled, the person in the mirror slowly returned to the same size as Xu Qinglang had been when he was applying skincare products.\n\nHe's about to be pulled out,\n\nHe's coming out,\n\nPull harder!\n\nA little more force!\n\nAlmost out!\n\nOld Daoist shouted by the side, chanting a work song. Vaguely, he seemed to return to his days as a porter on the dock. But as he chanted, it sounded more like three grown men acting as midwives.\n\nFinally, a corner of the object in the mirror's clothing appeared.\n\nBut then,\n\nWith a crisp \"crack,\" the mirror suddenly exploded.\n\nThen, a black shadow darted out from within. Perhaps Zhou Ze and the others were too engrossed, as all three fell backward simultaneously, as if the rope in a tug-of-war had suddenly snapped.\n\nThis made Zhou Ze smile wryly. When he quickly stood up, realizing he needed to catch the black shadow, he found he had already lost the initiative.\n\nZhou Ze's fingernails had only snagged the opponent, and after a pained shriek came from within the black shadow, it actually shrunk again, escaping Zhou Ze's grasp.\n\nThen it burrowed into another glass door in the bathroom.\n\nOnly this time, it seemed unable to fully penetrate, with a part of it still outside, like a blood leech. This might have been due to its injury, affecting its performance.\n\nZhou Ze's fingernails swept past, and the glass door shattered. The black shadow let out another shriek and fled again, like a wild rabbit, moving very fast.\n\n\"Don't let him escape! He can only hide in reflective surfaces. You two go look, I'll trap him first!\"\n\nZhou Ze plunged his fingernails into the ground, and black qi immediately spread out, completely enveloping the small villa. Zhou Ze had done this before when facing the water python's attack, but that time was for self-preservation; this time was an active containment.\n\nMeanwhile, Old Daoist and Xu Qinglang rushed out of the bathroom and began searching for reflective surfaces to see if that thing was hiding inside.\n\nThe beginning of the matter was unbelievable, but the process was even more astonishing. As for it now directly turning into a game of hide-and-seek, that was something no one had expected.\n\nIn truth, it was fundamentally because Old Daoist and Xu Qinglang were living people. Living people in this world abide by birth, old age, sickness, and death; there's science, reason, and laws to be followed. Thus, their perspective was sometimes not as broad as Zhou Ze's.\n\nFor someone who had been to hell, nothing was unacceptable, and nothing was impossible.\n\nThe search process was difficult and complicated, because there were too many reflective objects here. Checking them one by one, while also guarding against the opponent moving, even though Zhou Ze had confined the range to this small villa, it was still not a simple task to truly ferret out that thing.\n\nOld Daoist searched around, found nothing, and had no leads. He felt like he was going crazy, his mind filled with glass, wishing he could turn into glass himself.\n\nXu Qinglang searched around too and found nothing. They also didn't dare to ask Zhou Ze if he had truly stopped that thing, what if it wasn't in the villa and had already escaped?\n\n\"Oh, right, the hot springs!\"\n\nOld Daoist ran to the edge of the hot springs. The water in the hot spring pool had been drained, but there were still several puddles of standing water. These could also reflect light, and act as mirrors!\n\nOld Daoist jumped into the hot spring area, searching puddle by puddle, but still found nothing.\n\nFeeling somewhat exhausted, Old Daoist simply sat down at the bottom of the hot spring.\n\nCan't find it,\n\nThat thing can burrow into mirrors. Who knows where it went now. Amitabha, Immeasurable Heavenly Venerable, merciful Lord, please show your divine power and let this humble Daoist find him.\n\nZhou Ze in the bathroom was close to collapsing, constantly yelling from inside the bathroom, asking if they had found it.\n\nThis increased Old Daoist's pressure.\n\nDamn it, if only I could call the police and ask them to help find someone, Old Daoist thought wildly, then he suddenly froze. He pulled his phone from his pocket.\n\nA phone screen is also a mirror, it can also reflect light!\n\nAnd it's been on him all along, the easiest place for a \"lamp under black\" situation!\n\nOld Daoist immediately pressed the phone screen; it lit up. Originally, Old Daoist's wallpaper was the classic photo of Marilyn Monroe's skirt blowing up, but now, beneath Marilyn Monroe's skirt on the screen, a black shadow had appeared, like a layer of pixelation, and it was wriggling.\n\nOld Daoist was so happy that a bubble formed at his nose.\n\nHe was very excited,\n\nAnd immediately reached out to grab that \"pixelation,\" muttering excitedly:\n\n\"Amitabha, this humble Daoist has finally found you, hehehe!\"",

    "content": "\"Amitabha, this humble Daoist has finally found you, hehehe!\"\n\nAfter saying this, the old Daoist began to rub vigorously on the screen with his hand. This thing had been injured by Boss Zhou before, and now even when it burrowed into a mirror, it wasn't as nimble as it used to be. The boss had been able to smash mirrors to force it out, and the old Daoist felt he could do the same.\n\nBut as he rubbed, the old Daoist suddenly froze. He recalled what he had just said and suddenly felt a chill down his spine, then instinctively swallowed.\n\nNo way...\n\nThis must be a coincidence.\n\nYes, it was precisely because he had heard the previous words on the phone that they were imprinted in his mind, and he had blurted them out just now.\n\nYes,\n\nIt must be like that.\n\nThere was another possibility, one the old Daoist dared not think about, truly dared not.\n\nAs he rubbed, a layer of black grime, like the filth from someone who hadn't bathed in a long time, began to accumulate. The old Daoist pinched it with two fingers and pulled hard.\n\n\"I found it!\"\n\nAt the same time, the old Daoist, recovering from his shock, remembered to call for help.\n\nXu Qinglang immediately rushed over. Seeing the old Daoist pulling something out of the phone, he instantly understood and watched closely from the side, fearing the thing might escape again.\n\nZhou Ze finally pulled his fingernail out of the ground and let out a long sigh. He used to read wuxia novels or watch TV shows where characters could raise a hand and turn things to ashes, causing mountains to crumble and rivers to reverse. Douzong masters were truly terrifying...\n\nWhen it was his turn, he realized the gap between fantasy and reality was immense. In just this short time, he was already a bit sore in the back from exhaustion.\n\nThe old Daoist pulled the thing out and pressed it firmly with both hands. In fact, you couldn't feel its presence; his hands were perfectly pressed together, as if there was nothing inside.\n\nBut there was indeed a sensation stimulating him—that wet, slippery, somewhat chilly feeling that kept telling him there was something in his palm.\n\n\"Boss, here you go!\"\n\nSeeing Zhou Ze approach, the old Daoist immediately stood up and handed this \"hot potato\" to Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze reached out and took it. It was a black ball, no, now it looked like a black rag. But to be safe, Zhou Ze directly pierced it through the middle with his fingernail, like skewering a piece of barbecued meat, because this thing was too good at running and hiding.\n\nAny soul-like creature seemed to be suppressed by Zhou Ze's fingernail. After being pierced by Zhou Ze's fingernail, the thing kept \"spinning\" and \"jumping,\"\n\nlooking very pained.\n\n\"What are you...?\"\n\nZhou Ze hadn't even finished his first question,\n\nwhen a sound like a balloon popping was heard.\n\nThe black thing impaled on his fingertip actually exploded directly, turning into wisps of green smoke.\n\n\"...\" The old Daoist.\n\n\"...\" Xu Qinglang.\n\nThe old Daoist had ten thousand \"motherf*****s\" in his heart that he didn't know whether to utter, but a strong survival instinct made him swallow his words. Having deeply mastered the Dao of Prudence, the old Daoist immediately said:\n\n\"Boss, this fellow's bones are too hard; he'd rather die than yield.\"\n\nHe wouldn't accuse Zhou Ze of having broken the thing directly, after all their hard work, they hadn't even gotten a single word out of it.\n\nXu Qinglang took a deep breath. He wanted to curse, but he was too lazy to bother.\n\n\"My apologies.\" Zhou Ze looked a bit sheepish. Everyone had spent so much effort catching this thing, and it had gone wrong in his hands. \"I didn't realize it was so fragile.\"\n\nThe three returned to the living room, where the atmosphere was heavy. They had thought a turning point had appeared, and a breakthrough seemed imminent, but with that \"pop,\"\n\nthe whole situation returned to square one.\n\n\"Boss, at least we've confirmed one thing: this hotel definitely has something fishy going on!\"\n\nThe old Daoist said very seriously and earnestly, not at all feeling that he had stated the obvious.\n\n\"Should we rest first, or go for another bath?\" Xu Qinglang asked.\n\n\"Let's rest first. It's almost eight o'clock now. We'll go for another bath around one or two in the morning,\" Zhou Ze said, checking the time.\n\nThe three didn't go back to their rooms to rest but made do by lying on the living room sofa and tatami. Zhou Ze actually wanted to go back to his room to sleep, but Xu Qinglang and the old Daoist clearly didn't want to. The old Daoist, being shameless as ever, insisted on staying with the boss. Although Xu Qinglang said no, his body was very honest.\n\nBeing next to Zhou Ze meant there was at least someone who could confront things head-on when something happened, whereas if he were alone, he often became flustered.\n\nThe old Daoist didn't mention the words earlier because he thought it might be a coincidence, and he felt a bit uneasy.\n\nAround eleven o'clock, the old Daoist was woken by the need to urinate. He didn't dare go to the bathroom. Firstly, the bathroom was indeed haunted today, and the old Daoist was afraid that while he was relieving himself, the family of three might suddenly appear on the floor looking for their heads, which would scare him impotent.\n\nSecondly, too many horror stories and movies involved accidents happening during urination and defecation. Knowing there was danger nearby, yet insisting on being alone, and bothering with certain things at a critical moment, often led to one's own demise.\n\nSo, the old Daoist directly reached for an empty mineral water bottle from the coffee table, preparing to relieve himself right in the living room.\n\nJust as the old Daoist unzipped his pants and was about to \"turn on the faucet,\" he saw Zhou Ze on the opposite sofa watching him with open eyes.\n\nThe old Daoist immediately stopped, startled, and said somewhat awkwardly, \"Boss, you're awake?\"\n\n\"I can't sleep,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nOnly then did the old Daoist realize. Yes, the old Daoist knew that without Bai Yingying, Zhou Ze couldn't sleep at night; he had actually forgotten.\n\nZhou Ze got up, lit a cigarette, walked to the front of the living room, directly facing the bathroom, and pointed inside. \"I'll watch. Go ahead and relieve yourself in there.\"\n\nMoved,\n\nIncredibly moved,\n\nOne hundred, one thousand, ten thousand times moved!\n\nThe old Daoist wished he could cry tears. The boss had changed, truly changed, becoming more caring towards his subordinates, more attentive to lonely old people.\n\nAlthough it seemed a bit late to understand these principles after two lifetimes, it was... worth it!\n\nThe boss was actually willing to help him urinate at night!\n\nThe old Daoist's inner thoughts were abundant. Of course, it was truly Zhou Ze's unintentional gesture, but for him, the impact was profound.\n\n\"Alright, boss.\"\n\nThe old Daoist immediately entered the bathroom.\n\nThe door was left open.\n\nStanding by the toilet, the old Daoist could see Zhou Ze in the living room, and Zhou Ze could see him. It felt very secure!\n\nThis feeling was absolutely great!\n\n\"Boss lights the lamp, illuminating the ghost's home, letting the lost ghost find the way back;\n\nBoss lights the lamp, illuminating the ghost's future, with a bit of light, comforting the ghost's heart...\"\n\nThe old Daoist was in a good mood, even humming a tune, leisurely pulling out his \"faucet,\" finding the most comfortable angle, and then preparing himself.\n\nGetting old,\n\nThe \"faucet\" inevitably rusted,\n\nSo singing now was also to ease the awkwardness. Otherwise, if he stood by the toilet for a long time and the boss didn't hear the sound of water, wouldn't he be very curious?\n\nJust then, Zhou Ze's phone rang. He looked down and saw it was still that unknown number.\n\nThe whole incident, in fact, originated from this unknown call. It was like a string, constantly pulling them to this hotel to investigate its affairs.\n\nAnd indeed, the hotel did have problems, but that feeling of being led by the nose constantly made Zhou Ze very uncomfortable and dislike it greatly.\n\nBut no matter what, Zhou Ze still answered the call.\n\nImmediately after,\n\nThe phone delivered the somewhat tired phrase:\n\n\"Save me... save me... I'm on General Mountain... save me... save me... please... save me...\"\n\nIt seemed his opening line was always this one.\n\nZhou Ze felt like swearing. If this guy were in front of him, Zhou Ze would probably walk over and slap him.\n\nSeriously, could he provide some, even slightly, useful information?\n\n\"I'm on General Mountain,\" Zhou Ze replied weakly.\n\nBut this time, it seemed different.\n\nBecause the voice on the other end of the phone,\n\nseemed to have suddenly learned how to communicate.\n\nHe actually changed his usual Xianglin's Wife-like monologue:\n\n\"Really...? You've come...? Have you really come...? Really...?\"\n\n\"Yes, I'm here. Where are you? How can I save you?\"\n\nZhou Ze perked up slightly, a glimmer of hope in his heart.\n\n\"Hehe... it's good that you've come... so good... so good... thank you for coming to save me... truly... thank you... I'm very grateful to you... extremely, extremely grateful to you...\"\n\nA barrage of thank-yous,\n\nbut still not a speck of useful information.\n\nZhou Ze interrupted the incessant thanking and said directly:\n\n\"Tell me something useful, or I'm leaving first thing tomorrow morning.\"\n\n\"Useful things... ah... right... I'm sorry... my mind... it's a bit messed up...\"\n\nThis was already known.\n\n\"Oh... I remember... I remember... how you can save me... oh no... how you can save us...\"\n\n\"Hurry up.\"\n\n\"That is... you take our place... you take our place here and accept the punishment and suffering... then we... then we can... escape from this sea of bitterness...\"\n\nZhou Ze's eyes narrowed.\n\nJust then,\n\nThe voice on the phone suddenly sped up:\n\n\"Surprised?\n\nDelighted?\n\nHow about,\n\nI pour you some red wine first,\n\nto celebrate?\"\n\nRed wine?\n\nZhou Ze frowned slightly.\n\nAt this moment,\n\nThe old Daoist, after a long period of preparation, finally released the water,\n\nmaking a \"gurgling\" sound.\n\nJust like most people's first action after pooping on the toilet is to look back at the poop they've just produced,\n\nthe old Daoist instinctively looked down at himself,\n\nthen his face suddenly changed color.\n\nHe realized what he had just urinated was,\n\nblood,\n\nbright red blood!",

    "content": "Suddenly, a feeling of ground-shaking swept through the surroundings. Zhou Ze instinctively lowered his center of gravity to prevent himself from falling.\n\nBut he saw the old Taoist priest in the bathroom still clinging to his faucet, screaming;\n\nXu Qinglang, on the living room sofa, was still in a deep sleep, seemingly oblivious to anything amiss.\n\nZhou Ze realized, with a start, that it wasn't actual ground-shaking or an earthquake, but rather a severe distortion of all light and shadows around him, creating the illusion of violent shaking.\n\nEverything reflective seemed to come alive, becoming very active, actively trying to mislead and influence him.\n\nIt was an unfathomable feeling, as if at this moment, he was being rejected by the entire environment. They were no longer inanimate objects around him, no longer tools he could pick, choose, or trample upon. Having gained their own consciousness, they instinctively began to repel him, to dislike him.\n\nZhou Ze opened his mouth, wanting to wake Xu Qinglang, but when he called out, Xu Qinglang continued to sleep on the sofa, as if he hadn't heard anything at all.\n\nNo matter how soundly he slept, he couldn't be *that* dead asleep.\n\n\"Old Taoist!\"\n\nZhou Ze called out to the old Taoist priest again.\n\nThe old Taoist stood in the bathroom, still staring at his faucet and yelling. No matter how Zhou Ze called him, he wouldn't turn around.\n\nGradually, Zhou Ze noticed the old Taoist's figure twisting, and Xu Qinglang's body, lying on the sofa, also twisting. He felt like he was in a hall of mirrors, where all the light around him was bent, causing an extremely painful visual impact.\n\nTaking a deep breath, Zhou Ze began to close his eyes. He wasn't a novice ghost catcher anymore. In the past six months, he had been through many storms. He knew that in such a situation, the first thing to do was to calm his inner self.\n\nHeart like ice, unfazed by the sky falling!\n\nHowever, as soon as Zhou Ze closed his eyes, he felt a sudden sensation of weightlessness beneath his feet, as if he was about to fall into a deep abyss.\n\nThis feeling often occurred during sleep, a sudden sensation of falling, then the whole person would instinctively twitch and quickly wake up, realizing it was a false alarm.\n\nBut for Zhou Ze at this moment, this feeling lasted for a long time, and it grew more intense.\n\nZhou Ze could only choose to open his eyes, and the moment he reopened them,一道道 white light suddenly burst forth, their brightness like a car suddenly turning on its high beams at night.\n\nAfter a moment of dizziness and blindness, when Zhou Ze's vision returned to clarity, he found himself still standing in the living room.\n\nEverything around him was unchanged, as if everything that had just happened was merely an illusion that didn't count, a fleeting mirage. But soon, Zhou Ze realized something was wrong.\n\nThe sofa was still the same sofa, but Xu Qinglang on it was gone.\n\nThe bathroom was still the same bathroom, but the old Taoist priest who was urinating blood in it was also gone.\n\nThe furnishings were all there, everything was unchanged, but he was the only one left here, and only he.\n\nZhou Ze took a deep breath. The light was on, but its brightness was clearly insufficient, even very low, making everything feel dim.\n\nHe walked into the bathroom and, through the cracked mirror still on the wall, Zhou Ze suddenly saw the figures of the old Taoist priest and Xu Qinglang.\n\nThe old Taoist priest was leaning against the wall, looking terrified, with blood all over him. Xu Qinglang was next to him, watching over him, also seeming to comfort the old Taoist.\n\nWere they in the mirror?\n\nZhou Ze was a bit stunned. Then, Zhou Ze saw Xu Qinglang helping the old Taoist priest leave the bathroom, and he couldn't see them anymore.\n\n\"Hey! Can you hear my voice?\"\n\nZhou Ze called out, but there was no response. Afterward, Zhou Ze exited the bathroom and walked into the living room. There was a large picture frame in the living room with an oil painting of Eight Steeds. From the mirror, Zhou Ze saw the old Taoist priest sitting on the sofa in the living room, and Xu Qinglang bringing him a glass of water.\n\nImmediately after, Xu Qinglang lit a paper talisman, dissolved it in the water, and handed it to the old Taoist to drink.\n\nThe old Taoist, frowning in pain, gulped down the talisman water, then kept exhaling.\n\nZhou Ze couldn't hear their voices at all, only see their images and movements.\n\nIt wasn't until Zhou Ze saw himself in the mirrored scene that his heart sank.\n\nSomething,\n\nHad truly turned into an unimaginable situation.\n\nHis own reflection on the sofa was just lying there, motionless.\n\nXu Qinglang and the old Taoist priest occasionally looked at him on the sofa with concerned expressions. Xu Qinglang even used a wet towel to wipe his face, but he felt nothing.\n\nHoo...\n\nHe understood now.\n\nIt wasn't that they had unknowingly entered the mirror.\n\nIn fact,\n\nThe one who had truly entered the mirror,\n\nWas himself!\n\nZhou Ze tried to scratch the mirror with his fingernails. He instinctively wanted to break this thing and get out, but his usually infallible fingernails were completely useless against this small mirror at this moment. This mirror was as hard as *King Kong*, so solid it was despair-inducing.\n\nAfter trying for a while, Zhou Ze gave up and sat down on the sofa.\n\nOnce seated, Zhou Ze realized that while the furnishings in the room were indeed the same, the arrangements were actually reversed, as things in a mirror are indeed opposite to reality.\n\nHe reached out and felt, discovering that his cigarettes were still there. He took a cigarette and put it in his mouth, and was actually able to light it with a lighter. The smoke even had the scent of tobacco.\n\nZhou Ze didn't know what state he was in. His body was still in reality outside the mirror, but everything here felt so real, unlike a soul leaving the body.\n\nZhou Ze had experienced the state of a soul leaving the body. It was a very weak and bewildered feeling. But he clearly didn't have that feeling now, which meant he wasn't in a state where his soul had been sucked in.\n\nZhou Ze remembered that in the afternoon at the restaurant, his fingernails were also useless against those \"departed souls.\" This seemed to imply that he was currently in the same state as those \"departed souls\" dining in the restaurant?\n\nNot a soul,\n\nNot a physical body,\n\nA... very strange and indescribable state?\n\nThis was,\n\nThe state within the mirror?\n\nThroughout this night, Zhou Ze mostly sat on the sofa, pondering how to get out, how to leave this place. Zhou Ze also tried to open the door and look outside, but he found that the main door and the walls of the courtyard were all separated by a layer of \"glass.\" He couldn't get out at all, only able to move within this confined area.\n\nSo, this night was spent either sitting on the sofa contemplating life, or standing in front of the picture frame, watching the old Taoist priest and Xu Qinglang desperately trying various methods to wake him up.\n\nActually, what Zhou Ze was most worried about at the moment was whether Xu Qinglang and the old Taoist priest would take his body back to the bookstore in the city center the next day.\n\nAlthough Zhou Ze's character was quite resilient, he really didn't want to be abandoned by his companions like this, even if his companions probably didn't know that he was actually in the mirror at the moment.\n\nZhou Ze even tried to fill the hot spring pool with water and soaked in it several times, only to find that even if he submerged his head in the pool, he still couldn't leave this area. Zhou Ze had executed and tried every possible method, and all had failed.\n\nIn short, this night was very long, so long that Zhou Ze felt a bit suffocated.\n\nWhen faint sunlight seeped in from outside, Zhou Ze slowly raised his head,\n\nIt's morning, isn't it?\n\n\"Crunch... Crunch...\"\n\nThere seemed to be the sound of something breaking. Zhou Ze stood up, walked to the door, and reached out to open it, finding that a piece of the glass outside had shattered, enough for a person to walk out normally.\n\nThis was like a tunnel for children to pass through in an amusement park. Zhou Ze walked in, able to follow only this single path forward, because all around were thin layers of glass. You could see people outside, see the scenery outside, but you just couldn't get out.\n\nNo matter how much force you used, you couldn't break even a shred of this glass.\n\nAs he walked, Zhou Ze saw a door. The door was open, and Zhou Ze walked in.\n\nThen,\n\nIt suddenly opened up.\n\nAfter walking through the narrow glass tunnel for more than ten minutes, suddenly entering an open area truly felt like a fisherman accidentally discovering a Peach Blossom Spring.\n\nHowever, what Zhou Ze entered was the restaurant.\n\nA buffet-style layout,\n\nA familiar environment,\n\nIt was the hotel restaurant.\n\n\"Sir, your room card please.\"\n\nA voice sounded beside Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze turned his head to look at her.\n\nIt was a server, but her mouth was above her eyes, and her entire facial features were inverted, giving a very eerie feeling.\n\nZhou Ze didn't move.\n\nThe other party reached out, and a room card appeared from his own person.\n\n\"Hello, enjoy your meal,\" the server smiled.\n\nThis smile was the most unsettling smile Zhou Ze had ever seen in his life. Picasso probably couldn't paint such an effect either.\n\nThe restaurant wasn't very crowded, but as Zhou Ze sat down, more and more guests came in to dine, exactly like the scene from yesterday.\n\nThe only difference was that yesterday Zhou Ze was an observer, this time, he was in the game.\n\nHe didn't go to get food, just sat down in the same spot as yesterday. If this was the case, Zhou Ze really wanted to look forward to seeing if Xu Qinglang and the old Taoist priest would also come through the hot spring pool.\n\nHe didn't wait for Xu Qinglang and the old Taoist priest, but Zhou Ze first saw the family of three. They also sat down in the same spot as yesterday, with the little girl sitting first, and her parents going to get food.\n\nThen,\n\nThe headless family of three collectively stared blankly at the dazzling array of food in front of them.\n\n\"Hi, hello again,\" Zhou Ze said, with a hint of gallows humor.\n\nHowever,\n\nThe family of three, who had been unable to communicate before, suddenly all turned their bodies toward Zhou Ze.\n\nThey had no heads,\n\nSo logically, they couldn't speak, especially since they couldn't eat,\n\nBut they made a sound, collectively,\n\nThough it was just one simple word:\n\n\"Hi.\"\n\n------\n\nPS: Starting today, Long will be participating in a \"Network Writer\" grassroots charity event, going to poverty-stricken mountain areas. It's estimated to take over a week. Long will try his best to ensure updates;\n\nOf course, if there are unexpected circumstances preventing timely updates, Long will post a single chapter to inform everyone in advance.\n\nDon't panic,\n\nHold onto Long!",

    "content": "That \"Hi\" carried a great deal of dark humor.\n\nPeople often assume that ghosts are filled with immense resentment and a hysterical, profound sense of bitterness; this is a common preconceived notion.\n\nZhou Ze used to think so too, until he himself became a ghost.\n\nHow much difference is there, really, between ghosts and humans?\n\nIn terms of malevolence,\nHumans fear the terror of ghosts, ghosts know the venom of human hearts;\nIn other aspects,\nGhosts originate from humans, and in many ways, whether in personality or senses, they actually have a deep sense of identification with humans.\n\nThe only difference might be that ghosts, most of the time, resemble the extreme character of \"desperadoes\" or \"fugitives.\" It's hard for them to linger in the human world for too long. Even if there are some accidental circumstances where they don't descend to hell, and the *guichai* haven't discovered them yet, residing in the human world is more like a rat hiding in a sewer.\n\nHumans fear ghosts, but in this world, there are too many things that can harm and subdue ghosts.\n\nFor example, an old Daoist priest's crotch.\n\nZhou Ze reached up, touched his head, and yawned. The suppression of the whole night before seemed to have dissipated quite a bit now. For someone who had already walked the Yellow Springs Road, there was nothing left to be hung up about.\n\nTo go back, to return to his own body, to his original life—of course, that was his desire.\n\nBut for now, without a way to achieve that, there was no need to be overly anxious or troubled.\n\n\"Can you tell me now, who killed you?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nThe family of three was still looking at him,\nThen,\nSilence.\n\nThe feeling of being \"stared at\" by three headless people was truly unsettling.\n\nEven Boss Zhou was a bit uncomfortable now.\n\n*Ding-dong*...\n\nNext to Zhou Ze, there was the crisp sound of a spoon hitting a plate. Zhou Ze turned around and saw a beautiful young girl sitting beside him, seemingly about to start her meal.\n\nThe girl turned her head and glanced at Zhou Ze—oh no, she was actually looking at the family of three over there, giving them a gentle nod.\n\nWell,\nZhou Ze felt a bit sad and weary.\nIt turned out she was greeting someone else through him, and he had misunderstood. That was indeed quite awkward.\n\nThen,\nThe family of three sat up straight again, staring blankly at the food in front of them.\n\nThe girl, meanwhile, ate unhurriedly. She ate very elegantly; it wasn't a constrained or overly prim way of eating. In fact, she ate quickly, but it conveyed a unique kind of grace.\n\nZhou Ze just watched the young lady eat.\n\nFortunately, the old Daoist priest and Old Xu were still anxious about Zhou Ze not waking up, and hadn't thought to come back through the hot spring pool to check. Otherwise, if they had seen Zhou Ze staring intently at the eating girl as if nothing were wrong, they might really have fallen ill from anger.\n\nThe girl finished her meal, drank the last bit of milk from her cup, wiped her mouth with a tissue, and then stood up, seemingly preparing to leave.\n\nZhou Ze also stood up and followed her, like a loitering pervert.\n\nIt wasn't that Zhou Ze was interested in her in any particular way. In this environment and state, Boss Zhou wasn't so despairing as to stoop to that level. It was because, in Zhou Ze's eyes, this girl was very different from the other people in the restaurant.\n\nWhile the other diners in the restaurant could eat, their movements felt no different from the headless family of three.\nNumb,\nLifeless,\nWith a musty scent like an old woman's bound feet.\n\nBut this girl radiated a sense of life. She seemed to possess a higher degree of... freedom in this environment, just like him.\n\nZhou Ze followed her out of the restaurant. To his surprise, he and she were walking along a glass passageway.\n\nIt was like a beehive, intricate and complex, with each bee having its own place.\n\nZhou Ze continued to follow behind the girl. The two walked slowly, one after the other.\n\nAs they walked, the girl stopped. She seemed to have only just noticed Zhou Ze.\n\nThe girl turned her head and smiled at Zhou Ze, a very pure smile.\n\n\"Kon'nichiwa.\" (Hello)\n\nThe girl bowed slightly to Zhou Ze.\n\nJapanese?\n\nZhou Ze's first thought was of his own Spider-Man.\n\n\"Hello.\"\n\nZhou Ze responded.\n\nZhou Ze understood such simple Japanese, but he still replied in Chinese.\n\n\"Hello,\" the girl replied again in Chinese.\n\nAfterward, the girl continued to walk forward, and Zhou Ze continued to follow.\n\nThe brief exchange and greeting seemed more like an insignificant interlude, like a pebble thrown into a calm lake, quickly restoring its tranquility after causing a ripple.\n\nThey walked all the way to the lawn outside the room door, where Zhou Ze saw the girl turn in another direction.\n\nSo,\nShe was his neighbor.\n\nThe layout of this hot spring villa hotel was such that a single detached villa was divided into two for use, sharing a single wall.\n\nThis explained why the girl and Zhou Ze's \"walking\" routes were the same. However, at this point, they had to part ways. Zhou Ze also tried walking in the girl's direction but was blocked by a thin layer of glass.\n\nGiving up the struggle, Zhou Ze returned to his room.\n\nHe sat down in the living room, lit a cigarette, then stood up and walked to the picture frame to look. In the mirror, he was still lying on the sofa, Old Daoist priest was dozing beside him, and Xu Qinglang was on the phone, seemingly contacting someone.\n\nZhou Ze guessed he was contacting Bai Yingying at the bookstore, or perhaps the little loli. After all, his unresponsive state in reality, where he couldn't be woken no matter how much they called, was truly incomprehensible and difficult for Old Xu and the others to handle.\n\nThis feeling of being cared for was quite nice. Of course, the feeling of peeping was also quite nice.\n\nZhou Ze stretched, flicked off the cigarette ash. Just then, he heard the sound of the hot spring pool filling up from next door.\n\nThe courtyard was actually divided into two as well, with each side having a hot spring pool. The sound of the water filling was loud enough for the other side to hear.\n\nZhou Ze walked into the courtyard and sat down in a wicker chair.\n\nThis was unavoidable. In the world within the mirror, you were lonely, essentially a prisoner, only allowed to go to the dining hall at specific times along specific routes and then return to your cell.\n\nOf course, he could also peep through the mirror to see what Xu Qinglang and the others were doing in reality. But it wasn't *that kind* of movie where he could just watch the visuals without sound. In this situation, he could only peep but not communicate, only stand by and fret. It was truly boring and only made him increasingly agitated.\n\nNow that he had a neighbor next door, listening to her movements was quite nice. Of course, if this neighbor were a large, burly fat man, Zhou Ze probably wouldn't have been interested.\n\nThe water was soon ready. Zhou Ze heard footsteps, and even the rustling sound of clothes being taken off.\n\nTo only hear and not see was always a defect. And for the sake of not missing any clues, Boss Zhou simply moved his wicker chair against the wall and stood there.\n\nThere was also a thin layer of glass on top of the wall, preventing entry and stopping you from crossing the line. But it couldn't stop you from looking. This thin layer of glass was more like a subtle censor bar, adding a hazy beauty to the image, which was more appreciative... oh no, more *research-worthy* than a simple, crude one.\n\nZhou Ze held a cigarette in one hand and gripped the wall with the other, peering inside.\n\nThe girl had already entered the hot spring pool, and she began to sing, a melancholic Japanese song. Zhou Ze didn't understand the lyrics, but it felt quite good, very pleasant to listen to.\n\nSlowly, Zhou Ze turned around, no longer looking inside, but leaning his back against the wall.\n\nFor some reason, Zhou Ze heard a sense of loneliness in the girl's singing, not the loneliness of an unfaithful wife, but the loneliness of being confined here for a long time.\n\nZhou Ze even thought that perhaps the other people in the restaurant, at first, were just like him: wanting to get out, wanting to question, wanting to do something. But slowly, they were tormented into numbness by this day-after-day prison life, becoming like the family of three.\n\nWould he,\nToo, have this day?\n\n*Whoosh*...\n\nThe girl finished singing and began to wash herself, wiping her body with a bath towel. Zhou Ze could hear the sound of the water, and even the girl's breathing.\n\nBecause the distance was truly too close, both hot spring pools were actually built against the wall, so the girl and Zhou Ze were truly just separated by a wall.\n\n\"What's your name?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nA pervert who had been peeping at someone bathing, brazenly speaking, asking for her name.\n\n\"Tsukino Saori.\"\n\nThe girl replied.\n\nShe had actually noticed Zhou Ze's peeping long ago.\n\n\"And you?\" the girl asked.\n\n\"Xu Qinglang.\"\n\n\"A very pleasant name,\" the girl said.\n\n\"Mm,\" Zhou Ze agreed.\n\n\"Did you also die near here?\" the girl asked again.\n\n\"Die?\"\n\n\"Yes, die.\"\n\n\"Are you already dead?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Haven't you died yet?\" the girl seemed a little confused, then added, \"Or perhaps, Mr. Xu, you just haven't realized that you've actually been dead for a long time?\"\n\n\"I've been dead for a long time, a very, very long time ago,\" Zhou Ze replied. \"Can you tell me how you died?\"\n\n\"I'd rather not answer that question.\" The girl refused.\n\n\"But I really want to know. Anyway, we don't have anything else to do right now, do we?\" Zhou Ze tempted.\n\n\"We can take a bath,\" the girl said very seriously.\n\n\"Take a bath?\"\n\n\"Yes, we can soak in hot springs every day, take baths, and wash every part of our bodies, thoroughly, cleanly.\n\nPeople should be clean, no matter when, no matter what the situation, they must be clean, and it's essential to be clean.\"\n\nAs a man with a cleanliness obsession, Zhou Ze actually felt some resonance upon hearing the girl's words.\n\nThe girl truly stopped chatting with Zhou Ze. She began to seriously scrub her body, that is, to clean herself.\n\nZhou Ze felt she was washing excessively clean. He could clearly hear the sound of the bath towel vigorously rubbing against her skin. It must have, hurt, right?\n\nA moment later,\nThe girl spoke proactively, \"Mr. Xu, can you do me a favor?\"\n\n\"Speak.\"\n\n\"One of my legs,\nIs in the pool on your side.\nCould you help me,\nWash it clean?\"\n\n————————\n\nThere was a small earthquake in Sichuan, which made the original route impassable, so we had to take a detour. Therefore, for most of this time, Long could only be on the bus. Today, we visited and comforted two primary schools in Liangshan, then rode the bus from afternoon until evening to reach the hotel. As a result, this week's updates can only be squeezed out of time, as it's really impossible to type on a laptop on the bumpy mountain roads.\n\nThis is the first update, there will be a second one shortly.",

    "content": "The Bookstore was as deserted as ever. Of course, if it ever became lively, that would truly be a ghost sighting.\n\nAfter receiving a call from Xu Qinglang, Bai Yingying immediately changed her clothes. As she locked the store door, preparing to leave, she saw Spider-Man sitting alone inside. She frowned slightly, then reopened the door and walked back in, speaking to the silent Spider-Man:\n\n\"Hey, the boss is in trouble. Come with me to help him.\"\n\nSpider-Man looked up at Bai Yingying, then silently stood up. He only listened to Zhou Ze, but that didn't mean he had no intelligence whatsoever.\n\nTaking him out of the store, Bai Yingying locked the door. Just then, a taxi drove up, and the little loli was sitting in the front passenger seat.\n\nAfter Bai Yingying and Spider-Man got into the car, the driver looked at the passengers and smiled, saying:\n\n\"You're like... what are they called? Oh, cosplay enthusiasts, right?\"\n\nBai Yingying didn't answer.\nThe little loli didn't answer.\nThe Priest couldn't possibly answer.\n\nThe driver was awkward, and then suddenly felt very cold in his car. He looked down and saw the air conditioning wasn't on.\n\n\"Let's go, driver, to General's Mountain,\" the little loli urged.\n\nShe was in a very bad mood because Zhou Ze was constantly getting into and causing trouble. She just hoped Zhou Ze could steadily rack up achievements and become a patrol inspector, and then she would be free.\n\nIn fact, she had always thought Zhou Ze was someone who knew his place, whether before or after she was subdued by him. The little loli maintained this view.\n\nBecause he was so lazy, practically indistinguishable from a salted fish, but how could this salted fish get into so much trouble?\n\nFirst, the Prefect's ID, then Lady Qingyi, followed by the Book of Yin and Yang, then the Priest, and now, he'd gone to General's Mountain and gotten himself \"unconscious.\"\n\nThe little loli took a deep breath. Dealing with a bailiff like this was really troublesome.\n\n\"Is there a way to solve the boss's problem?\" Bai Yingying asked the little loli.\n\nThe little loli smiled. \"I just received a call. That noodle shop guy is only a half-baked mystic. His description can't provide much valuable information. I need to go to the scene to make a conclusion, but one thing is certain: a person like your boss, without you and without a freezer, he can't even sleep, so how could he be in an unconscious state? Especially without any external injuries.\"\n\nBai Yingying frowned slightly upon hearing this, saying, \"No matter what, we have to wake the boss up.\"\n\n\"I'll do my best,\" the little loli pouted.\n\n\"If the boss doesn't wake up, you'll be buried with him.\"\n\nUpon hearing this, the little loli's expression hardened. She whispered, \"At this point, threatening me is pointless.\"\n\nThe driver listened to a little girl and a young woman bickering. Although he couldn't understand what they were saying, he found it quite interesting. He wanted to interject, but it seemed he wasn't part of the cosplay crowd, so it was hard to find common ground.\n\nHowever, the driver found an opening. \"Are you going to General's Mountain for tourism? I heard there was a murder case there recently.\"\n\nThe little loli was silent.\nBai Yingying was silent.\nThe Priest continued to be silent.\n\nThe driver felt even colder, so cold he didn't even want to drive. His feet started trembling.\n\nThis was normal, considering the driver hit the jackpot today, picking up three passengers: one a ghost messenger, one a zombie, and one also a corpse. How could it not be cold?\n\nAn average taxi driver would be spooked if they drove to a funeral home or cemetery at night and saw a blurry white shadow in the distance. But he'd hit the grand slam, achieving the peak accomplishment of \"taxi driver sees ghosts!\"\n\n\"General's Mountain, what a great place. Do you know the origin of General's Mountain?\" The driver still wanted to talk. He had to talk; he was freezing and puffing out breaths.\n\n\"What's its origin?\" Bai Yingying asked.\n\nPerhaps because Bai Yingying initiated the conversation, and she deliberately reined in her malevolent aura, the driver suddenly felt the temperature rise. It wasn't Bai Yingying's fault; she only \"ooh-ooh-oohed\" for Zhou Ze. When facing others, she was truly icy cold. Especially after the boss got into trouble, Yingying wasn't in a good mood either.\n\n\"Cao Ding, do you know him?\" the driver asked.\n\n\"Who is he?\" Bai Yingying asked.\n\n\"A famous general who fought against Japanese pirates. Of course, he couldn't compare to Qi Jiguang, but he was still very formidable. He was a local from Tongcheng. During the Jiajing era of the Ming Dynasty, the Japanese pirates were causing a lot of trouble, and our Tongcheng is near the mouth of the Yangtze River, so many pirates came here. He led his troops to repel the pirates several times, but he died heroically in battle at the age of forty-four.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Bai Yingying nodded.\n\nThe little loli, however, suddenly became interested. \"What's the connection between General's Mountain and Cao Ding?\"\n\n\"It's named after him. There's also a scenic spot on General's Mountain called Wako Tomb, which is dedicated to him. At that time, the Japanese pirates were burning, killing, and looting their way here. Cao Ding defeated them and pursued them to General's Mountain, where an accident happened, and he sacrificed himself. Originally, General's Mountain wasn't called that, and Cao Ding's official rank wasn't high, but the people of Tongcheng were very grateful to him, so they called that mountain General's Mountain, and it has remained so ever since.\"\n\nThe little loli licked her lips, deep in thought.\n\nAbout an hour later, the car finally reached the foot of General's Mountain. The little loli paid and got out first.\n\nWhen Bai Yingying got out of the car, she saw the little loli with her hands behind her back, looking up towards the mountaintop, acting like a little adult.\n\n\"See anything?\" Bai Yingying asked.\n\n\"The problem is I didn't see anything,\" the little loli frowned. \"That's the strangest part, because that guy surnamed Xu said they saw ghosts, and many of them, at the hot spring hotel on the mountaintop, but it's very calm here, not a trace of malevolent aura.\n\nI think your boss must be as confused as I am. There are clearly ghosts, yet it's calm.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Didn't you hear what the driver said earlier? This is where heroic souls sacrificed themselves. They've received generations of incense offerings from the local people. In this place, even if evil spirits appear, they will be suppressed heavily. Even you and I will feel some suppression.\"\n\n\"Then the boss, he...?\"\n\n\"Probably not. Although your boss is a ghost, he shouldn't be directly targeted. Moreover, five hundred years have passed since the Jiajing era. Even the most powerful heroic souls can't sustain themselves for that long. People are always forgetful.\"\n\n\"Let's go to the hotel first and see what's wrong with the boss.\"\n\nBai Yingying said, then walked directly up the mountain.\n\nThe little loli followed behind, and the Priest walked last.\n\nHowever, as they walked, the Priest suddenly stopped. His slightly hunched body slowly straightened, and a faint green light emerged from the head covering over his eyes.\n\nThe little loli turned her head to look at the Priest, somewhat worriedly asking, \"He won't lose control, will he?\"\n\nBai Yingying shook her head firmly, saying, \"Impossible. He's not his old self. You're not a zombie, so you don't understand that feeling we zombies have.\n\nI can tell you with absolute certainty that in this life, he will never betray the boss.\"\n\nThe Priest's gaze darted around, as if searching for something, or as if something was calling to him.\n\nMeanwhile, Bai Yingying and the little loli felt nothing at all.\n\n\"Is something there?\" Bai Yingying asked the Priest.\n\nThe Priest looked bewildered, spreading his hands as if not knowing how to describe it. Since Zhou Ze brought him back to the Bookstore, he hadn't said a single word.\n\nCommunicating with Zhou Ze was simple for him, but communicating with others was very difficult.\n\n\"What exactly is wrong?\" Bai Yingying pressed.\n\nThe Priest remained bewildered, but he mechanically bent down and picked up two stones, one large and one small.\n\nThe small stone was placed on top of the large stone.\n\nThen, the Priest reached out and squeezed the small stone on top.\n\nWith a \"snap,\" the small stone instantly pulverized.\n\nThe debris slowly slipped through the Priest's fingertips.\n\nThen, he looked at Bai Yingying and the little loli, as if to see if they had understood.\n\n\"Oh...\" The little loli opened her mouth, making a sound.\n\n\"What does that mean?\" Bai Yingying looked at the little loli.\n\n\"Oh... I didn't get it either,\" said the little loli.\n\n\"...\" Bai Yingying.\n\nThe Priest scratched his head, seemingly thinking about how to express himself.\n\n\"Forget it, let's go find your boss first,\" the little loli said, not wanting to waste any more time. She turned and walked up the mountain. Bai Yingying glanced at the Priest and followed.\n\nThe Priest, still bewildered, continued to follow behind them.\n\nThe Priest walked steadily, but with every step, he left a footprint below. At the same time, he unconsciously shook his head, like an ox trying to shoo away annoying flies.\n\n...\n\n\"Hey, I've wiped this leg clean for you. Not bad, a leg for years of enjoyment.\"\n\nZhou Ze held the girl's leg, waving it towards the wall.\n\nEarlier, the old Taoist priest had retrieved a leg from the pool water in the hot spring illusion. It was the very same leg Zhou Ze now held.\n\n\"Do you want to play with it?\" the girl next door asked.\n\n\"Sorry, I was just joking. After all, we're both dead, there's no joke we can't take.\"\n\n\"I'm asking you... do you want to play with it?\" the woman pressed again.\n\n\"No.\"\n\nZhou Ze looked at the leg in his hand and refused.\n\nThe moment Zhou Ze refused, hot water, not hot spring water but boiling, bubbling blood, began to surge into Zhou Ze's hot spring pool.\n\nThe blood quickly filled the hot spring pool, like a pot of boiling Chengdu hotpot, fiery and scalding.\n\nIndeed, there were things churning inside as if being cooked.\n\nIt was another leg.\nIt was an arm.\nIt was a torso.\nIt was a neck.\n\nSections of dismembered corpses continuously churned within.\n\nShe had arrived.\nShe had leaped past the glass barrier.\nFrom next door, she had come to Zhou Ze!\n\nFrom within the blood, the head slowly floated up. Her limbs and bones continued to churn around her.\n\nAt the same time, she spoke:\n\n\"Not playing?\"",

    "content": "\"Not playing?\"\n\nFacing the girl's question, Zhou Ze was somewhat speechless. Such matters were usually based on mutual consent or a clear transaction of goods for money. He had never heard of forced buying and selling.\n\nYou're awesome,\nYou can cross the line,\nYou can come from next door into my yard,\nBut no matter how awesome you are,\nEven if I concede ten thousand steps,\nWith you in this state of being torn into pieces, even if I were just feigning refusal earlier, I wouldn't be able to get aroused now even if I wanted to.\n\nBoss Zhou stroked his forehead, feeling a bit melancholic.\n\nBut the girl was clearly filled with immense anger. At this moment, the blood in the hot spring pool actually overflowed, and simultaneously, the girl's originally severed body parts slowly reassembled.\n\nAlright,\nThe body's reassembled,\nIt can be used now.\nIs that what you mean?\nAren't they all the same with the lights off?\nIsn't the most common thing said \"you're lying on my hair?\"\n\nChinese parents always teach their children from a young age that being a picky eater is wrong, and they should think about how many peasant uncles in ancient times toiled hard in the fields only to have no money to marry a wife and end up bachelors.\n\nBoss Zhou wanted to concede. If conceding could solve the trouble in front of him, it was best not to resort to violence. After all, from the woman's perspective, she had been so proactive. As a man, no matter the reason for your prevarication, you would always be looked down upon.\n\nBut looking at the reassembled girl, the previously severed parts of her body were clearly marked with raised bloody seams, surrounded by dense, crimson patterns, like a painting embroidered by Li Kui. It was truly a sight too gruesome to behold, giving the pure impression of a pieced-together doll.\n\nSorry,\nI refuse.\n\nZhou Ze stood in place, watching the girl approach him step by step. His fingernails slowly extended.\n\nThen,\nThe woman drew closer to him.\nThe surrounding blood rushed towards Zhou Ze like boiling water, truly a grand display.\n\nZhou Ze spread his arms, his fingernails sweeping to both sides, directly parting the blood. The girl's body was instantly divided into two halves. The poor girl, like a piece of clay, had just managed to reassemble herself only to be cruelly destroyed by Zhou Ze.\n\nIf I can't do anything about this glass, can't I do anything about you?\n\nThe girl, split into two halves, began to writhe, as if about to rejoin.\n\nZhou Ze said nothing more, continuing to slice with his fingernails, like cutting vegetables, directly re-dividing the girl. Adhering to his principle of not being too much of a beast, Zhou Ze picked up the two halves of the girl's head and turned to walk into the living room.\n\nPerhaps,\nThe girl was also shocked.\nSuch a stunning entrance, such a sharp declaration,\nIn the end,\nShe herself was like a dish served up,\nAnd truly cut by Zhou Ze.\n\nThe girl's head was placed on the coffee table by Zhou Ze. Zhou Ze lit a cigarette. To be honest, with Zhou Ze's current strength and status, dealing with a small female ghost no longer gave him any thrill.\n\nBut there were some questions Zhou Ze needed to ask her, most importantly,\nHow to get out of this damn mirror world.\n\nAfter the two halves of the girl's head were put together, they slowly began to merge. Her body outside the living room also started to re-coalesce. The headless body wandered restlessly outside the living room, as if wanting to come in, but also somewhat hesitant.\n\nAfter the girl's head recovered, it sat squarely on the coffee table, continuing to glare at Zhou Ze, but the anger in her gaze had significantly diminished, replaced by a sense of apprehension.\n\nAs the saying goes, a pitiable person must have something detestable about them. The same applies to ghosts.\n\nBoss Zhou had seen countless ghosts and heard many ghost stories of all kinds. He could somewhat guess the girl's experience before her death.\n\nRaped,\nAnd dismembered,\nFinally trapped here as a soul in the mirror, that should be more or less correct.\n\nShe desperately scrubbed her body, wanting to gain some psychological suggestion and comfort from this action, to make herself feel that her body was still clean.\n\nA pitiable Japanese girl,\nThis kind of pity knows no borders.\n\nBut ghosts are products of extremes. In fact, those who are too detached are not qualified to linger in the human world as ghosts. Those who were \"salted fish\"<sup>1</sup> their whole lives, always laid-back and stoic, and then died, are all obediently queuing up on the Yellow Springs Road.\n\nFrom the perspective of a ghost messenger, the ghosts who can linger in the human world are basically troublemakers, like children in class who don't listen and talk back to the teacher.\n\nTherefore, when the girl directs her anger at you, reasoning with her won't work; she won't listen at all.\n\nLast time, when he encountered the vengeful sea serpent, and in many other incidents, Zhou Ze had indeed come across many resentful and wronged souls. However, if Zhou Ze didn't have his fingernails and wasn't a ghost messenger, he might not have even had the right to pity them, only becoming a sacrifice to their anger.\n\n\"They... I didn't release them. In fact, I don't even know why I was pulled into this place.\"\n\nZhou Ze exhaled a smoke ring towards the girl and continued,\n\n\"I told you, I can help you get revenge, provided you tell me the secret of this place and how to leave this cursed place.\"\n\nThe girl continued to stare at Zhou Ze with hateful eyes. Zhou Ze didn't pay much attention, continuing to smoke.\n\nJust wait.\n\nAbout fifteen minutes later, the headless body of the woman outside slowly sat down. She wrapped her arms around her knees, leaning her back against the floor-to-ceiling window outside the living room, looking very lonely and desolate.\n\nAnd in the girl's eyes, there was no longer the light of anger; instead, a string of tears flowed down.\n\nZhou Ze pulled out a tissue from the coffee table, wiped her tears, and comforted her,\n\n\"Don't cry. You'll ruin your beautiful face if you cry.\nI, Xu Qinglang,\nWill be heartbroken.\"\n\nSo, when doing something shady outside, it's very necessary to use your good friend's name.\n\nLike when peeking at a girl bathing,\nOr when you've just sliced a girl like vegetables but then pretend to wipe her tears,\nOr when a technician gives you a form to rate the \"Ice Water Tenderness\" project at a club and asks for your signature,\nIn these moments,\nLeaving your own name is very unwise.\n\n\"They... they're already gone.\"\n\nThe girl choked out.\n\n\"How many people?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Three, three people.\"\n\n\"Oh.\" Zhou Ze nodded. \"Then how did they die?\"\n\nIf the girl was killed by those three people, then how did those three people die?\n\nIt couldn't be that the killed girl immediately turned into a vengeful ghost and successfully got her revenge, right?\n\nIf she had succeeded in her revenge, she wouldn't still harbor such immense resentment.\n\n\"They were chosen by the devil.\" A hint of confusion flashed in the girl's eyes. \"They were chosen by the devil...\"\n\n\"You can be more specific. We're not writing poetry,\" Zhou Ze reminded her.\n\n\"It's the devil, it's the devil, it's the devil!!!\"\n\n\"Alright, it's the devil, it's the devil,\" Zhou Ze said, somewhat resigned. \"Anything else? It's best if you tell me everything you encountered from the time of your incident and afterward in detail.\"\n\nZhou Ze reached out and rummaged, pulling out his ghost messenger badge, and waved it in front of the girl,\n\n\"You can think of me as a police officer.\"\n\nThe girl's gaze began to scan her surroundings.\n\nZhou Ze also looked around and asked, \"What's wrong?\"\n\n\"This place is enveloped by mirrors, and mirrors can not only reflect the present but also remember the past.\"\n\n\"How can I see it?\"\n\nTears continued to drip from the corner of the girl's eyes, but this time, the tears evaporated in mid-air before falling, creating a hazy, colorful halo, and even the surrounding glass reflected an unusual light.\n\nThis felt like being in a movie theater; everything around them seemed to be covered in a fresh layer of white dust, tinted with an unreal haziness.\n\nWhat surprised Zhou Ze most was that he could actually hear sounds. The mirrors here didn't just record images.\n\nOn the sofa in front of Zhou Ze sat a man with a buzz cut, under thirty, smoking a cigarette with his feet propped up on the coffee table.\n\nThis was an image, recording past events.\n\n\"Clang!\"\n\nThe door was heavily shut.\n\nTwo more men walked in. These two looked younger, perhaps in their mid-twenties. They were carrying two large plastic bags. One wore a baseball cap, and the other had long hair, giving off an artistic vibe.\n\nThe baseball cap man and the long-haired man sat opposite the buzz-cut man. Both put their bags beside them.\n\nThe baseball cap man pointed at the buzz-cut man, who was smoking in silence, and said to the long-haired man beside him with a laugh,\n\n\"What did I tell you? His home team lost today. He's definitely in a bad mood and getting angry by himself, hahaha...\"\n\n\"Laugh your ass off, just keep laughing!\nWe could've won against Jiangsu today, damn it!\nTheir Jinling home field was just cursed today. We hit the goalpost several times, and they just took a casual swing and it went in. It's infuriating.\"\n\nThe buzz-cut man directly cursed at the baseball cap man. Clearly, he was indeed in a very bad mood.\n\n\"It's just that the team lost. What's the big deal? Real Madrid and Barcelona lose too, don't they?\"\n\nThe baseball cap man said indifferently. Then, he opened his bag. \"Come on, let's have our party. I brought the drinks too.\"\n\nInside the bag were clothes, which the baseball cap man took out and handed a set to the buzz-cut man opposite him.\n\nThe buzz-cut man took the clothes, and all three began to change.\n\nThese three sets of clothes were Japanese military uniforms. Having been subjected to various anti-Japanese war films, Chinese people were simply too familiar with these uniforms.\n\nThe buzz-cut man adjusted his collar, looked in the mirror, and seemed very satisfied. Then, as if something occurred to him, he said directly,\n\n\"Damn it, you guys,\nIf the Japanese had killed more people in Jinling back then, killed all those idiots, wouldn't my team have won today?\nIt's best if everyone in Jinling was killed and there were no more teams there. I wouldn't be in such a bad mood today. I was supposed to have a good time at the party with you guys.\"\n\nThe long-haired man nodded and said,\n\n\"Exactly! If it weren't for those sneaky Americans back then, we would already be Japanese citizens. Now we still have to be with these Zi-<sup>2</sup>-na bastards,\nJust thinking about studying with them before and having to work with them now makes me sick.\"\n\n***\n<sup>1</sup> \"Salted fish\" (咸鱼 - xiányú) is a Chinese slang term describing someone who is listless, unmotivated, and content with mediocrity.\n<sup>2</sup> \"Zi-\" is a partial phonetic translation of \"支那\" (Zhīnà), a derogatory term for China. The speaker uses a more offensive variant (\"支那逼\" - Zhīnàbī). The original text uses \"支、、、那逼\" with ellipses, indicating a self-censorship or hesitation in fully writing out the slur, which is reflected here by only partially translating the phonetic sound and the accompanying ellipses.",

    "content": "Zhou Ze stood to the side, as if watching a stage play, the actors utterly absorbed in their roles, completely oblivious to whether or not an audience was watching their performance.\n\nIn fact, they really were very self-absorbed.\n\nMusic played, a Japanese song with a strong rhythm.\n\nThen the three men, dressed in Japanese military uniforms, began to dance, brandishing imitation samurai swords, presumably ordered from Taobao, swirling to the beat while humming along, like they were celebrating and cosplaying.\n\n\"What song is this?\" Zhou Ze asked the girl's head beside him, as he really didn't understand Japanese well.\n\n\"'Batto Tai,' it's a type of Japanese Army song,\" the girl replied.\n\n\"Oh, I thought it was an Ultraman theme song.\"\n\nThe three guys were having a blast, clearly fully immersed, quite self-forgetful.\n\nActually, they looked pretty idiotic. These three guys weren't Japanese, but genuine Chinese, which he'd already deduced from their accents and what they said earlier.\n\nYet they were so focused and invested now, as if performing some noble ritual, which made one think of the idiom, \"a monkey crowned with a hat.\"*\n\nLiking their manga, action films, songs, movie stars, and so on, none of that mattered and was perfectly normal. Even having a fondness for a certain country was everyone's freedom. But the words and actions of these three clearly went beyond that feeling.\n\nEspecially uttering words like hoping the Japanese had been more thorough with the Nanjing Massacre, simply because of a soccer game's outcome, was an unforgivable crime.\n\nThat contempt for their own identity, that yearning for a foreign identity, made Zhou Ze uncomfortable. He had once experienced Sanxiang Village, where even after death, the villagers still endured immense hunger pains, yet stubbornly guarded their \"military provisions.\"\n\nThe actions of the dead and the living formed a stark contrast.\n\nJust then, Zhou Ze heard a woman's voice, asking a question in Japanese.\n\nThe voice sounded a little familiar.\n\nZhou Ze looked at the girl's head.\n\n\"At the time... I thought the neighbors were also Japanese, so I... voluntarily greeted them,\" the girl said, gritting her teeth.\n\n\"Tsk tsk.\" Zhou Ze shook his head. Did she just walk right into it?\n\nThe three men, who were dancing as if marching, stopped immediately upon hearing the woman next door greet them in Japanese. They then went outside the living room to talk to her. They couldn't speak Japanese, which was ridiculous. They yearned to be Japanese but hadn't even learned the language.\n\nBut in the end, when the long-haired man opened the door, the girl was standing there.\n\nFor the girl, it was probably like meeting a familiar face in a foreign land. After all, being in a foreign country, and having a compatriot next door, would always bring an irresistible urge to connect.\n\nThe girl was invited to join their gathering, and she even performed a Japanese song. Although the three men didn't understand Japanese, they fully conveyed the look of \"impressed despite not understanding.\"\n\nAfterwards, everyone started drinking.\n\nThen, the buzz-cut guy started getting handsy. The girl had been drinking, but she was still somewhat sober. She immediately stood up to refuse and said in Chinese that she was going back to her room.\n\nAs the story progressed to this point, Zhou Ze turned his head and asked the girl's head, \"You must have realized they weren't Japanese much earlier, right?\"\n\n\"I thought they admired Japanese culture, so I...\"\n\nHearing this explanation, Zhou Ze found it quite amusing. When he fought with the priest earlier, the priest had ironically remarked that Chinese people loved hearing foreigners speak Chinese, gaining immense inner satisfaction from it.\n\nThe rest of the story was simple. The girl resisted, and the men forced themselves on her. All three of them forced themselves on her. Since all three were drunk, the final scene was a mix of the girl's muffled sobs and struggles after her mouth was gagged with a towel.\n\nAfter it was over, the girl lay on the floor, her eyes vacant, her body contorted, while the three men were like Japanese soldiers in that era who would regularly be issued comfort station tickets, finishing their release and clocking out.\n\nDuring that period, the Japanese set up many comfort stations in areas where they had troops stationed, forcing women from various countries into them to be brutalized. In Japanese military camps, this was like an amateur activity such as watching movies, with the number of movie tickets issued each month varying according to rank.\n\nAt this point, Zhou Ze narrowed his eyes, as if the climax was about to begin.\n\nThe girl was eventually dismembered.\n\nDid these three men kill her to silence her?\n\nBut even if they wanted to silence her, would they go to such an extreme as dismemberment?\n\nThe reason was simple: dismembering and disposing of a body in a hotel would be very difficult to do without leaving traces. If they merely wanted to cut off the roots, there was no need to do it in such a manner.\n\nZhou Ze continued to watch from the side; the answer would come out soon enough.\n\nThe three men seemed to have sobered up, and looking at the Japanese girl lying on the ground, almost unconscious, fear showed on their faces.\n\nIndeed, generally speaking, people who enjoy online regional attacks or are \"Japan-worshippers\" are usually quite cowardly in their social lives, typically insignificant small fry. That's why they desperately hope to find another distorted sense of satisfaction for their failed lives elsewhere.\n\nThe three men were clearly panicking. The long-haired man even ran over, apologizing repeatedly, hoping the girl would forgive him and not call the police.\n\nThe other two, the buzz-cut and the cap-wearing guy, were also somewhat flustered.\n\nBut just then, on the floor beneath their feet, three shadows suddenly appeared. These three shadows appeared strangely, with no prior warning, then silently merged with the men's shadows, becoming indistinguishable.\n\nAnd in the eyes of the three men, a hint of bloody light slowly emerged.\n\nNext was the most brutal and difficult to watch scene.\n\nThe girl was dismembered, her body laid out like a sacrifice on the edge of the hot spring pool, and then the three men actually knelt down facing the hot spring pool.\n\nThey began chanting what sounded like incantations or prayers, this time in perfectly pure Japanese.\n\nThey were possessed!\n\nAnd their nests had been usurped!\n\nAs someone who had returned from a borrowed corpse, Zhou Ze was actually quite familiar with this scene.\n\nThe girl's head, upon hearing the words spoken by the three men, appeared to be in great pain. Her headless body ran from the courtyard into the living room, reaching up to cover her ears.\n\nThis posture was very strange.\n\nThe headless body stood to the side, reaching up to cover its ears, while its head rested on the coffee table.\n\nIt was imaginable that the sound of these Japanese chants was a great torment and torture for the girl.\n\n*Whoosh*...\n\nThe surrounding scene began to distort,\n\nand then gradually dissipated.\n\nZhou Ze only remembered the final image: it was a ritual, seemingly to summon something, and the bodies of the three men slowly shriveled into husks, finally turning into pus that soaked into the pebbles in the courtyard. The girl's body was likewise, completely dissolving into the hot spring pool, like food boiled away.\n\nAfterwards, Zhou Ze walked over to the girl and asked, \"When did you die?\"\n\n\"A year ago,\" the girl replied.\n\n\"You've been here since you died?\" Zhou Ze asked again.\n\n\"Yes, I've been here since I died, and they were next door to me. I couldn't get out. All I could do was look through the mirror and see the activities of the guests who moved in later. Then, I noticed the restaurant getting more and more crowded. Some of the dead nearby, their souls would gravitate here, move in, and then dine in the restaurant punctually.\"\n\n\"Then why didn't you go find them for revenge before?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Because I couldn't get through before. Now I can, because they've left, and something is about to awaken.\"\n\nZhou Ze was silent for a moment, then continued, \"What exactly is that 'something'?\"\n\n\"I don't know, I really don't know,\" the girl replied.\n\n\"Then one last question, not long ago, was there a family of three, parents with a girl about five years old, who stayed here?\"\n\n\"Yes, they stayed here.\" The girl looked at Zhou Ze, somewhat bewildered, and said, \"When they were here, I heard those three men say that this family of three would be the best sacrifice.\n\nThen a few days later, I saw that family of three dining in the restaurant. They were... headless.\"\n\n\"Were they killed by those three men? But they're already dead, aren't they? Without physical bodies, sealed in the mirror like you, they shouldn't be able to get out.\n\nAlso,\n\nwhat did those three men want with their heads?\"\n\n\"They were probably trying to awaken themselves,\" the girl replied. \"I've heard many of their conversations. They all spoke in Japanese. They yearned to regain their freedom, to be released from someone's suppression.\"\n\n\"Suppression?\"\n\n\"Yes, they're different from me. Those three are different from the other souls who gathered here later. They have greater freedom. In fact, if they wished, they could even enter my room at any time, but they weren't interested in that. They were always waiting for an opportunity, a suitable opportunity.\"\n\nZhou Ze sat down on the sofa.\n\nThis case, originally about a family of three being murdered, had now unearthed far too many things.\n\nThe incident began a year ago.\n\nThree idiotic Japan-worshippers held a gathering here, which attracted a Japanese girl visiting China from next door. Then these three Japan-worshippers became aroused. After all, they dreamed of being Japanese, so they truly couldn't resist a Japanese girl who presented herself.\n\nPerhaps their malice was perceived during the \"crime,\" or maybe their wearing Japanese military uniforms and singing Japanese songs produced an effect similar to a \"planchette session.\"\n\nIn any case, three Japanese ghosts, originally suppressed here by some unknown entity, were summoned, possessed them, and simultaneously, this poor Japanese girl was dismembered and sacrificed by her own compatriots.\n\nThose three Japan-worshippers also died. This was their first step towards freedom, transitioning from a state of suppression to souls sealed in mirrors. While seemingly all sealed and confined, they should have gained more freedom than before.\n\nThey must have been waiting for the appearance of the next round of sacrifices, which was the family of three. So, that family of three must have met a terrible end, allowing them to gain a further degree of freedom.\n\nWhat angered Zhou Ze was that he himself was the key for those three Japanese ghosts to gain even greater freedom.\n\nThat ghostly phone call lured him here, then he would take their place in prison, allowing them \"complete freedom\"!\n\nHe was clearly the hunter, yet he was ensnared by what should have been his prey, and he walked right into it.\n\nBut how did these three Japanese ghosts come to be?\n\nZhou Ze could sense that those three souls, whether in terms of their power or methods, were not comparable to ordinary souls. This wasn't Zhou Ze trying to explain away falling into a trap; it was because Zhou Ze, as a Soul Ferryman, couldn't even perform that kind of sacrificial ritual. He even believed that Little Loli, an experienced Soul Ferryman, probably couldn't either.\n\nThree souls, more professional than Soul Ferrymen?\n\n\"Oh, right.\" The girl suddenly seemed to remember something and said, \"Throughout this past year, I often heard them curse a person. I don't know who that person is, but it's probably largely related to their suppression.\"\n\n\"What's that person's name?\" Zhou Ze looked up and asked.\n\n\"Cao Ding.\"\n\n___\n*沐猴而冠 (mù hóu ér guàn) - Literally \"monkey wearing a hat.\" An idiom used to describe someone who, despite appearing important or dignified, is actually still uncivilized, foolish, or not truly qualified for their position; putting on airs without substance.",

    "content": "Zhou Ze knew who Cao Ding was. After all, the little loli was a late bloomer, having taken up residence in the body of little girl Wang Rui. Zhou Ze didn't know where she was from or when she died, and he didn't bother to ask, but he guessed she wasn't a local.\n\nAs for Bai Yingying, she was a naive soul who had been lying in a coffin for two hundred years. Her conversations with Mrs. Bai usually revolved around typical girlish chatter. Have you ever seen a girlfriends' gathering where they start discussing patriotic sentiments?\n\nSo, neither of them were truly local Tongcheng people. But Zhou Ze, having lived two lives, was always a Tongcheng native. Cao Ding was quite famous in Tongcheng; of course, the most renowned figure in Tongcheng was Zhang Jian, who drafted the Qing Emperor's abdication edict. After him, Cao Ding could be counted among the top ten.\n\nHe was an anti-Wokou hero, though his official position and fame weren't particularly high. Zhou Ze only knew this much, having long forgotten the specifics. He only remembered that Cao Ding was a figure from the mid-Ming Dynasty, a time when the Wokou were at their most rampant. The coastal areas were plagued by Wokou, and the government forces were useless, often collapsing at the first encounter. It wasn't until generals like Qi Jiguang gradually emerged that the Wokou threat slowly subsided.\n\nIn other words, for a long period, the Ming Dynasty's official army was basically at the level of \"five-combat-scum,\"* much like the early stages of the Anti-Japanese War, when the Japanese army swept through almost unopposed. Therefore, generals who dared to go against the current during that time were particularly rare and valuable. Because at that point, there was practically no hope of winning, which truly embodied the spirit of \"though a million men oppose me, I shall go forth.\"\n\nSince those three Japanese ghosts hated Cao Ding, Zhou Ze could only boldly speculate that the identities of those three ghosts might also be \"five-hundred-year-aged\"?\n\nThis speculation was terrifying, making Zhou Ze ponder it carefully.\n\nMost importantly, the heroic spirit had suppressed these ghostlings here for so many years. What if he ended up falling into a trap and releasing them instead? His sin would be immense. If those three scoundrels were released and caused trouble in Tongcheng or nearby areas, would that karma eventually fall on him?\n\nBoss Zhou never denied being a lazy loafer who feared trouble, usually adopting a \"less is more\" attitude to muddle through life. But he wouldn't just accidentally open Pandora's Box and then shrug it off to go back to sleep.\n\n\"How do we get out?\"\n\nZhou Ze asked the most crucial question. Of course, Zhou Ze knew that the Japanese girl in front of him probably didn't know how to get out either.\n\nThis place was like a special container. Zhou Ze guessed it was likely due to the unique environment of General Mountain. Cao Ding's heroic spirit had suppressed these Wokou for five hundred years. It was originally a first-level prison, but the Wokou's lingering spirits began to play \"Count of Monte Cristo\"-style escape.\n\nNot a single-stroke escape, but a continuous increase in their freedom, similar to moving themselves from the deepest, most strictly guarded cells of the prison to the outermost, least guarded cells.\n\nThis was somewhat like a compromise, which created this hybrid place. In this mirror world, the lingering spirits couldn't significantly interfere with the outside world; this was already the final layer of restriction.\n\nThe Japanese girl shook her head. She had already put her head back on her neck.\n\nShe didn't know how to get out. If she did, she would have gone out for revenge long ago; why wait until now?\n\nZhou Ze felt a bit helpless and took out his phone. The phone still had no signal, but Zhou Ze remembered something: those three Japanese ghosts had been able to call him here and play a \"ghost call\" trick. Could he do the same?\n\nHe tried calling Xu Qinglang. The phone kept ringing; it actually connected.\n\nZhou Ze, somewhat surprised, walked over to the painting frame and looked at Xu Qinglang's situation inside.\n\nHis call kept ringing, and the \"beep... beep...\" sound came from the other end, but in his eyes, Xu Qinglang had no intention of answering the phone.\n\nIt connected, but there was no response from the other side?\n\nZhou Ze couldn't hear the sounds from inside, nor did he know if Xu Qinglang's phone was ringing, but it was highly likely that the phone on that end wasn't reacting.\n\nZhou Ze also tried calling Bai Yingying and the little loli, but they all connected, and no one answered.\n\n...\n\nWhile Zhou Ze was trying to make calls, Bai Yingying, the little loli, and others had already entered the hotel and knocked on the door.\n\nXu Qinglang opened the door, looking somewhat haggard, truly like a wife worn out from caring for her sick husband.\n\nThis was indeed the case. He remembered that night Xu Qinglang was still sleeping when the old Daoist priest screamed and peed blood, and then Zhou Ze lay unconscious on the ground. From that moment until now, Xu Qinglang had been like an ant on a hot griddle, never getting a moment's rest.\n\nBai Yingying immediately found her unconscious boss lying on the sofa, knelt by the sofa, took his hand, and kept calling for him to wake up quickly and not abandon Yingying.\n\nEveryone around unconsciously twitched their mouths at this scene.\n\nPlease,\n\nZhou Ze wasn't dead yet,\n\nYou're exaggerating a bit too much, exactly like an ancient aristocratic family's concubine, who, after crying at the funeral, would pack her belongings and prepare to run away.\n\nThe little loli seemed much calmer. From her perspective, she seemed more concerned with whether Zhou Ze was conscious right now. If he was consciously unconscious, then her life was still in his hands. If he was completely unconscious,\n\nThen would she be free if she killed him now?\n\nOf course, the little loli only thought about it, just like men walking on the street unconsciously fantasize about the curvaceous beauties they see. She didn't dare to do it, nor did she dare to gamble.\n\nFinally, the little loli walked to Zhou Ze's side and examined his condition.\n\nThe old Daoist priest next to her began to recount in detail what had happened these past few days.\n\n\"How is he?\" Bai Yingying asked the little loli.\n\n\"His soul is still here,\" the little loli frowned, \"but it's incomplete.\"\n\n\"Incomplete?\"\n\nThe little loli looked around, as if searching for something.\n\n\"Yes, it's incomplete, so he can't wake up.\"\n\nThe old Daoist priest on the side heard this and said, \"I seem to remember a villain in 'Investiture of the Gods' who had a magic treasure that could take away part of a person's soul.\"\n\nThe little loli ignored the old Daoist priest's words and had no time to discuss \"Investiture of the Gods\" with him. She began to walk around the room, especially after seeing the shattered glass in the bathroom, her gaze turned more towards reflective objects.\n\nFinally, the little loli even stood in front of the \"Eight Steeds\" painting frame in the living room, looking into the mirror frame.\n\n...\n\nFrom Zhou Ze's perspective, the little loli was now more like she was looking at him directly, but she shouldn't be able to see inside. This was enough to show the little loli's superior skill and insight compared to those around her.\n\nOld Xu and the old Daoist priest had been trying to figure out how to wake up the unconscious Zhou Ze, but they never thought that Zhou Ze was actually right beside them, just trapped.\n\n\"Can she see you?\" the Japanese girl beside him asked.\n\n\"Given enough time, she should be able to figure it out.\" Zhou Ze continued to look at his phone. In fact, the problem was quite awkward now: even if the little loli was given more time, and even if she could confirm that he was in the mirror,\n\nHow was he supposed to get out?\n\nThere must be a way out, Zhou Ze believed. It was like facing a complex game, but you needed enough time to play through it, at least countless failures and exploratory experiences. However, Zhou Ze didn't have that much time now, considering those three Japanese ghosts had been here for a year, and most importantly, they might have been playing this game for five hundred years!\n\n\"Crack...\"\n\nThe sound of shattering glass came from outside the door.\n\nThe Japanese girl looked at Zhou Ze and said, \"It's mealtime.\"\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Aren't you going?\" the Japanese girl continued to ask.\n\n\"Are you hungry? Or, do you get hungry?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Just want to go for a walk.\"\n\nZhou Ze understood. Eating for those in the mirror was like prisoners in a cell being regularly let out for fresh air and outdoor activities.\n\n\"I'm not inte...\"\n\nBefore Zhou Ze could finish his sentence,\n\n\"Crack... crack... crack...\" sounds suddenly kept coming from outside.\n\nZhou Ze immediately rushed to the door and opened it.\n\nYes,\n\nOriginally, outside should have just been a glass corridor leading directly to the restaurant, but the surrounding glass began to shatter one after another at this moment. More and more lingering souls began to wander aimlessly, as if they had lost their original restraints, becoming at a loss.\n\n\"What's going on?\" Zhou Ze asked the Japanese girl behind him.\n\n\"I don't know either,\" the Japanese girl also showed a surprised expression.\n\nZhou Ze rushed out the door. The glass around him, from far to near, continued to shatter. This gave Zhou Ze a very ominous premonition. He was actually a prisoner confined here, and the glass could be understood as the iron bars of the prison. The iron bars were now constantly shattering and disappearing, which was actually a good thing for prisoners because they would regain freedom.\n\nBut for Zhou Ze, it was different, because it meant that the restrictions and restraints here were fading away, and what had been suppressed was poised to escape.\n\nThe lingering souls here were becoming more and more numerous, because due to the special nature of General Mountain, the souls of those who died nearby would unconsciously gather here, somewhat like a treasure basin.\n\nAnd now, these people began to walk blankly forward, as if guided by something.\n\nZhou Ze walked among the crowd, desperately wanting to know the source of all this.\n\nFinally,\n\nZhou Ze saw a flag in front,\n\nAnd beneath the flag,\n\nLay three sets of black Japanese samurai armor. The armor bore many scars and damages, yet exuded a unique grimness.\n\nThe flag emitted black light, enveloping a circle. Any lingering souls attracted to it, once they entered the circle, would be bound by black threads. And those three sets of armor, which had been neatly stacked and still,\n\nInside,\n\nBegan to slowly expand...\n\n------\n\nApologies, after the interview last night, I got back to the hotel, set an alarm to sleep for two hours and then write, but the alarm didn't wake the dragon, and I ended up sleeping until early the next morning...\n\nTranslator's Note:\n* \"战五渣\" (zhàn wǔ zhā): Literally \"battle five dregs,\" a slang term originating from the anime \"Dragon Ball Z,\" meaning someone with a power level of 5 (the lowest possible), thus \"combat useless\" or \"scum in battle.\" It implies someone is extremely weak or incompetent in a fight.

    "content": "\"The wind's picking up outside,\" the old Taoist said as he walked to the living room's French window and closed it. For some reason, the wind had suddenly grown stronger, rustling the trees and wicker chairs in the yard.\n\nThe little loli, however, tore her gaze away from the Eight Horses painting, then deliberately walked over and opened the window the old Taoist had just closed. She poked her head out, then returned with an extremely grave expression.\n\nLooking at Zhou Ze, who still lay unconscious on the sofa, a hint of murderous intent flashed in the little loli's eyes.\n\n\"What are you doing!\" Bai Yingying immediately reprimanded.\n\nThe little loli pointed at Zhou Ze and cursed directly, \"What the hell did this bastard release? He's trying to get me killed!\"\n\n\"What's wrong?\" Xu Qinglang asked.\n\n*Bang!*\n\nSuddenly, the door was blown open by the wind outside, and even the glass of the French window shattered, sending shards flying everywhere in the living room.\n\nThe old Taoist and Xu Qinglang immediately crouched down, wrapping their heads with their clothes for protection. Bai Yingying threw herself over Zhou Ze to shield her boss. The glass shards that flew onto Bai Yingying were directly repelled; the female zombie's physique was indeed formidable.\n\nThe little loli stood amidst the flying glass shards. It was quite a sight, actually, and with her cold loli expression, it really looked like a scene from a blockbuster movie.\n\nSpider-Man, who had been sitting in a chair ever since he entered, seemed to be used to this. Normally, after cleaning the bookstore, he would find a spot to sit down and remain motionless. Even the old Taoist, who was a people-person, couldn't rouse him, finding him less entertaining than his own monkey.\n\nNow, the little loli stared directly at Spider-Man.\n\nSpider-Man continued to sit, seemingly unaffected by the little loli's gaze.\n\nThe little loli took a deep breath and said directly, \"Let's deal with the problem here first.\"\n\nSpider-Man remained motionless.\n\nWhen customers first visited the bookstore, they would often see him sitting there motionless and think he was a sculpture, like a model placed in a movie theater before a Spider-Man movie.\n\n\"I've always wondered why you stayed in Tongcheng. That guy's ashes were just an accidental discovery, weren't they? Not the real reason you stayed in Tongcheng for so long.\"\n\nSpider-Man remained unmoved.\n\n\"I investigated. This hot spring resort on General Mountain belongs to the Xu family.\"\n\nNo matter how big the world, this was still China. Tongcheng was a second-tier city, but in reality, it was just a small place, especially since Shanghai was just across the river. So, there weren't many foreigners in Tongcheng. Citizens on the street would still curiously stare at foreigners, unlike those in big cities who were long accustomed to blond hair, blue eyes, or dark skin.\n\nThe little loli knew that Zhou Ze had first met the priest at a funeral. At that time, the priest stood beside several women of the Xu family, somewhat like a family chaplain.\n\nAnd General Mountain was the Xu family's property.\n\nAnd now, the *Wokou*<sup>1</sup> vengeful spirits, suppressed by heroic souls, were actually, of all things, on the verge of rioting. Could this be a coincidence?\n\nSpider-Man remained as steady as a mountain.\n\nThe wind grew stronger, carrying a howling shriek. To ordinary people, this would just seem like a sudden change in weather signaling rain, but even Xu Qinglang could tell that the wind carried a strong malevolent aura. This was a sign that something immensely ominous was emerging!\n\nThe little loli took a deep breath.\n\nShe was so angry!\n\nWhy was it always Zhou Ze who caused trouble, and she had to desperately clean up his messes?\n\nMoreover, the little loli had to clean up this mess whether she wanted to or not, because she was also a Ghost Catcher of Tongcheng. This meant she was responsible for dealing with all supernatural incidents within Tongcheng's borders. If a supernatural event spiraled out of control and affected too many innocents, she would bear direct responsibility.\n\nThis was like trouble falling from the sky while sitting at home. The little loli suddenly felt so wronged; it seemed she hadn't lived a single comfortable day since meeting this slacker.\n\n*Gurgle... gurgle... gurgle...*\n\nThe hot spring pool began to bubble. The faucet wasn't on; the water was flowing backward from the drain plug at the bottom. Then, the entire courtyard began to collapse. The cobblestone ground directly caved in, and even more than half of the living room collapsed along with it.\n\nBai Yingying, quick as a flash, carried her boss's body and retreated to avoid her boss falling in with it.\n\nInside the resort, a pit appeared, and at the bottom of this pit was a dilapidated plaque with many bullet holes.\n\nIt was said that when the Japanese invaders entered Tongcheng, they learned there was a *Wako*<sup>2</sup> tomb and a General's Temple here, so they specifically came to destroy them. The bullet holes on the plaque were likely left from that time.\n\nThis clearly indicated that it had been deliberately relocated, and the entire resort itself could even be called a deliberate \"cover-up\" for it.\n\nBeneath the plaque was a headless statue, its paint long faded and damaged. It depicted a man on horseback wielding a saber, conveying a sense of desolation.\n\nBeside the man's statue were three boxes, mostly rotted away. From inside, one could see what appeared to be armor.\n\n*Buzz! Buzz! Buzz!!!!!!!!!!!*\n\nA series of vibrating sounds emanated from the boxes below. Immediately, a black shadow suddenly shot out and plunged into one of the boxes. Then, the rotten box instantly exploded, and a set of armor slowly rose up, becoming human-sized, but the armor floated, with no one wearing it inside.\n\n\"Oh...\"\n\nA weathered voice emanated from within the armor,\n\nLike someone who had slept for too long and was awakened.\n\n\"Hai...\"\n\n*Bang!*\n\nA rusted *katana*<sup>3</sup> materialized from some unknown crevice below and instantly appeared in the warrior's hand.\n\nThe warrior first looked at the other two sets of armor at his feet, seemingly curious why his two companions hadn't awakened with him. Then, he looked at the statue behind him.\n\nFive hundred years ago, it was this very person who stopped them. But five hundred years later,\n\nIt was time for it to end!\n\nThe little loli's gaze sharpened. She opened her mouth, and her tongue swiftly coiled out, transforming into a whip that lashed fiercely at the warrior.\n\nAs if he had eyes on his back, the warrior's *katana* sliced horizontally, blocking the tongue. At the same time, his figure flickered, pulling on the little loli's tongue as he retreated.\n\nThe little loli was pulled up like a kite, but she clung on stubbornly, not giving up. She knew she couldn't let the stone statue collapse, or the remaining two would also be released, and they would be even more unrestrained.\n\nSomeone might ask, why didn't they just destroy the statue earlier?\n\nBut in reality, if the statue had been destroyed earlier, it would have destroyed all three of them along with it, like digging up the roots of a fruit before it was ripe.\n\n\"Baka...\"\n\nThe warrior's blade cut horizontally. The little loli's body trembled, and she instinctively retracted her tongue, but she also leaped into the pit. She had no choice; she had to stop it, and she had to meet it head-on.\n\nBai Yingying, by this point, had also recovered her wits and shouted to the old Taoist, \"Protect the boss.\"\n\nThen, she looked at Spider-Man, who was sitting at the side, \"Come with me!\" After that, Bai Yingying directly jumped into the pit. Spider-Man, who had shown no reaction to the little loli's cold remarks earlier, immediately stood up and jumped down with her.\n\nThe old Taoist looked at Xu Qinglang and said, \"I'll protect the boss. You go too.\"\n\n\"...\" Xu Qinglang.\n\nTaking a deep breath, Xu Qinglang took out his heart-protecting mirror. Before he could jump down, the little loli flew out backward, crashing heavily into Xu Qinglang, sending him tumbling backward with her.\n\nThe little loli quickly got up, a trickle of blood at the corner of her mouth, but she immediately flipped her tongue, licking the blood back into her mouth, then charged back in.\n\nNext was Bai Yingying. Bai Yingying was directly struck by the *katana*. Although it didn't cause substantive damage, the *Oni*<sup>4</sup> energy on the blade directly dispersed the malevolent aura on her, causing Bai Yingying to stagger backward repeatedly.\n\nSpider-Man, however, continued to trade blows with the warrior, who repeatedly let out sounds of surprise.\n\nClearly, he recognized the priest, but he couldn't understand why his fellow countryman and junior was now turning against him.\n\n...\n\nZhou Ze had no idea how critical the situation was in reality. He didn't have time now to return to the room and look out through the glass mirror.\n\nCurrently, he was in the midst of a crowd, watching more and more souls walk into the circle where the flag was, like batteries, being rounded up.\n\nAnd between the flag and the armor, three figures in Japanese military uniforms, holding *katana*, were singing Japanese military songs and constantly running in circles.\n\nThey were already dead, yet they hadn't realized their demise. They still believed they were alive, dreaming their dreams of being Japanese.\n\nTheir actions were actually designed to attract nearby souls to constantly approach.\n\nIn fact, behind the flag, a huge, blurry phantom could be seen. Within the phantom was a man on horseback, very dignified, but his shadow was constantly twisting and blurring.\n\n\"What is this, a suppressed demon?\" The Japanese girl found Zhou Ze and stood beside him, asking.\n\nShe didn't feel any connection to the warrior as one of her own, after all, she had been dismembered and offered as a sacrifice precisely because of these three sets of armor.\n\nIn her eyes, these things were not her kin, but thorough and utter demons.\n\n\"Yes,\" Zhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"Why can these demons break free?\" The Japanese girl asked.\n\nZhou Ze pointed at the three figures in Japanese military uniforms who were still jumping around.\n\nHe said:\n\n\"Because those who unsealed them are Chinese.\"\n\n---\n<sup>1</sup> *Wokou* is a term used in East Asia for Japanese pirates, but it can also refer to invaders or bandits. Here, it refers to the Japanese invaders/soldiers.\n<sup>2</sup> *Wako*: Another term for Japanese pirates or invaders, same as Wokou.\n<sup>3</sup> *Katana*: A Japanese long sword.\n<sup>4</sup> *Oni*: A type of demon or ogre in Japanese folklore.

    "content": "Actually, the samurai’s combat strength wasn't that high. Of course, his movement and experience were indeed rich, so he often gained the upper hand in clashes, but the damage caused by his attacks was not very serious.\n\nThe little loli could confidently maneuver around him. Bai Yingying, after being hit, could always endure the damage with her powerful physique and quickly rush back into the fight. Spider-Man could also fight back and forth.\n\nHowever, the most crucial point was that a soldier wearing armor, while the armor was just protective gear to mitigate some damage, it was still possible to bypass the armor or even attack the soldier directly through it.\n\nBut,\n\nThe samurai before them,\n\nHe had no flesh and blood,\n\nNo discernible presence,\n\nIt was as if a mass of air was sustaining this black samurai armor in battle. Therefore, Bai Yingying and the others' attacks could only land on the armor, and the effect was, in fact, negligible.\n\nUnless they could instantly tear or shatter the armor, but this armor was likely no ordinary item five hundred years ago, and after five centuries of nourishment, it had long surpassed the usual scope of armor hardness. To directly smash it was extremely, extremely difficult.\n\nAnd because of this, even though this samurai was now fighting one against three, he still held his ground without falling behind.\n\n\"Seal him!\"\n\nThe little loli shouted to Bai Yingying and Spider-Man. Now, they could only settle for a temporary retreat, because if she hadn't been intentionally blocking him from behind, this samurai might have long since found an opportunity to destroy Cao Ding's statue.\n\nOne was already so tough to chew on; if two more appeared, the situation here would be completely reversed.\n\nBai Yingying nodded, then charged forward again. This time, Spider-Man cooperated with Bai Yingying, moving at the same speed but from different directions to outflank him.\n\nThe katana was reversed, its tip piercing directly into Spider-Man's thigh, then quickly cutting horizontally upwards. The entire process was fluid and decisive.\n\nSpider-Man's body was nearly split open with a gash. He began to stumble backward, finally collapsing onto the ground. Spider-Man's clothes were also sliced open and scattered on the ground. From the wound, foul-smelling pus continuously oozed out, a truly shocking sight.\n\nBai Yingying's eyes narrowed. For some reason, she sensed that this samurai's strength seemed to have sharply increased since their initial engagement!\n\nThis feeling was quickly confirmed.\n\n\"Bang! Bang! Bang!\"\n\nThe samurai exchanged three punches with Bai Yingying. He stood perfectly still, while Bai Yingying began to retreat continuously. The next moment, the samurai appeared behind Bai Yingying, with astonishing speed, followed by a horizontal cut.\n\n\"Buzz!\"\n\nThe blade made a harsh grinding sound as it made contact with Bai Yingying. Bai Yingying was sent flying backward, her malevolent energy constantly dissipating. After falling, Bai Yingying couldn't stand up as quickly as before; she could only lie on the ground, struggling to support herself with her hands, clearly in great pain.\n\nBeneath the helmet, a pair of crimson eyes seemed to be observing everything. Then, the samurai accelerated again, charging directly towards the little loli's position.\n\nThe little loli was in an awkward spot. She could dodge, but behind her was Cao Ding's statue. She hated the feeling of having no retreat. After all, not everyone had the courage or willingness to be a hero.\n\nBut at this moment, she still spread her hands, stood on her tiptoes, and after extending her tongue, a black vortex swept out.\n\n\"Swish! Swish! Swish!\"\n\nWith each slash of the katana, the little loli's body trembled once, but she still didn't retreat.\n\nMost importantly,\n\nShe suddenly realized with astonishment that the samurai's strength was like a roller coaster. It started flat, then suddenly soared, defeating Spider-Man and Bai Yingying in an instant. But at this moment, his strength seemed to have plummeted again.\n\n\"Heaven and Earth without limits, Righteous Heart True Law!\"\n\nSeizing this opportunity, Xu Qinglang appeared, holding his heart-protecting mirror. He knew that with his strength, he could hardly play a significant role in a direct confrontation, so he simply chose to strike at the opportune moment.\n\nIt must be said, the timing Xu Qinglang chose was truly excellent.\n\nThe heart-protecting mirror directly pressed against the armor, causing the samurai's body to tremble as if electrocuted. But immediately, the katana suddenly swung horizontally, aiming straight for Xu Qinglang.\n\nEven though Xu Qinglang had anticipated it and quickly retreated after a successful strike, he was still grazed by the blade's energy. His body arced gracefully through the air, flying directly out of the pit. Fortunately, he landed on a sofa, otherwise he might have been killed by the fall.\n\nThe old Taoist immediately scrambled over to check Xu Qinglang's condition. Seeing him unconscious, he quickly slapped Xu Qinglang's face.\n\n\"I'm not dead...\" Xu Qinglang said with difficulty.\n\n\"Damn it, this guy is really tough. All of you together couldn't take him down.\"\n\nThe old Taoist poked his head down and saw that the little loli was still in a standoff with the samurai. If the little loli were to be defeated, then this round would truly be over.\n\n\"You... go down and help...\"\n\nXu Qinglang lowered his head and glanced at his abdomen, where a wound had appeared. It was truly a close call; if he had retreated even a little bit later, he might have been cut in half.\n\n\"Don't talk. Your injury means you shouldn't talk much,\" the old Taoist said sternly.\n\nWhile using one hand to staunch the flow of blood from his wound, Xu Qinglang gripped the old Taoist's arm tightly with his other hand, glaring at him.\n\nThe old Taoist felt very uneasy under the stare.\n\nDamn it,\n\nDon't you know my level?\n\nMake me go up?\n\nThe old Taoist really didn't want to go up.\n\n\"Can you invite a deity?\" Xu Qinglang asked.\n\n\"Uh, I used to play around with it, but that was just to fool people.\" At this moment, the old Taoist didn't mind revealing his shortcomings.\n\nXu Qinglang took out a very small talisman from his upper jacket pocket, much smaller than the old Taoist's talismans.\n\n\"Stick it on your forehead and try to invite a deity into your body!\"\n\n\"Will it work?\" The old Taoist clearly didn't believe it.\n\nSimple tools, simple operation, simple process,\n\nIs inviting a deity that easy?\n\nThen why would those charlatans on the street still need to lie?\n\n\"The Yin energy is heavy here right now, and there are many ghosts. Just inviting any one of them to possess you will at least make you more capable than you are now!\"\n\nAfter saying these words, Xu Qinglang coughed heavily a few times, spitting out some blood.\n\nThe old Taoist opened his mouth, as if hesitating. The old Taoist was afraid of death, truly afraid of death. And such a simple method of inviting a deity, while sounding good, in plain terms, it just meant letting any nearby minor ghost possess him to stimulate his potential. The side effects would surely be terrifying.\n\nBut at this moment, the old Taoist clearly saw the little loli suddenly kneeling down on one knee, blood oozing from the corner of her mouth. Clearly, she was also close to collapsing.\n\nThe old Taoist also understood that once the little loli retreated, then regardless of whether the samurai broke the statue, they would all be finished.\n\nThe strongest boss,\n\nWas still in deep sleep!\n\nThe old Taoist immediately felt a sense of \"the wind whistles, the Yi River is cold,\" but he still pasted the talisman Xu Qinglang handed him onto his forehead.\n\n\"I invite the Immortal to possess me!\"\n\nThe old Taoist couldn't recite the Taoist incantations for inviting deities. Instead, he ended up jumping around like a Northeast Chinese shaman, looking quite comical.\n\nSuddenly, the old Taoist's body twitched, then he supported his knees with his hands, his upper body drooping.\n\nXu Qinglang, while struggling to cover the wound on his abdomen, looked at the old Taoist with hopeful eyes. At this point, there was nothing else they could do. Asking the old Taoist to invite a minor ghost to possess him was a last resort. Having one more combatant, no matter how small, was better than nothing.\n\nThat talisman wasn't a proper talisman for inviting a deity either. In fact, it was the key to Xu Qinglang's ability to enter Sanxiang Village in the first place. The talisman's purpose was to suppress the Yang energy in a living person, obscuring the three lamps on their body, allowing a ghost to enter.\n\nThe old Taoist slowly raised his head, his gaze falling upon Xu Qinglang who was lying on the ground. He then gave a bitter laugh:\n\n\"Damn, it's useless, could it be that my Yang energy is too strong?\"\n\nXu Qinglang slumped his head to the side, despairing.\n\nThe talisman remained on the old Taoist's head. He had just tired himself out jumping around. His hand instinctively reached for his crotch, but unfortunately, the talisman had already been used.\n\n\"Roar!\"\n\nA roar from the soul erupted from within the samurai's armor.\n\nThen the samurai ignored the little loli's attacks, absorbing everything head-on. With one downward slash, the little loli raised both hands, clamping the katana, while her tongue directly pierced the samurai's armor. But the samurai also landed a powerful kick to the little loli's body.\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nThe little loli was sent flying backward,\n\nAnd crashed heavily onto the ground.\n\nThe samurai armor was severely damaged and continued to crack, clearly nearing its limit, but he still desperately charged towards Cao Ding's statue.\n\n\"It's over!\"\n\nThe old Taoist slapped his thigh. At this moment, his reckless spirit emerged. He directly picked up a broken concrete brick nearby and jumped down, rushing towards the samurai.\n\nThe old Taoist was fighting for his life; there was no other option.\n\nThe feeling at this moment was like a siege battle where the regular army had fallen, and only the old, weak, women, and children were left to continue the fight.\n\nIt must be said,\n\nThe old Taoist's self-assessment was very accurate.\n\nAlthough the samurai was severely wounded by the little loli, a centipede dies but never falls. As he turned around, the katana thrust horizontally, making the old Taoist's body shiver with fear.\n\nBut in that instant, the talisman on the old Taoist's forehead suddenly broke off. At the same time, the old Taoist's entire demeanor abruptly changed. He immediately shifted his body, dodging the blade. Then, the old Taoist's palm pressed down along the back of the katana, causing the blade to plunge into the ground with its momentum. The old Taoist himself then bravely moved closer to the samurai, ramming his shoulder hard into the samurai's helmet.\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nA crisp sound,\n\nThe samurai's armor was once again extensively damaged, and his body swayed continuously, beginning to retreat, like a plastic toy about to completely fall apart.\n\nBut the samurai paid no attention to his injuries. Those crimson eyes fixed intensely on the old Taoist, glowing with a special light.\n\nIn those eyes, there was apprehension and solemnity,\n\nAnd even,\n\nSomething called fear.\n\nThe old Taoist pulled the katana from the ground, skillfully twirled the blade, then raised it to point at the samurai. With a hoarse yet firm voice, he uttered two words:\n\n\"Kill the Japanese!\"",

    "content": "Zhou Ze chose not to enter the area encompassed by the banner, as he wasn't sure if the banner would have a special effect on him.\n\nHowever, not entering the area didn't mean there was no other way.\n\nAt this moment, Boss Zhou waved his fingernails from outside the circle, intimidating the attracted lost souls, preventing them from entering the banner's range.\n\nThe three sets of armor relied on the malevolent energy provided by these lost souls entering the area to awaken and act. Cutting off their entry was akin to pulling the rug out from under them.\n\nThe Japanese girl stood beside Zhou Ze, her eyes red, her body twisting in various places, emitting her aura to help Zhou Ze intimidate these lost souls.\n\nActually, most of the lost souls here could only be called \"lost souls,\" not even \"ghosts,\" because they were supposed to go to hell. However, after death, they were \"detained\" by General Mountain's unique magnetic field environment and gathered here.\n\nThe Japanese girl, on the other hand, was a genuine ghost with a deep desire for revenge. Therefore, she was able to maintain her lucidity in this environment.\n\nShe didn't have any other thoughts just because this was a Japanese setup. For her, her promising life had been ruined by her \"compatriots.\" All she wanted to do now was take revenge!\n\nZhou Ze actually felt pretty stupid himself, like an adult threatening a bunch of kindergarten kids with a knife, telling them not to move. It was a classless act, but it was the only thing Zhou Ze could do at the moment.\n\nZhou Ze didn't dare take risks. If he rushed in and was affected by that strange banner, things would truly become troublesome.\n\nIt was important to remember that he was different from these lost souls. If they were individual batteries, then he was a nuclear power plant.\n\nZhou Ze also tried to open the Gates of Hell to take all these lost souls away, but presumably, because they were in the mirror world, the Gates of Hell couldn't be opened. However, Zhou Ze could at least be clear about one thing: the outside world must be in chaos right now, and he wondered if Bai Yingying and the little loli could hold out.\n\nAnd in fact, if it weren't for Zhou Ze's timely intervention, which caused one of the awakened armors to lose its continuous source of malevolent energy, the situation outside might have already deteriorated to an extreme degree.\n\nThe previous rollercoaster-like changes in the samurai's power were precisely for this reason.\n\nZhou Ze kept an eye on the confused lost souls in front, who were instinctively trying to enter the area, while also monitoring the situation behind him. He noticed that the floating black armor was already seven or eight parts damaged, and he breathed a sigh of relief, guessing that the situation outside shouldn't be completely out of control, right?\n\nHowever, at this moment, the three men who had been wearing Japanese military uniforms, singing and dancing around the flagpole to attract lost souls, simultaneously drew their swords and rushed towards Zhou Ze, shouting something.\n\nZhou Ze didn't care about the swords in their hands. When the first person charged, he directly backhanded, pinching the hilt of the opponent's sword, and then lifted it. The opponent, due to the momentum of his charge, actively stumbled towards Zhou Ze. Zhou Ze directly clasped the opponent's neck, his five fingernails mercilessly piercing into the opponent's neck!\n\n\"You want to be a Jap so badly, don't you?\" Zhou Ze said in a deep voice.\n\n\"Ahhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!\"\n\nThe man let out a tragic scream. At this moment, he seemed to gain a moment of clarity.\n\nBasic \"survival\" instinct at play, at this moment, he actually looked at Zhou Ze and pleaded:\n\n\"I'm not Japanese, I'm Chinese, I'm Chinese...\"\n\nZhou Ze showed no politeness whatsoever, directly twisting his neck. At the same time, the black mist on his fingernails transformed into the sharpest \"blades,\" instantly shredding his lost soul!\n\nAgainst such scum, there was no need to show any mercy. Annihilation of the soul, never to be reincarnated, was their rightful destiny.\n\nHowever, perhaps Zhou Ze's simple and brutal killing of one of their companions instilled immense fear in the other two. They dared not advance further, dared not leave the area delimited by the banner. Instead, they directly walked in front of the two still-unawakened armors and began to put them on.\n\n…\n\nThe old Taoist held the katana,\n\nHis legs slightly spread, in a pigeon-toed stance.\n\nOriginally, his appearance was quite good, exuding an air of immortality and Taoist grace. Now, he exuded a sense of simplicity and unpretentiousness.\n\nOne person,\n\nOne knife,\n\nFive hundred years ago, when Japanese pirates ravaged Tongcheng, the defending soldiers scattered, and the garrison troops were useless. He had many times gone against the tide, actively moving towards the areas where the Japanese pirates were causing trouble.\n\nAt the age of forty-four, already old (people in ancient times aged faster and had shorter lifespans), upon hearing the warning, he still unhesitatingly mounted his horse, took his sword, and actively charged forward. The local gazetteer of Tongcheng has detailed records of that battle: he fought his way in and out three times, leading the local villagers of Tongcheng to repel the Japanese pirates, and was killed in pursuit.\n\nThere are many statues of Cao Ding in Tongcheng. If you look closely, you can see that Cao Ding's statues are missing two fingers on his left hand.\n\nThe reason was that upon hearing of the Japanese pirates' invasion, Cao Ding began to sharpen his sword, personally testing the sharpness of the blade with his fingers. As a result, two of his fingers were directly cut off. Cao Ding laughed loudly, took his sword, mounted his horse, and went to kill the Japanese.\n\nAt that time, Cao Ding had already left the army. His identity at the time was merely the owner of a noodle shop in Tongcheng.\n\nThe old Taoist had never felt so exhilarated!\n\nFirst-person perspective!\n\nFirst-hand experience!\n\nFirst audience!\n\nAlthough his body was not under his own control, clearly controlled by an external will, the old Taoist felt very satisfied.\n\nThe only regret might be that no one had the time to take out a phone and record a video for him to commemorate it,\n\nIt's not easy to find an opportunity to show off!\n\nCao Ding didn't say much, which greatly displeased the old Taoist. Say more! Give more flashes! While not necessarily instantly causing sand and stones to fly and a blood moon to pierce through the clouds, at least help him make this act of showing off more perfect, right?\n\nOf course, these were just the old Taoist's inner musings.\n\nHowever, in reality, before Cao Ding died in battle, he merely bandaged his finger wounds and shouted:\n\n\"Kill the Japanese pirates.\"\n\nUntil his death, he said nothing else, but he used his entire life, even pledging the next five hundred years, to embody these two words.\n\nThe old Taoist walked directly forward. The samurai began to retreat, but in the next moment, the old Taoist sped up. God knows how fast the old Taoist could run.\n\nThe samurai was forced to meet the attack head-on. His aura had weakened significantly, for he knew that he was not only facing this old Taoist, but also an existence that had instilled fear in him for five hundred years.\n\nOne strike,\n\nJust one strike,\n\nWithout any fancy moves,\n\nWithout the slightest hesitation,\n\nEverything seemed so easy, revealing an unexpected and almost unsatisfying nonchalance.\n\nThe samurai's helmet was pierced through and directly exploded. Shattered along with it was the already nearing broken armor.\n\nThis strike was merely the final push that sent the samurai to the cliff's edge. Bai Yingying, Xu Qinglang, and the little loli had already depleted this samurai to the point of being a spent force.\n\nHowever,\n\nThis was not over yet.\n\nThe armor that had been quietly sitting in the rotten box now slowly filled up, as if someone had put them on.\n\nThe old Taoist continued to walk towards them, still walking very quickly.\n\nIf there are Japanese pirates,\n\nKill them,\n\nNo need for words.\n\nThe two newly appeared samurai seemed to be still somewhat unaccustomed to the situation, but they instinctively sensed danger. One samurai immediately raised his katana and slashed down at the old Taoist.\n\n\"Clang!\"\n\nSword met sword.\n\nThe old Taoist's knees buckled, and he directly knelt on one knee.\n\nThe old Taoist felt embarrassed. He knew that it was his old arms and legs that were not strong enough for the heroic spirit to display its might; he was somewhat holding it back.\n\nBut at the moment of kneeling, the katana in the old Taoist's hand smoothly lifted from bottom to top!\n\n\"Pfft...\"\n\nThe blade qi deeply pierced into the armor, leaving an incredibly deep mark there.\n\nThe old Taoist slapped the ground with one palm, quickly stood up, then bent his arm, thrusting the blade from back to front. At the same time, his shoulder and thigh continuously and forcefully collided with the samurai's body, forcing the samurai to lose his balance for a moment.\n\n\"Scratch...\"\n\nA harsh scraping sound was heard.\n\nThe katana in the old Taoist's hand was already resting at the samurai's neck, or rather, the samurai had no neck, but the blade of the katana was pressed just below his helmet.\n\nEffortlessly,\n\nThe situation was brought under control!\n\nHowever, at this moment, a face appeared from under the helmet, a distorted and panicked face. At the same time, this face roared:\n\n\"I am Chinese, I am Chinese, I am not Japanese, I am not a Japanese pirate, not a Japanese pirate, I am Chinese! Don't kill me, please don't kill me, I am Chinese!!!\"\n\nThe old Taoist felt extremely anxious!\n\nUnfortunately, the old Taoist did not have the right to control his own body, at least not at this moment.\n\nGenerally speaking, in the old Taoist's opinion, such heroic figures often have a high degree of spiritual purity. He truly worried that Cao Ding, because there was a Chinese soul inside the opponent, would hesitate or let the opponent go, adhering to the idea of not killing his own countrymen.\n\nIn fact, the old Taoist had already sensed that the consciousness controlling his body was becoming increasingly weak, and might have to leave at any moment!\n\nAt this time, there could be no hesitation, and even less softness!\n\nBrother,\n\nMy friend,\n\nOld senior,\n\nDon't stick to principles, absolutely don't stick to principles! Kill him, kill him!\n\nFortunately,\n\nThe old Taoist's worries were unnecessary, very, very unnecessary.\n\nAs soon as the opponent revealed his Chinese identity and pleaded,\n\nThe blade went straight in,\n\nDirectly splitting the armor's helmet.\n\nIncredibly refreshing,\n\nUtterly simple and brutal,\n\nThat person's pleading and crying were of absolutely no use.\n\nIt was so fast that the old Taoist even felt a little unaccustomed to it.\n\nCao Ding looked at the broken armor that had turned into a puddle at his feet,\n\nAnd said in a deep voice:\n\n\"Most of the Japanese pirates back then were also our countrymen.\"\n\n…\n\nPS: According to \"Jiajing Records\": \"For the maritime alarm in Jiangnan, thirteen parts were Japanese pirates, and seventeen parts were Chinese rebels.\"",

"其實，並不是說老道被附身之後就一下子打通了任督二脈然後神功大漲可以神擋殺神佛擋殺佛了，曹頂的上身確實激發出了老道的潛能，但實際上再怎麼激發，老道的潛能也不可能激發到超過白鶯鶯和小蘿莉的層次。\n\n\n\n  之所以能夠砍瓜切菜一樣連續解決倆武士，實際上是因為曹頂當年殺了他們，同時還鎮壓了他們五百年，這是一種烙印在靈魂深處的恐懼。\n\n\n\n  在曹頂的面前，這三名兇悍殺人如麻的武士，只能淪為瘦弱的鵪鶉。\n\n\n\n  這就像是白鶯鶯一個人時會很高冷，但在面對血統壓制自己的周老闆時馬上就變成「嚶嚶嚶」一個道理。\n\n\n\n  曹頂很爽脆，直接殺死了第二名武士，現在，只剩下一個了。\n\n\n\n  而且可以看出來，這名武士明顯有些惶惶不安，這種恐懼真的不是喊一句「人定勝天」這種口號就能抵抗得了的。\n\n\n\n  這是天敵，是難以逾越的鴻溝。\n\n\n\n  老道心下長舒一口氣，現在只要把最後一個殺了，自己這個逼也就能裝結束了。\n\n\n\n  曹頂也沒有耽擱時間，他也清楚自己耽擱不起，是故直接沖了上去。\n\n\n\n  老道身形矯健，宛若煥發了第二春，那名武士開始躲避，甚至不敢去主動反擊，但躲避也起不到太大的效果，在十餘招之後，武士開始不支，終於被曹頂找到了一個漏洞一腳踹中跪伏了下來，緊接著，曹頂的刀口順勢橫亘了上去。 \n\n\n\n  快，\n\n\n\n  砍了他，\n\n\n\n  砍了他！\n\n\n\n  砍了他，我們就可以喊「咔」，然後回家吃飯收衣服了！\n\n\n\n  老道在心裡狂喊著！\n\n\n\n  然而，\n\n\n\n  就在這時，一股濃重的虛弱感自老道體內傳來，這種虛弱感，像是一晚上安慰關懷了十來個失足一樣，天都開始在旋轉了。\n\n\n\n  「娘咧！」\n\n\n\n  老道心下暗道不好，\n\n\n\n  然後整個人倒退著最後仰面倒在了地上，疲倦的感覺直接襲來，老道更是在剎那間昏厥了過去。\n\n\n\n  武士刀垂落在了地上，這最後的一刀，並沒有砍下去。\n\n\n\n  上頭躺在地上卻一直觀察著這邊情況的許清朗下意識地一口血自嘴角溢出，\n\n\n\n  這太狗血了，明明給了莫大的希望，但卻在最後關頭出了問題？\n\n\n\n  標準的狗血電影套路，卻真實地在自己面前發生了。\n\n\n\n  白鶯鶯強撐著慢慢地靠著牆壁站了起來，她其實體內一片混亂，煞氣更是脫韁的野馬不停地肆虐著，但她清楚，這個時候不是自己休息的時候了，無論情況多糟，她都要站起來。\n\n\n\n  渾身是血的小蘿莉嵌在牆壁上，看見老道倒下去時，她的嘴角抽了抽，她的脾氣本就不是很好，所以在這個時候，如果不是身體實在有些吃不消的話，她真的很想罵人。 \n\n\n\n  但想來想去，似乎也沒誰能給自己罵了。\n\n\n\n  罵曹頂？\n\n\n\n  他沒多BB，也沒多廢話，更沒有像一些腦殘電視劇里的正派角色喜歡在殺人前廢話一大通，他已經夠果決夠迅速的了。\n\n\n\n  罵老道？\n\n\n\n  他好像也沒什麼可以罵的，他已經做了自己所能做的一切。\n\n\n\n  事實上，當下這批人里，只有老道是一個純粹的人，所以，曹頂想要上身的話，也只能上老道的身，他已經做出自己的貢獻了。\n\n\n\n  最後，小蘿莉覺得，還是有一個人可以罵的。\n\n\n\n  是那個ZZ，\n\n\n\n  他自己跑過來挖了坑，\n\n\n\n  然後當大家累死累活拼命幫他填坑的時候，他卻躺在那裡呼呼大睡！\n\n\n\n  這個ZZ！\n\n\n\n  咬著銀牙，小蘿莉從牆壁內掙扎著走了出來，雖然身形很不穩定，止不住地在搖晃，但她沒得選。\n\n\n\n  沒有配樂，也沒有鮮花，更沒有什麼血紅的旗幟在後面搖擺。\n\n\n\n  明明做著挺光偉正的事兒，但沒有歡呼也沒有啦啦隊，小蘿莉很不喜歡這種感覺，也很反感這種場景。\n\n\n\n  蜘蛛俠沒死，但他站不起來了，他受的傷太嚴重，不過之前出現的巨大創口在此時已經開始結痂。 \n\n\n\n  武士在原地愣了許久，他似乎還沒從剛剛絕望的情緒中走出來，帶著些許的彷徨，他試探性地站起了身。\n\n\n\n  然後，\n\n\n\n  他看見倒在地上已經昏厥過去的老道，看見了自己前面一個個身受重傷連保持站姿都止不住搖晃的對手。\n\n\n\n  他很想笑，\n\n\n\n  幸福，\n\n\n\n  來得太突然！\n\n\n\n  一種絕望的情緒在這裡瀰漫起來，這個片段這個畫面這個劇情以及這個節奏，適合放在電影的開頭，而不是片尾。\n\n\n\n  按照電影的劇情，隨後的一大段內容就是這次失敗未能阻止惡魔之後，又有一批新的勇士誕生和出現，最後殺死了惡魔。\n\n\n\n  實際上，小蘿莉自己也清楚，自己這邊戰敗後，大不了就是身死道消，而這個日本武士在禍害了一陣之後，馬上會有附近各地的鬼差捕頭甚至還會有巡檢大人親至趕來。\n\n\n\n  這個日本武士，到最後也逃不脫滅亡的宿命。\n\n\n\n  長舒一口氣，又深深地吸了一口氣，小蘿莉張開嘴，但只是伸出舌頭舔了舔自己有些乾裂的嘴唇。\n\n\n\n  武士撿起了自己的武士刀，\n\n\n\n  他的盔甲伸展開，\n\n\n\n  四周刮來了風，\n\n \n\n  風很大，\n\n\n\n  像是他在作無聲放肆的大笑。\n\n\n\n  在犧牲了兩個同伴之後，他笑到了最後。\n\n\n\n  雖然這個過程有不少的波折，雖然剛才的自己還在曹頂的追殺下萬分的狼狽，但局面，最終還是被自己掌控住了！\n\n\n\n  「鏗鏘！」\n\n\n\n  武士舉起了自己的武士刀，一開始指向了前面的老道，隨後又指向了一側的白鶯鶯，最後又指向了另一側的小蘿莉。\n\n\n\n  反派很多都死於話多，不是因為反派都很蠢，而是因為在勝券在握時多裝會兒逼是一種難以拒絕的誘huo，讓人下意識地去沉浸其中。\n\n\n\n  不過，武士也沒有過多的拖延，他先走向了躺在自己面前的老道。\n\n\n\n  舉起刀，\n\n\n\n  「咔嚓！」\n\n\n\n  武士愣了一下，\n\n\n\n  扭過頭，\n\n\n\n  看向身後，\n\n\n\n  那座屬於曹頂的雕塑，在此時忽然砸落了下來。\n\n\n\n  「砰！」\n\n\n\n  武士被壓在了下面，雕塑揚起了巨大的塵土，其內部，居然還有火星在四散，不一會兒，焦煙也瀰漫了出來。\n\n\n\n  小蘿莉站在了原地，然後馬上沖了過去，不顧自己的傷勢！ \n\n\n\n  白鶯鶯也發出了一聲厲害，強撐著跟著一起沖了過去。\n\n\n\n  兩個女人站在倒塌的雕塑面前，看著雕塑不斷地起伏，顯然，裡頭的武士正在拼命地掙扎企圖脫困。\n\n\n\n  一聲聲來自靈魂的厲嘯自下面發出，但隨之而來的，是更為熾熱的溫度。\n\n\n\n  有一種叫花雞的做法，就是把處理好塞入其他食材的雞放入溫度極高的泥土下面，等到一定時間後取出，剝開泥土，裡面的雞肉將十分美味。\n\n\n\n  而此時，這名最後的武士，其實就相當於那隻叫花雞。\n\n\n\n  「這是怎麼回事？」\n\n\n\n  白鶯鶯顯然有些難以理解，\n\n\n\n  「他要被壓死了？」\n\n\n\n  一個剛剛呼風喚雨的鬼武士，就這樣被砸死了？\n\n\n\n  這就像是電影裡給了極大篇幅的反派boss結果還沒出場就因為吃飯被噎死掛了一樣，讓人有些莫名其妙。\n\n\n\n  小蘿莉單膝跪地，對著面前已經倒塌下來的雕塑低下了頭，這是一種鬼差表達自己敬意的方式。\n\n\n\n  「曹頂，燃燒了法身，他本可以成為白夫人以及青衣娘娘那種的廟神，事實上他的功德和世代在通城享受的香火比前兩者要高得多得多。\n\n\n\n  但他放棄了這一切，只為了拉著這名武士的亡魂，一起魂飛湮滅，連下地獄謀求一個官身的機會都丟掉了。」 \n\n\n\n  白鶯鶯聞言，愣了一下，然後跟著一起跪了下來。\n\n\n\n  上頭，\n\n\n\n  躺在地上看著這邊情況的許清朗，心裡也是無比的唏噓，英雄的落幕，也著實很讓人感傷。\n\n\n\n  隨後，\n\n\n\n  許清朗看向了自己身邊還在昏迷著的周澤，有些無奈道：\n\n\n\n  「事情都結束了，你還不醒來？」\n\n\n\n  無奈之中，\n\n\n\n  帶著強烈得不滿和幽怨，濃郁得似乎都要化作水滴淌出來。\n\n\n\n  …………\n\n\n\n  「所以，這是怎麼回事？」日本女孩有些好奇地看著周澤。\n\n\n\n  背後的雕塑虛影在燃燒，剩下的一套鎧甲和那杆旗幟也在燃燒，熊熊的火焰將前方完全覆蓋。\n\n\n\n  「是在燃燒自己的神魂和功德。」周澤解釋道。\n\n\n\n  五百年前，曹頂戰死，通城百姓給他建立了曹公祠，修建了倭子墳，五百年的香火供奉，是當地百姓對他的懷念，而今，他將這些東西一個不留通通還了回去，只為了帶走這隻即將出土的惡魔，保地方一個安寧。\n\n\n\n  周澤覺得自己雖然是個通城人，但自己可能做不到這個地步，如果不是因為有著鬼差身份的羈絆，他很可能會在一開始就選擇明哲保身。 \n\n\n\n  正是因為大多數人做不到，所以人們才更加地崇拜英雄，給英雄再多的禮遇再多的香火再多的敬意，也絲毫不為過。\n\n\n\n  火還在燃燒，這片白茫茫的鏡子世界，仿佛在接下來很快會被燒得乾乾淨淨，在失去了曹頂失去了被鎮壓的這些鬼子亡魂之後，將軍山的奇特之處，也將不復存在。\n\n\n\n  周澤覺得自己很快也會得以離開，這些聚集在這裡的亡魂也會在隨後自己進入地獄，他們本就是該進地獄的，所以這幫亡魂周澤送不送，都不算業績的。\n\n\n\n  哦，\n\n\n\n  還是有業績的，\n\n\n\n  比如站在自己身邊的這個日本女孩。\n\n\n\n  周澤覺得自己在這件事上，一直都在打醬油，但好在也不是全無收穫，自己至少可以把這個女孩給送進地獄能賺一點是一點吧。\n\n\n\n  四周的玻璃，開始扭曲和揮發，亡魂們開始四處遊走，他們在等待這裡禁制的徹底消亡，從而去他們應該去的黃泉路。\n\n\n\n  一想到自己即將去見外面的那群朋友，周澤還有些怕怕的，這件事是因為自己要追查所以才捅破的，結果到頭來，自己反倒是被關在鏡子裡頭啥都沒幹成，而外面的那幫人，估計忙壞了吧。\n\n\n\n  這個，不是很好交代啊。\n\n\n\n  從自己衣服里取出了一根煙，再拿出打火機，周澤看見自己的煙和打火機都有些扭曲了起來，連帶著自己的手掌也有些模糊了。 \n\n\n\n  這是即將回去的徵兆，\n\n\n\n  但周澤還是點了煙，\n\n\n\n  隨後，習慣性地拿出了手機。\n\n\n\n  「我們，能出去了麼？」日本女孩問道。\n\n\n\n  「等出去後，我送你去該去的地方。」周澤說道，「如果你有親人的話，我可以事後幫你聯繫他們，給一個最後的交代，不好意思，這是我能做的極限。」\n\n\n\n  「我懂。」女孩很善解人意。\n\n\n\n  周澤聳聳肩，其實，有一件事周澤一直很奇怪，為什麼那個鬼來電可以在鏡子裡撥打出去聯繫到自己，但自己在鏡子裡卻沒辦法撥通出去，難道說這玩意兒是單向聯繫？或者只能聯繫給當地的鬼差？\n\n\n\n  但小蘿莉不也是鬼差麼？\n\n\n\n  還有一件事，既然曹頂能燃燒法神將這些魑魅魍魎都燒個乾淨，為什麼一開始沒燒，難道說一開始他還是存著能保存自己的心思，到最後見局面可能會失控才決定犧牲自己的？\n\n\n\n  當然了，周澤這個念頭並沒有褻瀆英魂的意思，英魂也是人，有這種念頭也很正常。\n\n\n\n  鬼使神差地，\n\n\n\n  周澤點開了電話簿，\n\n\n\n  在這個時候，\n\n\n\n  手機屏幕已經開始變得模糊起來了，四周的一切也都在慢慢地模糊。 \n\n\n\n  周澤選中了那個未知號碼，點了過去，之前其他人的電話他都撥通出去過，但能撥通卻沒人接，這個號碼，周澤反而沒撥過。\n\n\n\n  「嘟…………嘟…………嘟…………」\n\n\n\n  電話居然打通了，\n\n\n\n  「嘟…………嘟…………嘟…………」\n\n\n\n  自己身邊居然也有了電話的聲音響起來。\n\n\n\n  周澤有些意外地放下了手機，\n\n\n\n  看向自己面前的日本女孩。\n\n\n\n  手機的聲音，\n\n\n\n  是從她身上傳來的。\n\n\n\n  女孩愣了一下，\n\n\n\n  扭過頭，\n\n\n\n  看向了周澤，一臉茫然道：\n\n\n\n  「什麼聲音？」\n\n\n\n  周澤看著她，平靜地看著她，她沒穿衣服，之前從溫泉池裡走出來時就沒穿衣服，之後跟著周澤從房間裡跑出來時也沒穿，所以，她身上其實沒有可以放手機的地方。\n\n\n\n  不過，女孩臉上的笑容和迷茫很快消失不見，\n\n\n\n  她伸出手，\n\n\n\n  放在自己胸口，\n\n\n\n  隨後撕開了自己胸口的皮肉，\n\n\n\n  在肋骨夾層之中，有一隻個頭小巧的手機被嵌在裡頭。 \n\n\n\n  「咔嚓！咔嚓！」\n\n\n\n  她扳斷了自己的兩根肋骨，取出了裡面的手機，\n\n\n\n  然後當著周澤的面，將手機貼近自己的臉龐，\n\n\n\n  壓低了嗓門，\n\n\n\n  沉聲道：\n\n\n\n  「餵…………救我…………救我…………我在將軍山…………救我…………」\n\n\n\n  女孩舔了舔自己的嘴唇，像是玩笑被大人看穿了一樣，顯得有些嬌羞。\n\n\n\n  緊接著，她的手輕輕地拍打在剛剛被自己撕開的位置，有些後怕地嬌呼道：\n\n\n\n  「好險呢，\n\n\n\n  我就說這個缺了手指頭的老不死的東西不是那麼好對付的吧，\n\n\n\n  當初神父還很不以為然，說他已經死了五百年了，還能有什麼威脅？\n\n\n\n  只可惜，\n\n\n\n  神父不知道什麼原因居然放了我鴿子，這次居然沒來，不然我真想指著他鼻子罵他一頓，讓他睜開眼看看：\n\n\n\n  剛剛如果我也跟著衝進去，\n\n\n\n  可能現在也被燒死了吧？」",

    "content": "Everyone was wounded, scarred all over.\n\nThe little loli sat on the ground, eyes closed, occasionally kneading the aching parts of her body. Her body was delicate and indeed needed more attention.\n\nOld Tao and Spider-Man were laboriously carried up by Bai Yingying. Old Tao was still unconscious, his face pale, looking like he'd overindulged.\n\nHis eye sockets were sunken and dark, lips chapped and white, body weak and covered in cold sweat, twitching occasionally.\n\nOf course, no one would mock him now. Among the people present, Zhou Ze and the little loli were ghost servants, Bai Yingying was a zombie, Spider-Man was a living dead, and Xu Qinglang was a Mystic Cultivator. If Old Tao hadn't been there, Cao Ding wouldn't have had a suitable body to possess and help even if he wanted to at that time.\n\nBesides, Old Tao didn't chicken out even before Cao Ding possessed him. He grabbed a brick and charged forward; he was quite the man.\n\nSpider-Man's muscles were constantly rippling, seemingly undergoing self-repair, but the process was very, very slow.\n\nBai Yingying looked at him and found it somewhat amusing. The once clean-cut priest now looked like this; it was quite ironic, she had to admit.\n\nAnd according to the little loli, the priest had been deeply involved in this matter previously, but who told him to go research his boss's ashes halfway through when he had nothing else to do, ending up like this?\n\nBai Yingying also felt a shiver of fear. If the priest had been here in full form, perhaps even Cao Ding, sacrificing everything, might not have been able to successfully prevent the revival of these wandering souls.\n\nThis priest's ability to stir up trouble was simply too strong. It seemed he had been constantly causing problems for many years, and then he messed with his own boss,\n\nAnd then,\n\nGot himself killed.\n\nXu Qinglang leaned on the broken sofa, coughing occasionally. He had already bandaged his wounds himself; they weren't too serious. The main issue was the significant blood loss that left him feeling weak.\n\nOf those present, the one who seemed least affected was Boss Zhou, who had been sleeping from start to finish.\n\nXu Qinglang, annoyed, gently kicked Zhou Ze:\n\n\"Hey, it's over. Time to wake up, isn't it?\"\n\nIf Zhou Ze had joined earlier, perhaps everyone wouldn't have been so miserable. Even Cao Ding wouldn't have had to completely vanish. He would still have had a chance to seek an official position in Hell with his merits and incense offerings, or reincarnate for a happy and smooth next life.\n\nNo need for him to be completely annihilated, turned to nothingness, as he was now.\n\nIt wasn't that Xu Qinglang blamed Zhou Ze, but when a man isn't capable at crucial moments, when one greatly needs and craves his prowess, but he just turns his head and sleeps soundly, feigning ignorance, it's always very uncomfortable!\n\nThe little loli let out a long breath, exhaling a faint bloody mist, but her body seemed much lighter than before. She was using a breathing technique to regulate her internal injuries.\n\nOpening her eyes, she looked at the still unconscious Zhou Ze.\n\nThe little loli strangely reached out and touched Zhou Ze's forehead.\n\nBai Yingying watched the little loli's every move closely, worried that she might take a desperate measure and kill her boss while he was vulnerable.\n\n\"He should be awake,\"\n\nThe little loli said.\n\nThen, the little loli pointed to all the reflective surfaces around them, such as mirrors, picture frames, and even tiles. Without exception, all of them had dense cracks.\n\nThe barrier was broken.\n\nThe little loli had previously speculated that Zhou Ze's consciousness might be in the mirror world. Now that everything was over, he should have returned.\n\nBut then, the little loli suddenly let out a gasp, quickly retracted her hand from Zhou Ze's forehead, and examined her palm. There was actually a frostbitten mark on it.\n\n\"What's going on?\" The little loli looked at the still unconscious Zhou Ze with a solemn expression.\n\nAt this moment, Zhou Ze's face gradually began to change. His skin started to shrivel, turning a strange bronze color, and two fangs slowly pushed through the gaps in his lips. His body emanated a chill more terrifying than Bai Yingying's during combat.\n\nThis was the first time the little loli had seen Zhou Ze in this state. Before, she had only heard Old Tao jokingly say how amazing her boss was when he went \"berserk.\"\n\nNow, she believed it.\n\n\"Boss?\" Bai Yingying immediately leaned over, looking at Zhou Ze with concern.\n\n\"Is he...?\" Xu Qinglang frowned, looking at the scene before him, muttering, \"Is he having a nightmare?\"\n\n...\n\nThe collapse within the mirror world was unstoppable. Even the wandering souls in the outer regions had begun to disappear, returning to reality and naturally entering Hell, their rightful destination, which had been delayed by the peculiar environment here.\n\nThe girl faced Zhou Ze, a smile on her face. Her expression had lost its initial panic and senseless anger, appearing somewhat calm.\n\n\"Regardless, I really have to thank you.\"\n\nThe girl bowed deeply to Zhou Ze, a gesture of politeness.\n\n\"Only by following you could I be百分百 (100%) sure of escaping from here.\"\n\nYes, the girl was telling the truth. She could have chosen to act with those three Japanese samurai, but she was worried about unforeseen circumstances, such as the one who had suppressed her for five hundred years.\n\nAnd indeed, that fellow had actually abandoned his merits and incense offerings just to completely annihilate them!\n\nThat flame, now extinguished, still made the girl feel a shiver of fear.\n\nAnd by choosing to follow Zhou Ze, entering the game as one of the \"obstructors,\" if Zhou Ze won, she would be free; if Zhou Ze lost, she would be even freer. It was like betting on both sides in a war; no matter the outcome, she couldn't lose.\n\nThe phone was clutched in the girl's hand, constantly shaking up and down.\n\n\"Old people become spirits\" is a common saying to describe wise elders, because they have lived long and experienced many changes.\n\nAnd this woman had lived for five hundred years. On the basis of those five hundred years, using a little scheming and playing a few tricks was perfectly normal.\n\n\"I really didn't expect things to turn out this way,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nNow, Zhou Ze finally understood why Cao Ding hadn't chosen to directly annihilate all the aspiring samurai with a simple, brutal method from the start.\n\nBecause Cao Ding knew,\n\nThere was still one person who hadn't entered the circle,\n\nBut in the end, he had no choice but to leave a loose end, because this loose end was too cautious and too careful.\n\nCao Ding had wanted to take care of all future troubles in one go,\n\nBut he failed.\n\n\"Do you want to see what I looked like before?\"\n\nThe girl twisted her waist,\n\nSoon,\n\nShe appeared in a professional office suit, intellectual and capable.\n\nImmediately after, a dress appeared, shy and adorable.\n\nThen, a graceful Hanfu, fresh and refined.\n\nSlowly, she changed into a casual outfit, wearing white hotel slippers. These were the clothes she wore on the day she had her incident, when she was violated by the three Japanophiles.\n\nFinally,\n\nHer clothes began to melt, transforming into black fabric that slowly clung to her body. This was a female ninja's attire, her original outfit, the clothes she wore when she died!\n\nMore than five hundred years ago, she and her comrades had just landed and broken through the city gates when they were repelled by Cao Ding leading the villagers. She herself had her head severed by Cao Ding's blade during his pursuit.\n\n\"I told you, mirrors can record images. They are very objective and fair; they faithfully record everything that happened back then.\n\nBut precisely because of their fairness, they can give people a false impression that the scenes within them are all true.\n\nAnd the more real something appears, often the more lies lie behind it.\"\n\nThe female ninja tilted her head slightly, looking at Zhou Ze as if teasing a younger brother,\n\n\"Do you feel terrified now? Do you feel a sense of humiliation, as if you've been played in the palm of my hand?\"\n\nThe female ninja stepped closer, nearing Zhou Ze a little, and continued to provoke him:\n\n\"Didn't you ever wonder why those three guys coincidentally gathered here?\n\nDidn't you ever wonder why there just happened to be me next door, a Japanese girl who heard Japanese music and proactively knocked on the door wanting to join the party, only to then inexplicably resist shyly when things went wrong?\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded, admitting, \"I was careless.\"\n\nFrom the very beginning of the whole affair, Zhou Ze had been caught in the game. Whether it was \"serving time\" in someone else's place or his final actions, he had actually been manipulated.\n\n\"Hehe.\"\n\nThe female ninja laughed, very happily, and continued:\n\n\"You know, seducing those three guys was quite interesting, but they were no good, they finished quickly, their bodies were really weak. I really hadn't even started to feel comfortable, just a light squeeze and they'd already burst their dam.\"\n\nThere were a total of four ghosts,\n\nOne responsible for seduction,\n\nThree responsible for possession,\n\nClear division of labor,\n\nDone in one go.\n\nThat's how she was able to enter Zhou Ze's room from the adjacent one.\n\nOf course, when she was dismembered by Zhou Ze, she still managed to maintain her composure, flawlessly portraying a vengeful female ghost, which was indeed her skill.\n\nZhou Ze's body slowly began to change,\n\nIn fact,\n\nThe change in his body in reality was merely a conscious manifestation.\n\nIn the mirror world,\n\nZhou Ze's skin had slowly turned bronze, his flesh began to shrivel, and deep within his eyes, flickering, was a gloomy darkness like black flames.\n\nThe female ninja was a little surprised, surprised by Zhou Ze's transformation, and by the terrifying aura emanating from him now.\n\nBut she wasn't afraid.\n\nShe continued to smile:\n\n\"It's too late. This place will soon shatter. When it does, I can find any intact mirror to leave. You won't find me, and you can't catch me.\n\nI am free!\"\n\nZhou Ze slowly lowered his head,\n\nAs if he hadn't heard the girl's words at all.\n\nThe girl began to retreat. The restriction here was almost completely broken; she could leave now.\n\n\"Why... wake me... up...?\"\n\nThe girl froze, looked back, and found Zhou Ze still bowing his head.\n\nNot talking to her?\n\nThen who was he talking to?\n\nThe girl was a little confused.\n\n\"Oh... I see...\"\n\nZhou Ze seemed to be talking to himself,\n\nIn fact,\n\nHe was indeed talking to himself.\n\nHe reached into his pocket,\n\nAnd pulled out a bronze ring,\n\n\"Got it... Interesting... This thing... You can't use it... Can you?\"\n\nStill talking to himself,\n\nBut the female ninja sensed a strong sense of danger,\n\nThis sense of danger was clearer than when Zhou Ze's appearance changed and his aura became terrifying!\n\nShe started running outwards, she had to leave this place!\n\nCao Ding was dead,\n\nNo one could bind her anymore,\n\nFreedom,\n\nWas right before her!\n\n\"Ding...\"\n\nZhou Ze's black fingernail lightly flicked the ring,\n\nThe ring emitted a clear sound,\n\nAnd then,\n\nA blue light curtain radiated from the ring,\n\nInstantly enveloping this space.\n\nThe female ninja's body crashed heavily into the light curtain and was bounced back,\n\nHer eyes were filled with fear and disbelief,\n\nThe restriction that had clearly been mostly shattered just now,\n\nHad actually recovered at this moment!\n\nNo,\n\nIt wasn't that,\n\nThe female ninja realized,\n\nIt was a new restriction, re-covering this place!\n\nShe was trapped again!\n\nZhou Ze slowly raised his head, his back still slightly hunched,\n\nHis arms hung naturally, very long, with long fingernails that looked like they could touch the ground at any moment.\n\nA hint of mockery played on his lips,\n\nThe black flames in his eyes stared at the female ninja ahead with a hint of excitement,\n\nThe more he looked, the more he liked her,\n\nLike looking at a bottle of,\n\nFive-hundred-year-old aged wine...",

    "content": "Zhou Ze's body still swayed slightly, like an old man on the verge of death, or a drunken alcoholic, as if he could collapse at any moment.\n\nBut the terrifying aura emanating from him was intensely oppressive.\n\nThe female ninja tried to open the blue light barrier. She wanted to leave. She and her three companions had gone to great lengths to destroy the restrictions left by Cao Ding, but reality was so cruel.\n\nShe had finally escaped her original cage, only to enter an even larger, more solid one.\n\nZhou Ze slowly walked over, his figure still swaying slightly. As he approached, the female ninja's expression grew more serious.\n\nShe didn't dare to actively attack Zhou Ze, just like someone who accidentally falls into a tiger's cage. Their first instinct is to climb out of the cage, not foolishly fight the tiger.\n\nZhou Ze was that tiger in the cage, ready to devour people.\n\nPreviously, Zhou Ze had thought of letting the others from the bookstore fight for their lives outside while he, the boss, just watched the show, not even acting as a cheerleader. That was indeed a bit inexcusable.\n\nNow,\n\nit was rather good.\n\nZhou Ze even had to thank the woman in front of him for giving him a chance to do something, so he wouldn't be scorned by Xu Qinglang and the others after leaving the mirror world.\n\n\"We can make a deal.\"\n\nEvery prey, before dying, would try every means to find a chance to escape. The female ninja was no exception.\n\n\"Before you died... you were just an ordinary person...\"\n\nThe sarcasm on Zhou Ze's lips grew more intense.\n\nYes,\n\nfive hundred years ago, when you were killed by Cao Ding, you were just ordinary Japanese pirates. No matter how ruthless, you were still ordinary people.\n\nSince you were ordinary people, and you've been suppressed here for five hundred years, what could you possibly have that would interest me?\n\nThe female ninja showed a look of pleading.\n\nZhou Ze approached step by step.\n\nAt that moment, the female ninja's figure vanished from where she stood, instantly reappearing behind Zhou Ze. In her hand was a black dagger, which she thrust directly towards Zhou Ze's neck.\n\nEverything happened in an instant.\n\n\"Poof!\"\n\nThe dagger plunged in!\n\nThe female ninja's face lit up with joy.\n\nHer sneak attack had actually succeeded!\n\nWas he arrogant enough to think he had her completely?\n\nThe female ninja wanted to laugh at that moment, but she restrained her emotions, ready to twist the dagger and slice off Zhou Ze's entire head.\n\nBut then came the sound of \"creak, creak\" from muscle friction.\n\nNo matter how much strength the female ninja exerted, she couldn't move the dagger at all, because Zhou Ze's muscles and bones had directly jammed the dagger tightly, as if embedded in his body.\n\nThe female ninja's eyes narrowed, and she immediately chose to retreat.\n\n\"Thwack!\"\n\nBut then came a crisp sound.\n\nZhou Ze twisted his head.\n\nAnd then,\n\nthe female ninja felt her entire body fly through the air. All she heard was the rushing wind, a despair-inducing speed.\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nZhou Ze gripped the female ninja's neck with one hand, pressing her directly to the ground, sliding for nearly a hundred meters!\n\n\"Agh................\"\n\nA low murmur escaped Zhou Ze's throat, like a prayer before a meal, thanking God for such abundant food.\n\nThe female ninja's body trembled. This was not the tremble of facing an enemy. Even more than five hundred years ago, when she, as a female ninja, came to the Chinese coast with others, whether facing Ming Dynasty soldiers or finally Cao Ding, whether in victory or defeat, she had never been afraid. What's more, she now possessed five hundred more years of psychological experience than before.\n\nBut at this moment, she truly felt a fear from the depths of her soul, because she felt she wasn't facing a person, but a pressure from the food chain.\n\nIt seemed she was inherently his food. This sense of oppression was like a zebra, lost, encountering a lion.\n\nZhou Ze's nails pierced into the female ninja's neck, while the surrounding black mist instantly compressed.\n\nAround them, the sound of a juicer operating could be heard. In fact, that's what was happening.\n\nSimple,\n\ndirect,\n\nbrutal,\n\nastonishing,\n\nand also somewhat shocking, difficult to behold.\n\nA wisp of green smoke rose. Zhou Ze raised his head and inhaled sharply.\n\nThe green smoke entered his nostrils,\n\nbringing immense pleasure,\n\nlike a pampered old woman smoking a hookah.\n\nHe smacked his lips,\n\nlicked them,\n\nthen shivered slightly.\n\nEverything,\n\nwas comfortable.\n\nThe existence of a soul, even if she had existed for five hundred years and undergone special cooperation and conditioning with the priest, was, in Zhou Ze's eyes at this moment,\n\nnothing but a puff of smoke.\n\nSlowly exhaling,\n\nZhou Ze slowly sat down.\n\nHe reached out and gently placed his hand on his forehead,\n\nlike an old man after a full meal, ready to bask in the sun and take a nap.\n\nAbout a quarter of an hour passed,\n\nZhou Ze lowered his hand.\n\nHis eyes still gleamed with a strange green light,\n\nbut the expression on his face was somewhat unusual.\n\nIt was confusion,\n\npuzzlement,\n\npanic.\n\nThese emotions appeared unnatural on him. In the past, after killing Lady Green Garment, then the Japanese priest, and then eliminating the problematic ghost messenger possessing his sister-in-law in the Lin family, followed by the complete annihilation of two ghost messengers in Yancheng.\n\nIt seemed that whenever he appeared, it usually meant that whatever the situation,\n\nit was time for things to settle.\n\nBut at this moment,\n\nhe was truly a bit rattled.\n\n\"How... can I not go back?\"\n\nZhou Ze muttered to himself, as if pondering this question. At this moment, he wasn't very good at thinking, like someone waking up midway through a nap, relying entirely on his blurred consciousness,\n\ngetting out of bed,\n\nfinding a spittoon,\n\nunbuttoning his pants,\n\nturning on the faucet,\n\nthen lying back down to continue sleeping.\n\nPerhaps the next day, if anyone asked, he wouldn't even be sure if he had gotten up to urinate.\n\nZhou Ze raised his head,\n\nhis eyes filled with horror.\n\nHe stretched out a finger,\n\npointed to the sky,\n\nthen clenched his fist and slammed it heavily on the ground.\n\nHe understood.\n\n\"This time it's consciousness... the body isn't here... it's over... the body won't be able to hold on...\"\n\n...\n\n\"So, every time your boss 'goes berserk,' he turns into this?\"\n\nThe little loli asked, staring strangely at Zhou Ze's body.\n\n\"Mm, normal operation, it's fine.\"\n\nBai Yingying seemed very calm. The boss always had some issues with his body after going berserk, needing half a month to recover. She had grown accustomed to it.\n\nMoreover, Bai Yingying actually quite liked the boss when he was paralyzed, because she could take care of him completely, including bathing him. That was when the boss was most adorable, and when he needed her most.\n\n\"Cough cough...\"\n\nXu Qinglang coughed beside them, taking out a wet towel to wipe the old Taoist's face. The old Taoist was still unconscious.\n\nThe little loli continued to scrutinize Zhou Ze. Although she didn't know what happened to Zhou Ze in his dream, the changes in Zhou Ze's body at this moment were enough to make her very interested.\n\nA quarter of an hour later, the little loli pointed to Zhou Ze's right arm and asked, \"Is this also normal?\"\n\n\"Normal,\" Bai Yingying said without lifting her head.\n\nThe boss's body would suffer many injuries; this was a sign of his body being overtaxed.\n\n\"Are you sure?\"\n\nThe little loli pointed to Zhou Ze's right elbow.\n\nThe bone there was exposed, the skin and flesh torn open, and the exposed white bone was actually turning black. This was a sign of bodily decay, meaning that the nutrients within the bone were rapidly draining away, about to return to dust.\n\nHow did that song go:\n\n\"Turned into spring mud, nurturing the earth...\"\n\nThe little loli had no doubt that if Zhou Ze were thrown into the courtyard now, when they visited his grave next year, a very lush plant would likely grow there.\n\nShe could even plant a loquat tree seedling there. That way, she could write a diary later:\n\nThere is a loquat tree in the courtyard, planted by my captain in the year of his death; now it stands tall and leafy.\n\nShe turned her head and saw Bai Yingying acting as if nothing was wrong.\n\nThe little loli briefly wondered if she was overthinking it?\n\nOr was Zhou Ze's vitality just that strong?\n\nIt sounded like this happened often before,\n\nbut damn it, this was moving towards a state where he could recover even from being reduced to ashes!\n\nEven though they were all ghosts,\n\nyou still had to be a little scientific, didn't you?\n\nSo, the little loli walked over to Bai Yingying, extended her tender hand, grabbed Bai Yingying's face, and pulled her face towards the blackened, exposed bone on Zhou Ze's arm:\n\n\"I'll struggle one last time. If he can recover from this and still jump around full of life, then from now on, I'll serve him tea, fetch him water, wash his feet, and warm his bed!\"\n\nIf he could recover from this,\n\nsuch a captain, such a boss,\n\nwhat was it to her to just swallow her pride and accept it?\n\nBai Yingying suddenly felt as if she had been electrocuted.\n\nThen she opened her mouth.\n\nShe instinctively reached out and touched the exposed bone on the boss's arm.\n\n\"Thwack!\"\n\nThe bone actually caved in.\n\n\"Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!!!!\"\n\nBai Yingying began to shriek.\n\nXu Qinglang, who was still wiping the old Taoist's face, was startled white by this and spat out a mouthful of blood, which splattered onto the old Taoist's face.\n\nHe was literally scared to death!\n\nThe feeling of a zombie suddenly screaming behind you was not something an ordinary person could endure.\n\n\"Boss, Boss!\"\n\nBai Yingying knelt beside Zhou Ze, screaming hysterically, but she dared not touch Zhou Ze again, fearing that if she touched him again, another part would collapse.\n\nThe little loli let out a long breath.\n\nHer persistence was right.\n\nThis was normal. Even a Judge couldn't do this.\n\nThen,\n\nthe little loli tilted her head, staring at Zhou Ze, her fingers gently intertwined, a little conflicted.\n\nShe was thinking,\n\nif Zhou Ze just inexplicably kicked the bucket in his sleep like this,\n\nshe wouldn't really lose out, huh.\n\nNo loss, no loss,\n\ntruly no loss at all.",

    "content": "\"Boss, wake up, Boss, Boss, wake up!\"\n\nBai Yingying cried out anxiously beside him, hoping to awaken Zhou Ze. Of course, it proved to be futile.\n\nThe little loli sat on the rotten sofa nearby, swinging her legs silently. Although she secretly wished Zhou Ze would just kick the bucket, she was also afraid of over-provoking the female zombie and having her come at her.\n\nMost importantly, Zhou Ze wasn't dead yet. As long as the dust hadn't settled, it was hard to say what might happen.\n\nShe lowered her head and looked at a piece of broken glass on the floor.\n\nMost importantly,\n\nThe little loli wasn't sure,\n\nEven if Zhou Ze was unconscious, whether he still had the ability to sever her Soul-Blood.\n\nXu Qinglang also knelt beside him, checking Zhou Ze's condition. He was the first to realize what was happening and immediately said, \"Mud!\"\n\n\"Your dad?\"\n\nThe little loli was confused.\n\n\"Yes, mud, where's Monkey, where's Monkey!\"\n\nBai Yingying looked around and then realized she hadn't brought Monkey this time. Boss's current condition wouldn't benefit from being sent to a hospital. Only Monkey's mud could hope to stop Boss's continuous deterioration.\n\n\"Take Boss back!\"\n\nBai Yingying made a decision.\n\nTake Boss back to the bookstore, find Monkey!\n\nAt this moment, the little loli immediately spoke, \"Don't move him, you can't transfer him. His consciousness is very likely nearby.\"\n\nThe little loli was right. Even if she wished Zhou Ze would die sooner, she wouldn't dare to be too blatant about it.\n\n\"Also, given his current physical condition, how would you transfer him? Aren't you afraid his body will just fall apart?\" the little loli added.\n\n\"Then what do we do?\"\n\nBai Yingying was clearly a bit flustered.\n\n\"Wake up Old Daoist,\" Xu Qinglang pointed to the unconscious Old Daoist. \"He has Monkey's phone number.\"\n\nAn outsider hearing this would probably find it very strange.\n\nBut the truth was,\n\nMonkey in the bookstore had a phone.\n\nAnd the person bored enough to buy Monkey a phone was Old Daoist.\n\nWhen Monkey had nothing to do, he would use his phone in the bookstore to play music via Bluetooth, and he could even help Old Daoist film when Old Daoist was livestreaming.\n\nBut besides Old Daoist, no one else in the bookstore would bother getting Monkey's number and saving it.\n\nXu Qinglang first fumbled around Old Daoist's body. He found the phone, but it had been destroyed in the previous battle. Finally, Xu Qinglang let out a long sigh and pointed at Old Daoist:\n\n\"We have to wake him up.\"\n\nWithout another word, Bai Yingying stabbed her fingernail into Old Daoist's chest. A cold chill instantly permeated him.\n\nOld Daoist's body shivered, and he immediately opened his eyes.\n\n\"Hiss... I'm freezing to death!\"\n\nThis was a method of stimulating life potential, but Old Daoist had just been possessed by a ghost, which had already stimulated his potential once. With another stimulation this time, the seventy-year-old Old Daoist's body truly struggled to endure it.\n\nOld Daoist was awake, but he instinctively hugged himself, shivering violently, his lips purple, clearly frozen.\n\n\"I'll use my Corpse Elixir to warm and nourish your body and help you recover your vitality.\"\n\nBai Yingying spoke seriously to Old Daoist. She knew how much damage forcibly waking him up at this moment would do to his body, but things had reached this point, and she had no choice.\n\nOld Daoist continuously exhaled white mist, trembling as he first looked at Bai Yingying, then at Boss lying beside him.\n\n\"Boss is in trouble. He needs Monkey's mud,\" Bai Yingying said.\n\nOld Daoist nodded. \"1... 3... 8...\"\n\nOld Daoist recited Monkey's phone number. Xu Qinglang dialed it, and soon someone answered:\n\n\"Squeak squeak squeak...\" Monkey's voice sounded quite cheerful.\n\n\"Boss is in trouble. Come to the Hot Spring Inn in General Mountain, find us.\" Xu Qinglang said, trying to ignore the strong sense of incongruity.\n\nNormally, Xu Qinglang would think he'd lost his mind to say something like this to a monkey, and even call a monkey.\n\n\"Monk...ey... come...\"\n\nOld Daoist shouted, trembling beside him.\n\n\"Squeak squeak squeak... squeak squeak squeak...\"\n\nThere was another series of squeaks from the other end of the phone, and then it was hung up.\n\nXu Qinglang looked at his phone, still somewhat disbelieving. He said, \"Can it come?\"\n\n\"It's very smart.\"\n\nOld Daoist said, then lay back down on the ground. He was feeling very uncomfortable. In fact, a flush even appeared on his face, turning it rosy and radiant.\n\nXu Qinglang's pupils immediately constricted, and he shouted at Old Daoist, \"Hold on, you can't sleep now!\"\n\nYou're showing signs of a final burst of energy,\n\nXu Qinglang was really worried that Old Daoist would kick the bucket before Zhou Ze did.\n\n\"Buzz!\"\n\nBai Yingying spat out a white, cold, glowing pearl elixir from her mouth, which floated to Old Daoist's chest.\n\nOld Daoist let out a long sigh,\n\nHe felt a warm sensation flow through his limbs and bones, and he was much more comfortable.\n\nImmediately, he closed his eyes and fell back into a deep sleep.\n\nMeanwhile, Bai Yingying continued to keep her pearl elixir hovering over Old Daoist's chest to sustain his life. Her own skin, however, began to look haggard and wrinkled. Her original high school student appearance was slowly aging.\n\nThe little loli sat on the side, looking at the group of people constantly courting death, feeling truly speechless.\n\nShe jumped off the sofa. As she took one step, Bai Yingying's previously weak eyes suddenly sharpened.\n\n\"Don't even think about it.\"\n\n\"There you go again,\" the little loli shrugged. \"Why do you love threatening me so much?\"\n\n\"If Boss dies, he'll definitely take you down with him.\"\n\n\"Can't you come up with a fresh line?\"\n\nThe little loli looked up,\n\nHolding her forehead,\n\nThrough the gaps in her fingers, her green eyes were still watching the blue light curtain flickering above.\n\nActually, the ring had already returned to Zhou Ze's side.\n\nBut once the light curtain was activated, even if the ring was immediately withdrawn, it would continue to exist for a period of time.\n\nIn other words, just now, Zhou Ze had used the ring to reset the barrier, trapping himself while he was trapping the female ninja.\n\nIt was hard to imagine what his body would be like after such a long time.\n\nIn the past, he would automatically exit this state after a short while due to his body's critical condition. But this time, his consciousness and body were separated due to the mirror, which meant his body couldn't directly affect Zhou Ze's consciousness. The ultimate result would be his body completely breaking down, until it disintegrated!\n\nZhou Ze's chest heaved continuously,\n\nEvery minute that passed made him more dangerous.\n\nBut he had no other choice, no more room for maneuver,\n\nHe could only continue to sit like this,\n\nAnd wait like this.\n\nLayers of faint, crystalline light continuously ascended from Zhou Ze's body. The reaction of his consciousness affected his body, and the collapse of his body also affected his consciousness.\n\nA mirror isolated everything.\n\nIt even prevented Zhou Ze from disconnecting from his body and becoming a wandering spirit. His soul and body were disconnected, like two bound stones that would sink to the bottom of the sea together and drown.\n\nThe final outcome would be a complete collapse for both, neither side able to escape.\n\nThe blue light curtain was also noticeably diminishing,\n\nBut Zhou Ze felt he couldn't hold on until the light curtain dissipated,\n\nThis pit,\n\nIt was too deep.\n\n\"This time... I'm really... going to... kill myself...\"\n\nJust then,\n\nZhou Ze suddenly saw a layer of black substance appearing on his skin, covering his body like a dog-skin plaster.\n\n\"Low-end... trash...\"\n\nZhou Ze subconsciously reached out to peel off this thing that had suddenly appeared on him,\n\nBut in the next instant,\n\nHe stopped,\n\nHe saw that after these black things covered his body,\n\nThe speed at which the crystalline essence was evaporating from his body,\n\nHad clearly slowed down.\n\n\"...What are you doing?\" Bai Yingying leaned weakly on the ground, watching the little loli rummaging through the rubble below.\n\n\"You really deserve to be drowned in a pig cage!\"\n\nThe little loli cursed viciously,\n\nThen, from the pile of rubble, she continuously picked out broken pieces of armor. The second Onimusha had been beheaded by Cao Ding's blade, so all of his armor except the helmet remained. Under the statue, the last Onimusha had been burned to death, and all of his armor except the helmet had melted.\n\nConveniently, the little loli gathered all of them, making a complete set.\n\nThe little loli came back with the items,\n\nBent down,\n\nAnd put the armor on Zhou Ze's body.\n\n\"Does it help?\" Xu Qinglang asked.\n\n\"Even a kitchen knife, if nourished by a ghost for five hundred years, can become a magic tool,\" the little loli scoffed at Xu Qinglang and continued with her work.\n\nSoon,\n\nZhou Ze's body was fitted with black Japanese samurai armor.\n\n\"Creak... creak... creak...\"\n\nCracking sounds continued to emanate,\n\nThe little loli was worried at first,\n\nBut upon closer observation, she realized,\n\nIt wasn't Zhou Ze's body that was breaking now, but this set of armor that was slowly cracking, meaning the armor was bearing the damage for Zhou Ze.\n\nWhat the little loli didn't see was,\n\nThe previously raw and bleeding parts of Zhou Ze's skin, in subtle ways,\n\nHad already begun a strange fusion with this set of armor.",

    "content": "還記得十來年前大街小巷隨處可見的爆玉米花的人麼？\n\n\n\n  帶著自己的小爐，\n\n\n\n  溫著炭火，\n\n\n\n  搖動著把手，\n\n\n\n  小灶裡面不斷地發出「吧啦吧啦」的脆響，同時瀰漫出淡淡的香味。\n\n\n\n  此時的周澤就是這樣，\n\n\n\n  在小蘿莉將日本武士盔甲給周澤穿上去之後，盔甲和周澤的身體就不停地會發出這種「脆響」，像是雞蛋被敲碎倒入油鍋里一樣。\n\n\n\n  白鶯鶯站在邊上，不時關切地看著，她現在容顏逐漸地老去都沒有絲毫的在意，只是全身心地關注著自家的老闆。\n\n\n\n  許清朗在旁邊點了一根煙，一個人「吧唧吧唧」地抽著。\n\n\n\n  就像是普通的人家，如果有人生了重病，但凡重感情的人家都會砸鍋賣鐵送醫院去治療，無論這個家是否會破敗掉，至少得一家人整整齊齊。\n\n\n\n  許清朗現在就是這個感覺，不管大家受了多重的傷，付出了多大的代價，只要最後每個人都沒事的話，還是划算的。\n\n\n\n  「丫頭，把你這珠子收回去吧，貧道沒事了。」\n\n\n\n  老道已經睡了倆小時醒來了，睜開眼看見那珠子居然還在自己胸口上起起伏伏著，又看了看身邊頭髮都變白了的白鶯鶯，頗覺得心疼。 \n\n\n\n  多好的女娃子，雖然是殭屍，但也長得俊俏得很，為了自己這個七十歲的糟老頭子變成這樣，真糟蹋了。\n\n\n\n  不得不說，老道雖然平時做人有點渾，偷雞摸狗的事兒也沒少做，但很少有人知道，他一直在捐資助學，光是大涼山那邊，就捐助了百來個學生。\n\n\n\n  當初周澤曾問過他明明開直播也賺了不少錢，為什麼現在還孑然一身，連一套房子都沒有。\n\n\n\n  就算直播是近些年新興的產業，但周澤覺得老道以前做這種「封建迷信」的勾當再憑藉他那一套三寸不爛之舌，忽悠錢的能力也應該是很可觀的，不至於混得這麼差。\n\n\n\n  原因，就在這裡。\n\n\n\n  老道一直覺得自己是道門世家，祖宗以下，到自己之前，雖然一代不如一代，但終究是有點道行有點追求的，只是到了自己這一代，就徹底成了不入流的角色，他也只能靠做這些事情想著以後去了地下萬一見了歷代祖宗，至少還能有一件事能說出來，不至於全然給祖宗丟臉。\n\n\n\n  白鶯鶯見老道醒了，檢查了一下老道的身體情況，見他不會有生命危險，當下將自己的丹珠收了回來，但此時的她已經皮膚褶皺頭髮花白了，頗有一種「白髮魔女傳」中練霓裳的觀感。\n\n\n\n  小蘿莉一直蹲在旁邊，看著周澤的情況，雖然周澤的傷勢還在不斷地惡化著，但可以看出的是，這種惡化的速度比一開始真的減慢了太多太多。 \n\n\n\n  伸出自己的嫩手，小蘿莉試著去拉開盔甲看看，卻驚愕地發現周澤破裂的血肉居然和盔甲粘合在了一起。\n\n\n\n  這到底是好是壞，\n\n\n\n  小蘿莉拿不準，\n\n\n\n  她也不敢把這個發現給說出來，生怕刺激到這個已經護主心切到有些失心瘋的女殭屍。\n\n\n\n  老道艱難地坐起來，從許清朗那邊接過水，喝了兩口，然後又看了看老闆的模樣。\n\n\n\n  也就在這時，\n\n\n\n  上方忽然有一塊嵌進牆壁里的玻璃碎裂了，\n\n\n\n  而後，\n\n\n\n  一道可怖的氣息猛然降臨！\n\n\n\n  女殭屍身體一顫，\n\n\n\n  嚇得匍匐在了地上，\n\n\n\n  這是一種來自血脈上的壓制，讓她不得不臣服。\n\n\n\n  一邊的蜘蛛俠神父在此時也猛地睜開眼，跪伏在了地上，不顧自己的傷勢還在瑟瑟發抖。\n\n\n\n  小蘿莉一臉凝重地站起來，大氣都不敢出一口，但額頭上已經有冷汗滴落了下來，這種氣息，太可怕了，仿佛只要對方願意，就能夠將自己的靈魂從這具身體裡給拘出來吞掉。\n\n\n\n  反倒是老道和許清朗就沒什麼感覺，因為他們層次不夠，體驗不到這種細節。 \n\n\n\n  下一刻，\n\n\n\n  那股氣息消失了。\n\n\n\n  白鶯鶯馬上爬過去看老闆。\n\n\n\n  周澤眼睛微微顫了顫，緩緩睜開了眼，他第一眼看見的是一頭白髮容顏憔悴的白鶯鶯。\n\n\n\n  「唉。」\n\n\n\n  嘆了口氣，\n\n\n\n  周澤又閉上了眼。\n\n\n\n  一來是這個時候，他的身體情況不允許說太多話做什麼事情，\n\n\n\n  二來，這個時候說太多就矯情了，兩世為人，兩世光棍，處理這種事情，周澤一貫不擅長。\n\n\n\n  所以，\n\n\n\n  他繼續閉眼，\n\n\n\n  裝死吧。\n\n\n\n  這就像是渣男玩過了人家就拉黑聯繫方式裝失蹤，這是男人天生就點亮的科技樹，不需要人去教。\n\n\n\n  「他醒了。」小蘿莉說道。\n\n\n\n  「吱吱吱………………」\n\n\n\n  就在這時，\n\n\n\n  猴子的聲音從外面響起，它居然真的找到這裡來了！\n\n\n\n  真是一隻聰明到令人髮指的猴砸！\n\n\n\n  ………………\n\n\n\n  如果說，一開始周澤只是因為不太好意思面對白鶯鶯、許清朗老道他們，是在故意裝睡的話，那之後，其實就是真的又昏迷過去了。 \n\n\n\n  這次身體，被掏空得太厲害，當然，靈魂上的消耗也不少。\n\n\n\n  也不知道昏睡了多久，可能有小半個月的時間吧。\n\n\n\n  當周澤再睜開眼時，發現自己正躺在書屋二樓臥室的床上，白鶯鶯正在用濕毛巾給自己擦身子。\n\n\n\n  入眼的，\n\n\n\n  還是白髮。\n\n\n\n  周澤下意識地抬起手，指尖觸碰到了白鶯鶯的發端。\n\n\n\n  白鶯鶯身體一顫，側過頭，帶著驚喜的目光看著周澤，喊道：「老闆，你醒啦？」\n\n\n\n  「嗯。」\n\n\n\n  周澤應了一聲。\n\n\n\n  「想坐起來麼？」\n\n\n\n  周澤點點頭。\n\n\n\n  白鶯鶯拿了枕頭幫周澤墊了一下，讓他靠著窗沿坐了下來。\n\n\n\n  「你的臉…………」周澤開口道。\n\n\n\n  聞言，白鶯鶯的臉上露出了些許的落寞，她似乎是覺得自家老闆覺得自己不漂亮不好看不像是高中生那樣水嫩了就不要自己了，有些焦急道：\n\n\n\n  「老闆你放心，我會抓緊時間修煉回來的，把本源給補充回來，我可以蒙面蒙紗，如果你不喜歡的話…………」\n\n\n\n  周澤搖搖頭，沒表示什麼，等自己把身體養好，自己應該有辦法幫白鶯鶯把失去的本源給補充回來。 \n\n\n\n  其實，\n\n\n\n  這件事上，還是自己錯了，同情心泛濫，管什麼鬼來電。\n\n\n\n  雖然結局圓滿了，但在這個過程上，無法否認的是，自己是上了人家的圈套，且讓自己身邊的人也因此涉險，同時付出了極大的代價。\n\n\n\n  明明開個書屋，當個鬼差，收收小鬼，看看報紙，喝喝咖啡，小日子過得悠閒，偏偏不懂得去珍惜，總想著當什麼大英雄。\n\n\n\n  周澤有些自嘲地笑了笑，然後道：「幫我洗澡。」\n\n\n\n  「嗯，好的，老闆！」\n\n\n\n  每次周澤癱瘓醒來後，第一個要求就是讓自己幫他洗澡，因為老闆有潔癖，不能忍受自己身上髒的感覺。\n\n\n\n  白鶯鶯很開心，因為她覺得周澤肯願意讓她繼續給他洗澡，是沒嫌棄她。\n\n\n\n  這是一個天真單純的女孩子，雖然，她並不是那麼的單純，但至少在和自己相處時，她真的是這樣。\n\n\n\n  有時候周澤會回憶起自己當時在老書店用攝像頭記錄的畫面看見醒來的白鶯鶯下來用舌頭在自己水杯里攪拌時的畫面，\n\n\n\n  現在想想，\n\n\n\n  都覺得那時的她，帶著些許的調皮。\n\n\n\n  興許人和人就是這樣，相處久了，也相處習慣後，對一件事，就會產生不同的看法了。 \n\n\n\n  周澤似乎也忘了，當初自己看見監控視頻里這個畫面時，是被嚇得個半死的。\n\n\n\n  白鶯鶯抱著周澤下了樓，進了衛生間，老道和許清朗他們都不在，白鶯鶯說老道去考駕照了，老許則是又回老家了。\n\n\n\n  周澤記得上次老許說他老家遷墳時出了什麼事兒，不過自己當時好像在忙什麼事情也沒細問，他也沒細說。\n\n\n\n  至於神父，正在那裡勤勤懇懇地打掃著衛生，他的蜘蛛俠衣服在上次戰鬥中破裂了，老道給他又買了幾套衣服，是「死侍」的衣服。\n\n\n\n  老道說這種款式才適合他，反正都是皮肉燒焦見不得人的主兒。\n\n\n\n  坐在衛生間的小馬紮上，白鶯鶯細心地給周澤打著沐浴露，周澤身上有不少的爛泥，不用想都知道是什麼玩意兒。\n\n\n\n  但這玩意兒就是管用，尤其是治療外傷時更是有奇效，周澤哪怕再有潔癖也只能捏著鼻子認了。\n\n\n\n  「等我身體養好了，我幫你恢復。」周澤對白鶯鶯說道。\n\n\n\n  「嗯，謝謝老闆。」白鶯鶯繼續幫周澤搓著身子，然後道：「老闆，沐浴露不夠了，我去外面拿。」\n\n\n\n  周澤點了點頭。\n\n\n\n  白鶯鶯走出了衛生間。\n\n\n\n  微微側過頭，周澤強撐著站起身，身上各處骨頭都傳來了脆響，這是臥床太久的緣故。 \n\n\n\n  看著鏡子裡的自己一臉的鬍渣，周澤忽然覺得有些陌生。\n\n\n\n  不過，這次好像比之前幾次都要好一些，也不知道是否是因為躺了更久的緣故，總之這次醒來時身上的外傷基本都恢復了，當然，這身子還是很虛弱。\n\n\n\n  虛弱到，\n\n\n\n  周澤腳下忽然一個打滑，\n\n\n\n  整個人直接摔了下來，\n\n\n\n  周澤下意識地用手臂先著地企圖抵消慣性。\n\n\n\n  「嗡！」\n\n\n\n  落地後的疼痛感沒有那麼清晰，\n\n\n\n  正當周澤有些意外時，\n\n\n\n  忽然看見自己手臂位置，出現了黑色的甲冑，它阻擋了自己落地時的衝擊。\n\n\n\n  周澤慢慢地重新站起來，\n\n\n\n  伸手去觸摸這忽然出現的這片甲冑，發現這東西像是長在自己手臂上一樣，撕下來的話可能自己那塊位置也得血肉模糊。\n\n\n\n  周澤重新看向鏡子裡的自己，\n\n\n\n  然後默默地後退兩步，\n\n\n\n  微微抬起頭，\n\n\n\n  下一刻，\n\n\n\n  一套黑色的日本武士甲冑慢慢地自周澤身上各個部位浮現而出，\n\n\n\n  將他整個人都包裹在了裡面，\n\n\n\n  封閉的衛生間裡，\n\n\n\n  也當即颳起了陣陣陰風…………",

    "content": "The main materials of this armor were bamboo, leather, and some metal. It was entirely black and exquisitely crafted, making it a feast for the eyes.\n\nActually, when compared to the armors of other countries from the same period, Japanese samurai armor was not superior in terms of defense or practicality. This was because for a long time, the Japanese had been cooped up on their own islands, playing their own village-chief-level \"Warring States period.\"\n\nBut putting aside a series of shortcomings,\n\nThe key was that it looked good.\n\nEven Zhou Ze, at this moment, looking at himself in the mirror, encased in the armor, felt no discomfort or anger at this sudden addition. Instead, he thought that regardless of its practicality or defensive capabilities, just appearing suddenly during a fight would make him feel \"cool and flashy.\"\n\nIf there were an old Taoist priest nearby to accompany him with a classical BGM, the effect would be even better.\n\nPerhaps influenced by modern Japanese cultural products, at least for Zhou Ze, he truly didn't dislike this set of armor.\n\nZhou Ze remembered that when he was a child in the orphanage, after dinner, a large group of children would regularly gather in the living room, which had the only TV in the whole school. They would all sit on small stools, waiting to watch cartoons.\n\nAt that time, VCRs and later VCDs and DVDs were not yet widespread, so they basically watched whatever was on TV.\n\nFor a period, a Japanese anime, \"Ronin Warriors,\" was a huge hit across the mainland, sparking a massive craze. Even viewed with modern eyes, the anime's armor design and some of its chuunibyou-esque* BGM still didn't feel outdated or stale.\n\nHe stretched out his arm,\n\nlifted his leg,\n\ntwisted his waist.\n\nEven though he felt a bit weak, Zhou Ze still insisted on striking a few poses in front of the mirror, much like an old man suddenly acting like a young hothead.\n\nAfter he had played enough, Zhou Ze closed his eyes. The armor quickly disappeared. He let out a long sigh and sat back down, already drenched in sweat.\n\nBai Yingying had also returned with shower gel and re-entered the bathroom. Seeing Zhou Ze sweating again, she didn't understand why, but could only help him wash up again.\n\nEnjoying the service of his maid, Boss Zhou, after showering and changing into clean clothes, was helped by Bai Yingying to his favorite spot on the sofa.\n\nOn the coffee table in front of him were a plate of candies, coffee, and a newspaper.\n\nLeisurely afternoons should be spent wasting time.\n\nBoss Zhou quickly reverted to his \"salted fish\" role.** Perhaps, this was simply his nature. Moreover, after the last incident, Zhou Ze began to instinctively reject any activities that required him to leave the bookstore.\n\nHis personality was somewhat selfish, with a \"I'll be a salted fish to my heart's content, and after I'm salted to death, let the floods rage\" kind of attitude.\n\nThe old Taoist priest returned at this moment, drenched in sweat. Seeing Zhou Ze leaning on the sofa reading the newspaper, the old Taoist priest \"hehe\" chuckled excitedly, immediately grabbed a cold beer, and came over, saying:\n\n\"Boss, it feels really good to come home and see you sitting here reading the newspaper as usual.\"\n\nThe old Taoist's unspoken meaning,\n\nwas like a husband who had worked hard all day returning home to see his wife nursing the baby, and all his fatigue vanished.\n\nIn short, it sounded a bit strange.\n\nZhou Ze glanced at the old Taoist, seeing him energetic and walking vigorously. He suddenly felt a bit envious of this guy. After that incident, even with Bai Yingying's corpse pill extending his life, it only ensured he wouldn't die. He hadn't expected the old Taoist's vitality to be so strong. How long had it been, and he was already recovered?\n\nA seventy-year-old man with such terrifying vitality, and still able to get an erection in the morning while always thinking about those frivolous things, was truly enviable.\n\n\"How's your body?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nRegardless, he still had to show some concern, even though Zhou Ze felt the old Taoist could probably handle a \"one dragon playing with two phoenixes\" all night without issue.\n\n\"Very good, I feel even stronger than before.\" The old Taoist patted his chest and sat down beside Zhou Ze, then discreetly pointed at Bai Yingying, who was busy in the back, and whispered:\n\n\"Boss, can you solve Yingying's problem?\"\n\n\"I'll solve it when I recover.\"\n\n\"That's good. She's a pretty girl.\" The old Taoist smacked his lips, went to the bathroom, then came out and turned on the big TV, flipping through channels casually.\n\n\"Oh, Boss, there's a ball game today, do you want to watch?\"\n\n\"Not interested.\" Zhou Ze wasn't a football fan.\n\n\"Tongcheng Ziyun's match, it seems they're playing a Chinese Super League team, the FA Cup.\n\nA China League Two team playing a Chinese Super League team, that's quite rare. I'll take a look.\"\n\nThe old Taoist wasn't really a football fan either, but he did have some connection to football teams. Years ago, when he traveled across the country, he was invited to the home stadiums of many football clubs to perform rituals. The purpose was to bless the team's home ground and bring them good luck.\n\nPerhaps those few teams were unlucky; their shots at home always hit the post or they had various bad luck. Anyway, the old Taoist either got lucky, or the players felt a psychological boost from their home ground being blessed, and their home performance immediately improved. The old Taoist became very popular for this, and after gaining a reputation, he was invited by several other clubs to perform rituals.\n\nTo say that Chinese people are truly superstitious is actually not many. While temples are bustling with worshippers, most people are just there for the lively atmosphere. They bow in front of every statue, following a \"cast a wide net\" approach, and this isn't really superstition. Before a building project starts or a TV show begins filming, a ritual table is often set up with incense to seek good fortune.\n\nHowever, the old Taoist went too far a few years ago and created a \"butterfly effect.\" If you invited a Taoist priest, I would invite a shaman or a monk. In short, one after another, various deities came to bestow blessings, fully showcasing the local cultural characteristics of each club, creating a very lively scene.\n\nBut this was captured by fans and uploaded online. While the fans were just joking, it caught the attention of the authorities. The Football Association immediately issued a document prohibiting clubs from engaging in such activities again.\n\nBecause of this, the old Taoist's source of income was cut off, and he had to switch to the live streaming industry. But that's another story.\n\n...\n\nXu Qinglang didn't drive back to his hometown; he took shared rides both ways. When he finished his business in his hometown and took a shared ride back, he noticed the driver seemed to be secretly scrutinizing him the whole way.\n\nWell,\n\nXu Qinglang was already somewhat used to and immune to such scrutiny. He was well aware of his own appearance and temperament, and there was nothing he could do about it.\n\nHowever, the driver seemed a bit off, occasionally pulling out his phone to check it, and then deliberately looking at him through the rearview mirror. Finally, the driver couldn't help but ask:\n\n\"Are you a cross-dresser?\"\n\nXu Qinglang didn't understand the meaning for a moment.\n\nThe driver shook his head, then looked at his phone screen again, and asked, \"Are you a man or a woman?\"\n\n\"A man.\"\n\nXu Qinglang then pointed at the driver and said, \"What are you looking at?\"\n\n\"Oh, nothing.\"\n\n\"Tell me, what are you looking at?\" Xu Qinglang insisted.\n\nNot to mention the domineering aura of someone with twenty-some sets of [clothes/identities],\n\nJust the temperament he had developed from seeing and experiencing so much recently,\n\nXu Qinglang's words now carried a kind of Empress Wu Zetian-like pressure.\n\nPerhaps the driver was young and not as psychologically robust as an old hand. In his nervousness, he pointed directly at the screen and said:\n\n\"We have driver ratings here that passengers can't see;\n\nI saw the comments here saying you're very beautiful, and some people were guessing whether you're a man or a woman. I took your order earlier because I saw that comment and was interested, even though your route is quite different from mine.\"\n\n\"Boring.\"\n\nXu Qinglang shook his head disdainfully and closed his eyes.\n\nAbout twenty minutes later, the car arrived at the bookstore. Xu Qinglang got out and saw quite a few people inside the bookstore, and they were all living people.\n\nHe pushed the door open and walked in, seeing Zhou Ze sitting at the counter.\n\n\"You're awake,\" Xu Qinglang greeted.\n\n\"Mm,\" Zhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"Why is it so lively?\" Xu Qinglang asked.\n\nZhou Ze pointed to the big TV screen and said, \"It started with the old Taoist watching the game, and then a lot of passersby saw it through the glass window and came in to watch together.\"\n\n\"Paying a hundred yuan just to watch a ball game?\" Xu Qinglang couldn't quite understand.\n\nActually, Tongcheng had gone a long time without a professional football team, but since one was established two years ago, it attracted many fans. Even for a China League Two match, nearly ten thousand people would attend in person, and the popularity already surpassed some Chinese Super League teams.\n\n\"Damn it, we're two-nil down! Screw this, I'm not watching anymore!\"\n\nA middle-aged man with many tattoos on his body swore a few times, then reluctantly went to the counter to pay.\n\n\"What a rip-off! I only ordered two Sprites, and you charge me a hundred. And the kicker is, we're two goals down in the first half! I'm really paying to suffer.\"\n\nThe tattooed man thought for a moment, then put the hundred yuan he was about to take out back into his pocket. He said to Zhou Ze:\n\n\"Boss, how can you have the nerve to charge me? I'm from around here, my nickname is Brother Qiang. If you ever need anything, just let me know...\"\n\n\"No charge,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\nThe tattooed man \"hehe\" chuckled, pointed a finger at Zhou Ze, implying that he was sensible. In reality, someone who could open a shop on South Street was long beyond the reach of such an outwardly tough but inwardly weak hooligan.\n\nThe tattooed man pulled out a cigarette, bit it, lit it, and pushed the bookstore door open to walk out with a swagger.\n\n\"Clueless idiot,\" Xu Qinglang scoffed from the side.\n\nHe understood why Zhou Ze had suddenly been so kind as to not charge him. It was definitely not due to any threat.\n\nWhat a joke,\n\nA grim reaper threatened by a petty thug in the human world? How could he even continue to do his job?\n\nPlus, considering Boss Zhou's miserly, Scrooge-like personality, would he really let money slip away?\n\nThe truth was, Xu Qinglang had also noticed that the tattooed thug had a dark complexion and a faint dark aura surrounding him, clearly indicating that he had recently attracted some unclean things. If he didn't get help from someone with spiritual power to ward off the disaster, he would at best fall seriously ill, and at worst, he might get into a car accident on the road.\n\nThe money of a dying man, just don't take it. Maybe in a few days, he'd still come to the bookstore. If you can't collect his money while he's alive, you'll still collect it after he dies. Boss Zhou was firmly in control.\n\nZhou Ze silently lit a cigarette.\n\nThe exterior of the bookstore was all glass, so they could clearly see the tattooed man who had just walked out.\n\nThe tattooed man took a deep drag from his cigarette, walked out, and was just about to exhale when,\n\na pregnant woman happened to walk past him.\n\nThe tattooed man looked at the woman's swollen belly and immediately forced himself to hold back the smoke. Anyone who smoked knew the uncomfortable sensation of swallowing a mouthful of smoke, like swallowing half a mouthful of mustard.\n\nAfter the pregnant woman had passed,\n\nthe tattooed man bent over, dry heaving onto the ground.\n\nBoss Zhou exhaled a puff of smoke. Xu Qinglang, beside him, also witnessed this scene.\n\n\"Go help him break the curse,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nXu Qinglang nodded.\n\n---\n*Chuunibyou: A Japanese term that translates to \"middle school second-year syndrome.\" It's a condition where teenagers (or adults who never grew out of it) believe they possess special powers, hidden knowledge, or a secret destiny, often leading to exaggerated and dramatic behavior. In this context, it refers to the anime's \"over-the-top\" or dramatically cool elements.\n\n**Salted fish: In Chinese slang, \"salted fish\" (鹹魚) refers to someone who is lazy, unmotivated, and has no aspirations or drive, similar to the English idiom \"couch potato.\" The phrase \"咸鱼翻身\" (salted fish turns over) means to make a comeback or turn one's life around, so being a \"salted fish\" implies the opposite.",

    "content": "\"Hey, hold it right there.\"\n\nXu Qinglang pushed open the bookstore door and called out to the tattooed man who had just finished coughing.\n\nThe tattooed man froze, turned sideways, still with a cigarette dangling from his mouth. He looked at Xu Qinglang with a lecherous, playful glint in his eyes and said,\n\n\"Bro, I've been wanting to say this, you're really good-looking. Did you get that done in Thailand?\"\n\n\"............\" Xu Qinglang.\n\n\"Bro, something up? You're not here to get that hundred kuai back, are you? Let me tell you, your boss himself said it was on the house. Don't even think about getting it from me. When you run a business, you gotta be honest, right?\"\n\nThe tattooed man exuded an air of \"I'm so cool.\"\n\n\"Nothing. Just came out to tell you good night.\"\n\nXu Qinglang naturally shook his head, turned, and went back into the bookshop, leaving not a single cloud behind.\n\nGood night?\n\nThe tattooed man was stunned, his mind wondering if this guy had a crush on him.\n\nHe was a very upright person,\n\nBut this guy was so pretty,\n\nMaybe bending a little sometimes was understandable?\n\nShouldn't a true man be able to bend and stretch?\n\nThe tattooed man kept overthinking things, unaware that his loose tongue had just cost him a lifeline.\n\nZhou Ze was a bit surprised to see Xu Qinglang go out and come back so quickly. He asked,\n\n\"What's wrong?\"\n\n\"Nothing.\" Xu Qinglang walked behind the bar and started mixing himself a cocktail. \"Too lazy to save him.\"\n\n\"Oh.\"\n\nZhou Ze responded, saying nothing more.\n\nIf you have no relation to someone, you help them if you like them. It's a simple favor.\n\nIf you don't like them, turning a blind eye is also understandable.\n\nActually, the Old Xu from the beginning was a very positive person. He once urged Zhou Ze to help people, and Zhou Ze was annoyed by him back then.\n\nNow, Xu Qinglang has not only been influenced by Zhou Ze into a laid-back \"salted fish\" state in his lifestyle, but he's also become much more indifferent in this regard.\n\nPerhaps it's because he's seen too many亡魂 (departed souls) and their tragic stories; when you see things too often, you become numb.\n\nIn the first half of the match, Tongcheng Zhiyun FC was already two goals behind, which led to a significant drop in the audience. Most people were just watching for the excitement, instinctively supporting their hometown team. But seeing them two goals down in the first half, and it being a lower-tier league team playing a CSL team, everyone felt there was no hope and didn't want to watch anymore.\n\nHowever, sitting next to Zhou Ze were two middle-aged men who were still watching with keen interest. One wore a red shirt, sitting there and watching, not saying a word from beginning to end.\n\nThe other leaned on the side of the bar, propped on a crutch, holding a briefcase.\n\nNeither of these men were actually very old, only in their forties.\n\n\"No hope, no hope.\"\n\nThe middle-aged man with the crutch sighed regretfully.\n\nThe two young people next to him glared annoyed, apparently thinking that while it was fine not to watch at this point, being so negative was irritating.\n\nThe middle-aged man didn't get angry and continued to drink his cocktail. It was a 98 kuai cocktail. The middle-aged man had specifically asked about the price after coming in and felt that ordering ice water wouldn't be worth it, but this one would basically meet the minimum spend, so it wasn't a loss.\n\nIn fact, he was a meticulous person. It was quite surprising that such a person would be willing to walk into a \"black shop\" with a minimum spend of 100 kuai.\n\nHe didn't even know why himself. While running errands, he passed by, saw the match being broadcast inside, and was inexplicably drawn to sit down.\n\n\"Only two goals behind, it's not that bad, is it?\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nBoss Zhou wasn't a football fan, but he'd watched the first half. The two teams were actually playing back and forth, but the Tongcheng team was unlucky and conceded two goals to the CSL team. The chances were actually equal.\n\n\"It's different, it's different.\" The middle-aged man took a sip of his drink, explaining like an expert commentator: \"Actually, CSL teams playing against China League Two teams will inevitably feel a bit unaccustomed at first.\n\nBecause according to the Chinese Football Association regulations, China League Two can't have foreign players, they're all Chinese players. But the CSL has foreign players, and these past few years, more and more capital moguls have entered the CSL, buying stronger and stronger foreign players, even top-tier stars in their prime.\n\nSo, CSL teams, whether in matches or training, rely heavily on foreign players. When they suddenly play a match without foreign players, they're a bit unaccustomed. China League Two teams, because they don't have foreign players, play as they usually do, and their coordination is better.\n\nTherefore, the first half is crucial for an upset. And after one half, the CSL team can adapt to the rhythm without foreign players. Plus, the strength of the CSL team's Chinese players is much higher than those in China League Two. They often play better in the second half than in the first.\n\nNow, the problem is that this China League Two team is two goals behind in the first half, when they had their best chance. They'll have even less of a chance in the second half. And this CSL team is the defending champion of the last Chinese FA Cup; they won't let their guard down.\"\n\nThe middle-aged man's analysis only received a silent nod from Zhou Ze. Feeling a bit unsatisfied, he continued, \"Boss, believe me, this game, they won't turn it around. Look at these young people, they're just making noise.\"\n\nZhou Ze was noncommittal. Just then, Xu Qinglang had finished mixing a drink for himself, and Zhou Ze smoothly pushed it towards the middle-aged man.\n\nThe middle-aged man chuckled and accepted it without ceremony.\n\nPerhaps having drunk a bit too much, the middle-aged man occasionally pounded his瘸了 (lame) leg with his hand.\n\n\"Were you an athlete before?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Ah, mm.\" The middle-aged man showed a nostalgic expression. \"Back then, I also played football, but I wasn't as famous as General Fan or Cannon Hao. I was just a small substitute, and the team I was on wasn't big. That team is gone now too.\"\n\n\"That's a shame.\"\n\n\"Nothing to regret, just bad luck.\" The middle-aged man pointed to his glass and said, \"Boss, if you waive this bill for me, I'll tell you a secret in the football world.\"\n\n\"Waived.\"\n\n\"Straightforward.\" The middle-aged man sighed and said, \"I didn't catch a good time. Back then, in the early 2000s, the football world was chaotic and corrupt. Not like now, you know, these big bosses are all getting into football, lots of money, stupid people, good treatment. Damn, you can easily make millions.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded, signaling that he was listening.\n\nBy now, the second half of the match had also begun. The few remaining spectators in the bookstore were still watching. Most people had already settled their bills and left during halftime.\n\n\"It wasn't like that for us back then. It wasn't a matter of whether you wanted to or not; it was like that from top to bottom. Not to mention the big shots above, even the club managers and head coaches played like that. As a small player, what could you do?\n\nBack then, my skill level wasn't actually good enough for the Chinese Jia-A League, but the general manager kept me on and paid me a salary. What was his purpose? I knew it in my heart.\"\n\n\"Is that how your leg got lamed?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nThe middle-aged man nodded, \"Haha, Boss, don't misunderstand. I wasn't beaten for refusing to play match-fixing. I was so damn depressed.\n\nI remember that game, we were playing a mid-to-lower table team. Actually, these kinds of games are easiest to fix because both teams are mid-to-lower, so any result is normal, and outsiders wouldn't find it too surprising, unlike those competing for the championship or AFC Champions League spots, where many eyes are watching.\n\nIn that match, the bookie informed me to ensure a loss.\n\nLet me tell you, bookies generally don't bribe too many people on a team when manipulating a game. Maybe one here, one there, at most two. Especially bribing the defense makes everything easier; letting in a goal or giving up a goal is too simple. It's impossible for everyone from top to bottom to be the bookie's people. Firstly, the cost is high, and secondly, with too many people, it's easy for news to leak and cause problems.\n\nThat game, coincidentally, our team's foreign player was playing too well, like he was on steroids. He scored two goals within the first ten minutes.\n\nBookies generally don't dare to bribe foreign players. Foreign players can be changed at any time, and what if they go back to their own country and casually spill the beans to some media?\n\nUnlike us locals, our roots and connections are in the country, so bookies can control us more easily and aren't worried about us causing trouble.\n\nIn that game, I kept letting players through and even gave away a penalty. Finally, in the 80-something minute, I let the other team score three, allowing them to take the lead. It truly exhausted me.\n\nBefore the end of the match, I, as a defensive midfielder, just ran up to play as a forward. I didn't want to defend anymore anyway.\n\nWho knew, coincidentally, our backfield launched a long ball, and the ball actually went through the opponent's defense and landed right in front of me.\n\nI was completely stunned at the time, but the ball was right in front of you, so you couldn't just not kick it, that would be too fake. So I symbolically took a shot, deliberately mishitting it. The ball was very slow, a shot the goalkeeper could stop with his foot.\n\nBut damn it, the opposing goalkeeper seemed too nervous and actually fell down, and then that shot, which my grandmother could have saved, just went in.\n\nWhen I saw that ball slowly rolling across the goal line, I was filled with despair.\n\nAfter the game, the bookie's people found me and lamed my leg. Heh, I wasn't a star player. Of course, even star players at that time played match-fixing; haven't several of them gone to jail? But if I had some fame, they wouldn't dare treat me like this. What could I do when I was just a small substitute on a small team? This leg was the price, because my goal made the bookie lose tens of millions. Tens of millions back then was a lot of money.\"\n\nJust then, a cheer came from the young people in front.\n\nZhou Ze looked at the screen; the Tongcheng team had scored, now trailing 1-2.\n\n\"Oh, they can still score one?\" The middle-aged man was somewhat surprised.\n\nLess than three minutes later,\n\nAnother cheer,\n\nTied!\n\nThe score was tied!\n\nThe middle-aged man stood up abruptly, his face filled with disbelief.\n\n\"Is it a fixed match?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"No, it shouldn't be, and it couldn't be. That CSL team wouldn't want to lose; it's backed by a large group and doesn't care about that little bit of gambling money.\"\n\nAt this moment, several young people in the bookstore kept shouting \"Come on! Come on! Score another one!\" and so on.\n\nThen,\n\nJust before the match ended,\n\nThe Tongcheng team actually scored another goal, taking the lead and ultimately eliminating the CSL team, which was two tiers above them. They created a miracle and caused a huge upset.\n\nThe middle-aged man pursed his lips, smiled at Zhou Ze, then limped out of the bookstore with his crutch.\n\nZhou Ze had waived his bill, so he didn't pay.\n\nThe match was over, and everyone else in the bookstore had left, but the man in the red shirt remained seated. Throughout the entire match, he hadn't cheered or spoken, just sat there watching intently.\n\n\"Hey, it's time to go.\" Zhou Ze reached out and patted the man's shoulder. \"I let you enjoy a match before you go to the Yellow Springs, that's pretty good of me, isn't it?\"\n\nThe red-shirted man was startled, nodded, then looked at Zhou Ze, his lips mumbling a few times, and said, \"The goalkeeper that lame guy mentioned earlier, that was me.\"\n\nZhou Ze heard this and was a little surprised.\n\n\"That year, I was working with another small bookie in a counter-betting scheme, a case of \"black eating black\" (mutual betrayal in criminal circles). At the start, I let their foreign player score two goals. Who knew that guy could concede even more than me, and he actually managed to give away enough for them to take the lead.\n\nHeh, heh,\n\nHis last shot, it was really too slow and too weak. I had no choice but to pretend to fall and let that ball in.\"\n\n\"Are you guys playing a match or a game of 'Infernal Affairs'?\" Zhou Ze was a bit speechless, then asked, \"How did you die?\"\n\n\"Died in a car accident.\" The red-shirted man shook his head helplessly. \"I retired over ten years ago. Recently, while driving, some elementary school kids were playing football by the roadside, and a ball flew right at me, hitting my car window. It startled me, and I turned the steering wheel the wrong way, drove into the oncoming lane,\n\nThen I got into a car accident.\n\nActually, it was a minor accident. The opposing mini-bus was driving very slowly, really very slowly, not fast at all;\n\nI just bumped my head, and at first, there was nothing wrong when I was sent to the hospital.\n\nThen, the day before I was supposed to be discharged, I inexplicably died in the hospital, from some kind of concussion.\n\nDon't you think that's,\n\nFunny?\"",

    "content": "Zhou Ze wasn’t sure if reincarnation truly existed in this world, or if the so-called karmic retribution was real. But one thing was certain: those who commit heinous acts and accumulate ill-gotten gains would eventually receive their just deserts.\n\nAt the very least,\n\nThey would die of old age.\n\nHe opened the gates of hell, reached out, grabbed the man in the red shirt, and threw him inside. One piece of business was done.\n\nAfterward, Zhou Ze slipped back into his slacker state, lying on the sofa, holding a newspaper, and sipping coffee. After the tumultuous events in the Mirror World, Zhou Ze found this current state to be the most enjoyable.\n\nHe maintained this posture until evening, when Xu Qinglang approached Zhou Ze and whispered, “The shop’s account is out of money.”\n\nThe bookstore’s rent wasn’t expensive, as it was rented from the Xu family, who had given them a special deal when negotiating the price.\n\nHowever, the cost of everyone’s food and drink, plus utilities, added up to a considerable sum. The coffee Zhou Ze was drinking was imported and already quite pricey. While Xu Qinglang mixed cheap drinks for customers at the small bar, what he drank himself wasn't cheap at all.\n\nMoreover, the bookstore’s “living” business was indeed poor. The fact that Zhou Ze hadn’t bought any new books since then clearly showed how unsatisfactory the bookstore’s business was.\n\n“Go get some spirit money and burn it at the door. Burn a lot.”\n\n“Okay.”\n\nXu Qinglang went to get the spirit money. The old Taoist, who had been playing with the monkey, immediately came over when he saw this.\n\nFor the old Taoist, there was no game more fun in this world than burning spirit money. It was more thrilling than playing a slot machine. Just squatting at the shop entrance and burning it, and then someone would come over and drop money—it was simply delightful.\n\n“Get more,” the old Taoist muttered nearby.\n\n“Enough,” Xu Qinglang said, holding up a stack.\n\n“The boss said to burn a lot. Why are you trying to save him money?”\n\n“That’s enough, otherwise it’ll be too wasteful.”\n\n“Does his household need you to manage it?” The old Taoist shook his head. “If anyone, it should be Yingying.”\n\nXu Qinglang thought about it, and it seemed to make sense. He simply took out another stack and handed it to the old Taoist. Then, Xu Qinglang and the old Taoist, each with a stack of money, lit it at the bookstore entrance under the cover of night.\n\nAfter burning it, the old Taoist squatted nearby, smoking, waiting for the RMB to arrive.\n\nActually, the old Taoist himself had accumulated quite a bit of spirit money. Sometimes, when he encountered ghosts with no money, Zhou Ze wouldn't care for those few冥钞 (netherworld bank notes), so he’d give them to the old Taoist as a reward.\n\nThe old Taoist, overjoyed, hid them away. Little by little, it added up to a considerable sum.\n\nAnd the old Taoist had a dream: to collect enough netherworld bank notes and then stick them all together with tape to make a garment, just like the Hezhe people’s fish-skin clothes, and wear it.\n\nDamn, by then he’d truly be a human embodiment of auspiciousness. Just thinking about it made him excited.\n\nIf he wore that outfit to Macau, wouldn’t he be invincible?\n\nAn electric scooter approached from the front. The old Taoist and Xu Qinglang both looked towards it, both thinking, *It must be him.*\n\nThe person on the electric scooter was wearing a blue delivery uniform and a helmet, clearly a delivery rider. The rider originally thought nothing of it, but as they passed the bookstore, they suddenly saw a man and a woman squatting at the entrance, staring directly at them. Their heart immediately jolted, and just as there was a fire hydrant ahead, they actually drove straight into it.\n\n“Clang!”\n\nA small box fell, full of takeout containers.\n\nThe delivery rider immediately stood up, looking somewhat guilty, and quickly righted their electric scooter, seemingly not noticing the fallen items, and drove straight onto the road.\n\n“Beep beep………………”\n\nCar horns blared,\n\nUnder the gaze of the old Taoist and Xu Qinglang,\n\nThe delivery rider, like an iron-headed child, crashed directly into the bus ahead, a head-on collision.\n\n“Bang!”\n\nThe delivery rider was thrown flying,\n\nThe electric scooter also fell apart,\n\nAnd their helmet, by a strange coincidence, rolled right in front of the old Taoist and Xu Qinglang, tumbling and wobbling a few times.\n\nThis seemed to have gotten a little out of hand.\n\nXu Qinglang and the old Taoist exchanged glances, both seeing a hint of helplessness in the other’s eyes.\n\n“I told you to burn less,” Xu Qinglang complained.\n\n“Damn it, you’re the one who grabbed it!”\n\nThe old Taoist snapped back ill-temperedly, then got up and picked up the meal the delivery rider had just dropped. As soon as he held it, the old Taoist immediately felt something was off, and quickly pulled Xu Qinglang into the bookstore.\n\n“What’s going on outside? A car accident?” Zhou Ze was also startled by the noise outside.\n\nThe old Taoist brought the takeout containers over, took a deep breath, and opened the first container in front of Zhou Ze. Inside, to their astonishment, were stacks of money, and it was USD!\n\n“Oh, my good gracious.”\n\nThe old Taoist smacked his lips, then immediately opened two more boxes. They too were filled with USD.\n\n“We’re rich! We’re rich!” The old Taoist couldn’t control his hands and immediately opened the last takeout container, then yelped and quickly recoiled. Inside that last container was actually a bag of small blue pills.\n\nIt’s over, it’s over, this is going to be over, it’s pills!\n\nXu Qinglang stood by, not very excited when he saw the USD. There was less than a hundred thousand USD, which was only a few hundred thousand RMB, not even enough for one of his houses.\n\nBut when Xu Qinglang saw the blue pills, a look of surprise also appeared on his face.\n\n“Who dropped these?” Zhou Ze asked.\n\n“A delivery rider,” the old Taoist replied.\n\n“Where is he?”\n\n“Right, the one who had the car accident outside, he was thrown flying,” the old Taoist pointed outside.\n\nZhou Ze stood up, walked to the doorway, and looked. A crowd of onlookers had already gathered at the accident scene, but he could still see the delivery rider lying on the ground, bleeding profusely, probably beyond help.\n\n“Get some more spirit money and burn it at the door. Don’t cause trouble,” Zhou Ze instructed the old Taoist.\n\n“Alrighty.” The old Taoist wiped the sweat from his forehead and immediately went to the drawer to take out a few more netherworld bank notes to burn at the door. This time, it wasn’t for wealth, but to avoid trouble.\n\nZhou Ze pointed to the USD on the table, motioning for Xu Qinglang to put it away as household funds for a while. Then, he picked up the bag containing the blue pills and walked to the restroom.\n\n“Gurgle gurgle…………”\n\nZhou Ze poured the entire bag of small blue pills directly into the toilet and flushed it. The small pills went down the drain.\n\nActually, this bag of pills might have been worth even more, but Boss Zhou was unmoved, just like last time with the old Taoist eating the father and son mantou.* Such things would harm one’s yin virtue and bring misfortune to descendants if handled by the living. Even ghosts wouldn’t want to touch them.\n\nHaving finished this, Zhou Ze clapped his hands and walked out.\n\nThe police and ambulance arrived quickly. The delivery rider’s accident was quite serious; he died on the spot. Initially, not many police came, treating it as a regular car accident. But later, many more police arrived, and the atmosphere suddenly changed.\n\nZhou Ze guessed that the police had identified the delivery rider’s true identity and started a large-scale investigation. There were also police who came to the bookstore to take eyewitness statements, which the old Taoist handled.\n\nAfterward, the old Taoist smiled and said, “He really was a drug dealer. We were just burning spirit money at our doorstep and ended up acting on behalf of heaven.”\n\n“His lost items?” Xu Qinglang asked.\n\n“We’re lucky, or maybe the spirit money we burned later had an effect. Both surveillance cameras here had a circuit problem today and coincidentally stopped working, so we can keep those USD for ourselves.”\n\nUpon hearing this, Zhou Ze nodded. Money obtained from burning netherworld bank notes was usually ill-gotten, so he felt no psychological burden using it himself.\n\n“Hey, Deadpool, come clean up.”\n\nThe priest, dressed in a Deadpool costume, sat nearby. He stood up, took the mop from the old Taoist, and began cleaning.\n\nThe old Taoist wasn’t idle either, starting to arrange chairs and tables and clean the coffee table.\n\nBecause the boss had a cleanliness obsession, this cleaning had to be done once every day.\n\nZhou Ze went upstairs. Bai Yingying was already in the bedroom, sitting on a chair, wearing headphones, and watching a movie.\n\nActually, Bai Yingying’s appearance had mostly recovered these days, but that was only superficial. The internal depletion could only be restored after Zhou Ze’s body recovered and he could help her.\n\nHowever, just sitting there, with her white hair draped down and her feet propped on the desk, she exuded a tranquil serenity that surpassed her previous liveliness.\n\nEspecially her small feet, constantly flexing and extending gently, as if they could ensnare one’s soul.\n\nBeautiful curves, just the right arc.\n\nZhou Ze couldn’t help but stand at the doorway and watch for a while. People always had an urge to appreciate beautiful things.\n\n“Boss, boss, this is bad! No, this is good!”\n\nThe old Taoist ran up, holding something in his hand.\n\n“Boss?”\n\nBai Yingying took off her headphones and also walked over.\n\n“What’s going on?” Zhou Ze asked.\n\n“Boss, I found this under the chair. A card tucked between a few netherworld bank notes.”\n\nGenerally, after sending a ghost to hell, the “toll money” left by the ghost would either be on the ground or stuck underneath the chair the ghost had been sitting on. The old Taoist paid special attention to these areas when cleaning.\n\nBut finding a small card tucked inside netherworld bank notes was a first. The card was black, not like those things slipped under hotel doors at night.\n\nThe card felt a bit cold to the touch, with two lines of text engraved on it:\n\n“Welcome to Misty Town, a new haven for the deceased.”\n\nZhou Ze frowned slightly. A new haven for the deceased?\n\nThe deceased’s haven should be hell. How did a small town suddenly appear here?\n\n“Boss, this is poaching!” The old Taoist shouted directly.\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\nYes,\n\nIt was indeed poaching.\n\n“No wonder no ghosts came to visit during the time you were unconscious, Boss. I thought it was strange,” Bai Yingying said.\n\nBoss Zhou liked to lie in the bookstore, read newspapers, drink coffee, and be a slacker. That was based on the premise that spirits would come daily, bringing business and netherworld bank notes. Now that someone was poaching, Boss Zhou certainly wouldn’t be so magnanimous as to smile and ignore it.\n\nMoreover, according to the rules of the underworld, each area in the mortal realm had a corresponding Ghost Messenger responsible for it. In that area, the Ghost Messenger monopolized the local ghost express delivery industry. And once a monopoly appeared and became accustomed to, if any competition emerged, the monopolizer would instinctively choose to merge and suppress rather than consider improving service or increasing their competitiveness.\n\nJust like Boss Zhou at this moment, he hadn’t thought about developing any new activities in his bookstore to attract spirits. Instead, he instinctively chose a more direct and crude method.\n\n“Call Lin Ke. We leave at 3 AM.”\n\nZhou Ze lit a cigarette. The little loli also had to contribute to this matter. All along, Zhou Ze got the meat, and the little loli got to drink the soup, still increasing her performance. This new competitor was essentially ruining their joint business.\n\n“Go out and talk to them?” the old Taoist asked.\n\nZhou Ze looked at the old Taoist and smiled.\n\nHe said:\n\n“We’ll take them out.”\n\nAnything that interferes with my slacker life,\n\nIs a heresy,\n\nAnd must be decisively eliminated!\n\nHe who hinders my slacker life,\n\nDies!\n\n***\nTranslator’s Note:\n*The “father and son mantou” (馒头) refers to a previous chapter where the old Taoist ate a mantou that was implied to be made from human flesh, which would harm one's yin virtue.",

    "content": "Zhou Ze called the little loli because he adhered to the principle of \"use a lickspittle if you can, otherwise it's a waste.\" Anyway, her soul-blood was with him, so he didn't need to play the card of being considerate to subordinates. Moreover, ever since they met, the little loli had treated him as a disposable item to be used and discarded, so there was no need for any warmth.\n\nWhen he needed her, he would call her over and use her ruthlessly,\n\nthen discard her when he was done, each going their own way. When he needed her again, another phone call, and she still had to come running.\n\nDid Boss Zhou really not know that the little loli secretly wished he would die?\n\nLet her wish; a person who had died once didn't care about such taboos.\n\nStepping out of the bookstore, Zhou Ze was surprised to find that a new private kitchen restaurant had opened next door to his bookstore, named \"Wang Fu Ju Private Kitchen.\" It had probably opened during the half-month he was unconscious.\n\nAt the entrance stood an old man, bald and dressed in white clothes, younger than the old Taoist priest, probably around fifty years old, looking like an elder who would go practice Tai Chi in the morning.\n\nAt 3 AM, he was still sitting at the restaurant's entrance, in a wicker chair, with a pot of tea, drinking by himself.\n\n\"Oh, you must be Boss Zhou, right? You're back?\"\n\nThe old man was overly familiar and recognized Zhou Ze. It seemed he had gotten quite acquainted with the others in the bookstore during Zhou Ze's unconsciousness, but he had always known there was an elusive boss who appeared and disappeared like a dragon.\n\nOf course, he didn't know that the boss had actually been in the store all along, just unconscious.\n\nZhou Ze was a bit surprised. Opening a private kitchen restaurant in a prime location like South Street implied a certain level of prestige. Many private kitchens were very arrogant, explicitly stating how many tables they would serve today, and that they would even be closed on holidays. If you wanted to come, you'd have to wait in a long line.\n\nBut this boss was overly enthusiastic, even obsequious, towards him.\n\nHowever, Zhou Ze quickly understood. This boss probably thought that anyone who opened a bookstore, which was bound to lose money, in such an expensive and well-located area on South Street, must have a significant background.\n\nThey were either a fool or a big shot with too much money to burn, simply playing at being sentimental.\n\nThe boss, upon seeing Zhou Ze, immediately discarded the first possibility, as Zhou Ze clearly didn't look like a fool.\n\nThe other party handed him a business card and a cigarette. Zhou Ze waved his hand, indicating he understood, and the boss, knowing his place, said he was welcome to eat at his restaurant sometime and then left.\n\n\"This restaurant's boss is quite good.\"\n\nXu Qinglang also walked out at this moment, having changed his clothes.\n\nZhou Ze was noncommittal.\n\n\"You're a bit annoyed with him?\"\n\n\"Heh, you'd be very happy if you woke up after a nap and found a new 'Old Wang next door,' wouldn't you?\"\n\nXu Qinglang yawned.\n\n\"But you should be quite happy. People who run private kitchen restaurants usually have some special skills or something. Didn't you go to exchange notes?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Oil smoke damages the skin, so I didn't go,\" Xu Qinglang replied.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head, sighing inwardly that the world had gone to the dogs and people's morals had declined. The hardworking and diligent Xu Qinglang who ran a noodle shop had long since vanished into the winds of memory.\n\nBut then he thought, it seems Xu Qinglang became like this after meeting him. Could this also be a case of 'he who lies with dogs rises with fleas'?\n\nThinking more deeply, he himself was clearly a very diligent and hardworking person in his past life, so why, after dying once, did he become like a deflated ball,\n\ncompletely soft?\n\nThe little loli arrived, carrying her schoolbag, standing angrily across the street. Under the dim streetlights, at the intersection in the early hours, such a beautiful young girl suddenly appearing there brought not surprise but horror.\n\nXu Qinglang drove, Zhou Ze sat in the front passenger seat, and the little loli got in, still fuming.\n\nYingying was best off resting and not going out for now. The old Taoist priest was at home watching the store, so Zhou Ze just pulled Xu Qinglang along as a driver.\n\nWith the experience from the last hot spring hotel incident, Zhou Ze had learned his lesson. There was no need to drag a large group of people to everything. He didn't want to end up not dying himself but causing an accident for them, which he would then feel guilty about.\n\nThe card didn't have an address written on it, but when Zhou Ze ran his fingernail over it, he could sense a location. The departed souls didn't even need to look; they could sense it too.\n\nZhou Ze gave directions, Xu Qinglang drove, and about twenty minutes later, the car arrived at a small town on the outskirts of Gangzha District.\n\nGetting out of the car, they saw rice paddies ahead, stretching out in a continuous expanse, dotted with a few houses.\n\nThe location was here; it shouldn't be wrong.\n\nZhou Ze turned around, intending to ask the little loli to come down and help him look, only to find her sitting in the back seat doing her homework.\n\n\"Thump, thump, thump...\"\n\nZhou Ze reached out and knocked on the car window.\n\nHe really wanted to ask, \"Are you here to be funny?\"\n\nThe little loli unhappily closed her homework and said,\n\n\"Her homework is quite a lot. I just happened to wake up, so I helped her finish this week's homework. She can relax a bit too.\"\n\nZhou Ze's gaze narrowed. At this moment, he thought of the female ghost messenger who had possessed his sister-in-law earlier; she must have had this kind of problem, where the host's thoughts influenced her own, causing her to be somewhat disoriented.\n\nThis seemed to be a common problem. Did all ghost messengers who chose to inhabit living bodies get affected?\n\nHowever, Zhou Ze didn't say much more. He was here to cause trouble today and didn't have the leisure to talk about life philosophies with the little loli.\n\nPushing open the car door, the little loli stretched, took a deep breath, and then said,\n\n\"I don't feel anything.\"\n\n\"How's your performance been lately?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Very bad,\" the little loli replied.\n\nZhou Ze took out the black card, examined it carefully for a while, then looked up and around, saying, \"Is it because we both have bodies that we can't find that place?\"\n\n\"Or did they sense us coming, so they hid themselves in advance?\" The little loli shrugged, took the card from Zhou Ze's hand, and continued, \"It's like the small cards slipped under hotel room doors. They change locations and phone numbers after a while to avoid anti-vice raids.\"\n\nZhou Ze felt that what the little loli said made a lot of sense, but returning empty-handed like this truly made him unwilling. Maybe as soon as he left, that small town would open for business again.\n\nIf that happened, he'd be lying in the bookstore, unable to see a single ghost day and night, how could he continue to live so leisurely?\n\nTo put it simply, this would affect his future quality of life;\n\nTo put it grandly, this was a loss of the Underworld's state-owned assets.\n\n\"You didn't feel anything?\"\n\nXu Qinglang turned around and asked.\n\nIt was then that Zhou Ze noticed a talisman pasted on Xu Qinglang's forehead. Xu Qinglang had also worn this when he entered Sanxiang Village last time, and when the old Taoist priest made ghosts possess him.\n\nThis was the simplest kind of talisman; anyone with a little bit of Taoist skill could draw it.\n\nIt was like a health supplement;\n\nA health supplement that could truly improve your health and alleviate your illness was extremely difficult to find, one in a thousand;\n\nBut those that just made you feel a bit full, with no benefit or harm, were easy to get. Most on the market were like this;\n\nAs for those that could cause problems, make you sick, or even kill you directly, those were even simpler.\n\nThis talisman was used to lower a living person's Yang energy, belonging to the last type of health supplement.\n\n\"What did you see?\" Zhou Ze asked curiously.\n\nXu Qinglang pointed ahead. Zhou Ze followed his gaze. There was a tomb, not very conspicuous, with many small colorful flags stuck in front of it.\n\nChildren who grew up in the countryside would be familiar with this; many children liked to pull out the small flags when passing by tombs and wave them as toys.\n\n\"What's there?\"\n\nZhou Ze asked Xu Qinglang, while also looking at the little loli, finding her as confused as himself.\n\nThat shouldn't be right.\n\nXu Qinglang's skill level was only that of a second-rate amateur. These two ghost messengers here couldn't see anything clearly, but he could see something fishy?\n\nThe little loli seemed to understand something and immediately closed her eyes. Then Zhou Ze felt the little loli's aura beside him instantly weaken, even becoming somewhat sickly. When she opened her eyes, she looked in that direction and said,\n\n\"Found it. It's there.\"\n\n\"How did you do it?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Lower your aura. That place is where solitary ghosts gather. You and I are both using living bodies, so our Yang energy is strong. We have to lower your own aura to blend into their environment.\n\nClose your eyes and imagine what it feels like to be sick. Just keep giving yourself psychological hints that you're tired, you're weak, you're dying.\"\n\nUpon hearing this, Zhou Ze closed his eyes and kept recalling that feeling in his mind. Slowly, he seemed to find that boundary. When he opened his eyes again,\n\nthe tomb looked different.\n\nThe formerly plain and unremarkable tomb now looked like a ceremonial archway, somewhat resembling an ancient brothel, even decorated with lanterns and festive hangings. At the entrance, a small, short person dressed in the clothes of an ancient 'gui gong'* stood, welcoming people in and out.\n\nZhou Ze and the other two then walked towards it.\n\nThe 'gui gong' didn't notice Zhou Ze and the others at first, perhaps just as the little loli said: ghosts have their own circles, and humans have theirs. Although ghost messengers can see ghosts, it doesn't mean they belong to that circle, which is why the 'gui gong' couldn't see Zhou Ze earlier, just as Zhou Ze hadn't noticed anything unusual about the tomb.\n\n\"Oh, sirs, please come in, please come in!\"\n\nThe 'gui gong' bowed, serving them, making his already short stature appear even smaller.\n\nZhou Ze nodded and led the way in. The threshold was a bit low; Zhou Ze had to bend down to enter. Once inside, the space suddenly opened up.\n\nOh, wow,\n\ndancing,\n\nsinging opera,\n\nperforming acrobatics,\n\nbrightly lit,\n\nwith a multitude of beautiful women,\n\nwhat a lively scene.\n\nThis really showed that there was no comparison, no harm.\n\nZhou Ze felt that if he were a ghost, he would rather choose to come here and indulge himself freely, rather than go to a boring bookstore, eat a half-hearted cold dish prepared by Xu Qinglang, and then be slapped into the gates of hell by Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Oh, sirs, upstairs please! Come and play, come and play!\"\n\n\"That's right, sirs, come on, upstairs please, we'll serve you well!\"\n\nZhou Ze looked up to the second floor on the right and saw many women in bright red dresses waving their fans and calling out to him from the balcony.\n\nThe women's faces were thickly powdered, like the makeup favored by the Japanese, with pale faces and rosy red lips, which truly made one feel uneasy.\n\n\"Hahahahaha...\"\n\nA hearty laugh came from upstairs. Immediately after, Zhou Ze saw a chubby man blindfolded, playing hide-and-seek with a group of young women. He accidentally walked onto the balcony and grabbed a woman who had just been greeting Zhou Ze, kissing her directly.\n\nZhou Ze watched, his teeth aching.\n\nThe man's lips were covered in a thick, greasy layer of rouge.\n\nBut Zhou Ze quickly realized something was wrong.\n\nThe man was bald.\n\nAnd not just bald,\n\nhis head was covered in scabs.\n\n\"The Scabby Monk!\"\n\nZhou Ze shouted directly.\n\n\"Who, who called me?\"\n\nThe Scabby Monk immediately ripped off the blindfold from his eyes and instantly spotted Zhou Ze standing below.\n\nHe was so startled that he trembled, immediately shouting,\n\n\"It's an anti-vice raid! Officials raiding the brothel!\"\n\n---\n* The term 'gui gong' (龟公) refers to a pimp or a male servant in a brothel in ancient China.",

    "content": "Zhou Ze had never expected to encounter the Bald Monk in this place.\n\nBack then, this monk had come to his shop and talked to him at length about ideals and aspirations, only to be dismissed by Zhou Ze. He never thought the monk would actually show up here.\n\nIt seemed that the monk's philosophy was that all beings were equal, and that both humans and ghosts should have the right to exist. Ghost Constables also needed to respect human rights—oh no, ghost rights—and shouldn't forcibly send ghosts to hell.\n\nAt the time, to Zhou Ze, this monk sounded like a chuunibyo*, like someone poisoned by \"Reader's Digest\" and \"Reader,\" whose mind was filled with thoughts of how unified, strong, and enduring Japanese children were, how orderly they were in times of trouble, how advanced foreign countries were, how backward their own country was, and so on. He was completely out of touch with reality.\n\nNow, the Bald Monk's loud shout, \"Law enforcement sweeping for prostitution!\" instantly sent the street into a frenzy.\n\nIndeed, with Zhou Ze's status, he certainly qualified as an underworld official. And this place was indeed a dark spot. To put it nicely, it was a town of the deceased, but in the eyes of the orthodox Underworld, it was essentially an illegal shantytown where undocumented residents gathered, a target for resolute crackdown.\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nEvery household began to shut their doors and windows. The street performers and loiterers all scurried into the alleys. Even the heavily made-up ladies who had been calling Zhou Ze up from the second floor a moment ago vanished without a trace.\n\n\"Whoa.\"\n\nXu Qinglang walked over. He had been watching a street show just a moment ago; now there was nothing to see.\n\n\"Where's Lin Ke?\" Zhou Ze asked Xu Qinglang.\n\nEarlier, the three of them had entered one by one, and the street was bustling. Now the street was empty, and he only saw Xu Qinglang but not the little loli.\n\n\"Dunno. Probably hid somewhere to do her homework.\"\n\nThat actually seemed quite possible.\n\nThe little loli was clearly a bit abnormal, or perhaps showing tendencies of becoming abnormal.\n\nTo think that the Hell Girl, who upon their first meeting opened her mouth, stuck out her tongue, and shouted, \"The Underworld is orderly, the Yellow Springs can be crossed,\" would now be thinking about doing elementary school homework...\n\nThe shift in tone was truly HMP.\n\nZhou Ze hadn't experienced a prostitution raid himself, but he had bailed out colleagues a few times. It used to be that you could get someone out by paying five thousand yuan and having a guarantor sign a guarantee letter. But later, he heard the policy changed: if caught for soliciting, and you were married, your spouse had to be notified.\n\nWell, in any case, this den of iniquity had to be cleaned out. Crucially, it was affecting his business, and that was absolutely unacceptable.\n\n\"Kick the door, go in.\"\n\nZhou Ze told Xu Qinglang.\n\nXu Qinglang really wanted to retort, \"Why not you?\" but decided not to quibble. He walked forward and gently knocked on the door, as if visiting neighbors.\n\nZhou Ze's mouth twitched.\n\nHe had told Xu Qinglang to kick the door.\n\nBut if Xu Qinglang's action were accompanied by: \"Mom, open the door, I'm home!\"\n\nIt would have been too perfect.\n\nZhou Ze walked over and kicked the door.\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nThe door shattered instantly, like it was made of paper.\n\nIn truth, most things here were one part real and nine parts fake, just like the food Madam Bai served when she entertained him and Xu Qinglang.\n\nAlthough the door was not sturdy, the scene was extremely effective. Xu Qinglang, walking behind, thought it was a good time to film Zhou Ze. If the Underworld had an official newspaper, he could even submit it.\n\nThe title would be: \"In 2018, under the correct leadership of the Underworld, and the direct guidance of the Ten Yama Kings, our county constables, under the leadership of Constable Zhou Ze, resolutely implemented the spirit of Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva's meeting on this prostitution and illegal activities crackdown. Taking the purification of the ghost-catching market as the primary task, focusing on key work, further strengthening daily supervision, and effectively advancing the sustained and effective conduct of this crackdown, protecting the operational order of our city's 'Late-Night Bookstore';\n\nForging a solid defense line for the cultural security of our city and creating a favorable social and cultural environment for our city's economic construction.\"\n\nIt sounded quite amusing. Xu Qinglang even covered his mouth and chuckled from behind.\n\nHe truly wasn't nervous. With Boss Zhou here, he felt secure and completely unconcerned. Last time at the hot spring resort, Boss Zhou had been unconscious; otherwise, things probably wouldn't have been so difficult.\n\nUpon entering, they found a large hall with several spaces separated by screens. All the furnishings and layout were ancient and elegant. Looking up, Zhou Ze saw a row of young women standing side by side along the inner railing of the second floor, staring blankly downwards.\n\nThe sudden seriousness of the women made Zhou Ze somewhat unaccustomed, and the atmosphere became much more oppressive.\n\nMoreover, these women kept swaying back and forth, as if silently singing and bobbing their heads in unison, which added to the cold and grim atmosphere.\n\nXu Qinglang followed Zhou Ze in, then felt the atmosphere was a bit subtle and, rather unkindly, took a step back. After thinking for a moment, he simply retreated all the way out the door.\n\nThis didn't look like a place being raided for prostitution; it was clearly a Hongmen Banquet*.\n\n\"Oh, honored guest, aren't you coming inside?\"\n\nThe short pimp reached out and gently pushed Xu Qinglang's back. Xu Qinglang felt a chill run down his spine, followed by a wave of dizziness, and in the next moment, he found himself directly in front of Zhou Ze.\n\nThe pimp stood at the doorway, smiling as he closed the door, almost shouting, \"Shut the door and beat the dog!\"\n\nHonestly, no matter the industry, when encountering a competitor, few people would directly smash the place. They would usually first investigate the other party's background to see if they had any connections.\n\nBut Boss Zhou couldn't wait, and didn't want to wait. This matter had touched his raw nerve.\n\nAlso,\n\nBoss Zhou was getting a bit overconfident.\n\nNow, he had armor.\n\nAnd could unleash a \"berserker rage.\"\n\nHe didn't even care about the little loli, let alone others?\n\n\"Oh, oh, oh, guests are welcome, calm your anger, calm your anger.\"\n\nThe Bald Monk came down from upstairs. The pimp beside him brought him a chair, and he didn't hesitate to sit down, without even offering Zhou Ze a chair.\n\n\"Did you arrange this?\"\n\nSeeing the Bald Monk playing hide-and-seek with his eyes covered on the second floor earlier,\n\nHe really was \"making trouble.\"\n\n\"Oh, you flatter this humble monk. This humble monk is just here to play and join the fun. Walking through the mortal world, no matter when, I can only be considered a passerby, merely changing the way I cultivate.\"\n\nThe Bald Monk denied it.\n\n\"Then there must be a boss here, right?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nAt the same time,\n\nZhou Ze's patience was slowly wearing thin.\n\nHe had come to cause trouble in the first place,\n\nSo there was no need to talk reason.\n\nWhen his most vital interests were threatened, there was no need to be reasonable.\n\n\"Are you truly going to conduct a raid, Ghost Constable?\"\n\nThe Bald Monk rubbed his head, looking very conflicted,\n\n\"Unfortunately, the boss isn't here. This humble monk is just looking after the place for him. How about this, Ghost Constable, can we perhaps delay? When he returns, I'll have him come find you. If all else fails, I'll persuade him to move to another place after a while?\"\n\n\"After a while?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Could it be that Ghost Constable is unwilling to grant even a little bit of leniency?\"\n\n\"Leniency?\"\n\nZhou Ze retorted, then walked forward step by step.\n\nTalk leniency with me?\n\nIf you don't count the player's ghost attracted by the soccer match and the victim,\n\nAccording to Bai Yingying,\n\nDuring the half-month he was unconscious,\n\nThe bookstore had already run out of business!\n\nWhy did he move the bookstore to South Street, if not to have a larger flow of people and ghosts so he could comfortably lie at home and wait for ghosts to come knocking?\n\nNow that the ghosts were gone, how could he just lie around?\n\nThe thought of no longer being able to be a lazy bum at the bookstore, and having to go out and run around catching ghosts,\n\nMade Zhou Ze really angry.\n\n\"Sir, please calm down. I'll arrange some skilled ladies for you, guaranteed to serve you comfortably.\"\n\nThe pimp came forward to speak at this moment, trying to give Zhou Ze a chance to back down.\n\nBut he had severely underestimated how seriously Boss Zhou took this matter.\n\nNot even a single day's leniency.\n\nWas possible!\n\n\"Buzz!\"\n\nZhou Ze raised his hand and slammed it directly onto the pimp's head, at the same time his nails grew out and stabbed down.\n\nThe pimp's face changed dramatically,\n\nBut then his small head suddenly retracted, and then black thorns, like a hedgehog's, suddenly grew out of his body. Like an emergency reaction, the black thorns on his body bristled and shot directly towards Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Crack... crack... crack...\"\n\nZhou Ze's body was instantly covered in armor. These black thorns, upon hitting the armor, simply broke off, some even turning into smoke and dissipating.\n\n\"You're very cheeky.\"\n\nZhou Ze lowered his head and said to the pimp, who had retracted his head,\n\nThen kicked him,\n\n\"Bang!\"\n\nThe pimp was kicked away by Zhou Ze like a ball. As he flew through the air, Zhou Ze spread his palm, and black aura emanated from his five fingertips, coiling around him and pulling him back.\n\nLike passing the ball to himself seven seconds later.\n\nThe pimp let out a shriek.\n\nClearly, it knew its fate was not good. This aggressive constable seemed to have no intention of letting it go or holding back.\n\nThe Bald Monk, seeing this, immediately stood up,\n\nPutting his hands together:\n\n\"Amitabha, mercy is due where mercy is due. Constable Zhou, listen to this humble monk's advice, and grant this humble monk a small favor. Let him go first. You and I are people of status, why bicker with these small fry?\"\n\n\"Splat!\"\n\nA crisp sound,\n\nLike a watermelon hitting the ground,\n\nCrisp,\n\nLoud,\n\nFiery,\n\nA pool of crimson liquid flowed from Zhou Ze's palm,\n\nAnd below,\n\nWas a pile of minced meat,\n\nCurled into a ball, with backward-pointing thorns,\n\nIt was clearly a hedgehog,\n\nNow dead beyond all doubt.\n\nZhou Ze raised his head,\n\nClad in black armor, he looked even more menacing, especially with the runes on his armor constantly shifting, adding a touch of mystery to him.\n\nHe looked at the Bald Monk in front of him,\n\nAnd asked, feigning confusion:\n\n\"What did you just say?\n\n'Face'?\"\n\n---\n* Chuunibyo: A Japanese colloquial term for the \"eighth-grade syndrome,\" a phase where adolescents develop grandiose delusions and act dramatically.\n* Hongmen Banquet: A Chinese idiom referring to a trap or a seemingly pleasant gathering that is actually a dangerous ambush.",

    "content": "The cluster amaryllis, blooming by the roadside of the Yellow Springs, exuded a unique, ghostly fragrance. It accompanied the deceased on their return journey and was one of the few splashes of color in the Underworld.\n\nIt was a unique product of the Underworld, different from the saying, \"Oranges grown south of the Huai River are oranges; north of it, they are bitter oranges.\" This stuff simply couldn't grow in the Human Realm.\n\nNow, it had been transplanted here. Although this was a special space and a special environment, it was still, after all, in the Human Realm.\n\nOf course, compared to the \"wildflowers\" by the roadside, Boss Zhou was more interested in the \"achievements\" gathered ahead.\n\nHowever, when Zhou Ze walked over to examine the state of those wandering souls, he found their bodies were very faint, and their eyes were listless, as if they had hysteria.\n\nWandering souls had a shelf life. This shelf life wasn't about time; for example, a wandering soul that became a vengeful spirit, even if it eventually fulfilled its obsession, could only dissipate with the wind, losing the chance to re-enter hell and reincarnate.\n\nThe wandering souls here, while not having become vengeful spirits, had long lost their consciousness and thought, leaving only pure soul energy clusters. They could no longer be considered wandering souls.\n\nHell wouldn't want such \"ghosts.\" Even if Zhou Ze forcibly sent them down, he wouldn't get any achievements.\n\nThis made Boss Zhou's teeth ache. Such pure achievements were wasted.\n\nThe little loli stood by the side, bending down to observe carefully, and said:\n\n\"This is normal. Cluster amaryllis are special species that grow by absorbing the essence of the deceased. Of course, they can grow by the Yellow Springs, since so many deceased walk along the Yellow Springs road every moment. Even if each person drops a single hair, it's enough to nourish those cluster amaryllis.\n\nIt's different here. The few cluster amaryllis that grew here relied entirely on the day and night devotion of these dozens of wandering souls. They've been completely drained, like human juicers.\n\nIf it weren't for the existence of this special space, allowing them to return under the sunlight, they would surely have instantly turned to ash and vanished.\"\n\n\"Who's behind this?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"I don't know, but whoever or whatever organization has this kind of capability isn't something we can touch. The only thing we can do is report this to the higher-ups.\"\n\nThe little loli reached out to pat Zhou Ze's shoulder, but she was too short to reach. And unlike when Zhou Ze was merely a toy in her hand and she could make him pick her up to pat him, she felt a bit uncomfortable.\n\nZhou Ze reached out and ruffled the little loli's head.\n\nAfter that head-pat attack,\n\nThe little loli bit her lip.\n\nThis petty man constantly wanted to get revenge for what she had done to him in the past, repeatedly reminding her that their statuses had already changed.\n\n\"Speaking in riddles isn't a good habit,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Reporting this situation to the higher-ups can also earn a certain reward. This reward will be converted into achievements. All in all, it shouldn't be less than the achievements from sending these dozens of wandering souls to hell.\"\n\n\"Should've said so earlier.\" Zhou Ze's mood instantly improved.\n\nHowever, Zhou Ze soon remembered something else and said, \"Then you didn't report the Chengdu incident last time?\"\n\nThat person from Chengdu was still alive and kicking. Last time, he even slept in his bookstore and showered a pile of Soul Reaper IDs right in front of him. So, there was no follow-up?\n\n\"His matter is a bit special. At that time, the higher-ups were divided on how to handle it and didn't give specific operational instructions. We got our orders privately and pieced them together. So, if the mission failed, it failed. As long as he doesn't cause more trouble, this matter might just be given a cold treatment.\"\n\nThe little loli said.\n\n\"Oh, I see.\"\n\nZhou Ze reached out and ruffled the little loli's head again, ignoring her pouted lips. He even poked her little mouth with his finger, like he was teasing his niece.\n\nTo be honest, the little loli was indeed Zhou Ze's niece in terms of seniority.\n\n\"Even the Underworld's higher-ups are vying for power, not a monolithic block?\"\n\nZhou Ze had originally thought the Underworld was like a computer.\n\nThe little loli took a deep breath. She looked at Zhou Ze and suddenly felt like laughing because she knew whose Soul Reaper ID Zhou Ze held. The original owner of that ID back then had been tricked by Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva, losing even his Mount Tai Prefecture, and ultimately suffering a very desolate end.\n\n\"What do you think is the difference between humans and ghosts?\"\n\nThe little loli didn't specifically mention the Mount Tai Prefectural Lord's matter. Some things, some plans, originated from the hands of great figures. Even if the Mount Tai Prefectural Lord had long fallen, the arrangements he left behind were not something a small Soul Reaper like herself could casually comment on on.\n\n\"Then let's go. What about these cluster amaryllis? Should we collect them?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Send them to Hell. These things are ornamental flowers in Hell, but if they scatter into the Human Realm, they will become something far more terrifying than poppies. Their effect on the living is even more horrific.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded and first walked back to his original position, pointing to the hedgehog underfoot and saying:\n\n\"Does this count as a demonic creature?\"\n\nThis was the first time Zhou Ze had seen a *yao* (demon/monster). In the past year, Zhou Ze had mostly seen ghosts. He hadn't really seen any *yao*. However, this *yao*'s appearance was pretty low-key, similar to the monster foot soldiers from *Calabash Brothers* cartoons he watched as a child, with no combat power.\n\n\"This doesn't count as a *yao*. You'll know when we dig up this grave later.\" The little loli shook her head.\n\nThen, the three of them left the brothel together, returning the way they came. After Zhou Ze walked out, he still bent down, then closed his eyes, adjusting and calming his state. When he opened his eyes again, the lantern-hung archway they had entered earlier had completely vanished, leaving only a tomb mound there.\n\nXu Qinglang also took off the talisman from his forehead and patted his head, apparently, wearing this talisman had quite an effect, feeling a bit like having a cold or fever.\n\n\"Lao Xu, bear with it.\" Zhou Ze patted Xu Qinglang's shoulder. \"You seem to have tools in your car. Start digging.\"\n\n\"Why do I have to dig someone's grave…?\"\n\nXu Qinglang instinctively wanted to refuse, but seeing Zhou Ze was a sick person, and the little loli had taken out her homework book, well, Xu Qinglang didn't waste any more words. He took a multi-purpose entrenching tool from the car and started digging.\n\nThe reason he had this in his car was actually for self-defense. Carrying knives could get them confiscated during security checks, so he put this instead. It came in handy at this moment.\n\nIt actually didn't take long to dig because it was hollow inside. Xu Qinglang only dug for a short while, and the ground below directly collapsed, revealing a pit about twenty square meters.\n\n\"This is the area we entered earlier, right? Actually, in that small town, only that brothel could be entered. The other shops on the street were all fake, just for show, you couldn't actually go into them. Even in that brothel, only the spacious area on the first floor could hold people, but the rooms upstairs used for business were all just painted on.\"\n\nThe little loli explained from the side.\n\nThe walls of the pit were covered with many talismans, and there were also many paper-cut figures pasted there, in different forms but remarkably lifelike. These were the street performers and hawkers, and of course, they included the ladies and the leprous monk.\n\nZhou Ze jumped into the pit, and guided by memory, he bent down, took the shovel, and began to dig. Soon, several bright red things, like pomegranates, appeared, and even red juice flowed out from them.\n\nThe smell was very fragrant.\n\n\"Are these the cluster amaryllis?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Yes, cluster amaryllis,\" the little loli nodded. \"But in a normal Human Realm environment, this is what they look like.\"\n\nXu Qinglang also wanted to lean in for a look, but as soon as he smelled a bit of the scent, his expression suddenly changed. He immediately sat cross-legged and began chanting something, looking as if he absolutely needed to calm his mind.\n\nSeeing his face instantly turn red, so red that it seemed he could wring water out of it, proved how terrifying the effect of these cluster amaryllis was on ordinary people.\n\nEven if poppies were planted, they still had to be processed to become narcotics, and they would go through a series of transformations and operations. But these cluster amaryllis didn't need to; they were just there, and ordinary people couldn't stand even a whiff of their scent.\n\nXu Qinglang had been prepared, yet he still had to adopt such a serious stance to suppress it.\n\nZhou Ze dug around a bit more, found a few more, and also found the corpse of a dead hedgehog. This hedgehog was likely the one he had killed earlier, but it must have died a long time ago; it was already dried into jerky.\n\nA talisman was still pasted on the hedgehog's corpse. Zhou Ze reached out and tore it off.\n\n\"You just asked me if this was a *yao*, and I said no. This is just a *jingmei*, an effect produced by attaching a ghostly talisman to an animal corpse to empower it. It's much lower level than a corpse spirit.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded. He didn't choose to burn all these cluster amaryllis. Instead, he took off his upper garment and wrapped all of them inside.\n\n\"What are you doing?\" The little loli frowned.\n\n\"How about this, I'll take these things to a secluded place and wait. You two go back and find me some good sealed bottles. These things are useful to me,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Don't play with fire and burn yourself,\" the little loli warned with a grave expression.\n\n\"You know what? I just smelled this stuff and suddenly felt an appetite, wanted to eat something. It's much better than plum juice or blueberry juice. It'd be a real waste to burn this. I'll handle it myself and use it as a seasoning before meals.\"\n\nFor someone who had long entered a state of lazy living, the sleeping problem could be solved by hugging Bai Yingying, but the eating problem, even with plum juice, was truly hard to swallow.\n\nWith this stuff, he should be able to enjoy good food. Zhou Ze felt that no matter how dangerous it was, he had to keep it.\n\n\"You... you...\"\n\nOn the side, Xu Qinglang seemed unable to resist the psychedelic effect of the scent with his Pure Heart Mantra.\n\nHe slowly stood up, pointing at Zhou Ze, his face flushed, looking flushed with desire, as if scolding but also moaning:\n\n\"Don't... don't you want... my... juice... anymore?\"\n\nIt seemed Lao Xu was truly deeply poisoned.\n\n\"Get him sober. That sounds disgusting, I'm going to throw up.\"\n\nZhou Ze pointed at the little loli.\n\nThe little loli stepped forward, stuck out her tongue, and directly lashed Xu Qinglang's neck. Xu Qinglang, as if electrocuted, immediately fainted. But even unconscious, his body kept twitching, as if he was doing something in his dream.\n\nHaving dealt with Xu Qinglang, the little loli continued to look at Zhou Ze with a stern face.\n\n\"Stop warning me, it's useless. Food is the paramount concern of the people.\" Zhou Ze was very domineering.\n\nThe little loli shook her head,\n\nAnd said:\n\n\"After you make it, can you share a little with me?\"",

    "content": "The little loli didn't go far, but found a large wine jar in a nearby house. Zhou Ze initially worried if the jar could truly be sealed, and then witnessed a miracle;\n\nThe little loli took out a new, blank exercise book from her backpack, tore out pages one by one, and motioned for Zhou Ze to put the Higanbana inside. Then she took a sheet of paper, licked it with her tongue to moisten it, and stuck it onto the jar. She did this all the way around, then clapped her hands and took out a bottle of mineral water from the car, drinking it \"glug-glug\" as if replenishing the water she had just consumed.\n\nAlright, Zhou Ze knew the little loli's tongue could extend very, very long, but he never expected the saliva from that long tongue to have such an effect. Since the little loli said the seal was absolutely fine, Zhou Ze stopped thinking about it.\n\nOn the way back, Zhou Ze was driving because Xu Qinglang was still unconscious, lying across the back seat, immersed in a beautiful dream, like a drunkard. Of course, this was the result of the little loli knocking him out. If he were awake now, who knew what eye-bleeding things he might do.\n\nThe effect of this stuff on living people truly surpassed all known psychoactive drugs in the world; it was simply on a different level.\n\nHowever, Zhou Ze was very careful on the way back, and thankfully, he didn't encounter any traffic police, otherwise, getting caught for driving without a license would have been hilarious.\n\nFirst, he dropped the little loli off at her home, driving to the outside of Wang Ke's residential complex.\n\nThe little loli sat in the passenger seat. After the car stopped, she wasn't in a hurry to get out. Instead, she glanced at the wine jar at Zhou Ze's feet and licked her lips with her tongue.\n\n\"I'm curious, how did you manage to eat before?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"That's why most Ghost Messengers find hosts. We are mostly dormant, while the host carries out their own activities. Two souls coexist in one body, so the host isn't affected by eating or sleeping.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded. He understood. Because he was a stowaway, even if he coincidentally became a Ghost Messenger, the original owner of this body had already \"GG'd.\" So he was both a lodger and the current owner, naturally unable to fall dormant and let the other soul in this body eat, sleep, and play.\n\n\"Then you shouldn't need this either,\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nThe little loli glanced at Zhou Ze,\n\nand said very seriously:\n\n\"I lived too.\"\n\n\"I know.\"\n\nAll ghosts were once human.\n\n\"So, I also lived a normal life, and I ate.\"\n\n\"Oh, I see.\"\n\n\"So, I also crave food, and I want to try the taste of eating when I'm awake!\"\n\nThe little loli blurted it out in one breath, then propped her hands on her chest, sitting there puffed up with annoyance.\n\n\"Alright, when I make it, I'll save you a portion. You can pick it up at the bookstore when you have time.\"\n\nZhou Ze reached out and gave her a head pat again.\n\nThis time, the little loli didn't resist.\n\n\"Say hi to your dad for me.\" Zhou Ze waved at the little loli, watching her walk into the complex. In truth, it had been a long time since he'd contacted Wang Ke.\n\nLast time, Wang Ke introduced that client to him, and it turned out to be the Sea God's woman. Of course, this matter certainly had no direct connection to Wang Ke.\n\nSo, Zhou Ze realized he was truly a fickle and ungrateful person. He and his childhood friend had never contacted each other after starting work, and even after recognizing each other, their relationship remained distant. Of course, there was also Dr. Lin's family, which Zhou Ze didn't bother to think too much about.\n\nBuddha said that people need to introspect.\n\nZhou Ze smiled. Introspection was too boring. It was more enjoyable to go back and tinker with this thing sooner. Just thinking about not having to wolf down food anymore, but being able to eat slowly and deliberately, filled his life with hope.\n\nZhou Ze had also asked the little loli why she didn't just go to Hell and pick some Higanbana if she could go down there anytime she wanted. The little loli gave him a look reserved for idiots.\n\nHow many eyes were watching on the Road to the Underworld?\n\nA small Ghost Messenger going down just to pick Higanbana and come back up?\n\nWas he tired of living?\n\nBack at the bookstore, the old Daoist was sitting at the entrance smoking. Zhou Ze gestured for the old Daoist to come help him carry Xu Qinglang inside.\n\n\"Oh, what happened to him?\" the old Daoist asked after picking up Xu Qinglang.\n\n\"He's drunk,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\n\"Drunk, but no smell of alcohol?\" The old Daoist was a bit confused but didn't ask further, carrying Xu Qinglang directly upstairs.\n\nZhou Ze carried the wine jar into the bookstore and found that Bai Yingying wasn't on the first floor. He didn't ask the Death Servant for help but simply carried the jar himself up to the second floor.\n\nHe pushed open the bedroom door with his foot,\n\nand happened to encounter Bai Yingying opening the door and walking out.\n\nBai Yingying's face was flushed, incredibly excited, and she screamed hysterically:\n\n\"AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\"\n\nThis scared Boss Zhou so much he almost dropped the wine jar in his hands.\n\nBoss Zhou guaranteed,\n\nif the wine jar broke,\n\nand the Higanbana inside were also ruined,\n\nhe would definitely, without hesitation, stab the female zombie in front of him a hundred times!\n\n\"AHHHHH!!!!\"\n\nBai Yingying saw Zhou Ze return,\n\nand excitedly rushed over, hugging Zhou Ze directly and kissing him on the cheek,\n\n\"AHHHHH, we're the champions, Boss!\n\nRNG won the championship!!!!\"\n\nBai Yingying was as happy as a hundred-pound idiot.\n\n\"A battle royale game?\" Zhou Ze asked tentatively.\n\nBoss Zhou had been a surgeon in his past life, incredibly busy. Any spare time he had was spent researching the latest medical equipment and classic cases, driving himself like a top to climb higher and achieve his life's ideals. He had no time for games.\n\nIn this life, having died once, he understood the true meaning of a lazy, slow-paced life and had no desire to play games.\n\nSo, about any championships,\n\nor RNG,\n\nBoss Zhou was truly clueless.\n\n\"It's League of Legends, you know, 'LoL,'\" Bai Yingying explained.\n\n\"Oh, as long as you're happy.\"\n\nZhou Ze motioned for Bai Yingying to move aside. He wished he had asked the Death Servant for help instead. Why did this internet-addicted girl suddenly seem so unreliable?\n\nBut then, looking at the exhilarated Bai Yingying with her white hair,\n\nZhou Ze suddenly felt that watching her happy with such indulgence was also a kind of happiness.\n\nPerhaps because his body was still weak and hadn't fully recovered from the fight, Zhou Ze slept for a long time, waking up close to noon. Bai Yingying, as usual, waited for her boss to wake up before getting out of bed with him.\n\nZhou Ze washed up and went downstairs, planning to ask the old Daoist to get money to buy some lab equipment or sealing containers. He wanted to extract the Higanbana juice for preservation; keeping it in the wine jar wouldn't be suitable anymore.\n\nThe old Daoist was currently greeting customers. Xu Qinglang was still unconscious, and Bai Yingying had to go downstairs with Zhou Ze. The Death Servant only knew how to sit in a corner motionless, so only the old Daoist could handle customers.\n\nThe old Daoist surprisingly managed to concoct coffee and cocktails in a decent manner, at least enough to satisfy the customers.\n\nZhou Ze frowned slightly because the window seat he usually liked was occupied by two young girls.\n\nThis made Zhou Ze recall Xu Qinglang's suggestion: change the minimum consumption to one thousand yuan, which would keep many living people from coming in.\n\nOf course, since they were here, they were guests, so Zhou Ze could only choose another sofa and sit down. At the same time, he gave the old Daoist a few instructions, and the old Daoist acknowledged them and went out to buy things.\n\nBoss Zhou continued to pick up a newspaper and drink tea, entering his lazy state.\n\nThe bookstore was a bit noisy because there were two tables of customers: one table with the two girls, and another table with two young mothers. The young mothers had two children, a boy and a girl, running around the bookstore, causing some commotion.\n\nThe two children even ran to where the Death Servant was sitting. The boy pointed at the Death Servant and told the girl next to him which superhero he was and what special abilities he had. He probably genuinely thought the motionless Death Servant was a statue, since the Death Servant had no breath or heartbeat.\n\nTheir voices were a bit loud, so loud that Zhou Ze almost wanted to order the Death Servant to take off his mask to satisfy the two children's wishes.\n\nHe thought about it,\n\nbut decided against it,\n\nthere was no need to get angry with children.\n\nZhou Ze simply pulled out his phone and refreshed the news.\n\nJust then, the mothers of the two children seemed to notice their children's noise and stood up, calling out to their children to quiet down and not disturb others. The two children were quite obedient and indeed stopped talking, starting to look for comic books.\n\n\"Brother, come here, I have Doraemon,\" the little girl quietly called out to the boy with a comic book in her hand.\n\nUpon hearing this, the boy immediately scurried over from the other end.\n\nBut at this moment,\n\none of the two girls who had been occupying Zhou Ze's window-side sunbathing spot suddenly extended her leg as the boy passed by her,\n\nand the boy tripped directly,\n\n\"Smack!\"\n\nThere was a sound,\n\nand the boy fell directly to the ground,\n\nfalling hard, especially hitting his nose, which immediately started bleeding.\n\n\"Wuwuwu...\"\n\nThe boy sat on the ground and immediately cried, looking with wronged and scared eyes at the brightly dressed older girl beside him.\n\n\"Oh, little friend, how could you be so clumsy? Does it hurt? Let older sister see.\"\n\nThe girl who had intentionally tripped the boy immediately stood up with concern and helped the little boy up.\n\nThe little boy's mother heard the crying and immediately turned her head to look, running over to pick up her child,\n\n\"Oh, you're bleeding. I told you not to mess around, but you didn't listen. Look how hard you fell, you're bleeding.\"\n\nThe mother started scolding her son.\n\nThe little boy reached out, crying, and tried to point at the older sister in front of him. He knew she had tripped him.\n\n\"It's just children, falling and stumbling is common. Hurry and take the little friend to the hospital,\" the girl and her friend immediately came over to comfort her.\n\nThe boy's mother had been busy chatting with her best friend and hadn't seen the fall. She nodded to the girl, \"Thank you, I'll go to the hospital.\"\n\nWith that,\n\nthe mother immediately had her best friend take her daughter and leave the bookstore.\n\nThe little boy, held by his mother, couldn't help but glance at the older sister who had intentionally tripped him as they left the bookstore.\n\nAfter the children and mothers had left,\n\nthe two girls sat back down on the sofa.\n\nThe girl who had extended her leg sighed and chuckled:\n\n\"So noisy. These brats are the worst, no upbringing. I hate them.\"\n\n\"Hehe, your leg move was fast.\"\n\n\"Was it? Seeing those brats suffer makes me happy, especially since he fell and bled, got a nosebleed, I just feel so good, hehe.\"\n\n\"Me too, me too. Those two kids were so noisy, it's a pity they didn't fall to their death.\"\n\n\"Haha, you're so vicious.\"",

    "content": "Zhou Ze silently put down his phone and rubbed his eyes.\n\nDeadpool stood up, picked up a rag nearby, and walked over to where the two girls were sitting. He bent down and began wiping away the bloodstains the little boy had left.\n\nDeadpool's job at the bookstore was very simple: cleaning.\n\nHe required no wages, no food or lodging, never complained, never protested, never spoke out of turn; he simply buried himself in his work.\n\n\"Oh my god, he's actually alive,\" one girl exclaimed.\n\nThey had noticed Deadpool before, but because he remained perfectly still, they and the two children had assumed he was just a humanoid model or sculpture displayed in the bookstore.\n\nDeadpool professionally cleaned up, stood up, and prepared to leave.\n\nBut Zhou Ze gestured for him to stay put.\n\nAt this moment, the two girls, whether out of mischief or interest, came forward and asked to take a picture with Deadpool. One was responsible for taking the photo, and the other went up to pose with Deadpool.\n\nPerhaps, in their eyes, he was an actor hired by the bookstore for promotion.\n\nBoss Zhou lit a cigarette and watched as the two girls continuously took photos with Deadpool. One girl, overly excited, asked Deadpool if he could remove his mask for another photo.\n\nDeadpool didn't move, looking at Zhou Ze, waiting for his command.\n\n\"It seems your boss is very strict. It's so hot, and he still makes you wear full-body clothing,\" one girl complained on Deadpool's behalf.\n\n\"Boss, let him take off his mask and take a picture with us. What if he's a handsome guy?\" the other girl pleaded with Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze nodded, signaling Deadpool that he could remove his mask.\n\nThen Deadpool removed his mask.\n\nImmediately, there was several seconds of dead silence.\n\nFollowed by:\n\n\"Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!\"\n\nThe two girls screamed frantically, scrambling out of the bookstore. The girl who had tripped the little boy earlier even bumped into the glass door as she rushed through it, her face bleeding.\n\nThe impact made Zhou Ze wince; it looked like she would be disfigured.\n\nDeadpool seemed bewildered but showed no emotional fluctuation.\n\nAfter being struck by the Ghost Samurai's blade last time, a massive scar ran from his face downwards, making him even more terrifying than he already was.\n\nRather than calling him a \"person,\" it was more accurate to say he was a humanoid worm.\n\nZhou Ze wasn't sure why he kept him. To keep him for cleaning? To save on a janitor's expense?\n\nOf course, it certainly wasn't some \"deep father-son affection\" nonsense.\n\nPerhaps, it was a sense of pity.\n\nNo matter how much of a scoundrel the priest was when he was alive, look at the things he had done—he was truly capable of causing trouble!\n\nAnd after dying, he could stand up again. This kind of thing, though seemingly useless now, felt quite a shame to discard like trash.\n\n\"Put it back on.\"\n\nZhou Ze said.\n\nNot just the two girls, but even Boss Zhou, who had seen his share of things, found it a bit an eyesore.\n\nDeadpool nodded and put his mask back on.\n\nZhou Ze instinctively flicked off his cigarette ash.\n\nSeeing Deadpool about to approach with the rag again, he awkwardly stomped his shoe on the ground and instructed:\n\n\"Go burn those two hell banknotes from the counter outside the door.\"\n\n…………\n\nOld Daoist knew many people from all walks of life. His entire life, he had essentially been drifting, never forming a family nor having children. By traditional Chinese values, Old Daoist was undoubtedly a typical example of a failure.\n\nBut he himself only sought to live freely and happily, as long as he was content. Anyway, after death, everyone had to walk the path to the underworld and jump on the Bridge of Helplessness. Therefore, he might as well live as uninhibited as possible while alive.\n\nHe had been in Tongcheng for over half a year, but he had also made quite a few shady friends.\n\nActually, according to Zhou Ze's intention, he wanted to get a set of basic research equipment, like those found in hospitals or high school chemistry labs. He needed to roughly purify and package the Other Shore Flower into a form convenient for carrying and smoking.\n\nOld Daoist didn't know exactly what Zhou Ze was doing; he only knew to complete the tasks his boss assigned as perfectly as possible.\n\nAfter leaving the bookstore, he picked up his phone and called a friend he had made in Tongcheng, asking if he could get a set of purification laboratory equipment.\n\nThe man was silent for a moment, then said, \"Okay.\"\n\nThe two agreed to meet at a coffee shop on South Street. After Old Daoist sat down, he felt a bit foolish, wishing he had met at the bookstore instead; it was just across the street from the bookstore, and he had wasted money on coffee.\n\nThe man arrived, with a full beard. He was a cousin of Old Daoist. Old Daoist had just come out of a roll-up door after comforting a fallen woman when this man was standing at the entrance waiting.\n\nOld Daoist shared a cigarette with him. The two nodded, and then the man thanked Old Daoist, saying he had helped to \"grease the path\" for him, which made things easier.\n\nLater, Old Daoist went again, but when the roll-up door opened, it was the man who walked out.\n\nWith two such experiences, they were considered cousins. They even added each other on WeChat and went out for a barbecue together. Old Daoist knew he was involved in smuggling, basically just a petty gangster, but he was getting older.\n\n\"Yo, you look pretty bad.\" Old Daoist asked with some concern, \"Go less next time, take better care of yourself. If your body breaks down, who will they rely on?\"\n\nThe bearded man paused, nodded, and then said:\n\n\"That stuff, what do you want it for?\"\n\n\"My boss plans to use it to purify something. Anyway, the stuff he makes is not for ordinary people to touch; if they do, there'll be big problems.\"\n\nOld Daoist said very seriously.\n\n\"Is that stuff potent?\" the bearded man asked.\n\n\"Potent?\"\n\nOld Daoist thought for a moment. Xu Qinglang had been carried back to his room yesterday. Although his boss said he was drunk, Old Daoist could tell it was clearly not. He immediately said:\n\n\"It's very potent. Anyway, lying in bed is very exhilarating and fun. Damn, it's scary to watch.\"\n\nThe bearded man swallowed, and continued to ask, \"Then after you make it, where will it mainly circulate?\"\n\n\"Circulate?\"\n\nOld Daoist thought for a moment. The stuff his boss made probably couldn't be used by ordinary people; maybe it would only circulate with the little loli or Boss Liang. He replied:\n\n\"It'll probably just circulate within their own circles.\"\n\n\"Existing market, right?\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"I'm asking, will it only circulate in Tongcheng?\"\n\nOld Daoist remembered that Boss Liang was in Shanghai, adding:\n\n\"Maybe it'll also be sent to Shanghai.\"\n\n\"It'll even circulate to Shanghai?\" The bearded man's expression grew increasingly grave; his tension was clearly visible.\n\n\"Hey, what's wrong with you?\"\n\n\"Nothing...nothing...\"\n\nSaying this,\n\nThe bearded man reached up, took out a small earphone from his ear, placed it on the table, then clasped his hands together and apologized:\n\n\"Sorry, brother. I just got caught by the police for smuggling.\"\n\n\"This...\"\n\nOld Daoist was utterly bewildered.\n\nThis,\n\nNo,\n\nNo, this...\n\nJust then,\n\nCustomers at a nearby coffee table stood up. One person restrained the bearded man, while two others each held Old Daoist by the shoulder, pinning him down on the sofa.\n\n\"Behave!\"\n\nOld Daoist's face was full of grievance.\n\nThere's a misunderstanding,\n\nOfficer!\n\n\"This is my ID. We suspect you are involved in drug production and trafficking. Please cooperate with our investigation.\"\n\nSeveral more police officers walked in from outside. One of them flashed his ID in front of Old Daoist.\n\n…………\n\n\"Boss, where's Old Daoist?\" Bai Yingying asked Zhou Ze after washing up and coming out.\n\n\"He went out to buy something for me. I need to process the Other Shore Flower that came back yesterday,\" Zhou Ze replied. \"What's wrong with him, he hasn't bought the stuff back after so long.\"\n\nBai Yingying nodded, but then her gaze suddenly changed. She immediately walked over to the boss and said:\n\n\"Boss, many people outside are watching us.\"\n\n\"What?\" Boss Zhou hadn't fully woken up from his lazy, newspaper-reading state.\n\n\"Those few pedestrians over there, and the ones sitting on the steps reading newspapers or playing on their phones, the two women waiting for the bus at the stop—they're all staring at us.\"\n\nBai Yingying said very firmly.\n\nBoss Zhou stood up and went to the bookstore entrance to look around.\n\nHe wouldn't doubt Bai Yingying's judgment; in this regard, she was actually stronger than him, as there wasn't much difference between him and ordinary people when he wasn't in \"Musou\" state.\n\nJust then, Xu Qinglang stumbled down the stairs, wearing loose pajamas, rubbing his head and complaining:\n\n\"My head hurts so much.\"\n\n\"Did you have a very satisfying dream last night?\" Zhou Ze turned around and teased.\n\n\"That Other Shore Flower really can't be touched,\" Xu Qinglang shook his head and said. \"It's even worse than being drunk.\"\n\nIn a window seat on the third floor of a building across from the bookstore, a detective observing with high-powered binoculars immediately reported through his earpiece:\n\n\"Report, there's another woman in the bookstore who has come downstairs. Suspect a non-legitimate relationship with the suspect bookstore owner.\"\n\nJust then,\n\nThe little loli, just dismissed from school, got off the bus, carrying a large school bag, and walked towards the bookstore.\n\nShe was in a good mood, humming a tune, looking innocent and carefree.\n\nThe thought of being able to take some back for a late-night snack once Zhou Ze finished making that stuff filled her with anticipation. She had been craving it, wanting to re-experience the pleasure of eating.\n\nShe pushed open the bookstore door and walked in, and for the first time ever, she greeted Zhou Ze with a smiling face:\n\n\"Chief, is that stuff ready yet?\"\n\nThe distant detective reported again:\n\n\"Report, request to delay forced entry plan;\n\nA female child has entered the bookstore, suspected of possibly being taken hostage by the suspect.\"",

    "content": "\"So, how are you planning to handle it? You still haven't bought the equipment.\"\n\n\"The old Taoist hasn't come back yet.\"\n\n\"Why is that old guy so slow? If you'd told me earlier, I would've gotten you a set myself,\" the little loli said helplessly.\n\nIf they couldn't buy it, couldn't they just steal it?\n\nAnyway, it wasn't some high-tech instrument. Boss Zhou wasn't setting up a biochemical research lab here; getting some stuff from a high school chemistry lab would be enough.\n\n\"So, you're planning to make it into something like a capsule?\" The little loli pointed at the design sketch Zhou Ze had drawn. \"Can you make it?\"\n\n\"It's not that difficult. The important thing is to purify it first, then compress it, ideally into crystals. Otherwise, it won't be convenient for us to carry or use, and we need to eliminate any impact on ordinary people around us.\"\n\nThe little loli nodded. She didn't quite understand, but since Zhou Ze thumped his chest and guaranteed it wasn't a difficult technical task and he could do it himself once the equipment arrived, she was willing to wait a bit longer.\n\n\"Then I'm leaving. I'm really disappointed; I thought we'd go out for a late-night snack today.\"\n\n\"I have plum juice; you can make do with that.\"\n\n\"You eat just for the sake of eating. You don't enjoy the deliciousness of food at all. I'm not interested. It's easier to just fall asleep and let Wang Rui go eat and sleep on her own.\"\n\nThe tall and the small figures walked down from the second floor.\n\nThen,\n\nZhou Ze froze,\n\nbecause a third of the first floor was actually occupied by customers.\n\nZhou Ze swore to the heavens,\n\nsince opening,\n\nhis bookstore had never had such a high occupancy rate!\n\nHad the living standards of Tongcheng residents suddenly skyrocketed? Was a minimum spend of 100 yuan truly outdated?\n\nHowever, soon, Zhou Ze and the little loli both stopped in their tracks.\n\nAmong the guests, two or three gave Zhou Ze and the little loli a slight sense of pressure, as if those two people carried an invisible light, somewhat dazzling.\n\nEither this group of people were desperate criminals or gang members who had seen and participated in violent skirmishes, or they should be police officers.\n\nThe former possibility was unlikely; Boss Zhou didn't feel he had done anything to warrant these \"socialites\" specially coming here to sit around. Moreover, judging by their expressions—pretending to drink and read but constantly observing their surroundings—their profession was obvious.\n\n\"Did you break the law?\" the little loli whispered to Zhou Ze.\n\n\"No, I didn't,\" Zhou Ze whispered back.\n\nBoss Zhou believed that his recent actions shouldn't have attracted police to his doorstep. Even if there were occasional gray areas, he would have people burn冥钞* at the bookstore entrance, and the trouble would pass.\n\nCould it be that the two girls he scared away this morning had powerful backgrounds?\n\nHe thought about it and felt it didn't make sense. Firstly, those two girls might not have the courage to seek revenge, and secondly, even if it were revenge, why such a display? Besides, he had already had the Deadman burn paper money afterward.\n\nBoss Zhou always disliked trouble the most.\n\n\"You go upstairs, and take the wine jar with you, then leave,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nThe little loli nodded, turned, and went straight upstairs.\n\nZhou Ze gave the Deadman, who was sitting idly by, a look, signaling him to go up and leave with the little loli.\n\nBai Yingying was still serving tea and drinks to everyone. Zhou Ze walked over and reclined in his original spot, picking up a newspaper from the table and casually flipping through it.\n\nBai Yingying carried a cup of coffee and walked up to Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Go upstairs, then leave,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"They are...\" Bai Yingying had already noticed something was amiss. She had mentioned before that someone was watching the place from outside, and now they had openly entered the shop disguised as customers.\n\nBai Yingying's identity had been arranged by Xu Qinglang, and it couldn't withstand scrutiny.\n\nOnce Bai Yingying also went upstairs, Zhou Ze had no more worries.\n\nActually, for Zhou Ze, what was most illicit in the bookstore were the people themselves.\n\nFor example, Bai Yingying's identity—how could you explain to the police that she was from the Qing Dynasty, during the Xianfeng Emperor's reign?\n\nOr the Deadman; if you peeled back his coat, how would you explain that?\n\nZhou Ze had initially worried that having Bai Yingying and the others leave first might alert the officers present, but clearly, Zhou Ze had overthought it. On the contrary, the little loli and Bai Yingying going upstairs seemed to make the officers breathe a sigh of relief, thinking that Zhou Ze no longer had hostages nearby.\n\nXu Qinglang delivered cocktails to the last table. As he passed Zhou Ze, he curiously gave Zhou Ze a look, meaning, \"What's going on here?\"\n\nZhou Ze shrugged.\n\n\"Ask me, a ghost,\"\n\n\"I don't know either.\"\n\nBut Boss Zhou immediately thought of something and reminded Xu Qinglang:\n\n\"Have them pay first.\"\n\nXu Qinglang thought this was a good idea. It was rare to have so many suckers come in; it was best to settle the bill first. Most importantly, what if these officers suddenly changed their identities, like Emperor Kangxi on an incognito tour? Then it would be inconvenient to collect money.\n\nOld Xu went to collect the money, table by table.\n\nThe police actually paid. They probably felt it would be awkward to reveal their identities while paying.\n\nOnce Xu Qinglang had collected all the money and put it in the bar drawer,\n\nZhou Ze breathed a sigh of relief.\n\nIt was good that the money was collected.\n\nNext,\n\n\"Let the show begin.\"\n\nBut he waited and waited. These police officers continued to drink their coffee or beverages without anyone standing up and revealing their identity to Zhou Ze.\n\nThis made Boss Zhou a bit helpless.\n\n\"Can't you just get to the point?\"\n\nBoss Zhou stood up and walked to the bookstore door, pushing it open.\n\nEven at this moment, the police inside the room still didn't stand up.\n\nWhat exactly was going on?\n\nZhou Ze was completely confused.\n\nHe subconsciously took two steps forward.\n\nAnd then, just at that moment, two passersby from either side of the bookstore door suddenly rushed up, each grabbing one of Zhou Ze's shoulders, trying to restrain him.\n\nUnder the sudden stimulation, Zhou Ze almost lost control and brought out his armor or claws. He had to keep taking deep breaths to calm himself, cooperating with the two plainclothes officers, even actively putting his hands behind his back to let them handcuff him.\n\nThe two plainclothes officers were stunned for a moment. In all their years on the force, this was the first time they had seen such a cooperative suspect.\n\nThis time, Boss Zhou wasn't being cowardly. The key was that he needed to figure out what crime he had committed, right?\n\nWith such a big operation and so many police officers visiting his shop, Boss Zhou was utterly bewildered.\n\n\"We are the police. We suspect you are involved in drug manufacturing and trafficking. Please cooperate with us. We will take you back to the police station for investigation.\"\n\nA middle-aged police officer walked up to Zhou Ze and showed him his ID.\n\nDrug manufacturing?\n\nDrug trafficking?\n\nBoss Zhou looked utterly bewildered.\n\nBoss Zhou was taken into a police car. Xu Qinglang, who was inside, was also apprehended and put into a police car. Bai Yingying, the little loli, and the Deadman were not discovered, perhaps because the police didn't suspect them.\n\nAt the police station, after going through the interrogation room, the questions the police asked made Zhou Ze laugh and cry.\n\nHe personally set up a workshop to make drugs?\n\nNot only circulating in Tongcheng, but also preparing to enter the Shanghai market? And even using Shanghai as a springboard to radiate further out?\n\nBoss Zhou wanted to ask himself:\n\n\"Am I really that diligent?\"\n\nThe police seemed to be searching his bookstore. During the interrogation, someone called the interrogating officer, who then specifically asked Zhou Ze why there was a freezer in Zhou Ze's bedroom.\n\nAnd that kind of freezer clearly looked like it was for dead bodies, the same model rented out in morgues.\n\nZhou Ze said that summer was coming, and the air conditioning wasn't strong enough, so he used that thing for cooling.\n\nThe interrogating officer pounded on the table and reprimanded Zhou Ze to correct his attitude, cooperate with the interrogation, and that leniency would be granted for confession, while resistance would be met with severity!\n\nBoss Zhou couldn't help but roll his eyes. He probably figured if he said that if he didn't have that high school girl (Bai Yingying) sleeping with him, he'd have to lie in a freezer to sleep, this officer would think his attitude was even more problematic, or that he was actively toying with the police.\n\nAfter the interrogation, Zhou Ze was sent to the detention center, a temporary holding facility at the police station. The police seemed to have a certain number of hours for detention, and if there was no concrete evidence, Boss Zhou would be released once that time was up.\n\nIn short,\n\nThe whole day had been very strange. He was inexplicably treated as a drug trafficker. Of course, Zhou Ze also felt a little lucky that day when the delivery driver fell outside his door; he took the money but flushed that bag of blue pills down the toilet instead of keeping it. Otherwise, if it had been found, it would truly have been a case of a yellow stain on his pants—whether it was shit or not, it would look like it.\n\nOf course, that time was because he had burned冥钞, so logically, it shouldn't have led to any trouble. So, Zhou Ze was still thinking, where did the problem lie?\n\nThe detention center was small, and Zhou Ze was temporarily held in a room.\n\n\"Boss, boss, you're in here too!\"\n\nZhou Ze had just prepared to sit down when he heard the old Taoist's voice from the opposite cell.\n\nZhou Ze looked over, frowned, and said, \"How did you end up in here too?\"\n\nThe old Taoist's face was wrinkled like a chrysanthemum. He said,\n\n\"Boss, I'm so unlucky. I went to buy equipment for you, but the vendor was a smuggler who just got caught by the police. I went to buy that stuff and described it, and they thought I was preparing to make drugs.\n\nThen they arrested me and kept asking me about the specific process. I explained it was a misunderstanding, but they didn't believe me. They also asked me who I was buying the equipment for, and I could only say it was for you. They wouldn't even let me call you to inform you.\"\n\nZhou Ze understood. So, this mess was the old Taoist's fault.\n\n\"Couldn't you just buy those things at a school or a laboratory supply store? Why did you go looking for a smuggler?\"\n\n\"Uh, I was just thinking of buying some good equipment for you, Boss. What you brought yesterday, even this humble Taoist could tell it was very precious, good stuff. And you value it so much, so of course this humble Taoist had to choose better equipment for you.\"\n\n\"Thank you for that,\" Zhou Ze said sarcastically.\n\n\"So, what exactly was that thing?\" The old Taoist's curiosity was piqued. He didn't take his arrest seriously; after all, the innocent would be proven innocent, and misunderstandings would eventually be cleared.\n\n\"I had Lin Ke move it. That thing cannot fall into the wrong hands, or it will cause huge trouble.\"\n\nIn any case, the Other Shore Flower could not be obtained by ordinary people; otherwise, it would cause immense disaster.\n\n\"From underground?\" The old Taoist pointed downwards.\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"Oh, this humble Taoist understands,\" the old Taoist realized. So it was something from Hell.\n\n\"Just wait,\" Zhou Ze said. \"We'll probably be released soon.\"\n\n\"Mhm. Once we're out, I'll go directly to a school to buy the equipment for you, Boss, and you can continue making it,\" the old Taoist said.\n\n...\n\nIn the monitoring room,\n\nThe video and audio were transmitted synchronously.\n\nSeveral police officers stood there, watching and listening.\n\n\"Director Sun, you truly have a way. As expected, putting the two suspects together, they're bound to reveal some clues. I was worried they would collude earlier,\" a police officer said.\n\nOne of the older police officers took a deep breath, and with a hint of anger, slammed his hand on the table, reprimanding:\n\n\"What kind of work have you done?!\n\nYou let the suspect transfer the drugs before the bust! Have the search results from that bookstore come out yet? Did you find no evidence at all?\n\nAnd, in our Tongcheng, there's actually an underground channel that provides raw materials for drug manufacturing to criminals, and we didn't even discover it! This is a disgrace to the Tongcheng police force!\n\nFurthermore, did you hear just now? The suspect is convinced we can't catch him red-handed, and he's even planning to go back and continue making drugs after his detention period ends!\n\nInvestigate,\n\nInvestigate thoroughly,\n\nInvestigate until everything comes to light!\"\n\n---\n*冥钞 (míngchāo): Spirit money or hell money, burned as offerings to the deceased in traditional Chinese religious practices.",

    "content": "Zhou Boss had no idea how deeply the misunderstandings about him had accumulated with the police officers. He also had no awareness of anti-surveillance skills. In his previous life, he had left the orphanage clean and worked hard like a model worker, never entering a detention center in his entire life. This life, however, he had been in twice. The last time was when he had just borrowed a corpse to return his soul, and it was Doctor Lin who had come to pick him up.\n\nHe remembered at the time, he was chatting with a guy next to him about how good-looking that woman was, etcetera, etcetera...\n\nWhen the police led Doctor Lin to Zhou Ze and said, \"Your wife is here to pick you up,\"\n\nZhou Ze was utterly bewildered.\n\nHe sat down on the bench. It was a bit cold underneath, but Zhou Ze wasn't afraid of the cold. At this point, Zhou Ze noticed that only the old Taoist and he were locked up together. Old Xu wasn't detained here.\n\nThis was truly an uncalled-for disaster, with its cause and process having a comical effect that made one not know whether to laugh or cry.\n\nAt this moment, the detention center door opened, and two police officers pushed a dining cart in. Each detainee received a bento box and a bottle of mineral water.\n\nThe bento box quality was quite good, with two meat and two vegetable dishes. The police officers even asked if the food was enough, and if not, there was extra plain white rice available.\n\nThe old Taoist specifically asked for two bento boxes and ate them with great relish.\n\nZhou Ze opened his bento box, picked up his chopsticks, and poked at the meat pieces a few times, simply having no appetite.\n\nThe thing that Other Shore Flower was making hadn't been finished yet, and he didn't have any plum juice or anything. Under these circumstances, asking Zhou Ze to eat was truly difficult for him.\n\nA police officer nearby noticed this scene and his expression showed some displeasure, saying, \"So picky?\"\n\nZhou Ze looked back at him, said nothing, put down his chopsticks, opened the mineral water, and took a few sips.\n\nAn afternoon passed uneventfully like this. The old Taoist wanted to chat with the boss, fearing he might be bored, but seeing the boss had no interest in talking, he simply leaned against the bars and started snoring.\n\nWith the old Taoist's life experience, entering a detention center was like returning home, so familiar that it couldn't be more so. He ate well, drank well, and slept soundly inside.\n\nThe guys here spoke very kindly; he absolutely loved it here.\n\nZhou Boss, on the other hand, was sitting leaning against the wall, daydreaming, neither depressed nor bewildered. It was purely as if he had moved the sofa in the bookstore to a different spot, treating it as a different kind of \"salty fish\" experience.\n\nBut no matter how much of a \"salty fish\" he was, by evening, Zhou Boss couldn't sit still anymore. His routine had been very regular these days; at this hour, he should be sleeping, but without Bai Yingying beside him and no refrigerator here, he couldn't sleep.\n\nThe two police officers in the distance had already changed shifts. The two new officers, one was constantly patrolling, and the other was sitting there seemingly reading a book.\n\nThe old Taoist was still snoring away, seemingly sleeping even more soundly than at home.\n\nZhou Ze suddenly thought of *The Count of Monte Cristo*. He remembered that in the story, the Count of Monte Cristo seemingly escaped by digging a tunnel. Although he had no tools around him, could his fingernails dig?\n\nBut rather than digging a tunnel, wouldn't it be better to just pick the lock with his fingernails?\n\nAnd those two police officers, he seemed to be able to...\n\nHis armor could block bullets, right?\n\nAs Zhou Boss's mind was wandering,\n\nA \"clank clank... clank clank...\" friction sound suddenly came from his ear.\n\nThe sound was like chains dragging on the ground, a bit crisp, and a bit muffled.\n\nZhou Ze was somewhat surprised. Did people still wear shackles these days?\n\nIt shouldn't be.\n\nHe looked towards the door, but saw no one being escorted in, yet the \"clank clank\" sound continued incessantly, getting closer and closer.\n\nAnd the two police officers, including the old Taoist and other inmates, showed no reaction at all.\n\nZhou Ze opened his mouth and yawned. He understood; perhaps only he could hear this sound.\n\nWhat a sound only he could hear meant, there was no need to say much.\n\nBut Zhou Ze found it strange that a place like a police station could also have such a thing?\n\nHis middle school political science textbook clearly stated that the police were an armed state violent organ endowed by state law, a state machine, which neither gods nor ghosts dared to offend.\n\nThis was also why Zhou Ze was unwilling to cause conflict and willingly allowed himself to be arrested for questioning to clarify the situation. Firstly, he didn't want to ruin his previous bookstore life. Secondly, getting into direct conflict with the police was an unwise thing to do, even if he was a ghost messenger.\n\nTherefore, Zhou Ze found it somewhat surprising that something \"dirty\" would appear here.\n\n\"Clank clank... clank clank...\"\n\nThe sound came from far away and drew near, but it never truly appeared. Zhou Ze felt like a virgin who had bought a ticket to a strip club, anxiously waiting for the performer on stage to quickly take off the two most important pieces of clothing.\n\nBut it just made your heart itch, it just brushed against you, never letting you in, deliberately scratching at your heart.\n\nZhou Boss was truly a bit impulsive at this moment, wanting to directly break the lock, push open the door, and peek into the corridor to see which ignorant great power was causing trouble here.\n\nA police officer walked over, looked at Zhou Ze, who was gripping the bars with both hands and looking towards the exit, and sighed, saying:\n\n\"Confession brings leniency, resistance brings severity. Confess everything you need to, and you'll be able to get out. At least you can find peace of mind, right?\"\n\nZhou Ze completely ignored him, continuing to look towards the exit.\n\n\"Hey, I'm talking to you. You're not very old, are you? About the same age as my son.\"\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze turned his head this time and looked at this police uncle.\n\n\"Big brother, you really aren't suited for political education work.\"\n\n\"Hey, it's fine. Let's just chat casually.\"\n\nThe police officer actually sat down directly on the ground, sitting across from Zhou Ze through the bars, as if preparing for a heart-to-heart talk.\n\nBut Zhou Boss's attention was basically drawn to the sound of chains in the corridor. He was in no mood to entertain this person now.\n\nMoreover, this uncle was very dishonest. Zhou Ze had noticed him at first glance during the shift change; he carried a strong aura of righteous integrity, especially the national emblem on his police hat, which seemed to be glowing in Zhou Ze's eyes.\n\nWould such a police officer be relegated to being a jailer?\n\nZhou Ze was not naive enough to believe that any random jailer in a police station was a hidden master.\n\n\"Hey, let me tell you something confidential. I've heard about your case. I know you're married, and you have your own family, so we didn't inform your wife this time;\n\nYou might also have been misled. In fact, many of you drug manufacturers are just tools of drug trafficking organizations. There's really no need to take the fall for them. As long as you can truthfully tell us all the clues you know, you have a chance to atone for your crimes.\"\n\nZhou Ze waved his hand impatiently,\n\n\"You've really got it wrong. I don't make drugs, and I don't touch that stuff. This is just a small misunderstanding. I just wanted to buy a simple set of equipment to make orange crystal drinks for myself.\"\n\n\"Don't be so resistant, and don't rush to deny it. Calm down and think carefully again.\" The uncle continued to patiently advise.\n\nPerhaps, in his view, Zhou Ze was young, and his resume was simple, so he should be an easy breakthrough.\n\nBut he couldn't know that Zhou Boss was someone who had already died once. Not to mention that he hadn't done those awful things, even if he had, with Zhou Boss's temperament, how could he be so easily broken by a few words from you?\n\n\"Think about it. We've already noticed you this time. Evidence will be found sooner or later. If you want no one to know, don't do it. There are gods watching from above, right?\n\nBesides, you know the harm that drugs cause. Don't you fear going to hell for doing so many immoral things?\"\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze.\n\n\"We're just chatting casually. Anyway, it's not an interrogation, and there won't be any recording, so I can speak more freely.\" The police officer coughed.\n\n\"To be honest with you,\" Zhou Ze said helplessly.\n\n\"You speak, I'll listen.\" The police officer quietly made a gesture, signaling his colleague watching the monitors to pay attention, while he also listened intently.\n\n\"This is really just a misunderstanding. You've checked my resume, you should know my wife's family is very rich. Also, you arrested that employee of mine named Xu at the bookstore. You can check, he owns over twenty properties.\n\nIn this day and age, no matter if you're in physical business, innovation, or anything else, where is it as fast and stable as real estate for making money?\n\nEven that guy over there wearing a Taoist robe, he alone has sponsored hundreds of students in mountainous areas. A single live broadcast can bring in tens of thousands.\n\nAre we so bored that with all this money, we'd go into drug manufacturing and trafficking?\"\n\nZhou Ze felt he was being very candid.\n\nThe meaning was clear:\n\nWe don't lack money.\n\nEven Zhou Boss, the one with the least money, could get money if he swallowed his pride and flattered his father-in-law, or even simpler, he could fool some burial items from Bai Yingying and sell them as antiques to live a life of comfort.\n\n\"Hmm...\"\n\nThe police officer had clearly investigated the circumstances of these individuals.\n\nAt this moment,\n\nAfter listening to Zhou Ze's words, he also nodded, indicating that what was said indeed made sense.\n\n\"See, right? We all have money, we don't lack money. How could we be so bored as to do illegal and disorderly things, just because we're tired of living comfortably?\n\nThe logic doesn't add up.\"\n\nThe police officer showed a rather playful expression and said:\n\n\"This isn't the strictest logic, especially when it comes to you.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"For example... that bookstore you opened near Nan Da University, it's been losing money, hasn't it?\n\nSo, we can entirely re-establish your motive based on that.\n\nFor example,\n\nSomeone who would open a bookstore in a prime commercial center that is sure to lose money,\n\nIt seems plausible that he would engage in drug manufacturing and trafficking,\n\nBecause perhaps your starting point and original purpose were not to make money at all,\n\nPerhaps it was just for the thrill, for fun...\n\nDon't you agree?\"\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze.",

    "content": "周澤忽然覺得這位警察叔叔說得好有道理，\n\n\n\n  邏輯通順，\n\n\n\n  條理清晰，\n\n\n\n  舉例恰當，\n\n\n\n  難以反駁；\n\n\n\n  媽的，\n\n\n\n  弄得周老闆自己都開始懷疑自己是不是真的販毒了？\n\n\n\n  要不然自己開這一家書店幹啥？\n\n\n\n  當初租了許家在南大街的鋪子之後，\n\n\n\n  幹嘛還要開書店呢？\n\n\n\n  難道就因為徐樂那個傻子開了書店我也要開書店？\n\n\n\n  我可以開「魔指天堂」，可以開碧水藍天，可以開天上人間啊。\n\n\n\n  「你看，我說得很對吧。」\n\n\n\n  警察叔叔見周澤這個神情，以為是被自己觸動到了，所以繼續趁熱打鐵道：\n\n\n\n  「其實，我也能理解你們這些年輕人的思維，畢竟和我們那個時候不一樣了。\n\n\n\n  我小時候條件還是很艱苦的，吃飯倒是能吃得起，但想頓頓吃肉，難，所以我那時候就想著能頓頓吃肉就好了。\n\n\n\n  不像是你們，這一代起來時，生活條件好了太多，所以就想著搞點事情做做。\n\n\n\n  但………………」 \n\n\n\n  這位警察還在做著思想工作，\n\n\n\n  周澤卻忽然聽到了一聲近在咫尺的「嘩啦啦」聲音。\n\n\n\n  猛地站起身，周澤目光環視四周，但只聽得到聲音，卻根本「看」不見什麼。\n\n\n\n  這不可能，\n\n\n\n  這根本就不可能！\n\n\n\n  還有自己「見」不到的鬼？\n\n\n\n  一個鬼差見不到鬼，就像是理髮師只給光頭理髮一樣，這不是胡扯麼？\n\n\n\n  這位苦口婆心的警察叔叔一看周澤忽然站起來，以為是被自己說動了終於下定了決心打算坦白了，當下也是一陣激動，馬上跟著一起站起來，正準備繼續說些什麼時，卻看見周澤在欄杆里開始不停地來回走。\n\n\n\n  「嘩啦啦…………嘩啦啦…………」\n\n\n\n  「喂，你沒問題吧？」警察叔叔愣了一下，他開始懷疑周澤是不是毒癮犯了，之前尿檢不是沒問題麼？\n\n\n\n  但實際上，周澤是順著鎖鏈的聲音不停地換著自己的位置。\n\n\n\n  那個鎖鏈拖地的聲音，就在自己身邊，就在自己的欄杆外，他就在這裡行走著！\n\n\n\n  最後，鎖鏈的聲音「走」向了出口位置。\n\n\n\n  周澤馬上走到鎖扣的位置，雙手下意識地抓住了那裡。 \n\n\n\n  但周澤還是克制住了，沒有選擇以自己的力量強行開鎖出去，但這種感覺，真的很不爽。\n\n\n\n  業績啊，\n\n\n\n  就在自己面前逛了一圈，\n\n\n\n  又走了！\n\n\n\n  就像是一個美女脫光了衣服在你面前秀了一個小時的舞蹈，然後說一句「不好意思來親戚了」然後就離開了，留下你一個人在風中凌亂。\n\n\n\n  「喂，你沒問題吧？你不用裝瘋賣傻的，我沒從你的資料里看見有什麼精神病史！」警察叔叔以為周澤要耍什麼花招。\n\n\n\n  「你媽…………」\n\n\n\n  周澤差點脫口而出，\n\n\n\n  但還是深吸一口氣，\n\n\n\n  「你媽媽身體還好吧？」\n\n\n\n  「…………」警察叔叔。\n\n\n\n  「你再好好想想，現在坦白，算你自首，真的，還能酌情立功。」警察叔叔拿出自己的證件，道：「我叫張燕豐，想通了馬上告訴我。」\n\n\n\n  中年警察嘆了口氣，先去那邊拿起水杯喝了一口，然後有些無奈地轉身離開了看守所。\n\n\n\n  周澤站在原地，沒有人注意到，在鐵欄杆內側，已經被周澤用指甲劃出了一道道的「溝壑」。\n\n\n\n  隨即，\n\n \n\n  周澤乾脆坐了回去。\n\n\n\n  「老闆，你受委屈啦。」\n\n\n\n  對面的老道在那位警察叔叔開始政治教育時就醒了，這時候看周澤的反應，以為自家老闆是想出去了。\n\n\n\n  周澤沒好氣地瞪了一眼老道，\n\n\n\n  這堆破事兒歸根究底還是老道引起的，自己平時做事手腳都很乾淨，再小的事兒只要可能會遇到麻煩都會去燒一下冥鈔。\n\n\n\n  這次倒好，\n\n\n\n  老道給自己整了一個大的。\n\n\n\n  「老闆，明天我們就出去了，我們啥也沒幹，警方也調查不出什麼，你要控雞住你嘰嘰啊。」\n\n\n\n  老道還真擔心老闆直接開鎖衝出警局，\n\n\n\n  這也就意味著書店和大家的人生都一起毀了。\n\n\n\n  「睡你的覺。」\n\n\n\n  周澤懶得再說什麼，背靠著欄杆，然後又問道：\n\n\n\n  「對了，老道，你在警局有認識的人麼？」\n\n\n\n  「啥？」老道懵了一下，「老闆，你也喜歡上這裡了？貧道跟你講啊，這通城看守所的伙食其實算好的，蓉城的也不錯，畢竟也是大城市，最蛋疼的就是一些小地方警局的看守所，那伙食就沒這裡合口味了…………」\n\n\n\n  「你還是閉嘴吧。」 \n\n\n\n  周澤本想等這次事情結束自己出去後再找個機會回來看看，看看能不能找到那鎖鏈聲音的主人，但老道明顯想岔了。\n\n\n\n  「廣州的看守所最不好受，你也知道的，廣州天氣潮，嘖嘖，那個地方的看守所待著真難受…………」\n\n\n\n  「你再不閉嘴，我就開鎖出來把你先掐死。」\n\n\n\n  「…………」老道。\n\n\n\n  老道馬上閉嘴開始從心了。\n\n\n\n  周澤注意聽著，反正他也睡不了覺，但可惜的是，一直到天亮時，那個鎖鏈的聲音都沒有再出現過。\n\n\n\n  到上午時，幾個警察走過來，開了鎖，示意周澤可以出來了。\n\n\n\n  周澤和老道又被帶入到了審訊室，不過這一次倒是沒問什麼，簽個字，做個說明，然後就示意周澤可以走了。\n\n\n\n  看守所一夜遊結束，\n\n\n\n  周澤走出來時，許清朗和老道早就在外面等著了，他們的速度比周澤快一些。\n\n\n\n  許清朗給周澤遞了一根煙，剛出去買的，新開封的。\n\n\n\n  周澤接過煙，沒急著走，而是在警局門口的花圃邊坐了下來。\n\n\n\n  「應該是沒找到什麼證據，所以只能把我們先放出來了。」許清朗笑著說道。\n\n\n\n  「你這話說得像是我們真的做了什麼見不得人的事兒一樣。」周澤吐出一口煙圈說道。 \n\n\n\n  「呵呵，咱書店見不得人的事兒還少麼？」許清朗反問道。\n\n\n\n  「我打車？」老道拿出了手機準備打車。\n\n\n\n  既然從裡面出來了，自然是早點回書店，老道沒有擔心書店的生意，反正書店的生意一直是那個鳥樣，他擔心的是自己的那隻猴砸。\n\n\n\n  猴子很聰明，只要有客人在店裡它就絕對不會露頭。\n\n\n\n  昨天警察便衣進來時，自然也就沒有發現猴子，如果被發現了，哪怕周老闆沒製毒，也得出問題，畢竟那隻猴子品種還挺高級，屬於國家保護動物。\n\n\n\n  「等等。」\n\n\n\n  周澤抖了抖菸灰，回頭又看了一眼警局。\n\n\n\n  昨天鎖鏈聲音的事兒，周澤還沒弄明白，這件事兒讓他心裡有點痒痒的。\n\n\n\n  警局，可是連周澤這個鬼差都不是很願意進去的地方啊，也因此，周澤有種預感，昨天自己所遇到的，可能是一條大魚。\n\n\n\n  「怎的，老周，有點留戀捨不得走了？」許清朗調侃道。\n\n\n\n  「先回去吧。」周澤說道。\n\n\n\n  老道打了車，很快一輛快車就停了下來，三人一起上了車。\n\n\n\n  周澤和許清朗坐在後面，老道坐在副駕駛位置。\n\n\n\n  「你們是警察麼？」司機一邊開車一邊問道。 \n\n\n\n  「嫌疑犯。」\n\n\n\n  老道直言不諱。\n\n\n\n  「…………」司機。\n\n\n\n  「喂，你手別抖啊，嫌疑犯只是有嫌疑知道不？\n\n\n\n  雖然貧道看法制節目時看那些罪犯都被叫犯罪嫌疑人嫌疑犯的也覺得挺繞口的，直接叫罪犯多好啊，現在想想還挺合適，我們仨就是那種警察想抓但證據不足沒抓的成的，懂不？」\n\n\n\n  老道解釋著。\n\n\n\n  但司機的手卻更抖了。\n\n\n\n  「哪怕是行兇過程中被當場抓獲，只要尚未經過人民法院判決定罪，仍然成為犯罪嫌疑，懂麼？」許清朗給老道科普著。\n\n\n\n  「喲，懂了，你是專家。」老道呵呵道。\n\n\n\n  司機的臉皮開始抽搐了。\n\n\n\n  實在不是司機膽小，但他娘的這兩個一唱一和，實在是太給人心理壓力了。\n\n\n\n  「對了，老闆，那設備我下午去給你弄去？警方那邊可還是在盯著呢，萬一他們又以製毒的名義把我們又抓回去問話，忒麻煩了。」\n\n\n\n  「我自己想辦法出去弄。」周澤也是怕這個麻煩了，所以打算帶著酒罈出去找個實驗室製取一下。\n\n\n\n  「行，是該轉移地方了，估計咱店門口這陣子還得有便衣盯著。」許清朗說道。 \n\n\n\n  司機咽了口唾沫，他真的很想中途停車把這三個人給放下去，但他還有點不敢。\n\n\n\n  恍惚之中，前面的那輛奧迪車忽然急剎車，司機一個疏忽，沒來得及踩剎車，直接懟了上去。\n\n\n\n  「砰！」\n\n\n\n  兩輛車追尾了。\n\n\n\n  其實，碰到那種路上喜歡沒事做玩兒急停的車主真的很蛋疼，但一般來說，追尾的話大部分都是後車的責任，因為科目一里就說過，要保持安全車距，但話又說回來，以中國現在大部分的城市道路擁堵情況，保持嚴格意義上的安全車距很多時候也不怎麼現實。\n\n\n\n  「你這怎麼開車的啊！」老道怒了，剛從看守所出來就碰到車禍，這晦氣啊。\n\n\n\n  這時候，\n\n\n\n  前面那輛奧迪車車門打開了。\n\n\n\n  老道有些幸災樂禍道，「得嘞，車主要來找你麻煩了。」\n\n\n\n  但讓人大跌眼鏡的是，男性車主下車後不是跑到這裡來找麻煩，而是直接朝著前面狂奔而走，簡直跑得比兔子還快。\n\n\n\n  這讓車裡的四個人都有些詫異，司機坐在車裡打了交警電話，不管怎麼樣，先讓交警來處理一下。\n\n\n\n  老道則是先打開的車門下了車，走到前面看了看。\n\n\n\n  這時候，前面那輛被追尾的車後車門忽然被推開， \n\n\n\n  一個身上綁著繩子的女人從車裡摔了出來。\n\n\n\n  「喲，老妹兒，玩cosplay呢？」\n\n\n\n  老道在旁邊看著說道。\n\n\n\n  女孩很是冷靜地坐在地上，開始自己掙脫繩子，等到把繩子掙脫開後，她又伸手把自己嘴裡塞著的布條給取了下來。\n\n\n\n  「我在停車場被人偷了車，還被綁架了，剛剛因為車子追尾了，他跑了。」女孩對著老道說道。\n\n\n\n  「哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈………………」\n\n\n\n  老道捧著肚子大笑起來，\n\n\n\n  「老妹兒，你可真逗，你這玩笑開得一點都不好笑，放心，雖然你們瞎幾把急剎車，但追尾了是後撤的責任，我們只是乘客不是車主，沒事的。\n\n\n\n  你這個故事編得電影裡也不敢這麼拍啊，偷你的車順帶還綁架你的人？\n\n\n\n  還是因為我們追尾了你的車你才獲救的？\n\n\n\n  哎喲，老妹兒，\n\n\n\n  你是想笑死貧道好繼承貧道的花唄麼？」\n\n\n\n  女孩兒側著臉，平靜地看著老道。\n\n\n\n  老道笑著笑著，慢慢地笑不起來了，\n\n\n\n  然後帶著些許疑惑之色試探性地問道：\n\n\n\n  「娘的，是真的？」",

    "content": "交警來了，警察也來了，畢竟發生了綁架案，雖然劇情很扯，也很無厘頭，估計連周星馳的電影也不敢用這種情節怕被觀眾噴侮辱智商毫無邏輯，但是它貨真價實地發生了。\n\n\n\n  可能一開始這個消息在微博和貼吧傳播時，會被很多人噴之以「開局一張圖，其他全靠編」，\n\n\n\n  但當事實真的顯現出來時，足以讓一大群跌落眼鏡。\n\n\n\n  有些巧合的是，那位昨晚才跟周澤做政治教育工作的「看守」，也出現在了這裡，儼然一副警隊老大的樣子分配著工作。\n\n\n\n  他好像叫張燕豐吧，周澤還有點印象。\n\n\n\n  也是，身上帶著浩然正氣的警察，怎麼可能會只是一位小小的看守。\n\n\n\n  他也看見了周澤，然後深深地皺著眉，走了過來。\n\n\n\n  周澤剛剛做完了簡單的筆錄，實際上案情已經很清晰了，警方已經提取到了嫌疑犯的錄像且鎖定了嫌疑人的身份，下面無非是收網捕撈的工作。\n\n\n\n  「又見面了。」張燕豐伸手在周澤肩膀上輕輕拍了拍。\n\n\n\n  周澤微微皺眉，他有潔癖，很排斥不熟悉的人對自己進行身體接觸。\n\n\n\n  所以，等到張警官把手拿開時，周澤還特意伸手拍了拍自己的肩膀位置。\n\n\n\n  「…………」張警官。 \n\n\n\n  「我再說一遍，我沒製毒。」周澤有些無奈地重複道。\n\n\n\n  自家書店裡，真的沒做任何違法亂紀的事兒，周澤又是個懶散的人，能報警解決的事兒他絕對不會親自出手，他可沒興趣當什麼旁觀玩什麼法律外的審判之類的。\n\n\n\n  他相信人民警察是絕對公正且為人民服務的，且隨著十九大的召開，警務人員的風氣和規章制度正在不斷地完善和進步，已經成為保護中國特色社會主義建設的堅固力量和強硬保障！\n\n\n\n  「做沒做，我們會繼續調查的。」張警官說道。\n\n\n\n  「但我挺喜歡看守所的環境的。」周澤說道。\n\n\n\n  張警官愣了一下，隨即道：「我可以理解成這是一種挑釁麼？」\n\n\n\n  「不是，就像是很多文青說去一趟西藏能淨化心靈一樣，我覺得進一次看守所，也能讓自己浮躁的內心平復下來。」\n\n\n\n  「呵呵。」張警官皮笑肉不笑。\n\n\n\n  周澤聳聳肩，沒辦法，總不能說警局看守所好像有隻鬼，我免費給你們抓鬼要不？\n\n\n\n  「我有你的名片，過陣子我聯繫您聊聊，我希望在看守所里聊。」周澤說道。\n\n\n\n  「歡迎之至。」\n\n\n\n  周澤讓老道重新打車，不管怎麼樣，還是先回去再說，他有些疲憊了，想回書店睡覺休息。 \n\n\n\n  只是這邊因為這件事的原因有些堵車，所以三人得先步行一段距離才能打到車。\n\n\n\n  周老闆一邊走一邊打著呵欠，就在這時，一聲「嘩啦啦」的聲響在他耳邊響起。\n\n\n\n  周澤整個人猛地一滯，停住了一切動作，只是專心地聽著。\n\n\n\n  「嘩啦啦…………嘩啦啦…………」\n\n\n\n  是的，\n\n\n\n  是那個腳鏈在地上拖動的聲響，\n\n\n\n  很近，\n\n\n\n  很近，\n\n\n\n  就在自己身邊！\n\n\n\n  他出來了？\n\n\n\n  跟著自己從局子裡出來了？\n\n\n\n  而且還在光天化日之下！\n\n\n\n  這麼不給面子，這麼猖狂的麼？\n\n\n\n  只是，和昨晚一樣，周澤依舊只聽到聲音，卻沒看見任何的實物，這種感覺讓周澤很不舒服，也很不習慣。\n\n\n\n  人類的恐懼來自於未知，這種不可見只能腦補的玩意兒最是折磨人，就像是恐怖電影裡最恐怖的畫面不是鬼蹦出來和你打的時候，而是鬼沒出來前主配角在一個陰森的環境下行走順帶著壓抑的音樂配合時的階段。\n\n\n\n  「停下。」\n\n\n\n  周澤伸手，示意老道和許清朗停下來。 \n\n\n\n  老道有些莫名其妙地看著周澤，許清朗也是一樣。\n\n\n\n  連周澤都沒辦法看見那個東西，就更別提他們倆了。\n\n\n\n  當周澤停下時，\n\n\n\n  那鎖鏈的聲音忽然也消失了，仿佛已經走遠。\n\n\n\n  但冥冥之中，周澤卻能夠想像出剛剛有一個腳上戴著腳鏈的傢伙在自己身邊剛剛經過。\n\n\n\n  他要去哪裡？\n\n\n\n  他要去做什麼？\n\n\n\n  一個能夠在警局那種地方依舊可以活動的亡魂，這到底是一種怎樣的存在？\n\n\n\n  現在的周澤已經沒了抓大魚的心態，而是開始擔心這個東西會不會對社會造成什麼破壞，會不會傷及無辜。\n\n\n\n  正如當初小蘿莉在溫泉山莊面對鬼武士時無法後退一個道理，這是職責所在，陰司可以不在意你們這幫底層鬼差的殺戮和賺外快，但一旦你的本職工作沒有做好，陰司那邊可是有專門的懲罰手段。\n\n\n\n  環顧四周，周澤發現在斜對面有一家肛腸醫院。\n\n\n\n  好吧，出於一種本能地感覺，醫院學校這類的地方似乎總是容易見鬼，周澤下意識地向醫院門口走去。\n\n\n\n  這家醫院並不大，也就一棟大樓而已，算是小型的專科醫院。\n\n\n\n  走到醫院的門口，周澤在台階上坐了下來。 \n\n\n\n  「幫我擋一下。」周澤對身邊的老道和許清朗說道。\n\n\n\n  二人點點頭，雖然不知道周澤打算做什麼，但他們依舊選擇了配合。\n\n\n\n  周澤右手指甲長了出來，同時有一縷縷的黑氣開始環繞，而後，周澤將指甲觸及到了地上的瓷磚上，黑氣也融入了地下。\n\n\n\n  但這一次，地上並沒有黑色的腳印顯現而出，以前這招周澤可是屢試不爽，他沒辦法跟小蘿莉一樣玩兒什么元神出竅之類的把戲，\n\n\n\n  BIU一下，\n\n\n\n  就消失了，\n\n\n\n  BIU一下，\n\n\n\n  就又回來了。\n\n\n\n  但他也有自己的抓鬼方法，但很讓人意外的是，這個鬼不光是自己看不見，連腳印也不會顯現而出。\n\n\n\n  這到底……是什麼東西？\n\n\n\n  周澤站起身，他走下了台階，現在問題陷入了一個結症，根本就找不到那個東西，又談何去解決？\n\n\n\n  然而，就在此時，「嘩啦啦」的聲音再度響起。\n\n\n\n  周澤深吸一口氣，拳頭緊握，他氣了，真的氣了，對方這是在挑釁和撩撥自己，這是渾然不把自己這個鬼差放在眼裡啊！\n\n\n\n  村官再小，它好歹也是個幹部不是？\n\n\n\n  周老闆心裡甚至產生出了大不了再癱瘓半個月開個無雙把這個裝逼犯給抓出來的衝動。 \n\n\n\n  但周澤又擔心自己變成殭屍後依舊對那東西毫無所獲，那就意味著自己在接下來的半個月裡，將無法再做任何的事情。\n\n\n\n  「嘩啦啦…………嘩啦啦…………」\n\n\n\n  聲音還在響。\n\n\n\n  周澤閉上眼，開始用耳朵靜靜地去聽。\n\n\n\n  在左邊，左邊的聲音比較清晰！\n\n\n\n  睜開眼，左邊是醫院大樓入口的位置，周澤直接推開了面前的老道和許清朗向裡面衝去。\n\n\n\n  「嘩啦啦…………嘩啦啦…………嘩啦啦………………！！！！！！！！」\n\n\n\n  似乎是故意逗弄周澤一樣，當周澤開始向那個方向奔跑時，鎖鏈的聲音再度變得急促起來，頻率也越來越快，像是那個傢伙就在自己前面也在奔跑著一樣。\n\n\n\n  老道和許清朗只能跟在周澤身後一起跑，雖然他們不知道周澤到底在追什麼，但跟著跑就是了。\n\n\n\n  其實，周澤也不懂自己在追什麼。\n\n\n\n  他甚至開始懷疑，自己在追的，到底是不是一個鬼？\n\n\n\n  鬼的話，自己怎麼可能看不見？\n\n\n\n  會不會是什麼山精野怪？\n\n\n\n  用了特殊的障眼法，所以讓自己看不見？\n\n\n\n  但它的身上帶著鐐銬鎖鏈？ \n\n\n\n  有了以前面對那隻擼管猴子的經驗，周澤對精怪一類的存在一直秉持著一種極為慎重的姿態，不管怎樣，周老闆不會再像上次那樣傻乎乎地直接上去拼命了。\n\n\n\n  聲音還在繼續地急促，\n\n\n\n  不停地在周澤耳邊迴響，\n\n\n\n  周澤……周澤……\n\n\n\n  周澤快跑不動了。\n\n\n\n  該死的徐樂的身體，身體素質這麼差勁！\n\n\n\n  殊不知，到底是誰吃飯吃得少就算了，還整天躺沙發上看報紙喝咖啡，沒事的時候甚至連書店都懶得走出一步。\n\n\n\n  跑著跑著，前面進入了一個死胡同，那是一堵牆比，而在牆壁左側，則有著一個廁所。\n\n\n\n  周澤慢慢地放慢了腳步，\n\n\n\n  同樣的，\n\n\n\n  那鎖鏈摩擦的聲音也減慢了，對方應該也是跑到了死胡同，放慢了腳步正在思考該去哪裡吧。\n\n\n\n  周澤張開雙臂，撲了上去，這動作，看起來像是一個大傻子在假裝有妹子和自己擁抱一樣，但這是周澤現在所能選擇的最好方法。\n\n\n\n  沒有絲毫觸感，什麼都沒有，周澤拐入了廁所內。\n\n\n\n  醫院的廁所環境還是不錯的，有專門的人負責清理，地上的瓷磚也是剛拖的。 \n\n\n\n  這個小廁所里有三個蹲坑隔間，周澤一個一個地過去把門打開，還伸手在裡面揮舞了一下，還是什麼都沒有。\n\n\n\n  該死，\n\n\n\n  那東西到底跑哪裡去了！\n\n\n\n  周澤走到了洗臉池前，打開水龍頭沖了一把臉，開始大口地喘息。\n\n\n\n  「臥槽，老闆…………你這麼急著跑，就是為了上廁所麼？」\n\n\n\n  老道此時也跑到了衛生間門口，雙手叉著腰大口地喘息著。\n\n\n\n  緊接著，老道還拿出了半包面紙，遞給周澤：「要用麼？」\n\n\n\n  周澤沒有回答，繼續衝著臉。\n\n\n\n  「那貧道我先方便一下。」\n\n\n\n  老道先摸了摸褲襠，掏出一張符紙先貼在了洗臉池的鏡子上，然後走到小便池那裡，解開了褲腰帶開始放水。\n\n\n\n  也不知道他褲襠里藏符紙的習慣是怎麼來的，按照許清朗調侃的說法就是老道以前大保健時碰到差點被女鬼吸了陽氣，這褲襠藏符紙是最後一道防線，以防萬一的。\n\n\n\n  周澤用衣服擦了擦臉上的水珠，走到了衛生間門口，等老道方便好出來。\n\n\n\n  「到底怎麼了？」許清朗站在門口問道。\n\n\n\n  「我不知…………」\n\n\n\n  周澤一邊回答一邊再次看向了衛生間， \n\n\n\n  因為和洗臉池的鏡子拉開了距離，\n\n\n\n  鏡子裡的自己也一下子被放小了但也倒映得更全面了，\n\n\n\n  下一刻，\n\n\n\n  周澤愣住了，\n\n\n\n  在貼著老道符紙的鏡子裡，\n\n\n\n  他清楚地看見，\n\n\n\n  在自己雙腳位置，\n\n\n\n  纏繞著一條已經生鏽的鎖鏈，\n\n\n\n  很長，\n\n\n\n  很粗……",

    "content": "醫院前面的花圃台階上，周澤默默地坐在那裡，目光一直盯著自己的腳面。\n\n\n\n  其實，\n\n\n\n  這個時候你根本什麼都看不到，甚至連觸摸都沒辦法觸摸到，但是之前鏡子裡的畫面，早已說明了一切。\n\n\n\n  這條鎖鏈，就套在自己腳踝上，而自己之前所間接性聽到的聲音，其實就是自己的走動所牽引出來的聲響。\n\n\n\n  但也有一點讓周澤很不明白，那就是昨晚在看守所里時，自己明明是先聽到外面過道有聲音的，這至少證明當時這條鎖鏈，並不是在自己腳上。\n\n\n\n  那麼，這也就意味著，就是鎖鏈聲音忽然出現在自己四周時的那短短片刻，有人，或者叫有一個東西，把這鎖鏈給捆綁到自己腳上去了。\n\n\n\n  而自己，則是毫無察覺，甚至如果不是老道噓噓時順手把褲襠里的符紙先貼放在了鏡子上，自己很可能就壓根意識不到自己之前還在拼命奔跑查找的鎖鏈，\n\n\n\n  就在自個兒的身上！\n\n\n\n  重新打車，回到了書店，周澤在吧檯後坐了下來。\n\n\n\n  他現在沒有心思洗個澡然後喊白鶯鶯上樓回房間陪自己睡覺，\n\n\n\n  也沒心思去鼓搗什麼彼岸花汁水，\n\n\n\n  更沒心思看報紙喝咖啡曬太陽，\n\n\n\n  他時不時地低下頭，看看自己的腳面， \n\n\n\n  然後再時不時地抬起頭，\n\n\n\n  望天。\n\n\n\n  總之，很是惆悵。\n\n\n\n  老道給白鶯鶯講述了關於那條鎖鏈的事兒，白鶯鶯聽了之後，也是驚訝莫名。\n\n\n\n  而且，因為老闆的沉默，也導致書店裡大家都很沉默。\n\n\n\n  書店的門被老道先鎖上了，這個時候再有什麼客人進來也不方便，至於鬼魂的話，反正門開著和關著對想進來的鬼魂也沒啥區別。\n\n\n\n  自己給自己倒了一杯水，又給猴子拿了一把花生米，老道看著那邊還在低著頭的老闆，他忽然有點想笑。\n\n\n\n  這一幕，\n\n\n\n  有點像是皇帝的新衣一樣。\n\n\n\n  老闆說他腳上有一條鎖鏈，\n\n\n\n  看不見，\n\n\n\n  摸不著，\n\n\n\n  豈不是皇帝的新衣翻版麼？\n\n\n\n  回到書店後，周澤把符紙從老道那裡要了過來，找了面鏡子，就放在自己的前面地上，鏡子裡這正好倒映出周澤的這雙腳。\n\n\n\n  同時也顯露出了一條生鏽的鎖鏈，\n\n\n\n  他存在，\n\n\n\n  真真切切的存在，\n\n\n\n  無可置疑的存在。 \n\n\n\n  老道一開始也湊過來看了看，許清朗、白鶯鶯他們也湊過來觀摩了一下，像是在打量一件新奇的玩意兒。\n\n\n\n  至少目前來看，這條鎖鏈似乎也沒其他的危害，除了讓你不爽。\n\n\n\n  但作為當事人的周老闆，卻不會這麼想，他不希望自己的這雙腳要戴著鐐銬，哪怕接觸不到平時也看不見，但在心裡是有一個疙瘩的。\n\n\n\n  而且看看貼著符紙的鏡子裡所倒映出來的畫面，那骯髒的鐵鏽，令人頭皮發麻的坑窪，對於有潔癖的周老闆來說，更為難以接受。\n\n\n\n  講真，\n\n\n\n  如果這鎖鏈是用純金或者純銀再或者用一種新潮一點的反設計風格，可能周老闆心裡還能舒服一些，至少沒現如芒刺在背。\n\n\n\n  「老闆，會不會是因為你被認定是犯罪分子，所以你的腳上就出現了鐐銬？\n\n\n\n  還記得當初的那位戴著『人面獸心』高帽子的自殺老師麼？\n\n\n\n  他的帽子你也弄不下來。」\n\n\n\n  白鶯鶯猜測道。\n\n\n\n  許清朗在旁邊點點頭，似乎也的確是有這個啊。\n\n\n\n  眾口鑠金，人言可畏。\n\n\n\n  「不可能的，不是的。」\n\n\n\n  周澤搖搖頭，否定了這個猜測， \n\n\n\n  「那位老師的事情是當時在網上發酵得很厲害，群情洶湧，我這次只是一些警察懷疑我而已，體量上根本沒辦法對比，不應該會出現這種情況。」\n\n\n\n  是的，因為周澤還可以確認，這個鎖鏈一開始並不是在自己的身上，它曾經由遠及近。\n\n\n\n  老道湊過來指了指周澤面前的小鏡子，道：「老闆，說心裡話，我覺得你這個鐵鏈挺帥的，想想啊，你開無雙時，那個樣子…………」\n\n\n\n  說著，老道還雙臂下垂，表情呆滯，像是一頭喪屍一樣搖搖晃晃了幾下，而後再伸手指了指自己的腳面，道：\n\n\n\n  「如果這個時候腳下再多一條鐵鏈，這真是像極了以前遊戲機房裡的拳皇格鬥的瘋八神。」\n\n\n\n  說著老道和雙臂撐起來，\n\n\n\n  做出了一個爆能量的動作，\n\n\n\n  隨即像是童心未泯又像是真的沉浸到以前在遊戲機房打街機的氛圍，手臂來回地揮舞，嘴裡念叨著：\n\n\n\n  「晦澀…………晦澀…………晦澀…………」\n\n\n\n  周澤側過臉，看著旁邊沉浸在自己世界裡的老道，同時開口道：\n\n\n\n  「老道，書店地板…………」\n\n\n\n  「啊，死侍剛剛打掃過了。」老道馬上接話道，自從有了死侍之後，老道的工作就輕鬆多了。 \n\n\n\n  「哦。」\n\n\n\n  周澤點點頭，繼續道：\n\n\n\n  「通城不是在申創衛生城市麼，你去把我們書店門口的街道給清理一下吧，這也是我們市民應該做的。」\n\n\n\n  「…………」老道。\n\n\n\n  見周澤一直在盯著自己，不像是在開玩笑，老道只能一臉苦澀地拿起掃帚和拖把走出了書店打掃衛生去了。\n\n\n\n  白鶯鶯蹲在周澤旁邊，一雙手在周澤小腿上來回按摩著，嘟了嘟嘴，問道：「老闆，你覺得會是什麼原因，是有人栽贓陷害？」\n\n\n\n  「我不清楚，我現在自己也是有些一頭霧水，所以我決定先回看守所再看看。」\n\n\n\n  說著，周澤拿出了昨晚張燕豐給自己的名片，按照上面的電話撥打了過去。\n\n\n\n  電話很快就被接通，\n\n\n\n  對面傳來了一道很低沉的聲音：\n\n\n\n  「喂，哪位？」\n\n\n\n  「昨天進看守所的那個。」周澤回答道。\n\n\n\n  「想聊什麼？」\n\n\n\n  「我今天還想進去，可以麼？」\n\n\n\n  「你願意坦白你的罪行？」\n\n\n\n  「我沒有罪行。」周澤重複道。\n\n\n\n  「呵。」 \n\n\n\n  周澤耐著性子，道：「實話說吧，我是一個作家，昨晚在看守所待著讓我覺得自己很有靈感，我希望…………」\n\n\n\n  「嘟嘟嘟………………」\n\n\n\n  對面掛斷了電話。\n\n\n\n  周老闆對著手機看了看，忽然感到一種茫然。\n\n\n\n  再看看外面在「哼哧哼哧」打掃街道的老道，竟然有一種報應來得這麼快的感覺。\n\n\n\n  周澤只能再撥打電話回去，對方又接了電話，只不過這次電話那頭沒有先說話。\n\n\n\n  「我想回看守所，我有我的理由，雖然我知道這個要求有點不…………」\n\n\n\n  「嘩啦啦…………嘩啦啦………………嘩啦啦………………」\n\n\n\n  電話那頭傳來了一陣聲響，\n\n\n\n  熟悉的聲響，\n\n\n\n  但因為隔著電話傳來的，所以那聲音有一點點的失真，但周澤可以確定的是，聲音是從那邊傳來的。\n\n\n\n  「你繼續說啊。」張燕豐像是點了一根煙，見周澤不說話了，催促了一聲。\n\n\n\n  「你最近有沒有失眠多夢，體虛發汗，腰腿疼痛這類的？」\n\n\n\n  「呵。」\n\n\n\n  對面似乎又準備掛電話了。\n\n\n\n  「你有沒有夢見自己腳上有鐐銬。」周澤問道。 \n\n\n\n  對方愣住了，\n\n\n\n  沒有掛電話，\n\n\n\n  似乎這句話戳中了對方的某個心結，\n\n\n\n  少頃，\n\n\n\n  電話那頭傳來了回應：\n\n\n\n  「你來局裡找我，我在辦公室。」\n\n\n\n  ………………\n\n\n\n  周澤出現在張燕豐辦公室里時，已經是晚上了，張燕豐正坐在辦公桌後面吃著從食堂打來的飯菜，一邊狼吞虎咽一邊看著面前的卷宗。\n\n\n\n  當周澤進來時，他把飯菜和卷宗先推開到一邊，看著周澤。\n\n\n\n  「我想聽聽關於腳鏈的事情。」\n\n\n\n  「我覺得在這個環境下，在這個地方，而你又穿著警服的時候，和你說這種封建迷信的事情有點不合適。」\n\n\n\n  「可以，我下班了。」\n\n\n\n  一刻鐘後，換了便服的張燕豐和周澤一起走出了警局，兩個人走到了警局斜對面的一個小公園裡，找了條長椅，坐了下來。\n\n\n\n  「你現在可以不把我當作一個警察，就當作一個普通人，我們來聊聊天。」張燕豐還主動遞給了周澤一根煙。\n\n\n\n  二人的關係轉變得很快，\n\n\n\n  在之前，\n\n\n\n  周澤在鐵欄杆裡頭，他在外頭， \n\n\n\n  而現在，\n\n\n\n  大家似乎都變成了朋友，\n\n\n\n  「獄友」嘛。\n\n\n\n  周澤手裡拿著一面小鏡子，上面還貼著老道的符紙，然後把鏡子放在了張燕豐的腳面上。\n\n\n\n  公園裡的路燈光線不是很好，有點昏暗，\n\n\n\n  但依舊能夠勉強看見鏡子裡的畫面，\n\n\n\n  在張燕豐的腳上，\n\n\n\n  也套著一條鐐銬，只不過這條鐐銬沒自己的粗，也沒自己的長。\n\n\n\n  還是自己的更粗更長啊。\n\n\n\n  這情感傾向怎麼怪怪的？\n\n\n\n  「看見了？」周澤看向張燕豐。\n\n\n\n  張燕豐拿煙的手，微微顫抖。\n\n\n\n  「這是我第一次，正兒八經地見到它，以前，只是經常在夢裡夢見自己腳上有一條腳鏈，二十多年了。」\n\n\n\n  「所以，你以前做過什麼虧心事？」周澤問道。\n\n\n\n  「問心無愧，我對得起我每天穿的警服，無愧我警帽上的國徽。」張燕豐擲地有聲道，「我甚至已經慢慢習慣了這種隔三差五的夢，在夢裡，我戴著鐐銬在警局裡走著，我覺得這對於我來說更像是一種警醒。\n\n\n\n  它時刻提醒著我，我的權力來自於人民，來自於國家，所以我絕對不能越雷池一步，我只要走錯一步，以後這鐐銬就會真的出現在我的身上。」 \n\n\n\n  「啪啪啪…………」\n\n\n\n  周澤在旁邊輕輕鼓掌，\n\n\n\n  「所以，這應該是一種變相地肯定，就像是勇者的勳章一樣，只有好人，才會有這條鎖鏈？」\n\n\n\n  「你這是什麼意思？」張燕豐問道。\n\n\n\n  「我們先解決一個歷史遺留問題。」\n\n\n\n  說著，\n\n\n\n  周澤把鏡子對準自己的腳面，\n\n\n\n  一條又粗又長的鐵鏈出現在了鏡子裡，\n\n\n\n  「你現在可以相信我沒製毒做違法亂紀的事兒了吧？」\n\n\n\n  我們，\n\n\n\n  都一樣。",

    "content": "當你覺得你是獨一無二的受害者時，你會很方。\n\n\n\n  會認為老天爺在針對自己，自己被整個世界和整個社會給拋棄隔離了。\n\n\n\n  但當你發現，你旁邊還有一個一模一樣的倒霉人時，你心裡會覺得舒服多了，覺得老天爺還不錯，至少給自己留了一個伴兒。\n\n\n\n  這就是人性，大部分農村長大的人小時候應該都聽外婆或者奶奶說過不要靠近池塘或者河邊玩耍，她們說警告你以前這裡有孩子落水了變成了鬼，就想著拉你下去當替死鬼。\n\n\n\n  這只是恐嚇孩子遠離危險區域玩耍的話語，但正是這種最土灶的言語，往往能反映出很多質樸深層次的東西。\n\n\n\n  周澤點了煙，\n\n\n\n  不慌了，\n\n\n\n  不慌了，\n\n\n\n  之前自己還擔心這鎖鏈會不會有什麼後續危害，\n\n\n\n  但一看身邊這位身上有著浩然正氣的警官也有，那就真的一點都不怕了，也不擔心了。\n\n\n\n  「你是做什麼的？」張燕豐吐出一口煙圈問道。\n\n\n\n  「這個不方便和你說，這樣解釋吧，我和你的工作，都是在為社會主義現代化建設而奮鬥，為社會和諧而努力。」\n\n\n\n  張燕豐皺了皺眉。\n\n\n\n  「如果你以後碰見了難以處理的案子，可以來書店找我幫你看看，只能說到這麼多了，一些事情，知道的多了，可能對你來說，也不是什麼好事兒。」 \n\n\n\n  周澤伸手拍了拍張燕豐的肩膀，\n\n\n\n  「繼續做你的好警察，挺好。」\n\n\n\n  等周澤收回手之後，\n\n\n\n  張燕豐也伸手拍了拍自己的肩膀位置。\n\n\n\n  兩人相視一笑。\n\n\n\n  「我是不信這個世界上有鬼神這種東西的，從來都不會信。」\n\n\n\n  「繼續堅持這個信念吧。」周澤長舒一口氣，「你就當我今晚來找你就是一場夢，我們現在可以切入正題了，說說你這條鎖鏈的事情，那個夢，是什麼時候開始做的？\n\n\n\n  對了，你之前好像說，有二十多年了？」\n\n\n\n  張燕豐點點頭，「是的，有二十多年了，我父親也是一個刑警，我們家，算是警察世家吧，我兒子現在也在讀警校。」\n\n\n\n  「了不起。」\n\n\n\n  周澤不認為這是裙帶關係，誰會無聊到裙帶關係把全家喊來一起當警察，還是刑警？\n\n\n\n  「我記得那一年，是我父親犧牲的那一年。」\n\n\n\n  張燕豐說得很平靜。\n\n\n\n  周澤也聽得很平靜。\n\n\n\n  「那時候，我剛參加工作沒兩年，父親的犧牲，對我的打擊很大，老實說，我有點意志消沉，也有點怕。\n\n\n\n  是真的怕，我怕我哪天，自己也會犧牲。」 \n\n\n\n  「警察也是人。」周澤說道。\n\n\n\n  「但不一樣，真的不一樣的，我為我的怕而感到羞恥。」\n\n\n\n  張燕豐抖了抖菸灰，繼續道：\n\n\n\n  「第一次做那個夢，也在那一年，我熬夜處理一件案子的卷宗，然後在辦公室里睡著了，那一晚，我做了一個很長很長的夢，那個夢哪怕到現在，都是如此的清晰，我甚至還能夠記得當時的每一個畫面。\n\n\n\n  我站在一個冰冷的過道里，\n\n\n\n  聽到了鎖鏈在地上拖動的聲音，\n\n\n\n  那個地方，很冷，真的很冷，我這輩子體會到最深刻的寒意，就是那一次，還是在夢裡，呵呵。」\n\n\n\n  周老闆掏了掏耳朵，他每天都抱著白鶯鶯這個女殭屍睏覺，\n\n\n\n  對於「冷」這個字，也早就免疫了。\n\n\n\n  正常人，可受不了白鶯鶯身上所散發出來的陰氣，但周澤卻甘之如飴。\n\n\n\n  「我看見一個穿著白色衣服的人，從遠處走來，他走得很慢，一步一步地走著；\n\n\n\n  在他的腳上，有一副腳銬，鎖著他的腳踝，他每走一步，地上的鎖鏈都會因為被拖動而發出『嘩啦啦』的聲響。\n\n\n\n  那個聲音，在之後的二十多年裡，一直不停地在我夢裡面迴蕩著。 \n\n\n\n  他從遠處走來，\n\n\n\n  經過了我面前，\n\n\n\n  我看不清楚他的臉，\n\n\n\n  他的頭髮亂糟糟的，\n\n\n\n  但當他走到我跟前時，我反而不覺得冷了，甚至還感覺到一種溫暖。\n\n\n\n  然後，他走了，他似乎根本就沒看見我一樣，繼續往前走，一直走到這個過道的盡頭；\n\n\n\n  然後，\n\n\n\n  他消失了。\n\n\n\n  這之後，夢就醒了。\n\n\n\n  沒有波瀾，也沒有轉折，其實，是一個很普通的夢，但正是因為那個夢太真實了，真實到仿佛是真的發生過一樣，所以，我一直記得它，記了二十多年。\n\n\n\n  這之後我再做夢時，夢裡面我無論是在做什麼，無論是哪種夢，我的腳上，都會有這一條腳鏈。\n\n\n\n  那一條，原本應該是那個白衣人腳上的腳鏈，出現在了我的身上。」\n\n\n\n  張燕豐深吸一口氣，又重重地吐了出來，\n\n\n\n  「我曾經因為工作便利的原因，問過一位心理醫生，但他的回答讓我不是很滿意，你知道他說什麼麼？\n\n\n\n  他說，是我心虛，是我害怕，害怕自己什麼時候會敗露，什麼時候會出事兒，哈哈……」\n\n\n\n  說到這裡，張燕豐笑了笑，把菸頭丟在了地上，用力地踩了踩， \n\n\n\n  「老子這輩子，對得起國旗，對得起警徽，你知道麼，我父親出殯的那一天，他是穿著警服的，身上披著的，也是國旗。」\n\n\n\n  「我信的。」\n\n\n\n  周澤看了看張警官，老實說，他讓自己想到了之前曾在自己書店裡買書的那位局長。\n\n\n\n  就像是在微博上，哪個地方的城管欺負人了打老太婆了，這種消息轉發評論的人會非常多，而那些消防員或者警察因公殉職了，轉發的人反而寥寥無幾。\n\n\n\n  實際上，這個世界，還是好人居多，否則這個社會，早就亂了。\n\n\n\n  二人沉默了大概一刻鐘，周澤又主動打破了此時的寧靜。\n\n\n\n  「我需要找個辦法，把這件事給解決了。」\n\n\n\n  周澤指了指自己的腳面，然後站了起來。\n\n\n\n  這個小公園的對面，就是警局，周澤忽然開口問道：\n\n\n\n  「二十多年前你做那個夢時，也是在這個警局裡頭麼？」\n\n\n\n  「是的，不過當時警局沒這麼大，十年前吧，警局翻修重建過的。」\n\n\n\n  「地址沒變對吧？」\n\n\n\n  「沒變。」\n\n\n\n  周澤點點頭，「你會畫畫麼？」\n\n\n\n  「不會。」張警官回答得很直白，「你是想讓我把那個夢裡的畫面給畫出來？」 \n\n\n\n  「對，我希望有一種更直觀的體現。」\n\n\n\n  「局裡倒是有這方面的能手，我可以喊他過來。」\n\n\n\n  「不會影響到人家休息麼？」\n\n\n\n  現在不早了啊。\n\n\n\n  「年輕人，就得多錘鍊錘鍊。」張燕豐這般回答。\n\n\n\n  恍惚間，\n\n\n\n  周澤仿佛看到了自己上輩子往死里操練那些實習狗的模樣。\n\n\n\n  沒有回警局，這是周澤要求的，他總覺得待在警局裡聊這種似是而非的事情感覺怪怪的，而且那個地方，總會有一種若有若無的壓力壓制著他。\n\n\n\n  眾人來到了警局旁邊的一家咖啡館，那位小警察帶著自己的筆記本也來了，一臉的青春痘，看起來很是青澀，他先走到張燕豐面前，打招呼道：\n\n\n\n  「張隊好。」\n\n\n\n  張燕豐點點頭。\n\n\n\n  然後這位小警察又看向了周澤，問道：「這位怎麼稱呼？」\n\n\n\n  「嫌疑犯。」\n\n\n\n  周澤自我介紹。\n\n\n\n  「…………」小警察。\n\n\n\n  張燕豐瞥了一眼周澤，然後伸手示意小警察在他旁邊坐下。\n\n\n\n  接下來，小警察打開了筆記本，開始按照張燕豐的描述開始繪圖。 \n\n\n\n  這也讓周澤有點大開眼界，或者，在很多人眼裡，警察一個個都是刑偵高手，但實際上，警察隊伍里尤其是這些年開始有越來越多的其他專業人才的加入。\n\n\n\n  就像是當年曾名噪一時的金融詐騙犯被抓進牢之後還被FBI吸收進了組織一樣。\n\n\n\n  在小警察忙碌的時候，\n\n\n\n  周澤在旁邊玩著手機。\n\n\n\n  大概過了兩個小時，\n\n\n\n  張燕豐點點頭，示意這個差不多了，然後把筆記本扭轉過來，朝向了周澤，指了指屏幕道：\n\n\n\n  「差不多就是這個畫面了。」\n\n\n\n  周澤盯著屏幕看了一會兒，\n\n\n\n  一個白衣人，戴著腳銬，\n\n\n\n  麻木的往前走，\n\n\n\n  兩邊，是黑黢黢的東西，身後，也是黑黢黢的一片，\n\n\n\n  這是一個極為狹窄的空間。\n\n\n\n  周澤看了看張燕豐，道：「還能再回憶一些細節麼？」\n\n\n\n  「什麼？」張燕豐有些不能理解。\n\n\n\n  「比如這裡和這裡。」\n\n\n\n  周澤伸手指了指畫面的兩側，「這兩邊是牆壁，但之後這片黑的地方又是什麼，如果是牆壁，為什麼不直接延展出去？」 \n\n\n\n  「我不清楚，但我記得當時我夢裡這個地方的牆壁，是斷斷續續的，不是連成一片的。」\n\n\n\n  「所以，根據張隊的敘述，我在這裡著重渲染了光與影的區別。」小警察在旁邊解釋道，「我本來想把這裡都畫成牆壁延展出去的，但張隊說不是這樣。」\n\n\n\n  不知道為什麼，周澤對這兩側牆壁旁邊的黑影，很是在意，而那個穿著白衣服戴著腳銬的人，他反而沒去著重關注。\n\n\n\n  周澤抬起頭，不停地思考著。\n\n\n\n  他想到了在看守所里的畫面，那個鎖鏈的聲音由遠及近，而自己站在欄杆里，不停地來回走動，企圖尋找他的蹤跡……\n\n\n\n  猛地，\n\n\n\n  周澤像是想到了什麼，直接手指著畫面兩側的黑暗區域道：\n\n\n\n  「這裡不是牆壁，會不會是鐵欄杆？」\n\n\n\n  說著，周澤又用手比劃了一下，「老電影看過麼？那些老式的監獄，有印象麼？」\n\n\n\n  小警察馬上把筆記本調轉過來，重新開始了修改，而旁邊的張燕豐則是陷入了沉思。\n\n\n\n  「是這樣麼？」\n\n\n\n  很快，小警察把筆記本推向了周澤和張燕豐這邊。\n\n\n\n  畫面里，\n\n\n\n  原本黑黢黢的模糊區域改成了鐵欄杆，裡面依舊是黑色和模糊，但加上了這幾條欄杆之後，整個畫面一下子就清晰立體了起來，甚至連裡頭所包含著的訊息也一下子顯露了出來。 \n\n\n\n  在一個狹窄的監獄甬道里，\n\n\n\n  一個身穿著白色囚服的犯人，\n\n\n\n  腳上帶著鐐銬，\n\n\n\n  在麻木地前行著，\n\n\n\n  在他身側，是其他的監獄牢房，或許，裡面還有不少眼睛在看著他。\n\n\n\n  張燕豐馬上拿起電話，打給誰，周澤不清楚，但張燕豐的說話聲倒是很清晰，他也沒避諱在場的二人：\n\n\n\n  「老王，是我張燕豐，你現在立刻幫我查一下，我們警局的位置在以前是什麼地方。\n\n\n\n  你以前不是和我說過，老警局是依託一個老建築修繕起來的麼，幫我查查這個，查查到底是什麼地方，以前是用來做什麼的。\n\n\n\n  什麼，你要更具體一點的要求？\n\n\n\n  那好，\n\n\n\n  你就查，\n\n\n\n  它以前，\n\n\n\n  在哪個時期，\n\n\n\n  是不是做過監獄使用？」",

    "content": "「張隊，你們到底在調查什麼事？一起冤案麼？我也可以詳細地幫你們查一查的。」\n\n\n\n  小警察顯得很是積極。\n\n\n\n  「小劉啊，時候不早了，你早點回去休息吧，明天還得上班呢。」張燕豐說道。\n\n\n\n  這件事起源於他的一個夢，他是不可能讓更多的人知道的，而且說實在的，這個影響也不好。\n\n\n\n  「沒事的，張隊，我不累，我可以…………」\n\n\n\n  「你累了。」張燕豐提醒道。\n\n\n\n  「哦，額，好，我累了，那這樣吧，張隊，我先走了。」\n\n\n\n  小警察拿著自己的筆記本離開了。\n\n\n\n  周澤坐在旁邊默默地點了一根煙，真的，從張燕豐身上自己似乎真的看到了上輩子的自己，當年林醫生愛慕自己，但自己卻毫無感覺，對待下屬，他也是這種節奏。\n\n\n\n  鬼使神差的，周澤問了一句話：「張警官還是單身麼？」\n\n\n\n  張燕豐點了點頭。\n\n\n\n  呵，\n\n\n\n  真像。\n\n\n\n  言歸正傳，張燕豐目光嚴肅地伸手在桌面上輕輕敲了敲，道：\n\n\n\n  「其實，根據那個畫面，我本能地覺得它有點眼熟，和一些影視和文藝作品裡有很大的相似之處。」 \n\n\n\n  「我懂你的意思，鎖鏈，囚服，一步一步地在狹窄的通道里往前走著，四周是其他的牢房，大家的眼光或麻木或憤怒地看著這一切。\n\n\n\n  如果這個時候在旁邊拿出手機播一首《鐵窗淚》，就更符合氛圍了。」\n\n\n\n  「你也是這麼認為？」\n\n\n\n  張燕豐的表情依舊嚴肅，其實這種嚴肅之下，隱藏著的是一種尷尬和不適應，做了大半輩子的警察了，和一個之前還在自己眼裡是一個嫌疑犯的人討論這種神神叨叨的事情，他總覺得很是奇怪，而且充滿了一種違和感。\n\n\n\n  其實，張警官的心理素質還是很過硬的，普通人第一次經歷這種事情很可能會被嚇得魂不守舍，但他還能強行鎮定下來。\n\n\n\n  「如果是英魂或者是以前的烈士的話，比如被看押著送到刑場上去準備執行死刑，這個邏輯確實很說得通，我們在影視作品和小說里也經常出現，而且那些烈士也的確很值得敬佩。」\n\n\n\n  周澤緩了緩，吐出一口煙圈，然後伸手指了指腳面，道：\n\n\n\n  「但烈士亡魂閒得蛋疼給你和給我腳上加一條鎖鏈？\n\n\n\n  這是紀念品附贈麼？\n\n\n\n  還是愛的鼓勵？\n\n\n\n  而且我是個好人，你也是個好人，好吧，我這樣描述有點中二，但我們現在只能按照這個邏輯來推論。 \n\n\n\n  在我們都是好人的前提下，烈士英魂給我們套上一個枷鎖？\n\n\n\n  說不通，說不通啊。\n\n\n\n  又不是去景區或者寺廟，當地人強行販賣什麼紀念品，二話不說先給你戴上。」\n\n\n\n  張燕豐點了點頭，讓他一個老刑警去分析鬼的思維，確實一點專業超綱，但其實人和鬼，都是一個思維模式。\n\n\n\n  如果真的是烈士英魂，應該沒那麼無聊吧？\n\n\n\n  給祝福也不應該是給鎖鏈。\n\n\n\n  張燕豐的電話又響了，他接了電話，過一會兒，他對周澤道：\n\n\n\n  「我們這警局以前的遺址是一家醫院，從民國那會兒就是醫院了，解放後廢棄了一段時間，被當作居民安置的筒子樓，後來在這個基礎上改建成了警局，十年前又經歷了一次推倒重修，沒有查到曾被當作監獄使用的情況。」\n\n\n\n  周澤陷入了沉思，一般來說，亡魂和執念肯定是位於它的初始位置，比如一個人冤死在一個地方，如果產生冤魂的話，肯定也是在這個點活動。\n\n\n\n  況且，周澤和張警官都是在這個警局裡被套上鎖鏈的，這也可以從側面證明，事情的原始觸發點，就在這家警局裡頭。\n\n\n\n  「沒有當過監獄？」周澤有些不能理解，張燕豐夢裡的情況已經描述得很清楚了，當時的那裡，也的確應該是一個監獄才對。 \n\n\n\n  「我先回去，再仔細地調查一下，你知道的，這類資料網上是沒有的，都得靠去翻檔案室。」\n\n\n\n  張燕豐拿起自己的手機和桌上的煙就告辭離開了，走出了咖啡館時，他還抬頭長舒一口氣。\n\n\n\n  今天的事情，讓他不敢多想，也不願意多想，甚至包括周澤這個人。\n\n\n\n  但這件事，還是需要處理的，畢竟，這條鎖鏈，在自己夢裡斷斷續續出現了二十多年，他也不可能因為一些精神潔癖，而放棄這次的機會。\n\n\n\n  回過頭，看了一眼還坐在咖啡館裡的周澤，張燕豐搖搖頭，他忽然覺得裡面的這個人很恐怖，是的，很恐怖。\n\n\n\n  這不再是一名警察看一個嫌疑犯的目光，而是門外的人看門裡的人的目光，兩個人的生活和周圍的風景，可能真的是天差地別。\n\n\n\n  張燕豐不清楚一旦自己深入其中之後，還能不能再從門裡出來。\n\n\n\n  搖搖頭，他走向了警局。\n\n\n\n  周澤則是打了一個車，在半個小時後，回到了書店。\n\n\n\n  書店今天關門，白天關著晚上也關著，老闆出了點事兒，員工們擔心老闆，也無心工作。\n\n\n\n  這感覺，\n\n\n\n  就像是中學生說祖國尚未統一，我實在讀不進去書一樣。\n\n\n\n  他們是這樣解釋的， \n\n\n\n  然而：\n\n\n\n  老道在開直播，猴子在給他拿手機，不停地感謝老闆的飛機火箭！\n\n\n\n  許清朗躺在吧檯後面，臉上覆轍面膜，聽著歌曲，哼哼唧唧愜意得不行。\n\n\n\n  白鶯鶯在樓上吃雞，最近她買了一個kakao服的號，據說沒什麼外掛，玩得正嗨。\n\n\n\n  就連一直坐在樓底的死侍，也回到房間裡繼續坐著去了。\n\n\n\n  看著自己的員工，周老闆顯得有些意興闌珊，他兩天沒睡覺了，所以直接上了二樓，回到自己臥室後，就躺在了床上。\n\n\n\n  一想著自己腳上有一根生鏽的鐵鏈纏繞著，他就覺得很不舒服，很不自在，不停地左傾右翻。\n\n\n\n  白鶯鶯很知趣兒地結束了遊戲，也躺倒了床上，讓周澤把頭枕在自己的大腿根部，\n\n\n\n  然後她開始給周澤輕輕地按摩頭。\n\n\n\n  周澤也終於感受到了困意，慢慢地閉上了眼了，入眠。\n\n\n\n  ………………\n\n\n\n  滴答…………\n\n\n\n  滴答…………\n\n\n\n  滴答…………\n\n\n\n  這是水聲，\n\n\n\n  很清脆，\n\n\n\n  也很空幽。 \n\n\n\n  周澤睜開眼，發現自己正躺在水面上，熟悉的水潭，熟悉的遠處的道路，以及道路上，密密麻麻踮著腳走路的亡魂。\n\n\n\n  又回到這裡了？\n\n\n\n  好久沒做夢了吧自己，\n\n\n\n  尤其是在有白鶯鶯陪睡之後，自己的睡眠質量，確實比以前好得太多太多。\n\n\n\n  周澤下意識地往水潭下面看了一眼，故地重遊，總是想要看看那位老冤家到底還在不在。\n\n\n\n  水潭裡的水很清澈，是那種真正意義不帶絲毫誇張的清澈見底，一眼望下去，看不見無面女存在的絲毫痕跡。\n\n\n\n  她看來是真的死在蓉城了。\n\n\n\n  周澤長舒一口氣，\n\n\n\n  卻在此時，他在水潭倒映中看見自己身後的影子，他馬上轉過身，卻發現在自己身後不到一米的位置，站著一個女人，一個頭髮將自己的臉完全覆蓋住的女人。\n\n\n\n  「你沒死？」\n\n\n\n  周澤有些疑惑地問道。\n\n\n\n  女人沒回答，而是繼續站在那裡。\n\n\n\n  「你這是要去哪裡？」周澤問道。\n\n\n\n  女人緩緩地抬起頭，雖然她的眼眸在濃密的頭髮之下，但周澤能夠感覺出來，對方在盯著自己看：\n\n\n\n  「這句話，應該是我要問你…………你這是要…………去哪裡？」 \n\n\n\n  「咕嘟…………咕咚………………」\n\n\n\n  周澤只感覺自己身下原本像是冰面一樣堅固的水潭忽然翻湧了下去，自己整個人也跌落進了水潭之中。\n\n\n\n  一時間，\n\n\n\n  磅礴的窒息感蜂擁而至，像是有無數隻手，正在拼命地捂住他的眼耳口鼻，讓他失去對外界的一切感知。\n\n\n\n  唯一的印象，還是耳朵里殘留的對方最後的問話。\n\n\n\n  「呼…………」\n\n\n\n  周澤下意識地坐起來，夢醒了麼？\n\n\n\n  可能是因為自己是「鬼」的原因，所以做夢時，總是會夢回地獄，但之前那個和無面女一樣裝束的女人又是誰？\n\n\n\n  聽對方的聲音，似乎不是無面女。\n\n\n\n  蓉城那天到底發生了什麼事，細節上周澤並不清楚，小蘿莉把那一天當作了禁忌，她不願意多說，周澤也嘗試問過，但小蘿莉當時的反應就是哪怕殺了她她也不願意再回憶一遍那一晚的情況，周澤也就作罷了。\n\n\n\n  「鶯鶯…………」\n\n\n\n  周澤開口，\n\n\n\n  想讓鶯鶯給自己倒杯水，\n\n\n\n  但他整個人愣住了，\n\n\n\n  他不是躺在自家書店二樓臥室的床上， \n\n\n\n  而是躺在破舊的草蓆上，\n\n\n\n  在他身邊，密密麻麻地或靠著牆壁或躺在那裡穿著破爛衣服的人，當自己發聲的時候，其他人也在看著他。\n\n\n\n  夢還沒結束，\n\n\n\n  自己還沒有醒來，\n\n\n\n  不，\n\n\n\n  當周澤抬頭看見自己前面那一根根鐵欄杆時，\n\n\n\n  他才意識到，\n\n\n\n  不僅僅是夢還沒結束，\n\n\n\n  而是這個夢，\n\n\n\n  才剛剛開始。\n\n\n\n  「嘩啦啦…………嘩啦啦…………」\n\n\n\n  遠處，\n\n\n\n  傳來了鐵鏈拖地摩擦的聲音，\n\n\n\n  是那麼的熟悉。\n\n\n\n  張燕豐說他自從那一個夢之後，自己二十多年來，每一個夢裡，自己腳上都纏著鎖鏈。\n\n\n\n  周澤下意識地低下頭，\n\n\n\n  掀開自己身下破爛的衣服，\n\n\n\n  鎖鏈呢？\n\n\n\n  我的鎖鏈呢？\n\n\n\n  為什麼我沒有鎖鏈？？？",

    "content": "周澤默默地觀察四周，他知道這應該是夢，但這次，他也算是體會到了張燕豐之前在描述那個夢時所做的形容————真實。\n\n\n\n  是的，\n\n\n\n  這個夢真的很真實，\n\n\n\n  一切的一切，你都可以看得真真切切。\n\n\n\n  它的真實體現在細節上，\n\n\n\n  溫度，\n\n\n\n  濕度，\n\n\n\n  光亮，\n\n\n\n  沒有絲毫屬於夢的朦朧感，甚至，顯得有些過分地清晰和明了了，你明明只是很隨意地掃一眼，但是你連那裡有幾塊磚包括那上面的紋路摩擦痕跡似乎都能記得清清楚楚。\n\n\n\n  冰冷，潮濕，壓抑，這裡，像是噩夢的最深處，深淵內的一個角落，環境的要素其實還是次要的，最關鍵的還是在這個狹窄空間裡或坐或躺著的人。\n\n\n\n  他們的神情，\n\n\n\n  他們的目光，\n\n\n\n  那種麻木，那種渙散，\n\n\n\n  給這裡增添上了最濃厚的絕望。\n\n\n\n  空氣里，瀰漫著令人作嘔的氣息。\n\n\n\n  你已經沒辦法去具體分析這臭味來自於哪一個單一的東西，這是一種混合，讓你頭皮發麻難以想像的混合。\n\n\n\n  尿騷味，膿水味，人身上所散發出來的其他惡臭包括屍臭等等雜糅在了一起。 \n\n\n\n  周澤低下頭，\n\n\n\n  這個環境，\n\n\n\n  真的讓他很不舒服，待一秒，都是一種折磨。\n\n\n\n  哪怕這是夢，\n\n\n\n  他也希望醒來。\n\n\n\n  去尼瑪的線索，\n\n\n\n  去尼瑪的痕跡，\n\n\n\n  去尼瑪的真相，\n\n\n\n  讓老子待在這個地方，哪怕是夢，也不行！\n\n\n\n  周老闆在這個時候顯得很是任性，\n\n\n\n  他閉上眼，\n\n\n\n  慢慢地在心裡想像著在水底上浮的感覺，一般的人如果做了這種「鬼壓床」的夢或者是「清明夢」的話，也可以做這種嘗試，這樣可以加速甦醒。\n\n\n\n  然而，\n\n\n\n  偏生生的，有一隻手忽然按在了周澤的額頭上，而且這隻手，很臭，那濃郁的刺激性味道直接刺入周澤的鼻腔，刺激到了他的神經。\n\n\n\n  「燒…………退咧。」\n\n\n\n  說話的是一個中年男子，頭髮亂糟糟的，臉上也有著兩處傷疤。\n\n\n\n  周澤緩緩地睜開眼，下意識地伸手想要把對方按在自己額頭上的手給挪開，但他卻忽然發現自己的身體虛弱得很，乃至於力氣匱乏到了令人難以想像地程度。 \n\n\n\n  手抬到一半只能落下，而且一陣頭暈目眩。\n\n\n\n  「沒事，沒事，燒退咧，問題不大咧。」\n\n\n\n  男子張開雙臂，將周澤抱入自己懷裡。\n\n\n\n  「…………」周澤。\n\n\n\n  周老闆現在很討厭這該死的真實，\n\n\n\n  你弄得這麼真實做什麼，\n\n\n\n  有意思麼？\n\n\n\n  破爛衣服之外的肌膚接觸現在都是那麼的清晰，那個男人身上的油膩和污垢累積下來的「泥」，似乎還自帶著潤滑效果。\n\n\n\n  每一個細節，每一個部位的接觸，\n\n\n\n  甚至對方呼吸吹打在自己臉上的濕熱，\n\n\n\n  都帶著一種令人犯嘔的絕望！\n\n\n\n  「還冷麼？」\n\n\n\n  對方問道，話語聲很溫柔。\n\n\n\n  周澤注意聽了對方的口音，帶著點川味，總之，不是通城地方口音。\n\n\n\n  周老闆很想罵人，但他更想早點結束此時的尷尬，搖搖頭，想說話，但話到嘴邊，卻說不出來，他太累了，累得嗓音里一點聲音都發不出來。\n\n\n\n  「嘩啦啦…………嘩啦啦………………」\n\n\n\n  鎖鏈的聲音響起，且越來越近。 \n\n\n\n  牢房裡原本像是一具具「乾屍」一樣的人忽然激動了起來，他們一個個爬起來，全都涌到了鐵柵欄那邊雙手抓著鐵柵欄看著外面。\n\n\n\n  像是農村那邊趕集的日子一樣，大家都湊過去看熱鬧。\n\n\n\n  「嘩啦啦…………嘩啦啦…………」\n\n\n\n  近了，\n\n\n\n  很近了，\n\n\n\n  戴著腳銬的人，要來了！\n\n\n\n  周澤很想爬起來，看一看，這應該也是張燕豐夢裡所看見的那一幕，但看樣子要麼就是自己比張燕豐看得更真實要麼就是自己和張燕豐根本就不在一個視角上。\n\n\n\n  爬起來，\n\n\n\n  給老子爬起來，\n\n\n\n  臭味聞過了，\n\n\n\n  這個骯髒的地方都經歷過了，\n\n\n\n  還被一個男人抱了，\n\n\n\n  不起來看看具體情況的話，周澤覺得這些苦都白受了，自己也太虧了。\n\n\n\n  他對面前的男人使眼色，示意他攙扶自己起來看看。\n\n\n\n  「你燒剛退，先躺一會兒，我去看看。」\n\n\n\n  說著，男子很是溫柔地把周老闆安置在了地上，這塊區域墊著比較厚的草料，所以比其他位置更柔軟。\n\n\n\n  周老闆就這樣抬頭，看著牢房天花板， \n\n\n\n  而現在整個牢房裡，\n\n\n\n  包括那個之前陪著自己的男人，\n\n\n\n  全都擠到了鐵欄杆邊探頭看著外面，\n\n\n\n  像是一群追星的狂熱粉絲。\n\n\n\n  只有周澤，\n\n\n\n  一個人，\n\n\n\n  孤零零地躺在那裡，一動不動。\n\n\n\n  周澤覺得自己就像是一個傻子，有點像是跑龍套的，而且這個龍套還沒台詞，是一個死屍，且當鏡頭切換到其他地方去之後，坑爹的導演還不准自己起來，必須要讓自己繼續躺屍。\n\n\n\n  沒人說話，\n\n\n\n  沒人發聲，\n\n\n\n  他娘的，\n\n\n\n  直播看不了，\n\n\n\n  連有聲也聽不了？\n\n\n\n  周澤在心裡又罵了一次，他真的很想現在就閉上眼，在沒有人干擾的前提下把這個夢弄碎好讓自己甦醒過來。\n\n\n\n  他現在應該躺在鶯鶯的腿上，香噴噴地睡覺，醒來的話還能讓鶯鶯給自己泡茶，\n\n\n\n  為什麼還要繼續躺在這個比茅廁還要髒的地方？\n\n\n\n  但周澤又有點不甘心，苦都吃了，便宜也被占了，就這樣空手來空手回去？\n\n\n\n  還有，他記得張燕豐說過，那個夢，他記得很清楚，因為它很真實，但那個夢，他只做了一次。 \n\n\n\n  所以，\n\n\n\n  很可能，\n\n\n\n  周澤也只有這一次的機會。\n\n\n\n  我忍，\n\n\n\n  我繼續忍，\n\n\n\n  周澤腦子裡開始回憶自己上輩子最後階段出車禍後「假死」的狀態，\n\n\n\n  想想那時候被化妝再被推入火葬場的經歷，\n\n\n\n  現在，\n\n\n\n  似乎也沒那麼難以忍受了。\n\n\n\n  圍觀群眾的呼吸聲加粗也加重了，\n\n\n\n  呼吸聲中有著一種熱切，也有著一種渴望，\n\n\n\n  像是一個個發情的公猩猩，噴著鼻氣，就差雙手擂自己的胸口「噢噢噢噢」叫起來了。\n\n\n\n  別問周澤是如何從呼吸聲中推測出這麼多東西的，\n\n\n\n  畢竟他現在除了研究這一點點的聲音變化還能研究啥？\n\n\n\n  「嘩啦啦…………嘩啦啦…………嘩啦啦…………」\n\n\n\n  來了，\n\n\n\n  來了，\n\n\n\n  拖著鎖鏈的人，\n\n\n\n  慢慢地走來，\n\n\n\n  而且根據聲音，周澤可以確定對方已經走到了自己這間牢房的門口。 \n\n\n\n  周澤用盡全身力氣，側過頭，\n\n\n\n  他要看，\n\n\n\n  看一看，\n\n\n\n  一定要看！\n\n\n\n  但隨後，\n\n\n\n  周澤絕望了，\n\n\n\n  他只能看見在欄杆位置，是一群群男人的背影，他們把那裡堵得個嚴嚴實實，密不透風。\n\n\n\n  周老闆甚至連找個縫隙瞅瞅都難以做到！\n\n\n\n  艹！\n\n\n\n  周澤在心裡不停地怒吼著。\n\n\n\n  「嘩啦啦…………嘩啦啦…………嘩啦啦…………」\n\n\n\n  聲音由近向遠，開始慢慢地拉長，\n\n\n\n  人，\n\n\n\n  應該走遠了。\n\n\n\n  這就走了？\n\n\n\n  不說點話？\n\n\n\n  吼一句「給人進出的門被鎖著，給狗進出的洞還開著？」\n\n\n\n  周澤之前和張燕豐討論過，按照那時的環境來看，戴著腳銬的人很可能是烈士，寧死不屈的烈士，雖然有一些問題會有矛盾，但是那種可能性的概率真的很大。\n\n\n\n  現在，\n\n\n\n  周澤倒是可以排除之前的推斷了。\n\n\n\n  因為當那個戴著腳銬的人走遠了之後，周澤沒看見牢房裡其他人感到悲傷和憤怒， \n\n\n\n  恰恰相反的是，\n\n\n\n  他們的臉上全都是羨慕和憧憬。\n\n\n\n  仿佛恨不得那個戴著鐐銬走出去的人，是自己。\n\n\n\n  這讓周澤有些一頭霧水，這到底是什麼意思？\n\n\n\n  那個男人又轉了回來，伸手幫周澤整理頭髮。\n\n\n\n  講真，\n\n\n\n  如果是讓許清朗來給自己做這個動作，\n\n\n\n  自己至多覺得有點不適應，但還不至於太過反感，但眼前這個油膩且身上骯髒得不像樣子的傢伙這樣做，就讓周老闆剛剛好不容易壓制下去的噁心感再度升騰起來了。\n\n\n\n  這個地方，\n\n\n\n  他真的是片刻都不想多待。\n\n\n\n  「再睡會兒吧，等會兒開飯了，我幫你拿那一份來。」\n\n\n\n  男人溫柔地說道。\n\n\n\n  周老闆對吃，真的是沒有興趣，正常的食物他都吃不下，更別提看這裡的環境其實你就已經清楚這幫人的伙食到底是什麼玩意兒。\n\n\n\n  夢結束了沒有？\n\n\n\n  到底結束了沒有？\n\n\n\n  周澤就像是一個看完電影的人散場還不走，就等待著彩蛋。\n\n\n\n  但等了好一會兒，應該是沒彩蛋了。 \n\n\n\n  正當周澤準備真的閉上眼離開這個夢境時，\n\n\n\n  忽然間，\n\n\n\n  周澤覺得自己腹部一陣絞痛，像是有什麼東西正在踹自己肚子一樣。\n\n\n\n  艹，\n\n\n\n  吃壞肚子了？\n\n\n\n  「怎麼了，你疼麼？」\n\n\n\n  男子很是焦慮地看著周澤，然後伸手在周澤肚子上摸著。\n\n\n\n  「…………」周澤。\n\n\n\n  就在這時，那邊又傳來了悉悉索索的聲音，一個木桶被放在了外面，應該是飯食。\n\n\n\n  男子站起身，走向了那邊。\n\n\n\n  預想中的那種哄搶沒有出現，大家就像是自發地克制一樣，等著男子拿一個破碗盛了第一份飯食拿了湯水走回來，然後接下來眾人才開始哄搶。\n\n\n\n  靠，\n\n\n\n  獄霸啊？\n\n\n\n  周澤書店裡有不少「霸道總裁愛上我」的書，很多小女生很喜歡看，\n\n\n\n  現在這是「獄霸大佬愛上我」？\n\n\n\n  「來，先坐起來，吃。」\n\n\n\n  男子把周澤攙扶起來，靠著牆壁坐著，\n\n\n\n  周澤坐了起來，\n\n\n\n  低下頭， \n\n\n\n  發現自己肚子鼓鼓脹脹得很大很大，\n\n\n\n  胃脹氣？\n\n\n\n  這麼嚴重？\n\n\n\n  「辛苦你了，也辛苦你肚子裡的孩子了。」男子帶著歉意說道。\n\n\n\n  肚子裡的…………孩子？\n\n\n\n  艹，\n\n\n\n  這是一具女人的身體？",

    "content": "周澤很難以描述自己現在的感覺，只覺得一切的一切是那麼的荒謬，或許是因為剛剛進入這個夢，或許是一種一開始的代入思想麻痹，所以周澤真的沒對自己的性別產生過懷疑。\n\n\n\n  一直到現在，才有種恍然大悟的感覺。\n\n\n\n  當然，在這裡恍然大悟是一種貶義詞，至少對於周老闆來說是這樣，大多數正常一點的男性可能都不希望自己有這種「恍然大悟」的一天。\n\n\n\n  好在，這種尷尬和糾結並沒有持續太久，因為很快「咕嘟…………咕嘟…………」的聲音就再度冒了起來。\n\n\n\n  周澤一開始是長舒一口氣，覺得夢要醒了。\n\n\n\n  不管是被動的還是主動的，自己應該都要醒來回到溫暖的大床柔軟的高中女生大腿上去了。\n\n\n\n  就像是你去參加一個公益活動，太陽大得要死，撂挑子不幹了覺得過意不去，但忽然上面有人喊話活動結束，那就順水推舟丟下東西進去吹吹空調河杯冰鎮芬達吧，也不想喊著我還能繼續幹下去沒事兒。\n\n\n\n  大多數人應該是這種心態。\n\n\n\n  但很快，周澤發現這水聲有問題，它不是在自己身邊響起，也不是在自己耳中響起，它是在自己肚子裡想起！\n\n\n\n  「咕嘟…………咕嘟……………」\n\n\n\n  周澤上輩子是單身，這輩子也沒讓林醫生懷孕，按理說他對產婦其實並不了解，但實際上上輩子自己當醫生時處理急診面對過好多個產婦了，所以他可以確定，正常孕婦，哦不，哪怕不正常孕婦肚子也不會發出這種聲音。 \n\n\n\n  且水聲越來越大，大得像是在打雷一樣，肚皮也在一抖一抖的。\n\n\n\n  牢房裡其他人在此時都像是陷入了時間靜止一樣，搶飯的搶飯，吃飯的吃飯，全都一動不動，包括周澤面前的這個男人，也是保持著餵飯的姿勢不動了。\n\n\n\n  「咕嘟…………咕嘟………………」\n\n\n\n  水燒開了，\n\n\n\n  周澤盯著自己的肚子，\n\n\n\n  他本能地察覺到了什麼。\n\n\n\n  終於，\n\n\n\n  一條裂縫從自己肚子上慢慢地浮現而出，很滑膩，很順暢，這種感覺像是在手術台上用手術刀切割著肚皮。\n\n\n\n  周澤也不感覺痛，但以前是自己給別人動手術切割肚皮找病灶，這次輪到自己變成了第一視角「體驗」這種感覺。\n\n\n\n  好像現在VR技術被不少人用來拍攝第一人稱VR運動愛情片牟利，市場前景也是非常之好，這一刻周澤覺得似乎這也是一條新的商機，比如推出這樣一款VR體驗，讓所有年輕丈夫都體驗一把，好讓他們明白自己妻子分娩的辛酸。\n\n\n\n  當然了，男人們肯定是不願意體驗這玩意兒的，但可以著重在女人那邊宣傳。\n\n\n\n  好吧，\n\n\n\n  周老闆在這個時候思緒發散得實在是不像樣子，這就像是做、、愛和做其他痛苦的事情一樣，你需要給自己分點心，好讓自己不要那麼專注。 \n\n\n\n  畢竟，眼下周老闆自己的肚皮正在慢慢地裂開。\n\n\n\n  然後，一隻白嫩的小手從肚子裡伸出來，頗有一種孫猴子蹦出石頭的感覺，你不得不感嘆生命的奇蹟。\n\n\n\n  然而，在下一刻，\n\n\n\n  一個沒有頭的嬰兒從周澤肚子裡爬了出來。\n\n\n\n  周老闆深吸一口氣，他已經做好了一切的心理建設準備，但事實的發展還是進一步地超出了他的心理建設期限。\n\n\n\n  再高明再擅長黑暗畫風的導演和編劇，\n\n\n\n  也很難拍攝出現在的這種畫面，\n\n\n\n  糾結著倫理和最原始的恐怖，\n\n\n\n  新生的璀璨和死亡的陰影在此時完美地進行了契合。\n\n\n\n  似乎是出於職業習慣的原因，周澤發現嬰兒的脖頸位置很是圓滑，這意味著切割頭顱時對方技術精湛。\n\n\n\n  「咿呀…………咿呀…………」\n\n\n\n  沒有頭，\n\n\n\n  卻依舊能夠發出聲音，\n\n\n\n  童聲稚語，本應該是讓人覺得清脆動聽的聲音，\n\n\n\n  但在此時卻成為了最恐怖陰森的點綴，\n\n\n\n  不亞於老套恐怖片裡經常響起的低沉配樂，甚至起到了更為可怕強烈的效果。 \n\n\n\n  「滴答…………滴答…………」\n\n\n\n  嬰兒身上還帶著濃郁的體液，隨著他順著周澤肚子往上爬，那些體液不停地滴落在了周澤的身上，滑膩膩的感覺很讓人難受。\n\n\n\n  終於，嬰兒爬到了周澤的面前。\n\n\n\n  周澤現在很想抽支煙，然後表現出一種若無其事的樣子說一聲「來，我們聊聊」。\n\n\n\n  但現在周澤連話都說不出來，\n\n\n\n  擱在以往遇到這種畫面周老闆肯定二話不說指甲蓋兒伺候！\n\n\n\n  管你有什麼天大的冤屈讓老子這個潔癖承受這種苦難就該把你撕碎甚至連下地獄的機會都不給你，\n\n\n\n  實在不行大不了開個無雙看看到底誰能笑到最後。\n\n\n\n  但是現在人在屋檐下不得不低頭，周老闆只能半眯著眼，看著嬰兒的下一步舉動。\n\n\n\n  「咿呀…………咿呀………………」\n\n\n\n  嬰兒慢慢地向後傾倒，\n\n\n\n  幾乎是屁蛋兒就坐在了周澤的胸口位置，兩條小腳丫撐起來，像是在故意給周澤看一些什麼。\n\n\n\n  周澤看見了，\n\n\n\n  在嬰兒的腳上，有一條絲線，這是體液凝聚出來變成了類似膠水一樣濃稠性極強的玩意兒。\n\n\n\n  但從周澤的視角看起來， \n\n\n\n  這就像是嬰兒自己小腿上也纏繞上了一條鏈子，\n\n\n\n  他在向自己炫耀這一條鏈子，\n\n\n\n  而且樂不可支。\n\n\n\n  是你搞得鬼？\n\n\n\n  周澤在心裡問道。\n\n\n\n  他不知道嬰兒能不能聽得到，\n\n\n\n  但這是周澤現在可以嘗試的唯一溝通方式。\n\n\n\n  很顯然，嬰兒聽不到，他還是在不停地繼續炫耀著自己腿上的「鏈子」，像是一個小學生考了一百分跑回去跟自己爹媽報喜得瑟以期待獲得誇獎。\n\n\n\n  周澤沒有過小孩，正規的小孩還是私生子，周老闆兩輩子都沒有過，但很諷刺的是，周澤第一次體驗「父愛如山」，居然是在這個環境在這個場面之下。\n\n\n\n  他乾脆閉上了眼睛，說不了話，也基本動彈不了，但我選擇非暴力不合作，總可以吧？\n\n\n\n  但肚皮上的觸感卻是那麼的清晰，包括那滑膩膩的感覺噁心的體驗在自己身上滴淌的感覺，哪怕你看不見，但耐不住你自己的腦補，其實跟睜開眼睛看還真差不多。\n\n\n\n  也就在這時，\n\n\n\n  遠處像是傳來了「咔嚓」一聲鐵門打開的聲響。\n\n\n\n  這就像是萬物復甦的春雷炸起，\n\n\n\n  又像是一部電影開場前的龍標，一個綠色的大幕出現一條龍最後顯示「公映許可證」； \n\n\n\n  這意味著下面電影開始了，\n\n\n\n  故事開始了，\n\n\n\n  大家敬請期待。\n\n\n\n  周澤睜開眼，\n\n\n\n  看見那個之前還坐在自己胸口位置折騰的嬰兒慢慢地轉過身，開始向他出來的地方爬去。\n\n\n\n  這是一種比他出來時更詭異的畫面，\n\n\n\n  一個從母親肚子裡剛剛爬出來的嬰兒，\n\n\n\n  他又慢慢地爬進了母親的肚子裡，\n\n\n\n  仿佛那個手術刀一樣順滑流暢且切出來的刀口還能自帶拉鏈效果，\n\n\n\n  他拉開了拉鏈，\n\n\n\n  他出來了，\n\n\n\n  他進去了，\n\n\n\n  又拉上了拉鏈。\n\n\n\n  是的，此時周澤就有這種感覺，看著自己肚子上的傷口慢慢地癒合，這種現實和虛幻猛烈交叉撞擊的感覺換做其他人當這個第一視角的觀眾估計早就心理崩潰了。\n\n\n\n  就是換張燕豐那種老刑警隊長在周澤這個位置，估計也是一樣，普通人再優秀他也有一個心理承受極限，就像是人再強壯不吃飯你也得餓死一個道理。\n\n\n\n  好在周老闆心理防線確實鞏固，這一年來人和鬼也見識得太多太多，外加身邊還有小蘿莉不時地以可愛萌的面容伸出長長的舌頭玩意兒一把畫風突變。 \n\n\n\n  周老闆是過來人了，\n\n\n\n  他只覺得這畫面很噁心，\n\n\n\n  但你要真的說靠這些畫面和第一視角的體驗就能把周老闆嚇瘋了，那也太瞧不起鬼差了，活人能被鬼嚇死，你見過鬼差被鬼嚇死？\n\n\n\n  原本靜止著喧囂終於回歸，牢房裡的犯人們開始爭搶著食物。\n\n\n\n  「來，吃飯。」\n\n\n\n  那個男人溫柔地把碗湊到周澤面前。\n\n\n\n  像是之前電影放到一半，被按了暫停，現在又按了恢復，劇情重新恢復了流暢。\n\n\n\n  周澤閉著嘴，不吃。\n\n\n\n  「吃一點吧，秀芬。」\n\n\n\n  周澤還是閉嘴。\n\n\n\n  「嘩啦啦…………嘩啦啦………………嘩啦啦………………」\n\n\n\n  鐵鏈的聲音再度傳來，\n\n\n\n  只不過這次聲音更響亮，而且拖動的節奏更快，不像是有人穿著它在行走，更是有人用手拉著它在行進。\n\n\n\n  一時間，原本爭搶飯食的犯人們通通丟掉了碗筷，全都擠到了欄杆那邊。\n\n\n\n  包括剛剛給周澤餵飯的男人，也放下了碗筷沖了過去。\n\n\n\n  一名穿著黑色制服的男人手裡提著兩根腳銬鏈子從過道那邊走了過來， \n\n\n\n  沿途所有牢房裡的犯人都開始喊叫，\n\n\n\n  他們很興奮，他們很激動，\n\n\n\n  他們，\n\n\n\n  也很渴望。\n\n\n\n  所有人都儘可能地伸出手，像是乞討的乞丐，希望分一杯羹。\n\n\n\n  黑色制服的人拿著鐵鏈轉身看著四周，\n\n\n\n  似乎很享受這種簇擁和期待的感覺，\n\n\n\n  然後，\n\n\n\n  他慢慢地走近了周澤所在的這個牢籠，\n\n\n\n  把兩根鐵鏈中的一根直接一甩，\n\n\n\n  丟進了這間牢籠里去。\n\n\n\n  一時間，\n\n\n\n  牢房裡的眾人像極了一群爭搶一根骨的野狗，居然直接廝打了起來。\n\n\n\n  之前給周澤餵飯的那個男人吼著：\n\n\n\n  「給我媳婦兒，給我媳婦兒，\n\n\n\n  她懷著孕，\n\n\n\n  她肚子裡有孩子！」\n\n\n\n  一邊吼著，\n\n\n\n  他也沖入了爭搶的圈子裡。",

    "content": "很多人都曾見過小路上一群野狗野貓爭搶食物的畫面，那種爭鬥，那種拼搶，不遺餘力，不惜一切。\n\n\n\n  因為動物清楚，沒有食物，自己也是死路一條。\n\n\n\n  人，一直自詡為高一等的存在，自詡為萬物之靈；\n\n\n\n  就像是有部分通城人被人稱呼為自己是蘇北人時會像是一隻被踩著尾巴咋呼起來的貓一樣激動地反駁說自己是蘇中，不是蘇北，這反而顯得更可笑。\n\n\n\n  很多年前，人類也是過著和野獸一樣茹毛飲血的生活，但現在，人們對於一些過分的舉動，往往會將其稱之為「禽獸之舉」。\n\n\n\n  開化了，\n\n\n\n  明智了，\n\n\n\n  就趕緊想要和以前的「同伴」撇開關係。\n\n\n\n  正如現在周澤看著這群人爭搶鎖鏈一樣，他們槍得很是忘我，搶得很是投入，人仰馬翻，本來空氣就很差的牢房被他們又掀起了陣陣塵土，空氣變得更差了。\n\n\n\n  到最後，有一個人手舉著鐵鏈站了起來，他臉上掛著彩，身上帶著很多淤青，眉角還破了口子，有血不停地滴淌下來。\n\n\n\n  這是這個女人的男人，之前那個還含情脈脈餵飯的男人。\n\n\n\n  就像是一頭獅子出去獵殺食物帶回來給自己母獅子吃一樣，他成功了。\n\n\n\n  黑色制服的人伸手敲了敲欄杆， \n\n\n\n  示意鐵鏈有主了，\n\n\n\n  這也讓周圍還蠢蠢欲動打算再上去拼搶一番的人不得不偃旗息鼓。\n\n\n\n  其實，\n\n\n\n  一開始在分飯食時，牢房裡其他人都表現出了一種極大的克制，他們知道這所監獄裡，還有一個孕婦。\n\n\n\n  但這並不意味著在接下來對鐵鏈的爭搶時他們會手下留情，晚一會兒吃飯和少吃一點不會有太大的問題，然而，這條鐵鏈，卻意味著更多的東西。\n\n\n\n  男人拿著鐵鏈走到了女人面前，\n\n\n\n  彎下腰，\n\n\n\n  將鐵鏈套在了女人的腳上，\n\n\n\n  「咔嚓」\n\n\n\n  扣上，\n\n\n\n  然後他抬起頭，\n\n\n\n  看著女人，\n\n\n\n  他笑著，\n\n\n\n  笑得很開心，\n\n\n\n  這笑容，在周澤眼裡宛若一個智障，\n\n\n\n  同時，\n\n\n\n  他有著一種深深的不解，\n\n\n\n  這條鐵鏈到底意味著什麼，\n\n\n\n  這幫犯人為什麼會對它如此地熱衷，\n\n\n\n  但有一點周澤可以確定的是，\n\n \n\n  這條鐵鏈似乎並不是那麼的美好，\n\n\n\n  否則也不會有這麼多年後還依舊存在的夢魘了。\n\n\n\n  這個夢，很清晰，細節條理都清晰得無以復加，但儘管如此，周澤卻覺得這裡頭仍然有一層根本就看不清楚的迷霧籠罩著。\n\n\n\n  它籠罩著真相，\n\n\n\n  有時候，越是真實的東西，往往也意味著越是虛假。\n\n\n\n  周澤張開嘴，\n\n\n\n  他想說些什麼，但聲音在喉嚨里還是無法發出來，只剩下了沙啞的呢喃。\n\n\n\n  然後，\n\n\n\n  男人攙扶起了女人，黑色制服打開了牢籠，旁邊又走過來幾個黑色制服，他們從男人手裡攙扶過了女人。\n\n\n\n  男人下意識地想要跟出來，卻被兩個黑色制服男子一把推了進去。\n\n\n\n  然後鐵欄杆再度被閉合，男人雙手死死地抓著欄杆，看著女人，看著女人的肚子。\n\n\n\n  他仍然很開心，\n\n\n\n  無比的開心，\n\n\n\n  非常的開心，\n\n\n\n  開心得讓周澤覺得自己如果有機會的話，\n\n\n\n  都想跑回去給他扁一頓。\n\n\n\n  「嘩啦啦………………嘩啦啦…………………嘩啦啦………………」 \n\n\n\n  鐵鏈的聲音在地上摩擦，\n\n\n\n  周澤也在走，\n\n\n\n  但因為這具身體太虛弱了，所以兩邊都有黑色制服在攙扶著他。\n\n\n\n  一路走過去，\n\n\n\n  清冷且孤寂，\n\n\n\n  唯有鐵鏈在地上摩擦的聲音是那麼的清脆，\n\n\n\n  那麼的刺耳。\n\n\n\n  然而，\n\n\n\n  路過其他牢房時，\n\n\n\n  周澤看見了之前相似的一幕，\n\n\n\n  牢房裡的犯人們一個個都聚集在了鐵欄杆前，探著頭，看著周澤，看著這個腳上綁著鐵鏈的女人。\n\n\n\n  他們眼裡，\n\n\n\n  滿滿的都是羨慕，\n\n\n\n  是那種恨不得取而代之的羨慕，\n\n\n\n  在聽到這鐵鏈的聲音時，他們甚至還露出了很享受的表情。\n\n\n\n  這幫人腦子是不是有病？\n\n\n\n  周老闆現在是一臉的黑人問號？？？\n\n\n\n  走，\n\n\n\n  還在走，\n\n\n\n  不停地走，\n\n\n\n  這條通道很長，再加上周澤走得很慢，\n\n\n\n  但明顯也是身邊兩個黑色制服的人沒有用全力的原因，如果他們願意，明顯可以分分鐘拖著這個女人快速地往前跑。 \n\n\n\n  這個女人雖然是一個孕婦，但周澤清楚，她能在營養和生活環境下依舊保證沒流產已經是一個奇蹟了，其實她真的很瘦，就比皮包骨頭好一點而已。\n\n\n\n  她跟她的孩子能撐下來，\n\n\n\n  真的不容易。\n\n\n\n  在周澤看來，\n\n\n\n  是這幫黑色制服的人故意走得這麼慢的，\n\n\n\n  他們像是巡遊一樣，\n\n\n\n  慢慢地陪著女人走，\n\n\n\n  像是在簇擁著冠軍獲得者接受其他人的矚目和歡呼，似乎刻意地想要把這個過程給延長一些。\n\n\n\n  不過，周澤還有一個疑惑，\n\n\n\n  好像方向錯了啊，\n\n\n\n  之前那個鐵鏈是從自己牢房這邊從右邊往左走的，但自己這次是被攙扶著從左往右走的，周澤很細心地留意到了這個差別。\n\n\n\n  再長的路，\n\n\n\n  終歸是有盡頭的。\n\n\n\n  前面，\n\n\n\n  出現了一扇鐵門。\n\n\n\n  門被打開了，\n\n\n\n  周澤被推了進去，\n\n\n\n  在裡面有一張桌子，\n\n\n\n  上面放著乾淨的水和食物， \n\n\n\n  周澤沒動，\n\n\n\n  讓周老闆在沒有其他佐料的情況下吃東西實在是不亞於一場酷刑了。\n\n\n\n  但下一刻，\n\n\n\n  一種衝動在周澤心裡響起，\n\n\n\n  周澤開始伸手，拼命地把食物和水往自己嘴裡塞。\n\n\n\n  周澤清楚，這只是夢，而自己，代入是一個女人的視角。\n\n\n\n  所以，\n\n\n\n  現在不是自己在動，\n\n\n\n  而是女人的求生欲在迫使著她開始吃東西，拼命地吃東西，因為她想活下來，因為她肚子裡還有一個孩子。\n\n\n\n  她清楚地知道，她的孩子需要營養。\n\n\n\n  狼吞虎咽持續了很久，但女人似乎永遠都吃不夠，但旁邊的黑色制服男子直接制止了她，打斷了她的繼續進食。\n\n\n\n  曾作為醫生的周澤清楚，極度食物匱乏的階段猛吃過度的話很容易出現生命危險。\n\n\n\n  古代在牢房裡有著一種「私刑」，叫做「獄死」。\n\n\n\n  就是讓犯人們一直餓著，只給少量的食物，讓其不至於餓死，但也別想吃飽，當然了，這個階段可以省略，古代想在牢房裡吃飽飯也是一種妄想和奢望。\n\n\n\n  然後猛地一天，獄卒給你擺上了一桌好酒好菜，讓你撒歡兒吃，當你吃得肚子滾圓之後，兩個獄卒就過來，一人一邊，一個抓著你的頭一個抓著你的雙腳，把你舉起來玩兒「伸展運動」，一會兒收緊一會兒拉直。 \n\n\n\n  來回這麼一段時間，你就嘎屁了。\n\n\n\n  這種死法，以古代仵作的驗屍水平是查不出什麼異樣的，身上也沒其他的傷口，獄卒們一般用這種法子收黑錢幫人在監獄裡整人報仇。\n\n\n\n  吃飽了，\n\n\n\n  身體像是一下子又有了一些力氣。\n\n\n\n  一個黑色制服男子拿著水槍走了進來，\n\n\n\n  水槍開始對著女人開始沖。\n\n\n\n  冰冷的水沖了過來，來回地沖。\n\n\n\n  女人躺在了地上，\n\n\n\n  不停地嗚咽著，\n\n\n\n  周老闆也跟著一起變成了落湯雞，這滋味，真的不是很好受。\n\n\n\n  隨後，\n\n\n\n  黑色制服拿來了一件白色的長袍衣服給女人換上，把身上還有些濕漉漉但確實比之前乾淨不少女人又推出了鐵門。\n\n\n\n  「嘩啦啦…………嘩啦啦………………嘩啦啦………………」\n\n\n\n  鐵鏈繼續在地上被拖動著。\n\n\n\n  之前走過的路，還要重新走一遍。\n\n\n\n  周澤都有些迷茫了，\n\n\n\n  難不成這搶鐵鏈就是為了吃一頓飽飯洗個澡？\n\n\n\n  就跟搶飯票搶洗澡票一個道理？ \n\n\n\n  重新走回去的路上，兩邊鐵欄杆里的人依舊是以一種羨慕的眼光看著周澤。\n\n\n\n  繼續往前走，\n\n\n\n  走到了周澤被關押的牢房，那個餵飯的男人也在欄杆邊看著女人，他很激動，也很欣慰，很開懷。\n\n\n\n  這讓周澤想起了劉若英的一首歌：\n\n\n\n  「很愛很愛你，所以願意捨得讓你，往更多幸福的地方飛去…………」\n\n\n\n  周澤繼續往前走著，鐵鏈還是繼續摩擦著地面。\n\n\n\n  黑色制服男子並沒有把他重新送回之前所在的牢房，而是繼續往前走著。\n\n\n\n  走著走著，上了樓梯，\n\n\n\n  走著走著，出現了地毯，\n\n\n\n  走著走著，\n\n\n\n  又出現了鐵門。\n\n\n\n  門被打開了，\n\n\n\n  裡面有光，\n\n\n\n  讓人一時間產生了一種可以逃出生天的錯覺。\n\n\n\n  沒蹲過牢的人是不能體會蹲牢房時對自由的渴望的，就像是大部分只有在生病時才會真切意識到平時活蹦亂跳身體健康沒毛病是多麼美好的一件事一樣。\n\n\n\n  周澤明顯察覺到，\n\n\n\n  在這個女人身上產生了一種激動喜悅的情緒， \n\n\n\n  很是強烈，\n\n\n\n  甚至她的身體都在不停地顫抖著。\n\n\n\n  她主動走了進去，\n\n\n\n  鐵鏈繼續拖著地面，\n\n\n\n  發出停留在這個狹窄空間裡最後的一點聲響。\n\n\n\n  「哐當…………」\n\n\n\n  人走進去後，\n\n\n\n  鐵門被關閉。\n\n\n\n  前面，被白色的類似農民種反季節蔬菜時用的大棚一樣的東西遮擋著，\n\n\n\n  而附近區域兩側位置，\n\n\n\n  則是有著一個個類似淋噴頭一樣的東西，有著很多小孔。\n\n\n\n  像是一個公共澡堂一樣，好像之前洗澡得不夠乾淨，還得重新洗一遍。\n\n\n\n  女人的情緒繼續激動著，\n\n\n\n  她還在慢慢地往前走，\n\n\n\n  而周澤在看見四周的布局後，\n\n\n\n  一種恐怖的陰霾馬上籠罩了下來，\n\n\n\n  女人不知道這裡是什麼地方，\n\n\n\n  但是他知道啊！\n\n\n\n  該死，\n\n\n\n  出去，\n\n\n\n  要出去，\n\n\n\n  這裡根本不是什麼見鬼的淋浴間，\n\n\n\n  這裡是煉獄，\n\n\n\n  真正的人間煉獄！",

    "content": "書店關著門，裡面亮著燈；\n\n\n\n  一般來說，書店是白天偶爾關門晚上是肯定開門的，但誰叫老闆今晚早早地就上去睡覺去了呢？\n\n\n\n  老闆既然消極怠工，手底下的員工自然也就樂得偷懶，最重要的是，沒老闆出手，他們就算是有顧客上門，也沒辦法給顧客打包發快遞，所以還不如不折騰。\n\n\n\n  老道和許清朗兩個人頭坐在沙發上，二人身邊茶几上則放著兩杯紅酒。\n\n\n\n  紅酒是走書店帳上走的錢，價格不菲，整個書屋現在瀰漫著一種鹹魚和腐敗的氣息，這是從上而下所帶壞的風氣。\n\n\n\n  其實，\n\n\n\n  一開始大家的吃穿用度方面的享受是有節制的，但後來周老闆的咖啡和茶葉越來越高級之後，下面的人自然也就上行下效了。\n\n\n\n  畢竟，\n\n\n\n  整個書店最沒錢的人都享受這麼高級的東西，\n\n\n\n  沒必要咱們幾個身家不菲的人寒酸湊合著過吧？\n\n\n\n  小猴子蹲在吧檯上面，面前擺著花生，自個兒一個人吃著歡快，它不煩人，也不折騰人，有人找它玩它就陪著玩玩，沒人找它它就自個兒玩，倒是乖巧得很。\n\n\n\n  老道還給它買了個緊箍和一件袈裟，順帶從某寶上定製了一個金箍棒，這只是老道為了滿足自己的惡趣味。 \n\n\n\n  想想看孫大聖正在被自己養成，那真是滿滿的自豪感和滿足感。\n\n\n\n  老闆還告訴過他，當初他跟猴子大戰三百回合時，猴子的「鐵棒」真的好嚇人。\n\n\n\n  老道信了，\n\n\n\n  但他沒料到老闆所說的「鐵棒」不是自己所想的鐵棒。\n\n\n\n  猴子不喜歡緊箍這玩意兒，也不喜歡那個棒棒，倒是對袈裟情有獨鍾，沒事做就把袈裟當披風一樣裹在身上，倒居然也能透露出些許的佛性。\n\n\n\n  老道曾去過峨眉山，那裡的猴子不怕人，甚至會主動來找遊客要吃的，如果運氣不好遇到了猴子的「暴躁老哥」，\n\n\n\n  不給的話猴子們還會來搶奪。\n\n\n\n  但即使那樣，峨眉山的猴子也被稱之為有「佛性」。\n\n\n\n  但對比一下自家的猴砸，真的是差遠了，會玩兒手機會切歌還能滴滴打車，上次猴砸就是自個兒打車去的將軍山給老闆看病的。\n\n\n\n  嘖嘖嘖，\n\n\n\n  反正在老道眼裡，被人家的孩子再優秀也沒自家孩子可愛。\n\n\n\n  老道不止一次地說過，他這輩子無兒無女，雖說資助了不少的貧困學生，但也沒幾個節假日打電話給他問好問安的，倒是有時候自己混得不好手頭拮据時有不少打電話催要學費生活費的，說話也難聽，像是自己欠了他們錢他們走不出大山就是自己的罪過一樣。 \n\n\n\n  這猴子，老道是當自個兒孫子養的，畢竟有些時候，畜生比人更懂得感恩這個道理。\n\n\n\n  「這日子過得，挺頹廢的。」\n\n\n\n  老道喝了一口紅酒，眯著眼，他品不出紅酒的好壞，所以他品味的其實是這一口紅酒到底咽下去了多少RMB。\n\n\n\n  想想這個價格，這紅酒的滋味就出來了。\n\n\n\n  咽下了紅酒，\n\n\n\n  老道伸展了一下自己的老腰，發出了一聲輕嘆，又道：\n\n\n\n  「你說現在咱書店外頭還有便衣盯著麼？」\n\n\n\n  「不曉得。」\n\n\n\n  「你不是會術法麼？」\n\n\n\n  「我什麼水平你不清楚，半桶水罷了。」許清朗倒是實誠，「倒是你，祖上也闊綽過，沒想著把術法撿起來練練？」\n\n\n\n  「早失傳咧，你呢，你就不想著再練練？」\n\n\n\n  「練了幹嘛，混吃混喝現在挺好，一邊看看不一樣的風景一邊打著自己的醬油，其實，他這種生活態度才是最舒服的，如果他真的跟你以前蓉城的那位老闆一樣，那咱們就得腦袋系在腰上過日子了。\n\n\n\n  刺激是刺激，\n\n\n\n  但想想現在，還是現在舒服啊。」\n\n\n\n  「罷了罷了，額上去睡覺咧。」 \n\n\n\n  老道把剩下的一點紅酒一飲而盡，對許清朗打了聲招呼，問道：「你不去睡覺？」\n\n\n\n  「據說，月光對皮膚有好處，我在曬月亮。」\n\n\n\n  許清朗伸手指了指自己臉上的面膜，\n\n\n\n  仿佛在吸收月亮之精華。\n\n\n\n  「切，神經病。」\n\n\n\n  老道打了個呵欠，招呼了一下猴子，然後走上了樓梯，剛走到二樓，老道跟猴子一起打了個哆嗦。\n\n\n\n  「嘶………………」\n\n\n\n  娘的，\n\n\n\n  這他娘的冷氣開得也太過了吧，\n\n\n\n  這麼冷？\n\n\n\n  老道下意識地雙手抱著自己的胳膊往裡走著，他先走到了老闆臥室門口，因為下面門縫裡還有白氣不停地逸散出來呢。\n\n\n\n  很顯然，\n\n\n\n  這裡才是源頭。\n\n\n\n  「咚咚咚…………」\n\n\n\n  老道敲門，\n\n\n\n  「老闆，空調壞咧，功率太強咧。」\n\n\n\n  裡面沒反應，\n\n\n\n  老道這時候也顧不得其他了，只能自己打開了門，不然他真擔心自己晚上睡覺時不知不覺就直接冬眠了。\n\n\n\n  門被推開，老道把頭往裡頭一探，然後愣住了。 \n\n\n\n  床上，\n\n\n\n  有一男一女，\n\n\n\n  當然，\n\n\n\n  老道偶爾也會在心裡YY一下老闆跟白鶯鶯每天晚上睡覺會發生什麼事情，雖說他也清楚鶯鶯是殭屍，水道結了冰，但作為一個老司機，老道清楚鍛鍊的方式還有很多種，這才是真正的情調和趣味。\n\n\n\n  床上的姿態，\n\n\n\n  很和諧，\n\n\n\n  比老道想像中要和諧得多。\n\n\n\n  老闆躺在鶯鶯的腿上，\n\n\n\n  鶯鶯坐在床上，雙手放在老闆的臉上。\n\n\n\n  兩個人哪怕是老道自個兒進來了也依舊一動不動，像是睡得很死根本就沒察覺到有人進來一樣。\n\n\n\n  老闆身上不時有白氣升騰而出，\n\n\n\n  而這些白氣大部分都被吸入了白鶯鶯的鼻子裡，\n\n\n\n  少量的逸散了出去，成為了使得附近溫度開始降低的元兇。\n\n\n\n  這一幕，\n\n\n\n  活脫脫的就像是老道以前喜歡看的港台午夜片裡的狐妖或者女鬼吸男人陽氣的畫面。\n\n\n\n  老道一陣猶豫，\n\n\n\n  他不知道自己是大喝一聲「呔，女殭屍放開我家老闆！」\n\n\n\n  還是喊一聲：「喲，鶯鶯吸得舒服麼，別把老闆吸乾了啊。」 \n\n\n\n  老道是不相信鶯鶯會主動吸收老闆身上東西的，和這頭女殭屍生活在一個屋檐下很久了，女殭屍如果真的對老闆有二心，之前在將軍山就沒必要捨命相救了。\n\n\n\n  湊近了幾步，老道得以看得更仔細了一些。\n\n\n\n  他發現鶯鶯原本的滿頭白髮已經有一半變成了黑色，\n\n\n\n  嘖嘖，\n\n\n\n  這是在療傷？\n\n\n\n  老闆在幫鶯鶯補充元氣？\n\n\n\n  老道想到了「玉女心經」，想著這功法也真奇怪，還得躺床上才能練功。\n\n\n\n  再看老闆，\n\n\n\n  老道忽然發現老闆的表情非常的痛苦，\n\n\n\n  像是在做噩夢一樣，很是難受的樣子。\n\n\n\n  娘的，\n\n\n\n  這是練功走火入魔了？\n\n\n\n  老道咬了咬牙，不管了，當下拿起旁邊的一本書，捅了捅老闆的胸口，但老闆還是沒反應。\n\n\n\n  老道乾脆拿書本對著老闆的胸膛拍了下去，\n\n\n\n  「啪！」\n\n\n\n  聲音很大，\n\n\n\n  老闆還是沒醒，但是白鶯鶯忽然睜開了眼，\n\n\n\n  女殭屍眼裡一片冰冷，剎那間本性顯露，她本就是殭屍，天地人神共棄之，平日裡的天真爛漫也只是對周澤一人而言的。 \n\n\n\n  此時的她，像是起床氣一樣，目光掃了一眼老道。\n\n\n\n  老道倒吸一口涼氣，\n\n\n\n  只覺得周圍溫度變得更冷了。\n\n\n\n  「鶯鶯，是我啊，是貧道啊…………」\n\n\n\n  老道打著哆嗦說道。\n\n\n\n  白鶯鶯面無表情，\n\n\n\n  先用力看了看老道，\n\n\n\n  然後低下頭看了看自己懷中的周澤，\n\n\n\n  隨後，\n\n\n\n  她似乎也是注意到了自己顏色發生變化的頭髮，當即像是意識到了什麼，馬上下了床，且直接在床邊跪了下來。\n\n\n\n  「老闆，鶯鶯不是故意的，鶯鶯也不知道是怎麼回事，忽然就睡著了。\n\n\n\n  鶯鶯真的不是故意吸收老闆的煞氣的，真的不是故意的。」\n\n\n\n  鶯鶯跪在地上，表情無比的誠懇和忐忑，像是一個做了錯事的孩子，在等待大人的懲罰。\n\n\n\n  額…………\n\n\n\n  老道琢磨著，\n\n\n\n  自己是不是也該跟著跪一下應個景？\n\n\n\n  但好像沒自己啥事兒啊。\n\n\n\n  就在這時，\n\n\n\n  因為白鶯鶯下了床而導致「睡眠」狀態無法繼續的周澤， \n\n\n\n  身體微微一顫，\n\n\n\n  而後，\n\n\n\n  緩緩地睜開眼，\n\n\n\n  這一雙眼眸之中，帶著一種令人瘋狂的血色，充斥著令人生寒的歇斯底里。\n\n\n\n  媽嘢！\n\n\n\n  老道嚇得直接腿軟，跪了下來，\n\n\n\n  老闆這樣子太可怕了。\n\n\n\n  周澤慢慢地坐了起來，\n\n\n\n  夢裡的畫面像是還沒有完全驅散，\n\n\n\n  頗有一種「為當夢是浮生事，為復浮生是夢中」的感覺。\n\n\n\n  周澤一開始沒看跪在地上的老道和白鶯鶯，\n\n\n\n  而是閉上了眼，\n\n\n\n  等過了一會兒，再重新睜開時，\n\n\n\n  周澤眼中的血色慢慢地褪去，化作了清明。\n\n\n\n  那個夢，\n\n\n\n  在最關鍵也是最令人絕望的時候，結束了。\n\n\n\n  周澤有些失落，但心裡也有些慶幸。\n\n\n\n  他側過臉，看著還跪在地上的白鶯鶯，留意到了白鶯鶯頭髮顏色的變化，問道：\n\n\n\n  「我記得我說過，等我身體恢復好後，會幫你復原的。」\n\n\n\n  「老闆…………」 \n\n\n\n  白鶯鶯見周澤誤會自己主動故意地吸收他身上的煞氣，當即把頭埋得更低了，解釋道：\n\n\n\n  「老闆，是鶯鶯幫你按摩時，\n\n\n\n  你身上的煞氣自己逸散出來的，\n\n\n\n  鶯鶯吸了幾口之後就醉了，然後就忘記之後發生什麼事情了。」\n\n\n\n  老道這個時候開口幫鶯鶯開脫道：\n\n\n\n  「對嘛，老闆，這事兒你不能怪鶯鶯啊，\n\n\n\n  是你自個兒精滿自溢了啊，\n\n\n\n  夢YI…………」\n\n\n\n  說到這裡，\n\n\n\n  老道咬了咬自己的嘴唇，\n\n\n\n  低下頭，\n\n\n\n  抽了自己一個巴掌，\n\n\n\n  我這，\n\n\n\n  臭嘴……",

    "content": "洗了一個澡，周澤換了一身衣服，坐到了樓下的沙發上，現在才是後半夜，距離天亮還早，但周澤已經沒了睡意。\n\n\n\n  正常的一個人在做了那個夢之後，估計也很難在短時間內再睡回去吧。\n\n\n\n  白鶯鶯給周澤泡了咖啡端上來，然後在旁邊站著，像是一個做錯了事兒的孩子，手足無措。\n\n\n\n  周澤擺擺手，示意沒事了，她可以上去休息或者是玩遊戲了，但白鶯鶯還是不願意走，在她看來，不管是有意無意的，她確實是從周澤身上吸收了煞氣，而自家老闆的身體明明還沒完全復原。\n\n\n\n  這就像是一個身體本就重病的人居然還夜夜笙歌，真的是作死。\n\n\n\n  喝了一口咖啡，周澤點了一根煙，老實說，他也有點奇怪，為什麼做夢時自己身上會自己散發出煞氣，他相信白鶯鶯不是故意害自己或者等不及了，事實上，白鶯鶯對她「白髮魔女」的造型還挺滿意的，最近穿衣服風格也玩兒起了古風，倒是別有韻味。\n\n\n\n  這件事，只能算是自己心頭的一根刺，想不通，就只能先放下，現在畢竟有更重要的事情需要去處理和解決。\n\n\n\n  半個小時後，一輛警車停到了書店門口。\n\n\n\n  旁邊還在「吸收日月精華」的許娘娘一瞅警察來了，直接起身上了樓，也不願意在樓下待了。\n\n\n\n  他抱怨過看守所空氣不好，睡眠也不好，看守所那一夜對他皮膚的打擊很大。 \n\n\n\n  進來的是張燕豐，是周澤給他發的信息。\n\n\n\n  張燕豐手裡拿著一份文件袋，他的目光先放在了白鶯鶯身上，有些疑惑地問道：\n\n\n\n  「她是誰？」\n\n\n\n  上次警察進書店，周澤讓白鶯鶯她們先走了，所以張燕豐並不知道白鶯鶯，而且哪怕警察的信息系統再強大，也不可能錄入白鶯鶯的信息。\n\n\n\n  「我侄女。」\n\n\n\n  周澤敷衍道。\n\n\n\n  張燕豐沒再糾結這個，而是在周澤對面坐了下來。\n\n\n\n  「咖啡還是茶？」周澤問道。\n\n\n\n  張燕豐摸了一把自己有些倦怠的臉，又聞到了周澤面前咖啡的濃香，道：「咖啡吧。」\n\n\n\n  白鶯鶯去泡咖啡，周澤側過頭喊了一聲：\n\n\n\n  「拿雀巢速溶的。」\n\n\n\n  「…………」張燕豐。\n\n\n\n  咖啡端了上來，張燕豐倒也光棍，一口喝完，然後指了指桌上的文件袋道：「不想看看？」\n\n\n\n  周澤搖搖頭，「應該沒什麼有用的信息。」\n\n\n\n  「呵呵。」\n\n\n\n  張燕豐笑了笑，也點了一根煙，問道：\n\n\n\n  「叫我來，做什麼？」 \n\n\n\n  「因為做剛剛睡覺了。」\n\n\n\n  「什麼？」\n\n\n\n  「然後，我做了一個夢。」\n\n\n\n  周澤伸了一個懶腰，\n\n\n\n  夢裡的畫面不堪回首，\n\n\n\n  當然，比起最後進入的那個密封空間，之前哪怕「女裝孕婦視角」的體驗，也就不值一提了。\n\n\n\n  「什麼樣子的夢？」張燕豐表情變得嚴肅起來。\n\n\n\n  這個世界上，\n\n\n\n  就他跟周澤兩個人腿上有鎖鏈綁著，既然他能做夢，那麼周澤自然也就能做夢。\n\n\n\n  「那個地方，應該不是醫院。」周澤咳嗽了一聲繼續道：「那裡，應該曾經是一座秘密的地下集中營，有點像是納粹的奧斯維辛。」\n\n\n\n  張燕豐眼睛眯了眯，「集中營？」\n\n\n\n  「對，我的夢應該和你有重疊的部分，我也夢到了那個監獄；\n\n\n\n  但可能是我和你有不同的原因，所以，我的夢比你更真實，細節上也比你的夢多得多。\n\n\n\n  那裡，關押著很多犯人，每個牢房裡都人滿為患。」\n\n\n\n  說著，\n\n\n\n  周澤伸手指了指自己腳下根本就看不見的鐵鏈，繼續道：\n\n\n\n  「這條鏈子，是監獄管理方丟出來的一個東西，它好像並不是象徵著鎖縛，至少，對於那些犯人來說，它似乎代表著一種很美好的東西，寄託著不一樣的美好感情。」 \n\n\n\n  周澤又想到了夢中那個幫女人搶奪到鐵鏈的男子，\n\n\n\n  當女人套著鐵鏈走出去時，\n\n\n\n  他站在鐵欄杆後面目光裡帶著祝福和美好的期待。\n\n\n\n  但他可能並不知道，\n\n\n\n  套著鎖鏈的女人，\n\n\n\n  最後走入了怎樣的一個地方。\n\n\n\n  這裡形成了一個極其強烈的矛盾點，因為周澤覺得自己當時對夢裡最後一個環境的分析應該不會有錯。\n\n\n\n  納粹的奧斯維辛介紹資料真的不難找，有不少與其相關的人都寫過類似的回憶錄，有一段周澤以前上學時讀過，記憶深刻，那就是不少猶太人進入那個房間之後以為這是給他們淋浴洗澡的地方，結果那些小孔里出來的不是溫熱的水，而是毒氣。\n\n\n\n  張燕豐沉默不語，他不知道該如何接這個話。\n\n\n\n  「我想，這個資料里，應該沒提及這個吧？」周澤伸手指了指茶几上的文件袋。\n\n\n\n  張燕豐搖了搖頭。\n\n\n\n  「那間監牢，應該是在地下深處的位置。」周澤沉聲道，「而且推測一下當時人穿的服飾以及我所看見的管理員的服飾，應該是民國時期，既然這個資料里沒有記載，我覺得，是不是存在這樣一種可能，那就是這個監獄現在還在地下，根本就沒有被發現？」 \n\n\n\n  「所以，你的意思是什麼？讓我去跟領導申請把警局推了往下開挖？\n\n\n\n  理由是我做了一個夢？」\n\n\n\n  張燕豐反問道。\n\n\n\n  「總歸是能找到辦法的，不是麼？」周澤又喝了一口咖啡，「畢竟，苦主都找到我們腳上來了。」\n\n\n\n  「我做不到，也不可能用這種理由去做。」張燕豐很認真地說道。\n\n\n\n  「其實，這個不難的，只要找到一點點的證據就可以了。」周澤分析道。\n\n\n\n  「最近警局裡面準備平整出一個地下車庫。」張燕豐說道。\n\n\n\n  「我懂了。」周澤點點頭，示意自己清楚了，但周老闆又繼續慵懶道：「我去讓人運作。」\n\n\n\n  如果能通過這個機會讓施工隊往底下多挖一些距離，說不定會出現什麼線索，到時候只要能確定下面可能有特殊的建築物，到時候正常的挖掘和施工也就能正大光明地繼續下去了。\n\n\n\n  「還有事麼？」張燕豐問道，看意思是打算走了。\n\n\n\n  「我的事情，你幫不上。」\n\n\n\n  周澤笑道，比如自己為什麼會在做夢時「精滿自溢」，甚至那逸散出來的煞氣濃郁到都可以讓白鶯鶯醉了過去。\n\n\n\n  「那我就先走了。」張燕豐起身，拿起了茶几上的文件袋。 \n\n\n\n  「對了，張隊。」周澤喊了一聲。\n\n\n\n  「怎麼了？」張燕豐回過頭看向周澤。\n\n\n\n  「你家祖上有沒有出過當兵的？」周澤儘可能地組織著自己的措辭，「你爺爺或者你太爺爺那一輩？」\n\n\n\n  「你這是什麼意思？」\n\n\n\n  「就是問問，興許那裡頭的受害者，可能會有你的親屬，你知道的，血親關係，很可能也能成為一種羈絆；\n\n\n\n  而這種羈絆，有時候甚至能夠超越生與死的距離。」\n\n\n\n  周澤想到了當初在文廟那邊被自己殺死的老頭，老頭侍奉文廟很多年，為的，就是給自己的後代祈福。\n\n\n\n  「這個我不清楚，我得去問問。」\n\n\n\n  「也包括特殊失蹤的。」周澤補充道。\n\n\n\n  「你說，監牢里有我的長輩，但既然是我的長輩，為什麼給我這個後輩加一條鎖鏈？」張燕豐問道。\n\n\n\n  「但對於他們來說，鎖鏈是一種美好的象徵，你長輩萬一喜歡你，就把這個給你戴上了呢？\n\n\n\n  就像是給你一塊糖或者一把長命鎖一樣。」\n\n\n\n  張燕豐沉默了一會兒，還是離開了。\n\n\n\n  周澤翹著腳，繼續側躺在沙發上，陷入了另外一種沉思。 \n\n\n\n  那就是如果張燕豐可以說是可能自己的某個親戚長輩死在那個監獄裡所以鎖鏈最後會落在他的身上，\n\n\n\n  那麼自己呢？\n\n\n\n  僅僅是因為自己是鬼差，\n\n\n\n  再加上自己恰好出現在了警局的範圍，\n\n\n\n  所以就被戴上了鎖銬？\n\n\n\n  真的，\n\n\n\n  是這樣麼？\n\n\n\n  想著想著，周澤忽然覺得有點胸悶，他站了起來，推開書店門，走了出去，站在了深夜的街道上。\n\n\n\n  空氣中瀰漫著淡淡的濕氣，還有稀稀落落的雨水正在落下。\n\n\n\n  哦，\n\n\n\n  原來是要下雨了，\n\n\n\n  怪不得這麼悶。\n\n\n\n  周澤繼續站在雨中，重新點了一根煙。\n\n\n\n  雨開始越下越大，\n\n\n\n  從一開始的淅淅瀝瀝變成了「嘩啦啦」的磅礴。\n\n\n\n  周澤伸手擋住了頭，\n\n\n\n  剛洗過澡的他還是決定先回書店裡頭了。\n\n\n\n  然而，\n\n\n\n  抬腳時身形一個踉蹌，整個人差點摔了下來。\n\n\n\n  腳下好重， \n\n\n\n  像是被鎖住了什麼東西根本就抬不起來。\n\n\n\n  周澤有些詫然地低下頭，\n\n\n\n  赫然發現在自己的腳上，\n\n\n\n  居然鎖著一條腳鏈，\n\n\n\n  怎麼，\n\n\n\n  怎麼會？\n\n\n\n  ……………………\n\n\n\n  老道吸了吸鼻子，走下了樓，他剛剛睡了一會兒，但有些凍感冒了，下來倒了一杯熱水喝喝暖暖身子，實在是老闆他們把二樓弄得太「清涼」了，這製冷的效果到現在都沒完全消散掉。\n\n\n\n  之前他還聽到上樓的許清朗打了個噴嚏，顯然也是有點受不了這種天然人工製冷的餘韻。\n\n\n\n  「喲。」\n\n\n\n  老道一邊慢慢喝著熱水一邊看向了坐在沙發上的白鶯鶯，\n\n\n\n  「老闆又睡著了？」\n\n\n\n  白鶯鶯點點頭，伸手輕輕地撫摸著老闆的面龐，道：\n\n\n\n  「那個警察剛走就睡著了，老闆應該是真的累了。」\n\n\n\n  「嘿嘿嘿，這能不累麼，都快被你給榨乾了。」",

"雨一直下，\n\n\n\n  氣氛不算融洽，\n\n\n\n  周澤默默地發現自己所站的街道正在慢慢地縮小，腳下的地面也在變得模糊，\n\n\n\n  視線所及之處，正在不斷地被壓縮著，\n\n\n\n  逐漸形成了夢靨的翻版，\n\n\n\n  哦不，\n\n\n\n  其實，不能說是翻版吧，只能說是，\n\n\n\n  一種延續。\n\n\n\n  回過頭，\n\n\n\n  發現身後不再是書店，而是一扇緊閉的鐵門。\n\n\n\n  再往上看，雨簾不見，取而代之的，是牆壁密密麻麻細孔位置不斷滴落下來的不知名液體。\n\n\n\n  又是那個夢？\n\n\n\n  自己又回到夢裡了？\n\n\n\n  回到了上次結束的地方，\n\n\n\n  回到了噩夢的暫停位置，\n\n\n\n  而當那個按鈕按下去之後，\n\n\n\n  似乎只是給了你一點點的中場休息時間，\n\n\n\n  接下來你該承受的，\n\n\n\n  你該體驗的，\n\n\n\n  你該去面對的，\n\n\n\n  根本就跑不掉。\n\n\n\n  周澤不清楚這是為什麼，這個夢，這個鎖鏈，為什麼會有著這麼大的能力。 \n\n\n\n  想當初自己進入三鄉村時，靠著那枚青銅戒指的「運營」，三鄉村得以成為一個獨特的架構一直存在至今，但也不至於有主動將人「吸入」的能力。\n\n\n\n  三鄉村也只能靜靜地存在於那個位置，還需要你費盡心思去找它，才能進入，根本不會像這個夢一樣，張開嘴主動地把你吞噬進去。\n\n\n\n  夢的結束，\n\n\n\n  夢的開始，\n\n\n\n  這其中，帶著極為明顯地蠻不講理，似乎周澤這個做夢的主體在這其中根本就無足輕重。\n\n\n\n  無論周澤是否願意，\n\n\n\n  他都會進來，\n\n\n\n  且必須進來。\n\n\n\n  周澤深吸一口氣，\n\n\n\n  講真，\n\n\n\n  一向鹹魚心態的周老闆最不喜歡的，就是這種感覺，他喜歡無拘無束，浪費屬於自己的青春和人生，但並不願意有人來對自己的生活指手畫腳，甚至強制自己去做一些事情。\n\n\n\n  也因此，\n\n\n\n  周老闆在此時選擇了非暴力不合作，\n\n\n\n  稀里糊塗地再入夢中，\n\n\n\n  好吧，\n\n\n\n  既然如此，\n\n\n\n  那自己就當一個冷靜的旁觀者。 \n\n\n\n  閉上眼，\n\n\n\n  甚至攤開雙臂，\n\n\n\n  周澤做出了主動迎接的架勢。\n\n\n\n  壓抑逼仄的空間裡，\n\n\n\n  那些液體不斷地澆灌在周澤的身上，\n\n\n\n  略微有些粘稠，且鼻尖不斷湧入類似於消毒水一樣的味道。\n\n\n\n  不過，周澤本來腦補的一些東西並沒有出現。\n\n\n\n  比如皮膚龜裂或者起密密麻麻的水泡或者肉體腐爛露出白骨云云，這些都沒有出現。\n\n\n\n  當然，\n\n\n\n  這種感覺也不好受，有點類似於泡在福馬林中的標本。\n\n\n\n  面前，是一塊白色的布簾，裹得嚴嚴實實。\n\n\n\n  周澤走過去，伸手去將其撕開一個口子，然後用力地掰開。\n\n\n\n  前面，\n\n\n\n  是和自己身後一樣的空間，\n\n\n\n  但又一個大肚子的女人正扶著牆壁不停地乾嘔著，顯得很是痛苦。\n\n\n\n  她的身子應該本就很虛弱，而此時這個空間裡這麼濃郁的刺激性味道，也著實讓她很是難受。\n\n\n\n  又是孕婦？\n\n\n\n  這裡的孕婦怎麼就這麼多？\n\n\n\n  周澤下意識地低下頭， \n\n\n\n  然後有些愕然，\n\n\n\n  自己的肚子是乾癟著的，\n\n\n\n  嗯？\n\n\n\n  好像有些不對勁。\n\n\n\n  周澤伸手摸向了老道經常掏出符紙的位置，\n\n\n\n  一桿槍加倆子彈袋，\n\n\n\n  這是一具男人的身體！\n\n\n\n  這次重新進入夢中，換了主視角了麼？\n\n\n\n  還有，\n\n\n\n  自己面前的這個女人，\n\n\n\n  怪不得這麼眼熟，\n\n\n\n  原來就是自己上次做夢時的主視角。\n\n\n\n  周澤走了過去，想要把女人攙扶起來。\n\n\n\n  算是一種本能的，哪怕他知道這是一個夢，但自己至少曾陪伴過這個女人。\n\n\n\n  也就在此時，原本周澤身後的鐵門被推開了，發出了刺耳的摩擦聲，而後有好幾名穿著防化服的人員走了進來，他們的雨靴踩在地上發出了「吧唧吧唧」的聲響。\n\n\n\n  其中兩個人直接伸手夾住了周澤的肩膀，把周澤往後拖拽。\n\n\n\n  他們的力氣其實不算很大，但周澤雖然這次夢裡從女人的視角換回到了男人的視角，但不變的是身體依舊極為虛弱。\n\n\n\n  就算是再強壯的人，被羈押在這個地方，每天吃著跟泔水差不多的食物，不見天日，估計也很快就會廢了吧。 \n\n\n\n  那個孕婦也一樣被夾了起來，兩個人一起被架著往外走。\n\n\n\n  周澤嘗試不停地扭頭看著四周，一直到周圍的過道開始越來越寬，到最後，遠處還聽到了陣陣聲響。\n\n\n\n  不是牢房裡的聲音，\n\n\n\n  事實上周澤待過牢房，牢房那裡雖然關著很多很多的人，但是那裡格外的安靜，大家都沒氣力了，也不會有人傻乎乎地抓著欄杆喊著什麼「放我出去，求求你放我出去」這類的廢話。\n\n\n\n  上頭的燈管開始越來越亮，也越來越密。\n\n\n\n  周澤被抬起來，放到了一輛擔架車上，然後自己的手腕和腳腕位置被重新做了一次固定。\n\n\n\n  周澤聽老道以前說過，一些帶著S。。。。M主題的情侶房會有這種項目，人會被「大」字型捆綁在床上，用以增加情趣。\n\n\n\n  擔架車被繼續往前推，周澤側過頭，看見自己身邊還有一輛擔架車，上面躺著那個孕婦。\n\n\n\n  比起周澤的淡然，孕婦就顯得緊張得多了，不停地哭喊著什麼，顯然，她發現了不對勁。\n\n\n\n  她的丈夫，姑且認為那個給她餵飯的男人是她的丈夫吧，拼得頭破血流給她爭奪到了鐵鏈，肯定不是為了享受此時的這一刻的。\n\n\n\n  周澤一直覺得，牢房裡的所有人，對這腳鏈，帶著一種極大的誤解，當然，這也是監獄管理方故意造成的誤解，甚至有意在經營著這種謊言。 \n\n\n\n  女人的喊叫聲很雜亂，不是通城方言，應該是其他地方的方言，所以她到底在喊一些什麼說一些什麼，周澤用力去聽了，但收穫寥寥，基本上都聽不懂。\n\n\n\n  最終，\n\n\n\n  兩個擔架車被推到了一個房間裡，這裡有著一些手術器械和設備。\n\n\n\n  對於曾經當過醫生的周澤來說，這裡的手術設備和器械實在是老舊得不能再老舊，一些東西自己以前只是在課本上看到過。\n\n\n\n  穿著防化服的人把兩個擔架車上的人又檢查了一遍，然後一起離開，走了出去，很快，又有一群穿著白大褂的人走了進來。\n\n\n\n  周澤一直在看著他們，他在期待著這些白大褂說話，因為在周澤的心裡，一直有一個猜測，而這個猜測，需要一個佐證。\n\n\n\n  只要這幫人說話，\n\n\n\n  就能確定自己的猜測到底對不對了。\n\n\n\n  然而，\n\n\n\n  他們並沒有說話。\n\n\n\n  這群白大褂自走入這個房間開始，就毫無交流。\n\n\n\n  雖然周澤可以看出他們面罩之下的年輕和老邁，甚至有兩個頭髮都有些花白了，也能看得出他們之間有身份地位的差距，明顯的副手和主刀。\n\n\n\n  但他們就是不說話，不做任何的交流。 \n\n\n\n  或許，這種事情，對於他們來說有點像是日常了。\n\n\n\n  實驗室里送進來兩個標本活體，\n\n\n\n  他們照例去應對，\n\n\n\n  就像是廚師每天上班打卡，不需要研究新的菜式，每天做的菜也是固定的，鹽味精油等等調料，都有標配，一切的一切，按部就班就可以。\n\n\n\n  其中兩個年輕的白大褂走到了屋子最裡面的一個類似保險柜的位置，那裡有一根金屬管子從裡頭探出來，兩個白大褂像是打開水龍頭一樣，從裡頭抽出了一團赤紅色的東西。\n\n\n\n  這是，\n\n\n\n  血？\n\n\n\n  這大保險柜里，是血庫？\n\n\n\n  接下來，拿著血樣的年輕白大褂站在一邊，伸手指了指周澤和隔壁床鋪的孕婦。\n\n\n\n  意思是，\n\n\n\n  先來哪個？\n\n\n\n  一個年紀稍大的白大褂走到了孕婦旁邊，示意先這個。\n\n\n\n  沒有交流，\n\n\n\n  依舊沒有交流。\n\n\n\n  這是夢，周澤不斷地對自己說著，既然是夢，那必然是假的，哪怕以前發生過，但也絕對不是發生在此時此刻自己的眼前。\n\n\n\n  周澤原以為自己能夠很是平靜地看完這一切， \n\n\n\n  就像是一個人坐在電影院裡看一場午夜場的恐怖電影，而且國產能上映的恐怖片有一個準則就是不能出現真的鬼，不管前面多故弄玄虛氛圍多好，到最後肯定給你歸咎到精神病或者催眠一類的所謂科學解釋之中。\n\n\n\n  所以只要抱著最後肯定吃屎的心態，\n\n\n\n  你會覺得開頭部分無論再恐怖，也就有限了。\n\n\n\n  周澤以為自己應該是這種心態，\n\n\n\n  並不會有太多的波瀾，\n\n\n\n  但他想錯了。\n\n\n\n  當年輕的白大褂將鮮血像是打點滴一樣慢慢地注入孕婦的體內時，\n\n\n\n  周澤眼睜睜地看著孕婦的身體開始瘋狂地抽搐起來，\n\n\n\n  她的血管在不斷地變粗，青筋畢露，像是馬上要炸裂出來一樣，\n\n\n\n  她表情極為痛苦，同時她不停地在試圖抬起頭，想要看看自己的腹部。\n\n\n\n  一邊的幾個白大褂們很是安靜地在旁邊拿著表格做著記錄，他們早就麻木了，也早就見怪不怪了。\n\n\n\n  孕婦的嘶吼和咆哮越來越誇張，她的眼耳口鼻里都開始有鮮血溢出，抽搐感也在不斷地增強，身體開始扭曲起來，但因為四肢關節位置被固定著，所以形成了一種極為誇張和不協調的姿勢。\n\n\n\n  脖子翻轉， \n\n\n\n  身子明明朝上，\n\n\n\n  但臉是朝下的，\n\n\n\n  牙齒不停地咬著光滑的擔架車，希望以此緩解自己的痛苦。\n\n\n\n  她的雙臂也早就扭曲過來，雙腿更是扭成了麻花。\n\n\n\n  周澤的目光有些茫然，\n\n\n\n  這是一種難以用言語去描述的慘烈場面，\n\n\n\n  或許，\n\n\n\n  對孕婦的痛苦和折磨，周澤是有心理準備的。\n\n\n\n  但最讓他刺眼的是，\n\n\n\n  那一群穿著白大褂的傢伙，平靜地站在旁邊，觀看著這一切。\n\n\n\n  作為曾經的一名資深醫療工作者，他們身上的白色，讓周澤覺得那麼的刺眼。\n\n\n\n  孕婦的掙扎持續了一段時間，\n\n\n\n  最終，\n\n\n\n  在某一刻，\n\n\n\n  她停止了掙扎，\n\n\n\n  整個人以一種天津麻花兒的姿勢詭異痛苦地陷入了一種靜止，\n\n\n\n  死於折磨，\n\n\n\n  死於痛苦，\n\n\n\n  死於扭曲。\n\n\n\n  見慣了生離死別，見慣了亡魂的周老闆，\n\n\n\n  在此時竟然有一點點不敢看， \n\n\n\n  尤其是孕婦的眼眶位置，\n\n\n\n  黑黑的，\n\n\n\n  空空的，\n\n\n\n  但卻格外地驚悚。\n\n\n\n  一名中年白大褂拿出了一把手術刀，\n\n\n\n  對著孕婦的肚子直接剖了下去，\n\n\n\n  從專業角度來說，\n\n\n\n  周澤可以確定對方擁有著資深外科醫生的手術刀造詣，\n\n\n\n  順滑的切口，\n\n\n\n  沒有其他現代醫學設備的輔助，\n\n\n\n  但卻切割得無比精準。\n\n\n\n  而後，\n\n\n\n  他把戴著塑膠手套的手伸入孕婦的肚子裡，\n\n\n\n  掏出了一個兩個成年人巴掌大的嬰兒，\n\n\n\n  但這個嬰兒身體是黑色的，像是灌了鉛一樣。\n\n\n\n  拿在手裡，\n\n\n\n  掂了掂，\n\n\n\n  等了一會兒，\n\n\n\n  嬰兒忽然動了一下，\n\n\n\n  而後很是痛苦地繼續扭曲起來，似乎是在延續著自己母親的痛苦。\n\n\n\n  看著手中居然還在動彈還在掙扎的嬰兒，\n\n\n\n  四周的所有白大褂忽然一起歡呼起來， \n\n\n\n  像是他們的研究有了新的突破。\n\n\n\n  拿著嬰兒的中年白大褂甚至興奮地叫了一聲：\n\n\n\n  「喲西……」",

    "content": "一聲「喲西」，已經說明了一切。\n\n\n\n  上輩子作為一名醫生，周澤清楚新藥研發和醫學的進步，離不開這種人體實驗，最典型的「神農嘗百草「，可以說是人體實驗的鼻祖，不過在這裡他是拿自己的身體去進行實驗，所以才顯得偉大和崇高。\n\n\n\n  而現代醫學，已經形成了一種比較完善成熟的體系，新藥的研發也有著屬於它的規範和流程，前期的測定，中期對動物的實驗以及之後的一期二期三期臨床試驗時，藥物可能引起的副作用等等理論上或許會出現的危害往往已經被壓縮到了可控和可接受範圍內。\n\n\n\n  人類孜孜不倦地給自己的進步打上馬賽克打上枷鎖，或許在一些科學瘋子眼裡，這是對自己的桎梏，但實際上，這是人類對自己的一種保護本能。\n\n\n\n  無論哪種學科的發展，到最終的目的，其實都是為了反補人類，而不是說對自己進行傷害。\n\n\n\n  上輩子時，一位來自日本的醫學教授曾訪華進行過行業交流講座，他言必談其師，凡是講到大方向大方針時，肯定會將其師傅搬出來當作作證，他的師傅在世時，曾是日本外科醫學的泰山北斗。\n\n\n\n  本著醫學無國界的思想，周澤聽完了整個講座，回去搜索了一下以及找行業相關人諮詢了一下，這才發現那位泰斗的師傅曾經參與過侵華戰爭時期人體實驗的研究項目。\n\n\n\n  因為特殊原因， \n\n\n\n  這類人並沒有被送到審判台或者是絞刑架上去，恰恰相反，歸國之後他們往往成為了日本當地一些大醫院的教授甚至是院長級別的人物，乃至於成為世界醫學界某個領域上的學閥。\n\n\n\n  這確實是一種很黑暗的諷刺。\n\n\n\n  此時此刻，\n\n\n\n  一群白大褂，圍繞著一個被托起的嬰兒，不停地鼓掌。\n\n\n\n  但沒有多久，\n\n\n\n  那個通體是黑色的嬰兒，被以這種簡單粗暴直接從死亡母體上解剖出來的嬰兒也一動不動了。\n\n\n\n  中年白大褂把嬰兒放了下來，然後開始了對嬰兒的解剖，四周其他白大褂也做好了記錄工作準備。\n\n\n\n  初段解剖完成之後，他們似乎已經滿足了，對於今天的研究突破，他們顯得很是滿意，而且他們像是打算繼續這個標本的課題。\n\n\n\n  其中一個年輕白大褂伸手指了指周澤，\n\n\n\n  好像是在問這裡還有一個標本，怎麼處理。\n\n\n\n  中年白大褂回應了一串日文，周澤聽不懂，但可以從他的語氣中感受出來，對方的意思是隨便找個項目給他做了，給人感覺就是反正貨源充足，今天大家已經有了足夠的數據和發現，你就隨便折騰就可以了。\n\n\n\n  隨後，留下了一個白大褂繼續在這裡，其餘白大褂則是帶著嬰兒的屍體標本興沖沖地離開了。 \n\n\n\n  這個年輕的白大褂顯得有些躍躍欲試，像是一個孩子以前只能看著旁邊的大人玩遊戲，現在終於可以自己親手上手操作了，這是一種難以言說的刺激。\n\n\n\n  「馬路大………嘿…………」\n\n\n\n  年輕白大褂自言自語了一串日文，周澤還是聽不懂，但是裡面有一個詞，周澤聽懂了。\n\n\n\n  「馬路大」，在日語裡是「圓木」的意思，大概可以理解成很普遍的材料，從這個稱謂上就可以看出日本人對他們面前這幫關在地牢里隨時取用的活體標本的態度。\n\n\n\n  周澤半睜著眼，他現在已經沒有了第一次不停想著結束這個夢的意思了，既然自己離開這個夢之後還會醒來，或者是外面有人把自己吵醒中斷這個夢之後，自己還會無意識間再進入這個夢裡，與其把夢魘分割成一一段段像是吃西餐一樣慢條斯理地享受，還不如光棍一點，一口氣給它吃光。\n\n\n\n  而且，對於這個奇怪的夢，周澤越來越有一種疑惑的感覺，冥冥之中，像是有什麼東西一直在牽引著自己。\n\n\n\n  那個被日本人捧著走的嬰兒，之後應該化作了厲鬼，畢竟在上個夢裡，周澤曾看見這個嬰兒從「自己」肚子裡爬出來，又爬了回去。\n\n\n\n  興許，這個夢的形成和這個嬰兒的亡魂有很大的關係吧。\n\n\n\n  趁著周澤在思緒飛散的時候，那個白大褂用針筒給周澤注射了什麼東西。 \n\n\n\n  那東西剛注射進體內後，周澤就感知到那個被注射的左臂一陣火辣辣的疼，而後這種疼痛感隨著血液循環開始擴散及全身。\n\n\n\n  周澤想到了那個孕婦，她最後是被硬生生地疼死在了擔架床上的，自己也得走她的後路？\n\n\n\n  但年輕白大褂卻直接把周澤的鎖扣給解開，只保留了腳上的腳鏈，而後，他用繩索把周澤的手腕給反綁住，緊接著更是從旁邊拿出一個金屬圈，套住了周澤的脖子。\n\n\n\n  這玩意兒周澤以前見過，精神病院抓精神病時很喜歡用這個東西，一些地方的警察的防暴裝備里也有，一個大夾子，只要扣住了案犯的脖子，就基本能將其制服了。\n\n\n\n  因為疼痛難忍，周澤翻身掉下了擔架床，白大褂一隻手抓著把手，控制著周澤，一隻手拿著筆，看著表，像是在記錄著一些數據。\n\n\n\n  酸脹、疼痛、肌肉的痙攣和抽搐，周澤本以為自己得重新體驗一遍那種痛苦，但不知道為什麼，慢慢的，這些痛苦開始遠離自己。\n\n\n\n  他依舊是這個第一視角，他依舊是在這具身體上，他能體會到這個身體現在正在承受何種巨大的折磨，但他像是有些麻木了，也像是有些脫離了。\n\n\n\n  身體開始下意識地向外爬，周澤像是一個旁觀者一樣，借著這個視角繼續地看著，這感覺像是戴上了VR眼鏡正在看一部紀錄片。\n\n \n\n  興許，這是一種不幸中的萬幸吧，或許，是這個夢認為一旦把這種痛苦等價地傳遞到自己的感官上，可能會引起自己現實里身體的反應，到時候這個夢就會被強行給切斷。\n\n\n\n  試想那個孕婦剛剛慘死的畫面，周澤甚至覺得如果等同的折磨落在自己身上，可能現實里的自己會下意識地直接進入「殭屍」狀態。\n\n\n\n  年輕白大褂似乎放任著自己的「馬路大」開始往外爬行，像是在遛狗一樣，顯得很是輕鬆自得。\n\n\n\n  爬出了這個實驗室之後，在過道里，他在繼續地爬著。\n\n\n\n  周澤看見了其他實驗室的情況，甚至在過道位置，也有其他的白大褂經過，但對此都見怪不怪。\n\n\n\n  經過一個實驗室時，周澤看見實驗室里的兩個擔架床上，躺著兩個男子，兩個男子分別有一條胳膊剛剛被切割開，幾個白大褂正在忙著給他們續肢。\n\n\n\n  對於現代醫學來說，這是一種極為可笑的操作和實驗，甚至可以說是異想天開了。\n\n\n\n  但是在這裡，\n\n\n\n  卻正在正兒八經地展開著。\n\n\n\n  這種研究項目是為了給那些在戰場受傷殘疾的皇軍考慮，如果可以更換肢體的話，他們認為能提高皇軍的戰鬥力。\n\n\n\n  也不知道是不是因為這個年輕白大褂故意的，需要記錄什麼數據，可能他給這個活體注射的那個液體比之前的孕婦少了一些，所以這個活體能夠持續更長時間的爬行，並沒有很快的死亡，當然，這種痛苦折磨的時間也成倍的增加。 \n\n\n\n  周澤還看見一個實驗室里，躺著五個女性，她們的共同點都是肚子被剖開，五個人都死了，不出意外的話，她們應該都是孕婦，腹中的嬰兒也已經被取出。\n\n\n\n  你很難以想像，\n\n\n\n  在這個其實不算很大的空間裡，\n\n\n\n  每個實驗室，\n\n\n\n  都在上演著慘絕人寰的悲劇。\n\n\n\n  有一部恐怖片，叫《林中小屋》，\n\n\n\n  但《林中小屋》的畫面，比不上這裡的十之一二。\n\n\n\n  「哐當」\n\n\n\n  門被撞開，\n\n\n\n  裡面幾個白大褂看向這邊，臉上露出了不愉之色，年輕白大褂馬上道歉，然後拉扯著周澤出去。\n\n\n\n  周澤只看見在這個實驗室里，\n\n\n\n  有五個人跪在那裡，雙手放在一個類似大冰箱的地方，那裡有小孔，只能給人的手伸進去。\n\n\n\n  其中一個人被拉了出來，他的雙手早就已經被凍得成了白色，而後他被兩個兩個白大褂一起押著把雙手放入滾燙的開水裡。\n\n\n\n  下一刻，\n\n\n\n  皮肉像是雪糕一樣融化下去，\n\n\n\n  只剩下了一雙白骨。\n\n\n\n  而那個男的只是麻木地看著這一切，他已經感知不到疼痛感了。 \n\n\n\n  年輕白大褂似乎有些意外，意外這個活體標本可怕的生命力，像是破了什麼記錄一樣，他一邊喊附近經過的同事似乎是通知自己的上級，然後拉扯著周澤又回到了最開始的實驗室。\n\n\n\n  實驗室的門被他關上，然後他又走到了那個巨大保險柜的面前，像是要重新再提取一些血液標本。\n\n\n\n  這具身體的抽搐像是停止了，像是已經克服了最開始的痙攣和排斥階段，他就這樣靠著牆壁坐在那裡，雙目無神。\n\n\n\n  而周澤的目光，\n\n\n\n  則是盯著面前的那個巨大的保險柜。\n\n\n\n  經過之前的一圈「爬行」，周澤發現了，這間實驗室，好像是這個地下研究所的核心所在。\n\n\n\n  通城這裡有這種研究所，周澤並不感到多奇怪，大部分人只熟悉一個731，它在哈爾濱。\n\n\n\n  事實上還有在長春的關東軍100部隊，在北京的北支甲1855部隊，在南京的榮字1644部隊，在廣州的波字8604部隊等等等，這些只是本部所在的城市，每個本部都會有很多分部，坐落在本部附近省份的大中小城市內同樣進行著人體實驗研究。\n\n\n\n  年輕白大褂拿著大針筒從金屬管子裡抽出血液，\n\n\n\n  然後又走到了周澤面前，\n\n\n\n  帶著好奇和驚喜，看著周澤，一隻手抓住周澤的胳膊，準備繼續注入。 \n\n\n\n  周澤慢慢地抬起頭，\n\n\n\n  看著自己面前的這張很是年輕的面龐，\n\n\n\n  很奇怪，\n\n\n\n  很諷刺，\n\n\n\n  這個年紀的年輕人，放到現在大部分醫院裡，可能都只能當一個實習狗，甚至年齡都沒有周澤以前使喚的實習狗年紀大，\n\n\n\n  但在這個時代，他卻在做著這種事情，且帶著一種小朋友進遊樂園的心態。\n\n\n\n  「八嘎！」\n\n\n\n  年輕白大褂見周澤居然敢瞪著自己，\n\n\n\n  直接一巴掌抽在了周澤的臉上，\n\n\n\n  興許，\n\n\n\n  是他感覺到周澤目光深處的那種鄙夷，這讓他很不舒服。\n\n\n\n  好在，周澤對這一巴掌全無感覺，他早就沒感覺了，除了能看，體會不到疼痛。\n\n\n\n  不過，因為這一巴掌，\n\n\n\n  周澤目光里的戲謔之色反而更清晰了。\n\n\n\n  年輕白大褂再次舉起了手，準備再抽一巴掌，但當他的手掌還沒落下時，\n\n\n\n  「砰！」\n\n\n\n  一聲悶響，\n\n\n\n  是從那個巨大保險柜里發出的，\n\n\n\n  像是有什麼東西在裡面狠狠地撞擊到了保險柜。 \n\n\n\n  周澤看見面前的這個年輕白大褂他的手在顫抖，\n\n\n\n  臉上也露出了驚恐的表情，\n\n\n\n  扭過頭，\n\n\n\n  看向身後的那個巨大保險柜…………",

    "content": "一輛凱迪拉克停在了書店門口，現在還是凌晨，所以在白天熙熙攘攘的南大街現在依舊很是冷清。\n\n\n\n  從車上下來一個女人，穿著百合裙，黑色的絲襪，再加上她那吹彈可破的細膩皮膚和年輕的容顏，完美地演繹著什麼叫做青春與性感的和諧統一。\n\n\n\n  舔了舔嘴唇，女人沒急著進去，而是看著書店兩側的牌坊，一邊是「姑妄聽之」，一邊是「如是我聞」。\n\n\n\n  我就隨便說說那些道聽途說的故事，您就隨便聽聽千萬別較真也千萬別往心裡去。\n\n\n\n  撲面而來的，是一股子鹹魚一般的氣息。\n\n\n\n  如果是那種王侯將相級別的，退休之後在家門口掛這個，會給人一種看盡世間滄桑返璞歸真的感覺；\n\n\n\n  但女人清楚，這家書店的老闆，本就有著一種鹹魚氣質，說難聽點，就是有點不上進，整天想著的是得過且過。\n\n\n\n  就如同普通人如果看見地上有一張一百美元故意裝作看不見不撿會被人當作打腫臉充胖子的典型，而如果是比爾蓋茨不撿的話往往能因此衍生出很多寓意深刻的道理一樣吧。\n\n\n\n  走到店門口，門是被鎖著的，對於一家平時只在深夜開門正式營業的書店來說，這個時候居然鎖著門本身就意味著一種不尋常。\n\n\n\n  女人手指輕輕一動，\n\n\n\n  「咔嚓……」 \n\n\n\n  裡面的鎖自己打開，\n\n\n\n  推開門，\n\n\n\n  走了進去。\n\n\n\n  女人閉上眼，露出了一種極為享受的神色。\n\n\n\n  要知道，\n\n\n\n  此時書屋裡頭很多地方都結了霜，尤其是靠近地面的位置，還有白氣繚繞，就像是夏天環繞著冰棍兒邊緣的那種白氣，可不是乾冰形成的效果。\n\n\n\n  一開始，是舒服的，但慢慢的，就是連女人都有些受不了了，他看了看沙發座位上一動不動的一男一女，還是選擇退了出去。\n\n\n\n  然後拿出手機，撥打了一個號碼。\n\n\n\n  很快，\n\n\n\n  裹著棉軍大衣的老道一邊打著哆嗦一邊醒著鼻涕從樓上跑了下來，尤其是在經過自家老闆身邊時，他清楚地感覺到自己下面的那疙瘩更是被凍縮成了一個硬核桃。\n\n\n\n  老道沒敢耽擱，馬上跑到了店外，然後脫下了軍大衣。\n\n\n\n  夏天的晚上也是帶著悶熱的，而現在老道則是很享受這種悶熱，恨不得再熱一點才好。\n\n\n\n  左顧右盼，老道看見了那輛凱迪拉克，然後湊近了過去，看見了靠在車門上拿著手機的女人。\n\n\n\n  女人很年輕，年紀可能就比書屋裡的白鶯鶯大上一點點。\n\n \n\n  「喲，您來啦！」\n\n\n\n  老道臉上馬上露出了討好之色，當然，還有再見故人的喜悅。\n\n\n\n  來人不是別人，正是唐詩。\n\n\n\n  唐詩看了看鼻子都凍紅了的老道，有些莞爾，道：\n\n\n\n  「有人在夢裡黃泉上看見了你現在的老闆，他就讓我來看看，看來，問題還挺嚴重的。」\n\n\n\n  「額，老闆他怎麼樣？」老道問道。\n\n\n\n  唐詩嘆了口氣，伸手指了指自己的眼睛，然後沉默不語。\n\n\n\n  老道也嘆了口氣，沒有再問下去，隨即他向身後的書屋看了看，道：「要我去叫醒他麼？」\n\n\n\n  「叫醒了也沒用，這件事沒那麼簡單，說不定會鬧出什麼亂子，先和我說說具體是怎麼回事，出來時他也沒和我說清楚，只讓我過來看看。」\n\n\n\n  「行，要不進去喝杯茶我們…………」\n\n\n\n  老道說著說著又看了看身後的「冰雪奇緣」主題書屋，\n\n\n\n  然後搖搖頭，道：\n\n\n\n  「算了，咱還是坐馬路牙子上說吧。」\n\n\n\n  ……………………\n\n\n\n  天亮的時候，警局後面已經傳來了機械的轟鳴聲，新批的一塊地，用來改建成地下停車場，因為趕工期，所以施工隊大早上地就開始施工了。 \n\n\n\n  張燕豐剛剛睡醒，正打著呵欠，平時工作忙，在辦公室睡覺其實也是一種家常便飯。\n\n\n\n  昨晚從書店回來後，他就坐在辦公室里一根煙接著一根煙抽著，然後不知不覺就趴在桌上睡著了。\n\n\n\n  他做了一個夢，\n\n\n\n  夢見在公園長椅上，自己跟周澤兩個人面對面地坐著，兩個人在聊什麼話題他已經忘記了，只記得他看見自己腿上和周澤腿上都有一根鏽跡斑斑的鎖鏈。\n\n\n\n  醒來後第一件事是去洗漱，刷了牙，洗了臉，張燕豐感覺自己的頭腦終於清醒了一些。\n\n\n\n  剛拿著洗漱用品準備回辦公室開始今天的工作，迎面就走來兩個年輕警察，兩個人在熱火朝天地討論著什麼，在拐角和張燕豐撞了個滿懷。\n\n\n\n  「聊什麼呢？這麼投入。」\n\n\n\n  張燕豐倒是沒生氣，一個習慣在辦公室睡覺的離異中年男，也不可能有什麼架子。\n\n\n\n  「張隊，不好意思，我們在聊剛剛後面施工隊挖出的東西，像是牌位什麼的，還有一些陶器。」一名年輕警察回答道。\n\n\n\n  「什麼？」\n\n\n\n  張燕豐馬上把自己手中的東西塞給旁邊的年輕警察，然後直接衝下了辦公樓向著後面的施工區域跑過去。\n\n\n\n  他沒想到周澤的速度這麼快，昨晚自己才跟他說施工隊的事情，今早他就能安排下去讓人故意往下深挖看看。 \n\n\n\n  張警官是誤會周老闆了，\n\n\n\n  在他離開後不久周老闆就已經進入睡眠狀態了，根本沒來得及把這件事吩咐下去交給老道或者許清朗去安排。\n\n\n\n  就算去安排了，也不可能這麼快見效，疏通感情打通關節就算最簡單粗暴的恐嚇也不可能這麼快的。\n\n\n\n  這只能說是趕巧了，\n\n\n\n  趕巧是修建地下停車場，本來需要往下開挖的深度就挺大，又正好蒙對了位置，挖出了一些東西。\n\n\n\n  張燕豐跑到施工場地這邊時，發現這裡也有不少警察在看熱鬧，好在警察局範圍內，吃瓜群眾進不來，所以場面還是很安穩。\n\n\n\n  其實，也不怪大家好這一口熱鬧，施工挖出什麼東西在全國各地都不算新鮮事兒了。\n\n\n\n  蓉城前陣子翻修一個體育館，結果發現草坪下面居然有一個古墓，再聯想一下體育館經常被拿來開演唱會，這才是真正意義上的「墳頭蹦迪」。\n\n\n\n  但通城不是蓉城，雖說有著「中國近代第一城」的美譽，但你真要說地下的東西，還真的跟蓉城或者西安那邊的沒辦法比，這個熱鬧，對於通城人民來說，是真的新鮮。\n\n\n\n  「挖出什麼東西了？」\n\n\n\n  張燕豐問旁邊的一個警察。\n\n\n\n  「挖出來的都收集到這裡了。」這是另外一個部門的警員，當下指了指旁邊的一片白布上放著的東西，「都是些零零碎碎的小玩意兒，而且我看了，好像也沒什麼古董的樣子，有點像是近代的東西。 \n\n\n\n  不過為了保險起見，我已經讓他們先暫停施工了，剛打電話給局領導匯報了一下，局領導說先溝通文物局的同志來看一看。」\n\n\n\n  警局裡能人不少，這位前不久剛在協助調查一起古董走私的案件，也是有眼力見兒的。\n\n\n\n  張燕豐看了看白布上的東西，發現大部分是一些陶瓷，做成的小動物的樣子，還有一些牌位，但也不像是給人用的，很小巧，很迷你。\n\n\n\n  「嘖嘖，民國時候的物件兒，這個造型小鬼子喜歡，以前不少日本人家裡給小孩買玩具就買這個。」\n\n\n\n  張燕豐抬起頭，\n\n\n\n  看見對面一樣蹲著的老道，\n\n\n\n  在老道身邊還站著一個妙齡少女，穿著很惹火。\n\n\n\n  張燕豐是認得老道的，當下對老道點點頭，他誤以為老道是周澤派過來的人。\n\n\n\n  「這上面寫的是什麼？」\n\n\n\n  張燕豐指著牌位上的日文說道。\n\n\n\n  老道卡殼了，他是見多識廣，但是真碰到專業的東西，他也是跟一竅不通差不多。\n\n\n\n  倒是旁邊的唐詩此時也蹲了下來，伸手去碰那些牌位。\n\n\n\n  旁邊一位警察下意識地想要制止她，但被張燕豐勸退下去。\n\n\n\n  「祭祀用的，祭奠小動物的。」唐詩說道，「這布條上還有字，上面日文的意思是祭奠這些為了大日本帝國獻身的小動物們，希望他們能沐浴天照大神的光輝云云。」 \n\n\n\n  老道有些意外地瞅了一眼唐詩，「你懂日文？」\n\n\n\n  而且這不光是懂日文了，分明對日本文化也很了解。\n\n\n\n  唐詩沒理睬老道的疑惑，拍了拍手，又站了起來。\n\n\n\n  張燕豐則是想到昨晚周澤對自己說的話，他說這下面很可能是一個集中營，集中營是什麼意思只要稍微熟悉點二戰歷史的人應該都清楚。\n\n\n\n  所以他當即對著唐詩說道：\n\n\n\n  「這些都是日本人拿來祭奠在實驗中死去的小動物的對吧？」\n\n\n\n  唐詩點點頭。\n\n\n\n  「那接下來繼續挖掘的話，是不是會發現給人的牌位以及骨灰盒之類的？」\n\n\n\n  侵華戰爭時期日軍在華進行過人體細菌實驗本就是路人皆知的事情，張燕豐現在這麼問，也是在為接下來的後續工作安排做準備，這些東西肯定要妥善處置，畢竟都是苦難人，而且是同胞。\n\n\n\n  唐詩搖搖頭，「不會有的。」\n\n\n\n  「為什麼？」張燕豐問道。\n\n\n\n  「731遺址整理時，發現過日本人給那些實驗室中小動物設置的祭奠場所和設施，但那些死在實驗室里被當作活體標本的人，他們別說牌位了或者祭奠供桌了，連骨灰都沒有保留下來。」\n\n\n\n  「為啥？」老道問道。\n\n\n\n  「因為在日本人眼裡，當時的中國人連畜生都不如。」",

    "content": "夢和現實到底有多少區別，\n\n\n\n  可以說很大，\n\n\n\n  但也可以說是一線之隔。\n\n\n\n  莊生曉夢中庄子曾提出過一個哲學問題，如果夢足夠真實的話，人是否還有能力去意識到自己是在做夢？\n\n\n\n  此時的周澤就有這種感覺，原本的他，可能只是一種借住的視角，被拖入這個夢之後，他一直把自己當作一個看客。\n\n\n\n  無非是看一場更寫實互動性更大的電影罷了。\n\n\n\n  但隨著夢的深入，周老闆也慢慢地被代入其中，開始感受到夢裡人物的喜怒哀樂，觸摸到屬於他們的情緒。\n\n\n\n  明明是一個將活人當作「馬路大」的人體實驗室，活人在這裡就是最不值錢的材料，每天都會被消耗。\n\n\n\n  但是在牢房內，腳鏈卻被謊言營造成大家都積極渴求的東西，周澤不清楚腳鏈所具體代表什麼含意，但可能只是一個藉口，其實不難猜。\n\n\n\n  比如，交換戰俘，又比如，每天固定釋放犯人獲得自由，作為主宰著這裡的掌管者，他們有太多的辦法去給自己手底下的羔羊營造出一個又一個的美夢，給予他們繼續堅強地在惡劣環境中活下去的希望。\n\n\n\n  這一點點的希望，每天能夠看得見的「希望」，就能夠讓大部分人頑強地克服艱苦生活條件帶來的摧殘，讓他們儘可能地保留下來，然後被拿來當作試驗品。 \n\n\n\n  周澤一直忘不了那個丈夫在爭搶得頭破血流之後，拿到了腳鏈給自己懷孕妻子銬上的情景；\n\n\n\n  在那個丈夫看來，自己已經做到了能做的極致，他放棄了自己離開的機會，把這個機會給了自己的妻子，給了妻子肚子裡自己的孩子。\n\n\n\n  然而，她的妻子剛剛極為痛苦扭曲地死在了手術台上，而他的孩子則是被掏出來，繼續了實驗，換來了那些白大褂嘴裡一聲驚嘆的\n\n\n\n  「喲西」。\n\n\n\n  每一個實驗室都在做著屬於他們自己的項目，嬰兒細菌實驗，肢體續接實驗，甚至人畜雜交實驗等等以一個現代人視角來看幾乎就是天方夜譚狗屁不通的實驗，在這裡卻在沒日沒夜地進行著。\n\n\n\n  不是這裡的日本人中二和異想天開，也不是他們真的沒有足夠的專業素養，而是因為他們的活體標本原材料實在是太過充足，且源源不斷，所以他們可以儘可能地自由自在地去實驗和嘗試那些猶如天方夜譚一般的設想和概念。\n\n\n\n  畢竟對於他們來說，最不值錢的，就是成本，最不缺的，也是成本。\n\n\n\n  周澤去過地獄，見過黃泉路，看過彼岸花，但說心裡話，在這個夢裡，在這個地方，他似乎才算是見識到了什麼才叫真正的「地獄」。\n\n\n\n  代入感，其實就是這麼來的，一點一滴地堆砌，慢慢地浸潤。 \n\n\n\n  也因此，\n\n\n\n  當那個巨大且插著金屬管子的保險柜內部發出那一聲轟鳴之後，\n\n\n\n  周澤的目光再度看向了那個地方，\n\n\n\n  那個他一開始就注意到的地方。\n\n\n\n  原本，他以為那裡是血庫，因為他見過白大褂從裡面抽取血液，注射進孕婦身上的包括注射進自己體內的血液，其實都是從保險柜外的金屬管子裡嫁接出來的。\n\n\n\n  年輕的白大褂此時無比的失魂落魄，嚇得都在哆嗦，嘴裡嘰里咕嚕地不知道在說些什麼，反正周澤也聽不懂。\n\n\n\n  而這個時候，也不知道是白大褂的呼喊聲還是保險柜的那一記悶響，總之，越來越多的白大褂開始聚集到這個實驗室。\n\n\n\n  大部分人臉上都帶著驚恐之色，似乎對著保險柜內的東西，他們有著一種天然的敬畏，但也有幾個頭髮花白的老東西，則是充滿著激動和躍躍欲試。\n\n\n\n  周澤這個試驗品反而在此時被忽略了，周澤覺得自己好像剛剛才破了一個小記錄，但這會兒好像沒人注意到自己。\n\n\n\n  幾個年紀最大或者說是地位最高的白大褂開始了激烈的爭吵，他們吵得面紅耳赤，誰都不願意退後一步。\n\n\n\n  聽著自己聽不懂的語言不停地喧囂，周澤覺得自己頭都有些大了。\n\n\n\n  而這時，那個之前牽著周澤爬行的年輕白大褂走到一個年紀大的身邊，指了指周澤說了些什麼，年長者不耐煩地揮揮手，好像是在說這個時候你拿這種小事打擾我真是沒眼力見兒。 \n\n\n\n  年輕白大褂不停地「哈伊」「哈伊」，表情恭敬誠懇地接受批評。\n\n\n\n  然後走過來，拉扯起周澤出了這間實驗室。\n\n\n\n  興許，\n\n\n\n  是他們暫時沒功夫料理自己吧，而自己身上也確實有了實驗的小突破，所以留著自己還有點用，周澤在心裡這樣想著。\n\n\n\n  年輕白大褂沒把周澤送回牢房，顯然也是不可能被送入牢房的，因為周澤見識過了腳鏈真正的意義，對於這些白大褂來說，他們更希望自己的「馬路大」們更堅強地活著給予他們實驗所用。\n\n\n\n  周澤被推入到了一個空間稍微大一點的房間裡，這裡有半個籃球場大小，年輕白大褂把周澤用細鐵鏈捆綁在一個鐵架子邊，然後對著裡面的幾個正在工作的白大褂交談了幾句，隨後就又馬不停蹄跑回原實驗室去了。\n\n\n\n  周澤就坐在這邊上，一開始，他還在思索，思索剛剛發生的悶響思索著那台保險柜，但很快，周澤的注意力就被自己現在所在的這個房間所吸引了。\n\n\n\n  房間有一個金屬加玻璃的巨大容器，透過部分玻璃，可以看見裡面的情況。\n\n\n\n  裡面有一個女人還有一個女孩，她們似乎是一對母女，因為小女孩依偎在女人身邊，女人則是用手撫摸著女孩的頭在安慰著她。\n\n\n\n  外面的幾個白大褂有一個拿著相機，有一個拿著計時器和寫著什麼數據報告，還有兩個則是站在容器旁邊的一個類似鼓風機一樣的東西旁邊開始運作機器。 \n\n\n\n  一開始，\n\n\n\n  周澤並不清楚這是一種什麼實驗，\n\n\n\n  慢慢地，\n\n\n\n  他看懂了，\n\n\n\n  因為實驗的原理很簡單，他們在不斷地抽出容器內的空氣，有一個儀錶盤上就是顯示著容器內的實時壓強。\n\n\n\n  隨著空氣地不斷被抽出，\n\n\n\n  周澤看見容器內的母女全都趴在了地上，表情無比的痛苦。\n\n\n\n  小女孩脫離了母親的掌控，爬到了容器邊緣，對著外面不停地拍打著容器，但是她的叫喊和哭泣得不到絲毫的反應；\n\n\n\n  四周的白大褂們都在做著自己手頭上的工作，有條不紊，極為熟練。\n\n\n\n  最後，\n\n\n\n  小女孩看向了被綁在角落裡的周澤，\n\n\n\n  她在向周澤求救，\n\n\n\n  她並沒能分辨出來，\n\n\n\n  其實周澤也是他們之中的一員，根本救不了她，或許，這就是小孩的天真吧，而她的母親，可能早就預感到了結局，反而顯得有些平靜。\n\n\n\n  周澤看著容器內的女孩，\n\n\n\n  容器內的女孩也在看著他，\n\n\n\n  兩雙眼眸，就這樣對視著。\n\n\n\n  周澤想做點什麼，但他掙脫不開繩索，他已經在嘗試，已經在努力了，這就意味著其實在不知不覺間，周澤已經忘記了自己只是一個看電影的觀眾，忘記了自己只是一個看客的身份，他代入到了其中，他想要做些什麼，他想要阻止眼前即將發生的一切。 \n\n\n\n  其實，是想阻止……已經發生的事情。\n\n\n\n  原本，再堅固的鎖鏈在自己指甲面前都像是紙糊的一樣，但現在，他卻根本奈何不得。\n\n\n\n  隨著空氣不斷被抽出去，小女孩體內的器官開始從眼睛、嘴巴甚至是**位置開始不停地往外擠壓，凡是身上有孔的地方，都成了體內器官往外溢出的出口。\n\n\n\n  周身的血管隆起，像是一條條密布在身上的蚯蚓。\n\n\n\n  臉脹得像是巨大的海綿，眼球鼓鼓的，卻依舊在死死地盯著周澤，或許，這是她最後的求生本能使然。\n\n\n\n  周澤不停地在掙扎著，希望掙脫這個鐵鏈，不時地發出「咔嚓咔嚓」的摩擦聲，但這種掙扎，顯得有些無濟於事。\n\n\n\n  女孩的身體被慢慢地壓縮和拉長，\n\n\n\n  同時，\n\n\n\n  體內的腸子開始從眼睛和嘴巴里不斷地「出來」，像是一根根活著的東西，自己在鑽出來。\n\n\n\n  這個畫面，\n\n\n\n  讓人頭皮發麻。\n\n\n\n  就像是你走路，不小心踩死了一隻蚯蚓，蚯蚓體內的那些黃的白的一股腦的迸濺了出來，但面前的這是人。\n\n\n\n  你能感觸到她的喜怒哀樂，\n\n\n\n  能感觸到她的痛苦， \n\n\n\n  以及，\n\n\n\n  她的絕望。\n\n\n\n  「吧唧…………」\n\n\n\n  女孩的眼珠像是炸裂了，\n\n\n\n  又像是彈了出來，\n\n\n\n  而後她的身體一陣抽搐之後，\n\n\n\n  頹然地倒在了地上，\n\n\n\n  她終於不再和周澤對視了。\n\n\n\n  但哪怕是死了，\n\n\n\n  她體內的腸子和其他器官還是在不停地被氣壓壓縮出來，那邊負責抽空氣的白大褂們還在繼續工作著。\n\n\n\n  等到空氣抽到極限之後，\n\n\n\n  拍好照片，做好數據記錄，\n\n\n\n  幾個白大褂發出了一聲歡呼，\n\n\n\n  像是到點了，工人下班了，他們可以回宿舍休息去了，誰誰誰手上可能還有慰安所的票，可以去放鬆一下。\n\n\n\n  一個白大褂看見了還在那裡機械麻木地抽動鐵鏈的周澤，\n\n\n\n  指著周澤大笑著，另外幾個同伴也跟著一起笑了起來。\n\n\n\n  周澤是別的實驗室「暫時」放在這裡的，他們當然不會把周澤給一樣送進容器里去，而且，他們今天實驗項目和數據已經完成，可以「下班」休息了。\n\n\n\n  聽到了笑聲， \n\n\n\n  周澤有些茫然地抬起頭，\n\n\n\n  看向前面的這幾個白大褂，\n\n\n\n  只是他抽動捆綁鐵鏈的動作，卻沒有停。\n\n\n\n  知道沒用，\n\n\n\n  畢竟這是夢，\n\n\n\n  再真實，\n\n\n\n  也只是夢，\n\n\n\n  但眼下，似乎只有這個動作，能讓周澤覺得自己好像是在做些什麼，\n\n\n\n  或許，\n\n\n\n  這可以麻痹一下自己。\n\n\n\n  「咔嚓…………咔嚓…………」\n\n\n\n  周澤還在繼續抽動著鐵鏈。\n\n\n\n  旁邊的幾個白大褂還在笑著。\n\n\n\n  「咔嚓…………咔嚓…………」\n\n\n\n  周澤腦海中又浮現出了最後小女孩盯著自己的畫面，\n\n\n\n  她的眼睛，\n\n\n\n  原本清澈可愛，\n\n\n\n  到最後「吧唧」一聲，\n\n\n\n  沒了。\n\n\n\n  嘶…………\n\n\n\n  心，\n\n\n\n  忽然好疼，\n\n\n\n  好久沒有再體驗到心疼的感覺了，尤其是在自己沒了心之後。 \n\n\n\n  強忍著胸口的不適感，\n\n\n\n  周澤繼續抽動著鐵鏈。\n\n\n\n  「哐當！」\n\n\n\n  一聲悶響從另外的實驗室傳出！\n\n\n\n  之前周澤所待的第一個實驗室里，幾個白大褂還在爭吵著，附近一群白大褂恭敬地站在旁邊等待著他們爭吵的結果。\n\n\n\n  忽然間，\n\n\n\n  保險柜的門再度從裡面被撞擊了一下！\n\n\n\n  在場所有白大褂都愣住了，\n\n\n\n  一起以一種驚駭莫名地目光看著面前這個巨大的保險柜。\n\n\n\n  「咔嚓…………」周澤繼續抽動。\n\n\n\n  「哐當！！！」保險柜的撞擊聲再度傳來。\n\n\n\n  「咔嚓…………」\n\n\n\n  「哐當！！！」\n\n\n\n  「咔嚓…………」\n\n\n\n  「哐當！！！」\n\n\n\n  聲音越來越大，\n\n\n\n  響徹整個研究所，\n\n\n\n  保險柜所在實驗室里的所有白大褂們有的都嚇得直接蹲在了地上，其他實驗室里聽到這個動靜的工作人員也一個個都疑惑不解，紛紛放下手頭的工作走出來想查看一下情況。\n\n\n\n  唯有周澤現在所在的這個實驗室里的這幾個白大褂， \n\n\n\n  正在以一種看怪物的目光看著周澤，\n\n\n\n  臉上寫滿了恐懼，\n\n\n\n  因為他們驚訝地發現，\n\n\n\n  周澤每次抽動鐵鏈的頻率，\n\n\n\n  和那巨大悶響發出的頻率，\n\n\n\n  一模一樣！",

\n\n\n\n  一幅幅畫面，\n\n\n\n  不停地在周澤腦海中閃現，\n\n\n\n  像是在放幻燈片一樣。\n\n\n\n  周澤的呼吸，開始越來越慢，他的動作，也越來越慢，但依然強勁有力。\n\n\n\n  每一次的抽動，都伴隨著手腕位置血肉的進一步模糊，\n\n\n\n  那種刺痛感，那種撕裂感，\n\n\n\n  在此時卻顯得那麼的無所謂。\n\n\n\n  實驗室檯面上，\n\n\n\n  躺著的身體扭曲青筋畢露的孕婦女屍，\n\n\n\n  被托舉在掌心裡依舊痛苦掙扎的嬰兒，\n\n\n\n  五個擔架台上肚子都被剖開的母親，\n\n\n\n  被強迫和動物雜交研究血統的男男女女，\n\n\n\n  雙手冰凍了不知多久拿榔頭敲擊一下就直接粉碎脫落卻一臉麻木的女人，\n\n\n\n  包括，\n\n\n\n  此時依舊躺在密封容器里還沒有來得及收拾的母女。\n\n\n\n  這個旁觀者，\n\n\n\n  真的旁觀不下去了，\n\n\n\n  那股子之前還能故意不當一回事兒給自己心理慰藉的理由，在此時也完全失去了效果。\n\n\n\n  憤怒， \n\n\n\n  壓抑，\n\n\n\n  悲痛，\n\n\n\n  在此時化作了周澤沙啞嗓音里的一聲聲怒吼！\n\n\n\n  「啊！！！！」\n\n\n\n  周澤歇斯底里地嘶喊著，\n\n\n\n  他的手臂開始更加瘋狂地不停地抽動，\n\n\n\n  他要掙脫這一切，\n\n\n\n  他要掙脫這條鎖住自己手臂的鎖鏈，\n\n\n\n  他要衝過去，\n\n\n\n  把面前這幫穿著白大褂卻行著禽獸豬狗之事的混蛋們一個個撕碎，\n\n\n\n  他要生吞活剝了他們，\n\n\n\n  他要喝他們的血，\n\n\n\n  他要吃他們的肉，\n\n\n\n  他要將他們的亡魂給拘出來，\n\n\n\n  不給他們下黃泉進地獄的機會，\n\n\n\n  他要沒日沒夜地讓他們接受折磨，\n\n\n\n  讓他們承受無邊的痛苦！\n\n\n\n  你們把這一切當作兒戲，\n\n\n\n  你們把這裡當作屬於自己的遊樂場，\n\n\n\n  你們把活生生的人命當作「馬路大」，當作剝了皮的圓木，\n\n\n\n  你們覺得你們是主宰，\n\n\n\n  你們覺得你們是行走在人間的惡魔， \n\n\n\n  你們覺得自己掌控一切，控人生死！\n\n\n\n  好，\n\n\n\n  那我今天就要讓你們看看，\n\n\n\n  到底真正的魔鬼，\n\n\n\n  是個什麼樣子！\n\n\n\n  從地獄裡爬出來，\n\n\n\n  從黃泉路上走回，\n\n\n\n  從幽冥潭中浮出，\n\n\n\n  我要讓你們見識什麼才是真正的恐懼，\n\n\n\n  我要把你們施加給其他人的折磨和痛苦……\n\n\n\n  十倍，\n\n\n\n  百倍，\n\n\n\n  千倍，\n\n\n\n  萬倍地，\n\n\n\n  還給你們！\n\n\n\n  「啊啊啊啊啊！！！！！！！」\n\n\n\n  嘶吼仍然在繼續，\n\n\n\n  無聲的吶喊在心中咆哮，\n\n\n\n  周澤大笑著，\n\n\n\n  面容扭曲著，\n\n\n\n  「咔嚓！咔嚓！咔嚓！咔嚓！！！！！！！！！！」\n\n\n\n  手臂抽動鐵鏈的頻率開始越來越快，\n\n\n\n  越來越快，\n\n\n\n  快得讓人覺得誇張。 \n\n\n\n  在這幾個白大褂眼裡，\n\n\n\n  此時的周澤就像是一頭渴望脫困到不惜一切的野獸，\n\n\n\n  哪怕是自殘，\n\n\n\n  也要掙脫鐵鏈的束縛，\n\n\n\n  擇人而噬！\n\n\n\n  ………………\n\n\n\n  「哐當！」\n\n\n\n  「哐當！」\n\n\n\n  「哐當！」\n\n\n\n  保險柜里的撞擊聲不斷地傳來，這個實驗室里將近十個白大褂此時都是一臉的凝重，不堪者，更是跪伏在了地上，就差磕頭了。\n\n\n\n  他們知道這裡頭裝的是什麼，也就明白這裡頭的東西忽然開始撞擊保險柜究竟是一件多麼驚悚的事情。\n\n\n\n  是的，\n\n\n\n  他們也是知道驚悚的，\n\n\n\n  哪怕他們平日裡都雙手沾滿血腥，哪怕他們各個都是屠夫，是劊子手，但他們依然會有害怕和畏懼的情緒出現。\n\n\n\n  之前爭吵最激烈的一名老年白大褂此時忽然主動向前撲了過去，他竟然抱住了保險柜的門閂，神情地摩挲著，像是一個男子見到了自己的初戀情人。\n\n\n\n  他很激動，\n\n\n\n  他很忘我，\n\n\n\n  他在大聲地用日語說著什麼， \n\n\n\n  像是在演講，\n\n\n\n  又像是在歌頌，\n\n\n\n  他這個行為，顯得很是瘋狂，顯得很讓人難以理解。\n\n\n\n  但這裡是變態的巢穴，是「惡魔」的寄居所，在這裡生活和「工作」的相關人員，都不能以尋常意義上的人去衡量。\n\n\n\n  在老人激動萬分地演說之下，\n\n\n\n  周圍有不少白大褂臉上也露出了憧憬和激動之色，他們開始擁抱，他們開始喜極而泣，他們開始歡呼，他們開始雀躍。\n\n\n\n  日本人的人體細菌實驗研究已經進行了很久了，但他們真正有用的發現，能對前方戰局起到些許作用的發明，也就是在細菌戰實驗中所意外發現的野外飲用水過濾處理的方法。\n\n\n\n  這個方法，也確實幫助了在東南亞作戰的日軍減少了一些因為飲水問題所帶來的瘧疾等疾病問題，除此之外，縱觀整個人體實驗研究始終，都沒有第二件值得一用的發現和成果。\n\n\n\n  雖然原材料獲取簡單，也方便，更是極為「廉價」，但日本軍方在這一個個的研究所里，也傾注了大量的資源，遲遲不出效果，無法真的支援大日本帝國的擴張和作戰，他們這些研究人員的壓力，也是格外的大。\n\n\n\n  而此刻，\n\n\n\n  保險柜里的撞擊聲，讓他們看見了希望的曙光，看見了自己成功的希望，在這個保險柜里，存放著的東西， \n\n\n\n  居然活了過來！\n\n\n\n  這是奇蹟，\n\n\n\n  是天皇陛下護佑下的奇蹟，\n\n\n\n  是天照大神賜予大和民族的輝煌，\n\n\n\n  是整個大日本帝國的明天！\n\n\n\n  撞擊聲不斷地發出，\n\n\n\n  保險柜也隨之開始抖動，\n\n\n\n  但這個保險柜太粗也太厚重了，也因此，裡面的東西哪怕不停地撞擊著，卻依然沒辦法出來。\n\n\n\n  研究所里其他實驗室的白大褂們也都被這巨大的動靜所吸引，紛紛放下了手頭上的實驗，走過來看看情況。\n\n\n\n  有的實驗室實驗還在繼續，但白大褂卻走了，他們不在乎這次實驗數據是否會作廢，反正活體標本不缺，這次沒做好，再做一次就行了。\n\n\n\n  漸漸的，\n\n\n\n  那個有著保險柜的實驗室里里外外，站了七八十個工作人員，他們都在往裡面看著，不停地交流著。\n\n\n\n  那個抱著保險柜很是激動的老者，他的話語很有煽動性，漸漸的，越來越多的白大褂開始應和起來，他們激動，他們瘋狂，他們開心地大笑。\n\n\n\n  有人開始唱起了日本軍歌，\n\n\n\n  這種氛圍開始傳染，\n\n\n\n  那個抱著保險柜的老者也高唱起來， \n\n\n\n  慢慢的，所有人都似乎投入到了這種情緒感之中，\n\n\n\n  「嘹亮鏗鏘」的軍歌在這裡形成了大合唱，\n\n\n\n  他們甚至熱淚盈眶，\n\n\n\n  覺得自己的「辛苦」沒有白費，\n\n\n\n  覺得自己的「付出」也沒有被辜負，\n\n\n\n  他們在慶祝，他們在高歌，他們覺得自己是幸運的一批人，是見證大日本帝國即將徹底崛起的「先驅」。\n\n\n\n  可能，\n\n\n\n  只有和周澤在一個實驗室的那四個白大褂才最清楚這件事是怎麼一回事，\n\n\n\n  當那個最中心的實驗室里在伴隨著保險柜不停地撞擊聲高歌時，\n\n\n\n  這個實驗室里的四個白大褂只覺得內心一片森寒，\n\n\n\n  周澤每次抽動鎖鏈，\n\n\n\n  遠處保險柜就同時發出一聲巨大的「悶響」，\n\n\n\n  他們清楚，\n\n\n\n  是這個男人，\n\n\n\n  是這個馬路大，\n\n\n\n  他引起的震動，\n\n\n\n  引起的反應！\n\n\n\n  而周澤的瘋狂仍然在繼續，\n\n\n\n  他瘋狂地抽動，\n\n\n\n  歇斯底里， \n\n\n\n  不顧一切，\n\n\n\n  他的血肉早就開始撕裂，\n\n\n\n  鮮血開始迸濺，\n\n\n\n  但他仍然沒有停止的意向！\n\n\n\n  尤其是在周澤聽到遠處傳來的歌聲時，\n\n\n\n  他那壓抑的情緒被徹底且完全地點燃！\n\n\n\n  你們，\n\n\n\n  還在唱歌！！！\n\n\n\n  「啊啊啊啊啊啊！！！！！！！！！」\n\n\n\n  「咔嚓！！！！！！！！！」\n\n\n\n  鐵鏈沒動，\n\n\n\n  但周澤卻獲得了自由，\n\n\n\n  因為在他的手腕位置，\n\n\n\n  竟然被硬生生地被他自己給扯斷了！\n\n\n\n  「哐當！」\n\n\n\n  與此同時，\n\n\n\n  在那個仍然在高歌的實驗室內，\n\n\n\n  原本看起來「固若金湯」的保險柜，\n\n\n\n  忽然裂開了一個洞，\n\n\n\n  一隻滿是傷痕白骨嶙峋的手，\n\n\n\n  從裡面探了出來。\n\n\n\n  歌聲，\n\n\n\n  也在此時，\n\n\n\n  戛然而止…………",

    "content": "堅固且巨大的保險柜，\n\n\n\n  就這樣很是突兀地破了一個洞，\n\n\n\n  四周的溫度，也開始迅速降低，\n\n\n\n  那隻白骨嶙峋的手，\n\n\n\n  距離之前一直抱著保險柜的老者白大褂只有不到兩分米的距離。\n\n\n\n  老者抬起頭，看著這隻白骨手，他的表情有些抽搐，似乎再也沒有之前演講時的衝勁和激情，他的下半身正在微微顫抖，如果不是身子撲在保險柜上勉強可以保持平衡，可能他現在已經癱軟在了地上。\n\n\n\n  因為他距離這隻手最近，\n\n\n\n  所以他的感觸也是最深，\n\n\n\n  尤其是在剛才，\n\n\n\n  他清楚地感知到之前還無比堅固足以抵擋很多次衝擊的保險柜好像在剎那間化作了軍隊食用的壓縮餅乾，變得那麼的不經事。\n\n\n\n  先前還在這裡齊唱軍歌的眾人，也集體噤聲，他們有些無措，也有些惶恐。\n\n\n\n  這是他們的研究所，平日裡，他們才是施加恐懼的那一方，現在身份的對調，讓他們一時間有些難以接受，\n\n\n\n  哦不，\n\n\n\n  不是無法接受，\n\n\n\n  是難以習慣。\n\n\n\n  「咔嚓…………咔嚓…………咔嚓…………」 \n\n\n\n  冰櫃的巨大門閂在此時慢慢地碎裂開去，\n\n\n\n  緊接著，\n\n\n\n  冰櫃的門緩緩地被推開，\n\n\n\n  老者的身體也落在了地上，他想要保持站立的姿勢，但還是癱軟在了地上，抬起頭，看著冰櫃裡的方向。\n\n\n\n  冰櫃中，\n\n\n\n  是一具屍體，\n\n\n\n  一具破損極為嚴重的屍體。\n\n\n\n  屍體的半邊頭顱已經消失不見，像是被整塊切除了一樣，傷口位置還格外地順滑，甚至還透著詭異的光澤。\n\n\n\n  半張臉下，僅存的一隻眼睛緊閉，沒有絲毫睜開的跡象，一條巨大的裂縫，從頭部一直綿延到了身下，像是在身體上曾開墾過一條溝渠。\n\n\n\n  其左胸位置，有一個巨大的缺口，可以從外面看向對面的那種貫穿傷，裡面的肋骨清晰可見。\n\n\n\n  屍體的四肢位置，一部分有皮肉覆蓋，一部分則是完全裸lu出來的白骨，透露著一種森寒。\n\n\n\n  這具屍體給人最深刻的感覺，就是他的骨骼，仿佛玉石一般，帶著一種通透圓潤，甚至能夠給人一種賞心悅目的感覺。\n\n\n\n  在場所有的白大褂都是活體實驗「研究者」，他們親自炮製了不知道多少次慘絕人寰的實驗，自然對人生命的極限在哪裡有著遠超常人的認知！ \n\n\n\n  這是一個死得不能再死的人，\n\n\n\n  他不可能還存活著，也沒有理由還能繼續存活著。\n\n\n\n  但是保險柜里只有他一個，\n\n\n\n  所以之前撞擊保險柜的，除了他還能是誰？\n\n\n\n  外加，\n\n\n\n  是他的手洞穿了這寬厚的保險柜，\n\n\n\n  就在眾人高歌的時候，\n\n\n\n  就在眾人最歡騰的時候，\n\n\n\n  他硬生生地眾人潑了一盆冷水，畫上了這首樂曲的休止符。\n\n\n\n  屍體一動不動地站在那裡，\n\n\n\n  保持著手臂半舉起的姿勢，\n\n\n\n  從保險柜的門緩緩打開後，\n\n\n\n  就沒有再動一下。\n\n\n\n  他安靜得像是一具藝術品，帶著美輪美奐的氣息，甚至，營造出了一種屬於斷臂維納斯那般的美感。\n\n\n\n  坐在地上，剛剛還驚魂未定的老者見此情景，又舉起了自己的雙臂，用日語高呼著什麼，他依舊興奮，依舊雀躍，也依舊樂觀。\n\n\n\n  或許，\n\n\n\n  每個團隊裡，都需要有他這樣子的人存在，才能一直維繫一個隊伍的精神狀態吧。\n\n\n\n  但這一次， \n\n\n\n  他還沒來得及感染附近的其他同僚，\n\n\n\n  原本一動不動的白骨手緩緩地落了下來，\n\n\n\n  像是覺得他太呱噪了一樣，\n\n\n\n  很自然地落下，\n\n\n\n  想要打斷他的喋喋不休，\n\n\n\n  又像是一個關懷喜歡你的長輩，\n\n\n\n  想，\n\n\n\n  摸摸你的頭。\n\n\n\n  這是愛的撫摸，\n\n\n\n  老者沒有怕，因為屍體的動作很慢，甚至你能感受到一種叫做溫柔的情緒。\n\n\n\n  老者更加地興奮了，\n\n\n\n  他越發地相信這是天照大神賜予大日本帝國的神跡，是帝國崛起稱霸的契機，而他，就是見證者和發現者，\n\n\n\n  他的名字，\n\n\n\n  日後註定將被銘刻在jing國神社最顯眼的位置上！\n\n\n\n  在這個地方，\n\n\n\n  從事這種研究，\n\n\n\n  可能一些人自己都沒有發現，\n\n\n\n  其實他們的內心和性格，也早就已經扭曲了。\n\n\n\n  就比如此時的老頭，\n\n\n\n  在度過了一開始的不能恐懼之後， \n\n\n\n  他的內心就被狂喜所取代。\n\n\n\n  附近的這些白大褂們沒有一個人尖叫，他們有恐懼，有害怕的，但沒人選擇離開，反而都站在原地，似乎都在等待著事態的進一步發展。\n\n\n\n  每個人的心底，都有那麼一點慶幸，也都有那麼一點期待，總覺得，如果上天要選擇眷顧一個人或者一批人的話，\n\n\n\n  很大可能就是自己了。\n\n\n\n  然後，\n\n\n\n  事態發展了，\n\n\n\n  白骨手輕輕地落在了老者的頭頂，\n\n\n\n  緊接著，\n\n\n\n  老者那張還洋溢著幸福喜悅笑容的臉，\n\n\n\n  在剎那間像是被澆了熱水的冰雕，\n\n\n\n  開始快速地融化。\n\n\n\n  他那褶皺的臉皮，\n\n\n\n  他那深陷的眼窩，\n\n\n\n  他那有些扁塌的鼻子，\n\n\n\n  他的頭髮，\n\n\n\n  他頭上的一切，\n\n\n\n  都在瞬間潰爛了下去，\n\n\n\n  幾乎就是眨眼之間，\n\n\n\n  老者的頭就變成了一具骷髏頭。\n\n\n\n  而這時，\n\n\n\n  直接體會到這種滋味的老者才來得及發出了痛苦的尖叫， \n\n\n\n  骷髏頭的嘴張得巨大，\n\n\n\n  但他已經無法發出聲音了，像是在做著無聲的嘶吼！\n\n\n\n  曾經有個日本軍官在回憶錄寫到，用武士刀快速砍下一個中國人的頭顱之後，短時間內，對方掉落在地上的頭顱，還能眨眼睛。\n\n\n\n  而這一次，\n\n\n\n  這一幕，\n\n\n\n  則是以一種更極端也是更直接的方式，\n\n\n\n  重置了這一個實驗！\n\n\n\n  無聲的嘶吼之後，老者的屍體頹然地倒下了一側。\n\n\n\n  實驗室內外聚集的這幫白大褂們這才開始亂了起來，開始瘋狂地往外逃跑，面對這種匪夷所思的畫面，他們的心神在頃刻間崩潰！\n\n\n\n  對帝國的虔誠，對天皇的忠誠，在這種匪夷所思的衝擊之下，仿佛一張紙，被瞬間捅了個稀巴爛！\n\n\n\n  魔鬼，\n\n\n\n  真正的魔鬼，\n\n\n\n  出現了！\n\n\n\n  …………\n\n\n\n  密閉容器內，\n\n\n\n  母女慘不忍睹的屍體還沒來得及處理，她們靜靜地躺在那裡。\n\n\n\n  周澤不清楚她們的亡魂還在不在，\n\n\n\n  會不會停留在這裡看著這一切。 \n\n\n\n  因為在此時，\n\n\n\n  周澤的視角，只是一個普通人。\n\n\n\n  斷了半截的手臂顯得有些空蕩蕩的，不是很協調，但周澤仍然堅定地向著前面四個白大褂走去。\n\n\n\n  在四個白大褂眼中，周澤就是一頭餓狼，一頭已經發了瘋的餓狼。\n\n\n\n  他們原本對馬路大沒有任何的畏懼，但周澤不同，那種自殘的氣魄已經足以驚人，外加其他人不清楚，但他們是清楚的，之前響徹整個研究所的轟鳴聲，其實是在響應著眼前這個男子抽動鎖鏈的頻率。\n\n\n\n  魔鬼，\n\n\n\n  被放出了牢籠，\n\n\n\n  降臨了人間，\n\n\n\n  但可笑的是，\n\n\n\n  魔鬼降臨之後的第一件事，\n\n\n\n  卻是在洗滌這裡的罪惡，\n\n\n\n  因為他發現這裡，\n\n\n\n  比他所應該待的地獄，\n\n\n\n  更像地獄。\n\n\n\n  警報聲在此時響起，從研究所的幾個入口位置，開始不斷有荷槍實彈的憲兵進入，他們的存在就是用以鎮壓研究所可能發生的暴、、、動。\n\n\n\n  只可惜，\n\n\n\n  接到命令的他們，並沒有被同時告知，這一次他們所鎮壓的不是所謂不聽話的馬路大，而是一頭剛剛脫離束縛的惡魔。 \n\n\n\n  一頭，\n\n\n\n  真正的魔鬼！\n\n\n\n  數名憲兵先進入到了這間實驗室，他們有些不解一個斷臂的馬路大為什麼能嚇得這四個研究人員步步後退不敢上前，但他們還是很職業地舉起了手中的槍，將槍口對準了周澤。\n\n\n\n  周澤停下了往前的腳步，\n\n\n\n  側過身，\n\n\n\n  再轉過頭，\n\n\n\n  看向了已經對準了自己的黑黢黢的槍口。\n\n\n\n  那四個白大褂幾乎是一起吼叫著什麼，像是在急不可耐地命令這些憲兵開槍，將這個讓他們打心底生寒的傢伙給槍決！\n\n\n\n  老實說，\n\n\n\n  無論是上輩子還是這輩子，\n\n\n\n  周澤好像還真的沒有面對過槍口，\n\n\n\n  尤其還是一排槍這麼大的場面。\n\n\n\n  明明自己現在只是一個普通人的身份，\n\n\n\n  明明自己剛剛連掙脫一個細細的鐵鏈都得用自殘的方式，\n\n\n\n  但不知道為什麼，\n\n\n\n  周澤現在，\n\n\n\n  卻是真的一點都不慌，\n\n\n\n  不光是不覺得慌，\n\n\n\n  反而覺得有些好笑。 \n\n\n\n  這種感覺，\n\n\n\n  很奇妙，\n\n\n\n  就如同一個大人，\n\n\n\n  看著一群五歲不到的小孩，拿著滋水槍指著自己，恐嚇著自己。\n\n\n\n  周澤甚至覺得他們，\n\n\n\n  有一點點的可愛。\n\n\n\n  周澤也不清楚自己的這種心態來自於哪裡，\n\n\n\n  也不明白為什麼自己會膨脹得這麼快這麼的沒有理由。\n\n\n\n  但就在這些憲兵即將扣動扳機的時刻，\n\n\n\n  在他們的身後，\n\n\n\n  出現了一道身影，\n\n\n\n  他像是鬼魅一樣忽然地出現，\n\n\n\n  沒有絲毫的預兆。\n\n\n\n  「啊啊啊啊！！！！！！！」\n\n\n\n  「啊啊啊！！！！！」\n\n\n\n  頃刻間，\n\n\n\n  這五名持槍的憲兵在發出慘叫聲之後，化作了乾屍倒在了地上，地上的他們，軍服顯得是那麼的寬厚和肥大。\n\n\n\n  那四個白大褂嚇得有的癱軟在了地上，有的靠著牆壁打哆嗦，有的直接蹲起來抱頭痛哭，嘴裡不停地用日語喊著：\n\n\n\n  「魔鬼！魔鬼！！！！」\n\n\n\n  在此刻，他們真切體會到自己做實驗室，那些實驗品看他們時的視角和感覺。 \n\n\n\n  周澤看著這個忽然出現的傢伙，\n\n\n\n  他那殘破得不能再殘破的身體，\n\n\n\n  他那隻剩下半張臉的頭顱以及那胸口空洞的位置。\n\n\n\n  對方原本緊閉的眼眸，在此時緩緩地睜開，眼眶深處，是令人心底膽寒的空洞。\n\n\n\n  但冥冥之中真的有一種感覺，\n\n\n\n  那就是他也在看著自己。\n\n\n\n  親切，\n\n\n\n  奇怪的親切，\n\n\n\n  那是一種血脈同步，不，是超越了血脈聯繫的共鳴！\n\n\n\n  不需要過多的介紹，甚至不需要太久的遲疑，\n\n\n\n  畢竟那種感覺，\n\n\n\n  實在是太過清晰，而且，肯定不會出錯！\n\n\n\n  周澤抿了抿嘴唇，\n\n\n\n  有些乾澀地道：\n\n\n\n  「你…………就是我？」\n\n\n\n  對方沒有回答，\n\n\n\n  只是繼續平靜地站在那裡，仿佛這個世界的任何存在，都沒辦法讓他提起絲毫的興趣，除了眼前的……周澤。\n\n\n\n  周澤咧開嘴，\n\n\n\n  笑了，\n\n\n\n  他終於明白， \n\n\n\n  那個實驗室中保險柜內的東西，\n\n\n\n  到底是什麼了，\n\n\n\n  居然…………\n\n\n\n  就是他自己！\n\n\n\n  那群喪心病狂追求瘋狂實驗的日本人，不知道以何種渠道也不知道從哪裡，發現了自己以前的屍體，將其當作標本儲存運送到了這裡，對其進行研究和分析。\n\n\n\n  甚至，\n\n\n\n  之前實驗室里年輕白大褂從保險柜哪裡抽出的血液，其實就是來自於自己的這具身體！\n\n\n\n  日本人，想以自己的身體為模板，\n\n\n\n  他們想…………造神！\n\n\n\n  怪不得自己無法脫離這個夢，怪不得哪怕夢醒來後自己也會被再度拖進來，怪不得這個夢如此的真實！\n\n\n\n  一切的原因，一切的因由，在此時，終於有了一個確切的答案！\n\n\n\n  因為在當年，在這個研究所里，\n\n\n\n  本就有自己！\n\n\n\n  在孩子還小的時候，\n\n\n\n  無論是家長還是老師，都會教你如何去和別人溝通和對話，\n\n\n\n  但應該沒人去教你，\n\n\n\n  該如何去跟你自己去對話，\n\n\n\n  而且不是想當然地「捫心自問」，文學誇張地形容和自己內心交流， \n\n\n\n  而是真正意義上的那種你面對著另一個你時，\n\n\n\n  到底該如何地去交流？\n\n\n\n  周澤現在也有些茫然，\n\n\n\n  而茫然導致了語塞，\n\n\n\n  他不知道該去說些什麼，\n\n\n\n  也不懂該去做些什麼。\n\n\n\n  但剎那間，\n\n\n\n  他忽然想到了一個很關鍵的事情，\n\n\n\n  那就是，\n\n\n\n  如果夢沒辦法改變，\n\n\n\n  如果夢是一個既定的事實，\n\n\n\n  如果夢只是一種記錄，是過去所發生的呈現！\n\n\n\n  那麼，\n\n\n\n  這是否意味著，\n\n\n\n  將近八十年前的這一刻，\n\n\n\n  自己的屍體，\n\n\n\n  確實甦醒了？\n\n\n\n  在這個研究所里，\n\n\n\n  甦醒了？\n\n\n\n  周澤扭過頭看了看密閉容器內的母女，她們，剛死沒多久，尤其是那個小女孩，就在自己面前，兩個人對視著，慢慢地被折磨致死。\n\n\n\n  周澤的聲音略微有些顫抖，\n\n\n\n  緩緩道： \n\n\n\n  「殺了他們…………所有人。」\n\n\n\n  那殘破的身影轉過身，\n\n\n\n  像是聽到了吩咐，\n\n\n\n  或者，\n\n\n\n  他只是遵從本心。\n\n\n\n  這裡，\n\n\n\n  不存在上下級的命令，\n\n\n\n  只是自己……在幫自己一個忙，自己在請求自己，自己在要求自己，\n\n\n\n  自己想做這件事，\n\n\n\n  然後，\n\n\n\n  「自己」就去做這件事。\n\n\n\n  周澤低下頭，他記起來之前這五名憲兵死時的畫面，他覺得這種快速乾脆的死法，\n\n\n\n  太簡單了，\n\n\n\n  也太便宜他們了，\n\n\n\n  最後，\n\n\n\n  在那殘破的身體走向角落裡的那四個白大褂時，\n\n\n\n  周澤又加了兩個字，給這次行動，打上了一個應有的基調，\n\n\n\n  那就是：\n\n\n\n  「虐…………殺………」",

    "content": "這裡，本就是「煉獄」，只不過現在，更多了一種叫做原汁原味的東西。\n\n\n\n  就像是一些國際大品牌的仿品，在質量上，差別真的很小很小，甚至有些仿品在質量上還強過真品，但真品在消費者眼中，就有著一種屬於他的氛圍，屬於他的純正。\n\n\n\n  眼下，\n\n\n\n  真正的惡魔降臨，\n\n\n\n  眾生平等，\n\n\n\n  於地獄面前，\n\n\n\n  集體，\n\n\n\n  顫抖！\n\n\n\n  各個實驗室里的器具在此時都發出了顫音，像是感應到了一種磁場和呼喚，之前的殺人利器和工具仿佛在此時都擁有了屬於自己的意識。\n\n\n\n  它們開始歡呼，它們開始活躍，它們更是有些迫不及待，等待著新一輪屬於惡魔的飽食。\n\n\n\n  有鎖鏈的摩擦聲，有手術刀和手術鉗的撞擊聲，有擔架車的「吱呀」作響，有門窗的「颯颯」，就連用於焚化屍體的焚化車間那邊，\n\n\n\n  也有骨灰，\n\n\n\n  亂飛。\n\n\n\n  一道道或高或低，或整齊或雜亂的聲響，在此時被完美地整合到了一起，形成了一種激昂的節奏，就像是貝多芬的《命運交響曲》，在此時緩緩地拉開序幕，走向了高……潮。\n\n\n\n  這是一種氣場，也是一種渲染，真正的陰森，真正的恐怖，有點像是桌台上的燭光，它不會給菜餚帶來任何味道上的改變， \n\n\n\n  但這種形式感，\n\n\n\n  不可缺少。\n\n\n\n  缺了半截手臂的周澤行走在這個研究所里，他走得很慢很慢；\n\n\n\n  看著八十年前的自己進行著屬於他的裁決，屬於他的殺戮，\n\n\n\n  第一次，\n\n\n\n  周澤真正的意識到，\n\n\n\n  死亡，\n\n\n\n  原來真的也是一種藝術。\n\n\n\n  帶著屬於它特有的節奏，\n\n\n\n  蘊含著它獨特的韻味，\n\n\n\n  像是窖藏了許多年的佳釀，沒喝之前就已經被這酒香所迷醉，而現在一口一口慢慢地品著，酒香從口中進入，流竄於鼻尖，最後落入胃裡，火辣辣的滋味頃刻間襲遍全身。\n\n\n\n  舒服過癮得，讓你幾乎克制不住地想要發出****！\n\n\n\n  白大褂們在研究所里像是一個個無頭的蒼蠅不停地來回奔竄著，尖叫著，哭泣著，嘶吼著，當惡魔和馬路大的身份被調換之後，事實證明了，根本就沒有誰比誰更高貴一說，在同等的位置和境遇之中，大家都是一樣的。\n\n\n\n  當初的他們，在面對試驗場內那些牢犯的掙扎和哀嚎時，他們或許還能笑著聊天，還能討論附近慰安所里哪一號服務更熱情。\n\n\n\n  那時候，他們在外面，別人在裡面，而現在，他們則進了裡面，也就沒有了以前在外面時的閒情逸緻。 \n\n\n\n  他們遭遇到了最為可怕的「鬼打牆」，知道要跑，卻根本跑不出去。\n\n\n\n  就像是實驗室里被關在容器內飼養者的小白鼠，命運，其實已經註定。\n\n\n\n  因為周澤的特殊吩咐，\n\n\n\n  所以接下來的死亡畫面，沒有一開始的那種乾脆，之前是曇花綻放，現在，則是讓你從花骨朵到含苞待放到最後徹底盛開以及之後的凋謝。\n\n\n\n  每個過程都不能少，每個環節都不能缺，\n\n\n\n  從恐懼的培育，到前期的壓抑，中期的細節，後期痛苦的延伸，生命之花，如此的嬌嫩，卻被用了無數種方法慢慢地炮烙。\n\n\n\n  死，也不會讓你們死得輕鬆，更不會讓你們死得簡單，榨乾你們每一點恐懼，釋放你們最後的痛苦，甚至連你們的靈魂，都不會放過。\n\n\n\n  不要以為肉身的終結就是解脫，\n\n\n\n  真正的生死不得，其實在你肉身完結之後才剛剛開始。\n\n\n\n  要知道，靈魂比起肉身，更是敏感，地獄的刑罰，更是大多針對靈魂的。\n\n\n\n  如果將肉身比作包P，那麼靈魂就是藏身其中的貴頭，\n\n\n\n  誰更敏感，\n\n\n\n  都懂。\n\n\n\n  殺戮的藝術，\n\n\n\n  死亡的旋窩， \n\n\n\n  不斷地喧囂，不斷地徘徊，也不斷地在交錯著。\n\n\n\n  周澤低下頭，\n\n\n\n  他看見地上的鮮血，似乎也變得鮮活了起來，像是揮墨的山水大師，不停地變幻著模樣。\n\n\n\n  陰森、玄奧、鬼畫符，宛若星辰給夜空的點綴，帶著一種根本就不用掩飾的戲謔和嘲諷。\n\n\n\n  一灘灘鮮血不斷地延伸過來，在周澤的腳邊化作了朵朵血色蓮花，每一個花瓣上，都是一張痛苦的臉，是剛剛死氣的白大褂們的亡魂，這是屬於他們的禁錮，這是屬於他們的恐怖盛宴。\n\n\n\n  就像是小時候看黑白電視機上的畫面，一條條線，一片片留白，線很雜亂，白也不是那麼的白，紛紛擾擾變化之下，讓人目眩，讓人犯嘔，讓人噁心。\n\n\n\n  周澤彎下了腰，\n\n\n\n  他用僅存的一隻手捂住自己的胸口，\n\n\n\n  有點想吐。\n\n\n\n  不是同情，也不是憐憫，只是單純的有些意外，\n\n\n\n  八十年前的自己，\n\n\n\n  比起現在的自己，\n\n\n\n  似乎更是心狠手辣。\n\n\n\n  那道殘缺的身體還在行走其中，\n\n\n\n  慢條斯理地像是在欣賞著屬於他本人的傑作，\n\n \n\n  到一定時候，\n\n\n\n  他就出現在一個還活著的白大褂面前，將其當作一道配菜，丟入這激昂的交響樂中化作其中一道音符，或者是鮮榨出他的鮮血，補充這血色的浪漫水彩。\n\n\n\n  他沒有獰笑，\n\n\n\n  甚至除了一開始睜開眼看周澤以外的時間裡，他其實都是閉著眼的。\n\n\n\n  看起來有些漫不經心，\n\n\n\n  但他卻像是最為追求完美的藝術家，樂隊指揮者，他恪盡職守，將一切的一切，都做到最好，讓觀眾……滿意。\n\n\n\n  哦不，\n\n\n\n  其實是讓他自己滿意。\n\n\n\n  交叉了八十年時間距離的夢，\n\n\n\n  彼此分別位於時間點的兩端，\n\n\n\n  到底什麼是夢，\n\n\n\n  什麼又是夢可以改變的虛假部分，\n\n\n\n  周澤不懂，也不明白。\n\n\n\n  但大概，\n\n\n\n  八十年前的自己，在這裡甦醒，開始殺戮這裡，開始淨化自己，這應該是真的。\n\n\n\n  至於他是否見到了八十年後現在的自己，是否因為接受了自己的委託，而將這場本對於他來說極為簡單的殺戮變得更加地複雜更加地累更加地漫長更加地享受， \n\n\n\n  那就不得而知了。\n\n\n\n  如果想知道真相，\n\n\n\n  只能等挖掘出地下的秘密，\n\n\n\n  離開這個夢，\n\n\n\n  在現實里，\n\n\n\n  去看八十年前遺留下來的痕跡，\n\n\n\n  這樣才能獲得最正確的判斷。\n\n\n\n  然而，\n\n\n\n  忽然之間，\n\n\n\n  一切的一切像是都被加快了進程，\n\n\n\n  周澤猛地發現地上原本變化著圖案的鮮血開始沸騰起來，\n\n\n\n  一個個之前還等著挨次序投入這場盛宴的白大褂和憲兵們幾乎是一股腦地被投入到各個實驗室之中，實驗室里的實驗開始繼續，工具和器械開始自己運作起來，各種各樣的實驗重新開始，甚至連記錄的冊子和筆都自己飛舞起來進行著屬於自己的記錄。\n\n\n\n  只不過，原材料，並不再是以前他們口中的馬路大，而是變成了他們自己。\n\n\n\n  但這種旋律的變化，讓周澤有些心驚莫名，當他再度看向那個殘破的身影時，卻發現那道身影已經出現在了自己的面前。\n\n\n\n  他雙手抓著他自己的半截腦袋，\n\n\n\n  顯得很是痛苦，\n\n\n\n  身體也在不停地搖晃， \n\n\n\n  像是已經無法克制住自己一樣。\n\n\n\n  四周的一切，都是他的手筆，是屬於他的死亡藝術，一切的一切，都根據他的心境在變化，而當他開始逐漸陷入瘋狂，陷入失控之時，周圍的一切也都開始向殘酷的暴力美學去延伸。\n\n\n\n  慘叫聲，\n\n\n\n  哀嚎聲，\n\n\n\n  有活人的，\n\n\n\n  有亡魂的，\n\n\n\n  他們在這其中更加地痛苦不堪。\n\n\n\n  猛然間，\n\n\n\n  那個殘破的身影睜開了眼，他的眼眸中帶著一種血紅色，一時間，讓周澤都有些發懵。\n\n\n\n  他在對著自己喊著什麼，\n\n\n\n  他在對著自己訴說著什麼，\n\n\n\n  但該死的，\n\n\n\n  自己為什麼一個字都聽不到！\n\n\n\n  「我聽不到，你在說什麼！」\n\n\n\n  周澤對著他大喊著，他知道，對方說的話應該很是重要，這甚至可能是八十年前的自己給自己留下的訊息。\n\n\n\n  通過……\n\n\n\n  夢的形式。\n\n\n\n  但是他什麼都聽不見，真的什麼都聽不見，再加上對方是處於失控邊緣近乎咆哮地在吶喊，周澤就算是懂唇語也不可能分析出他到底在說什麼內容。 \n\n\n\n  「轟！」\n\n\n\n  「轟！」\n\n\n\n  一連串的爆炸聲傳來，\n\n\n\n  這是幾個出口被炸毀的動靜。\n\n\n\n  上面的日本人已經沒人敢再下去了，打算把這裡封閉。\n\n\n\n  而這時，\n\n\n\n  那個殘破的身影像是越來越瘋狂，\n\n\n\n  地上的鮮血在此時不斷地升高，慢慢地覆蓋起來，一開始，僅僅是到周澤腳面，然後慢慢地到周澤的膝蓋，到最後，沒過了腰部。\n\n\n\n  周澤很想再喊住那個身影，他很想知道他剛才到底說了什麼，但周澤來不及再開口詢問，也來不及再做什麼，因為鮮血已經將他整個人淹沒。\n\n\n\n  「咕嘟…………」\n\n\n\n  身體，\n\n\n\n  像是墜入了海洋深處，\n\n\n\n  四周，\n\n\n\n  是令人內心絕望的孤寂，\n\n\n\n  而在下方，\n\n\n\n  有一個身形殘破的身影，\n\n\n\n  像是也在抬頭，在向上看，但二人的距離，在以肉眼可見的速度越來越遠。\n\n\n\n  浮力開始越來越大，周澤上升的速度開始越來越快，那種窒息的恐慌感也在越來越強烈。 \n\n\n\n  「噗…………」\n\n\n\n  當周澤浮出水面時，\n\n\n\n  他整個人直接從沙發上坐起。\n\n\n\n  「呼呼…………呼呼……………呼呼………………」\n\n\n\n  周澤身上大汗淋漓，全身上下都濕透了，\n\n\n\n  身邊的白鶯鶯還在沉睡，但頭髮已經恢復了少女的黑色，甚至連皮膚都變得更加的緊繃和有彈性，仿佛掐一下都能出水兒一樣。\n\n\n\n  如同新鮮的花蕊，被晨間的露珠好好地滋潤過了一樣。\n\n\n\n  周澤伸手捂著自己的額頭，\n\n\n\n  他還有些沒回過神來，\n\n\n\n  實在是之前的畫面，太過瘋狂，也太過心驚，尤其是那種殺戮之中所體現出的藝術感，讓人覺得自己正身處於交響樂團的正中央，\n\n\n\n  不，是海嘯的正中心！\n\n\n\n  這時，\n\n\n\n  周澤的手機響了，\n\n\n\n  他掃了一眼屏幕，\n\n\n\n  居然是張燕豐的電話。\n\n\n\n  接了電話，有氣無力地一聲「餵」。\n\n\n\n  電話那頭的張燕豐顯得則是很激動，旁邊還有機械轟鳴的巨大聲響，他大聲地喊道：\n\n\n\n  「喂，上頭已經同意了，要開挖了，要開挖了…………」 \n\n\n\n  要開挖了？\n\n\n\n  周澤還有些迷糊，\n\n\n\n  開挖什麼？\n\n\n\n  但很快，\n\n\n\n  周澤猛地清醒過來，\n\n\n\n  馬上把手機對準自己的嘴吼道：\n\n\n\n  「不能挖，現在不能挖，\n\n\n\n  千萬不能挖出來！！！」\n\n\n\n  ——————\n\n\n\n  ——————\n\n\n\n  PS：新的一個月了，大家把保底月票投給龍吧。\n\n\n\n  莫慌，\n\n\n\n  抱緊龍！",

    "content": "掛斷了電話，周澤伸手揉了一把臉，長舒一口氣，起身時，驚醒了白鶯鶯。\n\n\n\n  白鶯鶯伸手揉了揉眼睛，橫躺在沙發上，露出她的兩條修長也不失豐腴的腿，腳部輕輕交叉，曲線畢露。\n\n\n\n  帶著女人的嫵媚也有著少女的天真。\n\n\n\n  「老闆…………」\n\n\n\n  這聲音糯糯的，帶著一種天然的親切和孺慕。\n\n\n\n  「人家好舒服呢，好滿足。」\n\n\n\n  「…………」周澤。\n\n\n\n  此時，許清朗穿著棉襖，正坐在吧檯那邊喝著熱茶，旁邊還放著一個取暖器，耳朵里塞著耳機聽著歌，悠哉悠哉的樣子。\n\n\n\n  店門外是大夏天，行人都被大太陽給烘烤著，而自己這裡則像是入了冬。\n\n\n\n  他今兒一天，基本就是在書店裡坐一會兒，然後就跑外面再逛逛，真的是有些不亦樂乎。\n\n\n\n  冰火兩重天的體驗，嘖嘖，有趣。\n\n\n\n  很多人都會有過在夏天時想念冬天在冬天時想念夏天的經歷，許清朗這次算是好好地爽了一把。\n\n\n\n  見周澤醒來，許清朗伸了個懶腰，像是沒體驗夠，活脫脫的久曠怨婦。\n\n\n\n  「把你車鑰匙給我。」周澤直接道。\n\n\n\n  許清朗哈出一口白氣，從兜里把車鑰匙取出來，丟給了周澤。 \n\n\n\n  白鶯鶯見周澤要出去，馬上也要從沙發上下來跟著老闆一起出去辦事，但她剛下床就發出了一聲輕嚀，整個人摔在了地上。\n\n\n\n  「嚶嚶嚶，\n\n\n\n  老闆，\n\n\n\n  人家腿軟了。」\n\n\n\n  她這次，是吸了個飽，把以前失去的元氣都補充回來了，整個人有著一種難以用言語描述的滿足感，連骨頭都是酥軟的。\n\n\n\n  「你好好休息。」\n\n\n\n  周澤沒打算帶白鶯鶯，而是直接走到外面上了車，開了出去。\n\n\n\n  路上，周澤開得很快，因為剛剛在電話里周澤雖然喊了好幾遍讓那邊先停工，停止挖掘，但周澤清楚，張燕豐在這件事上，並沒有絕對處置的權力。\n\n\n\n  再者，張燕豐到底會不會聽自己的話答應幫自己阻止這一切也是個未知數。\n\n\n\n  畢竟，換位思考一下，那個鐵鏈的事情幾乎成了他二十年來的夢魘心結，現在有機會解開心結，他怎麼可能還忍得住？\n\n\n\n  那個地方，一直是被塵封著的，八十年前，夢中的事情出現，周澤記得在夢的結尾，日本人炸毀了研究所的出入口通道，而後世的現在對這件事對這個地方全無所知，很可能是日本人故意封鎖了消息。\n\n\n\n  也因此，那個地方大概在八十年的時間裡，都沒有人發現和開啟過。 \n\n\n\n  也就是說，\n\n\n\n  那具殘缺的身體，很大可能，還在裡面。\n\n\n\n  如果他們擅自開挖，把那個地方打開，將那具殘缺的身體再度驚醒，看看夢中最後那身體自己都無法控制住自己的場面，周澤就覺得一陣心寒。\n\n\n\n  最要命的，\n\n\n\n  那個傢伙，在一定程度上來說，就是自己，\n\n\n\n  到最後，\n\n\n\n  如果真的出現了意外，這筆帳，很可能還得算在自己頭上。\n\n\n\n  周澤倒不是想著怕擔責任，而是那種以前的自己發瘋導致意外發生的話，他的心裡肯定也會過意不去。\n\n\n\n  手機在此時響起，是許清朗打來的電話，周澤接了電話：\n\n\n\n  「什麼事？」\n\n\n\n  「哦，忘了跟你說了，那個唐妹子來了，老道跟著她去警局了，之前跟我說如果你醒了的話，就打電話給他。」\n\n\n\n  唐詩在那裡？\n\n\n\n  周澤一陣驚喜。\n\n\n\n  周澤馬上掛斷了電話，一邊開車一邊撥通了老道的電話。\n\n\n\n  「喂，老闆，啥事兒，我們這兒正挖著呢。」\n\n\n\n  老道那邊的聲音也很嘈雜，和之前張燕豐打電話給自己時的感覺差不多，顯然老道現在就在施工現場。 \n\n\n\n  「叫唐詩接電話。」周澤喊道。\n\n\n\n  「念詩？」老道捂著自己另一隻耳朵，顯然，他這裡噪音太大，沒聽得清楚。\n\n\n\n  這個時候，老道那邊手機響了一下，緊接著，一個女人的聲音傳來：\n\n\n\n  「是我。」\n\n\n\n  應該是唐詩在得知是周澤打電話來後二話不說就從老道手裡搶過了手機。\n\n\n\n  「不要讓他們繼續挖下去，下面有問題！」\n\n\n\n  周澤喊道。\n\n\n\n  「我知道了。」\n\n\n\n  唐詩說完，掛斷了電話。\n\n\n\n  周澤愣了一下，她真的聽清楚了？\n\n\n\n  不管了，周澤下意識地加速開始向警局開去，違章什麼的反正是許清朗去交管局交罰款扣分，反正車是他的。\n\n\n\n  一路上除了一個小學門口小學生們為了慶祝「六一兒童節」組織了一次郊遊活動過馬路導致車堵了一會兒以外，其餘時候都暢通無阻，沒有再堵車。\n\n\n\n  把車停在了警局外的馬路上，周澤迅速下車，直接沖向了那邊的施工現場。\n\n\n\n  施工現場現在很安靜，沒了之前手機通話時所聽到的嘈雜，不少施工員都坐在地上，在發呆和閒聊。\n\n\n\n  「老闆，這裡，這裡！」 \n\n\n\n  老道先看見了周澤，馬上喊了起來。\n\n\n\n  周澤走了過去，看見在前面一塊乾淨的花圃平台邊坐著的唐詩。\n\n\n\n  唐詩正在剝著大白兔奶糖不停地往嘴裡放，這個習慣她似乎一直沒有改掉。\n\n\n\n  快小半年了，再一次見到她，發現並沒有什麼變化。\n\n\n\n  唐詩一邊咀嚼著奶糖一邊瞥了一眼匆忙趕來的周澤，道：\n\n\n\n  「所有施工機械都被我做了手腳故障了。」\n\n\n\n  聞言，周澤長舒一口氣，唐詩這次是幫了他大忙，不管怎麼樣，現在還沒開挖出來就好。\n\n\n\n  這就意味著最可怕的可能暫時不會發生，一切，還有轉圜的餘地。\n\n\n\n  「那下面，很可能是一個集中營，對吧？」\n\n\n\n  唐詩看著周澤問道，她之前已經分析過一開始出土的東西了。\n\n\n\n  「對，是類似731的活體實驗研究所。」周澤直接開門見山。\n\n\n\n  唐詩並沒有多少吃驚，轉而繼續問道：「讓我阻止他們開挖的原因，是什麼？」\n\n\n\n  「你為什麼會到這裡來？」周澤沒急著回答之前的問題。\n\n\n\n  「是你自己做夢時夢回了地獄，被人看到了，她發現了你的異常，又告訴了他，他又對我說了，讓我過來看看，說你身上可能會發生一些事情。」 \n\n\n\n  周澤還在腦子裡不停地分析這麼多的他到底是指誰時，\n\n\n\n  唐詩直接用穿著涼鞋的腿輕輕碰了碰周澤的小腿，催促道：\n\n\n\n  「你還沒回答我之前的問題。」\n\n\n\n  周澤嘆了口氣，\n\n\n\n  指了指前面的工地，道：\n\n\n\n  「我被埋在下面。」\n\n\n\n  「…………」唐詩。\n\n\n\n  「…………」老道。\n\n\n\n  ………………\n\n\n\n  「老闆，你這真的是……嘿嘿，上午我才看微博看見一個消息，說一個考古學家挖一個墓挖著挖著發現是自己的祖墳。」\n\n\n\n  老道在旁邊說道。\n\n\n\n  「段子你也信，這個段子我幾年前就看過了。」唐詩直接說道。\n\n\n\n  「哦。」老道聳聳肩，然後指了指周澤，「你總不能說，老闆剛剛也是在逗我們玩，跟我們講段子吧？」\n\n\n\n  唐詩沒再說什麼，而是用一種帶著玩味的笑容掃了一眼周澤，「以前可真沒看出來，你來頭這麼大，前世上輩子什麼的，可不是誰都能有的，往往都是大人物的專利。\n\n\n\n  或者，你這其實就不是什麼前世，本來就是你以前用過的肉身？」\n\n\n\n  唐詩乾脆靠近了周澤，伸手在周澤肩膀上捏了捏，繼續道： \n\n\n\n  「能換一次，為什麼就不能換兩次？上一次是意外，但既然成功了，就意味著以前也能成功。」\n\n\n\n  這個時候，張燕豐看見了周澤，向這裡走來。\n\n\n\n  「機器出故障了。」張燕豐直接說道。\n\n\n\n  「嗯。」\n\n\n\n  「幸好，你給我打電話之後，我就去跟領導匯報了，我說下面很可能是以前的日軍人體細菌研究所，盲目開挖的話很可能會導致一些毒氣一類東西泄漏，危及附近居民安全，現在上面已經決定暫停施工開挖，等北京和上海的相關方面專家隊伍過來查看。」\n\n\n\n  周澤有些意外地看了眼張燕豐，道：「你忍得住？」\n\n\n\n  「我是警察，我得對百姓的生命安全負責。」\n\n\n\n  張燕豐回答道。\n\n\n\n  將心比心，換周澤是張燕豐的話，估計真忍不住，當下肯定不管三七二十一肯定催促人趕緊開挖了。\n\n\n\n  一個折磨了自己二十年的心理陰影，可不是說放就能放下的。\n\n\n\n  「也就是說，至少到明天，這裡都是安全的？」周澤再次確認道。\n\n\n\n  張燕豐點點頭，「專家隊明天才能趕來。」\n\n\n\n  周澤放心了，\n\n\n\n  但很快，\n\n\n\n  他的臉色就變了變， \n\n\n\n  因為只聽得「咔嚓」一聲，\n\n\n\n  張燕豐直接拿出手銬銬住了周澤的一隻手同時把手銬另一端銬在了他自己的一隻手上，兩個人用一個手銬銬在了一起。\n\n\n\n  「這是什麼意思？」周澤指著手銬道。\n\n\n\n  「我能忍得住，你也得忍住，別以為我不清楚你肯定打算今晚找機會下去。\n\n\n\n  對不起，我的責任不允許讓這裡有絲毫的意外發生，我這次算是違規操作，限制你的人身自由了，等明天專家團隊到了之後接管了這裡，你可以去警局投訴我，我願意接受處分。」\n\n\n\n  周澤舔了舔嘴唇，強忍著用自己的指甲把手銬掐斷讓張警官見識見識真正力量的衝動，\n\n\n\n  因為想想，對方在道德和職責上，真的做得無可厚非，甚至還很讓人敬佩。\n\n\n\n  周老闆還是決定以德服人，\n\n\n\n  直接道：\n\n\n\n  「相信我，我對這下面很熟。」\n\n\n\n  張燕豐呵呵笑了一聲，\n\n\n\n  顯然是不信的。\n\n\n\n  「我在下面住了八十年了。」",

    "content": "入夜了，\n\n\n\n  警局後面公園長椅上坐著兩個人，\n\n\n\n  一邊是男人，\n\n\n\n  另一邊也是男人。\n\n\n\n  張燕豐從口袋裡取出煙，遞給了周澤一根，然後自己嘴裡也咬了一根。\n\n\n\n  他們已經這樣坐了很久了。\n\n\n\n  不遠處，站著老道跟唐詩。\n\n\n\n  「磨磨唧唧。」\n\n\n\n  唐詩顯然對周澤做事拖泥帶水的風格很是不滿意，按照她的習慣，直接把那位警察給打暈過去也就沒事了。\n\n\n\n  「老張，相信我這一回，這件事最穩妥的方式就是我先下去看一看，哪怕是明天那些專家來了，都沒我下去效果更好。」\n\n\n\n  張燕豐沉默不語，只是默默地吐著煙圈。\n\n\n\n  「我沒必要騙你，真的。」\n\n\n\n  「下面是日軍以前的細菌研究室，你能確定擅自下去不會引起有害氣體的泄漏？」張燕豐沉聲道：「你知道這附近到底住了多少人？」\n\n\n\n  「我可以明確地告訴你，如果下面是最壞的一種情況，到時候事情一旦糜爛起來，會比毒氣泄漏造成的損傷更大。」\n\n\n\n  想想那道殘破的身體，最後他連自己都無法控制住了，如果再成績到他甦醒，後果真的太可怕了。 \n\n\n\n  「你可以打暈我的。」\n\n\n\n  張燕豐把菸頭丟在了地上踩了踩。\n\n\n\n  「什麼？」周澤愣了一下。\n\n\n\n  「我一直在等你打暈我，當然，我會反抗，因為這是我的職責，但我相信你這種人……有能力在我反抗的前提下把我打暈，到時候，你要去做什麼，我就阻攔不了你了。」\n\n\n\n  「你怎麼這麼死心眼。」周澤有些無奈道。\n\n\n\n  「死心眼的，不是我，是你。」\n\n\n\n  張燕豐伸手指了指前面路燈下還在等待的唐詩和老道，道：\n\n\n\n  「那個女孩，殺過人吧。」\n\n\n\n  周澤沒回答。\n\n\n\n  「看她的第一眼我就清楚，呵呵，我以前當過兵，後來當的刑警，混這一行很多年了，窮凶極惡的人也見過不少。\n\n\n\n  那個女孩的眼神，我一看就知道，她殺過人，而且是完全不把人命當回事兒的那種。\n\n\n\n  我如果不相信你的話，當時在警局裡，我就可以喊人來把她給圍住，然後對她做身份調查。」\n\n\n\n  周澤笑了笑，「調查不出來的。」\n\n\n\n  張燕豐有些意外地看了一眼周澤。\n\n\n\n  「這個世界上，很多東西，是調查不出來的，真的，當初你把我抓了，也沒從我身上調查出什麼吧？ \n\n\n\n  但我可以明確地告訴你，這一年來，我已經送了不知道多少人下地獄了。」\n\n\n\n  「那你為什麼還願意在這裡陪我坐這麼久？」張燕豐有些好奇道。\n\n\n\n  兩個人之間的關係一直在變化，一開始，周澤是嫌疑犯，張燕豐是警察，隨後，二人都是「獄友」，而現在，二人更像是兩個圈子裡互相帶著點欣賞意思的朋友。\n\n\n\n  「第一，還沒到後半夜，天色還早。\n\n\n\n  第二，我覺得你是個好警察，我願意在你身上浪費一點時間。」\n\n\n\n  「我是不是應該為此覺得榮幸？」\n\n\n\n  周澤站起身，張燕豐也被迫使一起站了起來，\n\n\n\n  「我是相信這個世界上還是好人多的，我以前也見過幾個好警察，是那種真正意義上奉行準則的好警察，我敬重他們，所以現在也敬重你。\n\n\n\n  所以，希望你這次不要迂腐，你可以和我一起下去，你腳上也有鐵鏈子，如果不出意外的話，可能你祖上哪個親戚就死在那裡頭。」\n\n\n\n  「我調查過了，我有一個二爺爺，抗戰時據說從了軍，但後來也就沒了消息了，家裡人打探也打探不到。」\n\n\n\n  「跟我一起下去吧。」\n\n\n\n  周澤邀請道。\n\n\n\n  張燕豐掏出了槍， \n\n\n\n  指著周澤的後背，\n\n\n\n  「我對你的身份並不清楚，說實話，我也害怕去清楚，你可能覺得我的行為很迂腐，也很固執，但對不起，我以前的人生經歷和工作經歷告訴我，有時候，真的就必須固執和堅持下去，一步都不能退。」\n\n\n\n  「嗯，我敬重你的…………」\n\n\n\n  「砰！」\n\n\n\n  不是槍響，\n\n\n\n  而是一塊石頭砸中了張燕豐的脖頸，\n\n\n\n  張燕豐暈倒在了長椅上。\n\n\n\n  唐詩走過來，面色帶著明顯的不耐煩，\n\n\n\n  「他都叫你打暈他了，你還廢話做什麼？\n\n\n\n  我是不是應該再給你們準備點茶水，再拿一台DV錄下來，好讓你們兩個人的正能量對話可以繼續傳播下去？」\n\n\n\n  周澤伸出指甲，輕鬆地掐斷了手銬，嘆了口氣道：「跟你說不通，你腦子裡除了大白兔奶糖，還能裝下什麼？」\n\n\n\n  唐詩目光一凝，似乎準備發作，但最後還是克制住了，轉身，直接向工地那邊走去。\n\n\n\n  老道在旁邊呵呵一笑，心想自家老闆自從會開無雙之後，再見到唐詩妹子時，腰杆兒也挺直了，包括對待小蘿莉也是一樣。\n\n\n\n  果然，男人有錢不變壞，母豬上樹變妖怪。 \n\n\n\n  三個人一起來到了工地上頭，這附近已經被封禁了，但顯然阻攔不了他們。\n\n\n\n  「哪個位置？」唐詩冷冰冰地道。\n\n\n\n  「就這兒，往下挖就可以了，注意別弄出太大的聲音。」周澤指了指腳下。\n\n\n\n  很快，\n\n\n\n  腳下的石塊木料開始自己懸浮起來，安靜地堆放在一邊，因為有了白天挖掘的基礎，接下來其實就很方便了，而且唐詩的「工作效率」，真的不比大型機械來得慢。\n\n\n\n  周老闆以前就想過，自己如果組建一個建築公司的話利潤應該很可觀，有力大無窮的白鶯鶯打小工，再加個唐詩充當工程機械的作用，一個不用吃飯，一個不用耗電，基本沒啥成本就全是利潤了。\n\n\n\n  過了一會兒，供一人下去的通道就被清理開了，周澤第一個走下去，唐詩是第二個，老道是第三個。\n\n\n\n  下面並沒有什麼毒氣味道，有著一種塵封的霉味。\n\n\n\n  順著台階下來，\n\n\n\n  拿出手機當手電筒，\n\n\n\n  前面的視野還算是清晰。\n\n\n\n  老道走在最後面，只覺得鞋底有些粘，嘀咕道：「這地上是什麼玩意兒？」\n\n\n\n  「血跡。」唐詩回答道。\n\n\n\n  「嘶…………」 \n\n\n\n  老道不敢再多嗶嗶，緊跟著前面兩個大佬。\n\n\n\n  推開前面的一道早就腐蝕生鏽得不像樣子的鐵門，入眼的，是很熟悉的牢房過道，兩邊則是牢房。\n\n\n\n  周澤還記得夢裡自己戴著腳鏈從這裡走過去的場景，附近牢房裡的人都帶著艷羨的目光看著自己。\n\n\n\n  再經過這裡時，拿手電筒往裡看看，視線所及之處的牢房裡，是一具具乾屍。\n\n\n\n  日本人炸毀出入口之後，應該就沒打算重啟開啟過，後來可能是因為戰局或者其他原因，乃至於等到日本戰敗之後，這裡就被遺忘了。\n\n\n\n  裡面牢房裡原本被關押著的人，就這樣被困死在了這裡。\n\n\n\n  「不是餓死的。」\n\n\n\n  唐詩這個時候直接用念力扳斷了兩根欄杆，甚至蹲下身檢查了一具屍體，道：\n\n\n\n  「炸毀通道時粉塵應該很多，這些人都是因為窒息而死，不是因為當年你的見死不救。」\n\n\n\n  「謝謝。」\n\n\n\n  周澤深吸一口氣，\n\n\n\n  「我收回之前說你腦子裡只有大白兔奶糖這句話。」\n\n\n\n  「你呢，你在哪裡？」唐詩問道，「你說得那個身體。」\n\n\n\n  周澤指了指前面。\n\n\n\n  「不要耽擱了，要祭奠等明天。」 \n\n\n\n  說著，唐詩主動往前走去，\n\n\n\n  過了前面一個甬道，前面馬上豁然開朗，因為進入了實驗室的區域。\n\n\n\n  唐詩停下了腳步，老道跟上去，也跟著唐詩一起停下了腳步，隨後，老道捂著嘴彎下腰，身體不停地抽搐著，顯然是在抑制不住地乾嘔。\n\n\n\n  周澤最後一個走過來，面前的情景，倒是沒讓他覺得有多吃驚，畢竟在夢裡，他親歷了最為鮮活的實時畫面。\n\n\n\n  而眼下，\n\n\n\n  實驗室區域裡，各種慘死的人，各種慘無人道的死亡方式，各種誇張帶著藝術炸裂氣息的畫面，也因為八十年的時間過去了，染上了時間的塵埃，不復當初一開始的鮮活和觸目驚心了。\n\n\n\n  當然了，\n\n\n\n  對於沒見過初始版本的人來說，\n\n\n\n  此情此景，\n\n\n\n  已經足以被稱之為人間煉獄。\n\n\n\n  「這裡死的，基本都是日本軍人和研究人員，他們死有餘辜。」周澤解釋道。\n\n\n\n  「話是這麼說，但老闆，這場面也太十八禁了，老道我真的吃不住。」\n\n\n\n  老道擦了擦嘴角，臉色都發白了。\n\n\n\n  「你處理一下地上自己的嘔吐物，別明天專家組下來拿你的標本回去研究了。」周澤提醒道。 \n\n\n\n  說完，周澤又看向了身邊的唐詩，問道：\n\n\n\n  「你還好吧？」\n\n\n\n  唐詩搖搖頭。\n\n\n\n  周澤有些納悶了，按理說她的心理承受能力是比老道要高的。\n\n\n\n  等到周澤往前再走兩步，看見唐詩的臉時，發現她居然在笑，臉上也露出了激動和欣賞的神采。\n\n\n\n  「額…………」\n\n\n\n  唐詩看了看周澤，道：\n\n\n\n  「難以想像，以前的你，品味和格調居然這麼高，這裡的畫面，這裡的屍體，這裡的死狀，包括鮮血堆砌起來的圖案，\n\n\n\n  真的，\n\n\n\n  很美。」\n\n\n\n  「…………」老道。\n\n\n\n  「…………」周澤。\n\n\n\n  「咔嚓………………」\n\n\n\n  一聲清晰的脆響忽然從實驗室深處傳來，\n\n\n\n  周澤的目光猛地看向了那個位置，\n\n\n\n  那個實驗室，\n\n\n\n  沒記錯的話，\n\n\n\n  是安置保險柜的區域！\n\n\n\n  唐詩舔了舔嘴唇，她顯得有些緊張，但也難掩激動，緩緩道：\n\n\n\n  「你看，\n\n\n\n  他也同意我的說法了。」",

    "content": "和唐詩的激動不一樣的是，周澤現在有些後背發涼，因為周澤見識過那個殘破身體遊走在研究所里用死亡描繪藝術的畫面。\n\n\n\n  那種閒庭信步，那種慢條斯理，\n\n\n\n  就差在你面前排出九文大錢，問你「死」字到底有幾種寫法了。\n\n\n\n  如果別人說「我發起瘋來連我自己都害怕」只是一種調侃的話，\n\n\n\n  那對於現在的周老闆來說，\n\n\n\n  這真的是最貼切的形容。\n\n\n\n  明明都是自己，\n\n\n\n  但自己心裡對那位，是真的帶著一種極為忌憚的情緒。\n\n\n\n  「其實……你一直忽略了一個問題。」\n\n\n\n  唐詩一邊慢慢往前走一邊說道。\n\n\n\n  「什麼問題？」\n\n\n\n  「那就是以前的你，是你；\n\n\n\n  現在的你，也是你。\n\n\n\n  既然現在的你是你，那麼以前的你，就不是你了。」\n\n\n\n  老道在旁邊數著好多個「你」，講真，他是沒聽明白唐詩這話到底是什麼意思，同時老道心裡也開始疑惑起來：\n\n\n\n  這些死鬼果然都和常人不一樣，\n\n\n\n  在這麼一個陰森可怖的地方， \n\n\n\n  居然還在討論哲學問題。\n\n\n\n  講真，老道現在是有些後悔跟著一起下來了，早知道留在上面放風多好，這下面本就慎得慌，他們還說怪怪的話。\n\n\n\n  周澤倒是聽懂了，唐詩的意思是，他在夢裡看見的畫面，是以前的自己在殺人。\n\n\n\n  那麼，\n\n\n\n  八十年後，\n\n\n\n  自己已經變成了周澤，自己失去了不少記憶，也只記得自己是周澤的事情，但靈魂，是傳承下來的，自己也能變成殭屍也是這個原因。\n\n\n\n  也因此，\n\n\n\n  自己和那個殘破的身軀，是不可能出現在同一個時代的，對方現在就算是在這裡，也只是一具軀體而已。\n\n\n\n  因為八十年前在這裡大殺四方製造死亡藝術的那個殘破身影，他的靈魂已經變成了自己現在的靈魂。\n\n\n\n  所以，\n\n\n\n  只留下一具空殼在這裡，威脅程度肯定沒以前那麼大。\n\n\n\n  「你就對你自己以前的事情一點都不上心麼，反正我是沒感覺出來你有多迫切地想知道自己的真實身份想知道自己的過去。」\n\n\n\n  唐詩避開了腳下的一具乾屍問道。\n\n\n\n  「我只記得我是我，我是周澤，我覺得這樣就挺好的。」周澤回答道。 \n\n\n\n  「呵，心態真不錯。」\n\n\n\n  「我書店裡倒是有不少書里的故事，主人公為了解開自己的身世之謎為了尋找遺忘的真相一路苦大仇深的，但那多累啊。」\n\n\n\n  「很有道理。」唐詩點點頭。\n\n\n\n  「其實，最關鍵的是，如果找回了以前的自己，我害怕我就不是現在的我了，對於現在的我來說，我幾乎就等於是被『殺死』。」\n\n\n\n  老道在後面聽得真的是一頭霧水，\n\n\n\n  娘類，\n\n\n\n  這倆狗男女是聊上癮了吧，\n\n\n\n  還聊得這麼深奧。\n\n\n\n  終於，\n\n\n\n  走到了那間實驗室門口，實驗室的門是被關著的。\n\n\n\n  「他最後，害自己跑回了保險柜？」唐詩問道。\n\n\n\n  「我不清楚。」\n\n\n\n  「吱呀…………」\n\n\n\n  腐朽的門慢慢地打開，發出了刺耳的摩擦聲，在這個研究所里不停地迴響著，遠處一些角落裡還出現了回音，像是有死去的亡魂依舊在哀嚎著。\n\n\n\n  「唐小姐，這會兒咱能老老實實用手開門麼，你那樣開門貧道我總覺得慎得慌。」\n\n\n\n  老道在旁邊小聲地埋怨道。\n\n \n\n  唐詩看向老道，聳了聳肩，\n\n\n\n  「如果我告訴你剛剛我沒用念力，你是不是會覺得更慎得慌了？」\n\n\n\n  「…………」老道。\n\n\n\n  唐詩沒急著走進去，而是重新環視四周，她總覺得好像有什麼東西隱藏在某個黑暗位置正在看著自己等人。\n\n\n\n  「周澤，我們好像一直忽略了一個最根本的問題，抱歉，是我沒處理過你這種複雜的事情，所以一直忽略沒想起來。」\n\n\n\n  「什麼？」\n\n\n\n  「那就是，既然現在的你在這裡，你是周澤。那豈不是說，在這八十年間，留在這裡的那位肯定發生了什麼事情？\n\n\n\n  否則，\n\n\n\n  你是從哪裡來的？」\n\n\n\n  「哐當！」\n\n\n\n  唐詩話音剛落，\n\n\n\n  從實驗室裡面就傳來了一聲悶響。\n\n\n\n  唐詩目光一凝，顧不得跟周澤繼續討論剛才的問題，直接走入了實驗室之中。\n\n\n\n  保險柜的門，已經被關閉了，周圍還有揚起的塵土，保險柜上面，還有一個人臉差不多的大的洞口。\n\n\n\n  而在下方，則有著一具只剩下白骨的乾屍，白骨的頭比身體其他部位保存得要更潔白一些，像是剛洗了牙的那種感覺。 \n\n\n\n  老道躲在周澤身後，手裡捏著那張符紙，但眼睛不停地在那個乾屍身上轉悠著，同時問周澤：\n\n\n\n  「老闆，那個頭骨可以帶回去啊，跟藝術品一樣。」\n\n\n\n  「你要帶你帶回去吧。」周澤對這個倒是沒什麼想法。\n\n\n\n  唐詩看了周澤一眼，示意她要開保險柜了。\n\n\n\n  周澤點點頭，向旁邊側了一下身子，以做好無論發生什麼事情都能夠進行支援的準備。\n\n\n\n  「吱吱吱………………」\n\n\n\n  保險柜那邊傳來了輕微的摩擦聲，像是有什麼東西在裡頭拉扯著門不讓唐詩用念力打開一樣。\n\n\n\n  唐詩微微皺眉，\n\n\n\n  加大了力道。\n\n\n\n  「轟！」\n\n\n\n  只聽得一聲炸響，\n\n\n\n  整個保險柜都飛了起來，\n\n\n\n  是的，\n\n\n\n  飛了起來。\n\n\n\n  周澤馬上推開了老道，而後自己也讓開，這才避免被保險柜給砸到。\n\n\n\n  「嘶嘶嘶嘶嘶嘶嘶……………………」\n\n\n\n  保險柜的門自己打開，\n\n\n\n  從裡頭忽然竄出來一隻只體型巨大的老鼠，這些老鼠一個個都有小貓的身體那麼大，同時眼珠子裡頭泛著烏光，出來之後也不怕人，而是聚攏在了人的面前，像是隨時準備發動攻擊。 \n\n\n\n  而原本保險柜所在的位置下面，則是出現了一個很大的洞，這個洞是凹陷下去，這裡還殘留著白煙。\n\n\n\n  地上兩塊玻璃被唐詩操控起來，直接對著這些大老鼠掃過去，老鼠一時間血肉橫飛，死傷慘重，剩下的那些馬上嚇得竄回了那個洞穴里去。\n\n\n\n  「剛剛是怎麼回事？」周澤掃了一眼地上的老鼠屍體碎片問唐詩。\n\n\n\n  「有東西在下面跟我角力。」\n\n\n\n  唐詩沒急著去洞穴那邊，而是看向周圍的牆壁。\n\n\n\n  「周澤，我覺得現在的問題不是去解決你以前遺留下來的軀殼那麼簡單了，這裡真的還有其他的東西。」\n\n\n\n  唐詩話音剛落，\n\n\n\n  實驗室內的牆壁忽熱開始了龜裂，一根根類似觸手一樣的玩意兒忽然橫掃了過來，空氣中都發出了呼嘯的聲音，帶著一種極強的力道！\n\n\n\n  唐詩雙手撐開，念力形成了一堵看不見的牆壁，擋住了大部分的觸手。\n\n\n\n  有一根從另一個方向穿插過來，在即將接觸到唐詩的時候被周澤直接攥住，而後用指甲切割開，一時間，周澤掌心位置出現了一灘腥臭的液體。\n\n\n\n  也就在此時，研究所其他位置也傳來了「悉悉索索」的聲響，像是有無數根藤蔓正在向這裡延伸過來。\n\n\n\n  「啪啪啪…………」 \n\n\n\n  附近的玻璃也被打破，那些藤蔓很快就堵住了這個實驗室的所有出口和縫隙，它們沒有進攻，而是開始分泌出了粘稠的乳白色液體，這些白色液體帶著一種極為強烈的腐蝕性味道，落在地上時感覺像是硫酸潑出來了一樣。\n\n\n\n  「娘類，這到底是什麼鬼東西。」老道嚇得身體開始哆嗦。\n\n\n\n  這場面，像是自己等人走入了一朵食人花的肚子裡，現在人家要準備把自己等人給消化掉了。\n\n\n\n  「應該是受到這個地方影響的植物。」唐詩說著微微皺眉，「不對，是妖物，我之前就覺得有些奇怪，這裡明明沒有一絲一毫的鬼氣，但總覺得有什麼東西在盯著自己，是妖！」\n\n\n\n  「吧唧…………吧唧…………」\n\n\n\n  四周乳白色的液體開始越來越多，漸漸地開始向周澤等人這邊靠攏。\n\n\n\n  「它是要把我們趕進那個洞口裡去。」\n\n\n\n  周澤指了指前面剛才那些老鼠鑽回去的地方。\n\n\n\n  「架子很大，我們來了這裡，你不主動出來見我們，還想我們主動去參拜你麼？」\n\n\n\n  唐詩閉上眼，\n\n\n\n  而後又緩緩地睜開，\n\n\n\n  在她的眼眸深處，有紫色的光芒在閃爍，她整個人的腳好像也都飄浮了起來，當然，飄浮的距離並不高，也就幾厘米的樣子。 \n\n\n\n  而後，\n\n\n\n  起風了，\n\n\n\n  一時間，地上正在涌過來的白色液體也全都飄浮了起來，倒轉著飛回去，全都灑在了那些觸手的身上。\n\n\n\n  之前明明是從那些觸手中分泌出來的液體，但現在卻對它們也有著等同的傷害，剎那間，周澤密密麻麻的觸手開始瘋狂地扭曲和融化起來，而後開始迅速地後退，空氣中瀰漫著濃郁的烤麵筋的味道。\n\n\n\n  唐詩再度閉上眼，\n\n\n\n  深吸一口氣，\n\n\n\n  身體略顯搖晃，但還是強撐著，她剛剛，已經有些透支了。\n\n\n\n  「咔嚓咔嚓…………咔嚓咔嚓…………」\n\n\n\n  從洞穴下面開始傳來了一陣清晰的摩擦聲，像是有什麼東西正在向這裡移動。\n\n\n\n  那個東西，\n\n\n\n  來了。\n\n\n\n  一道影子，\n\n\n\n  從洞穴下面緩緩地升起，\n\n\n\n  像是一張人臉。\n\n\n\n  老道拿出手機手電向那邊照射過去，眼睛當即睜得大大的。\n\n\n\n  在洞穴位置，\n\n\n\n  露出來的，\n\n\n\n  是半張人臉，\n\n\n\n  另半張，像是被極為順滑地切割出去了一樣，還帶著一種詭異的光澤。",

    "content": "半張臉，很是突兀地從洞穴那邊升起來，四周的溫度也開始迅速降低下來。\n\n\n\n  周澤下意識地倒吸一口涼氣，讓他最擔心的局面還是出現了。\n\n\n\n  其實，周澤之前也想過，既然自己現在是周澤了，甭管靈魂不靈魂，記憶不記憶的，至少證明八十年前到現在，原本被關在研究所里被日本人拿來當研究品的自己是動過的，不然也不會有自己的出現。\n\n\n\n  那是不是意味著，這具身體可能就不在這裡了？\n\n\n\n  但周澤還是想錯了，\n\n\n\n  這具身體還在，\n\n\n\n  而且發生了特殊的變化。\n\n\n\n  之前唐詩說這裡有妖，\n\n\n\n  周澤反正一點都沒感覺到。\n\n\n\n  不過，\n\n\n\n  人的影樹的名，之前在夢裡看見這具殘破身體大殺特殺的情景，又親眼目睹其自身都開始不受控制的癲狂，這時候再面對他，周澤心裡還是有些惴惴不安。\n\n\n\n  「嗡！」\n\n\n\n  一道波紋蕩漾開去，\n\n\n\n  那半張臉上僅剩的獨眼睜開了，眼眸之中，還是熟悉的空洞，似乎根本就沒有眼珠子之類的存在，但在下一刻，一團團稻草根莖一樣的玩意兒從眼珠子裡竄了出來，並且逐漸的延伸出去，甚至補全了右邊失去的半張臉輪廓，讓這個臉看起來，似乎「圓滿」了，但實際上看起來卻更加地詭異和不協調。 \n\n\n\n  「砰！」\n\n\n\n  一隻白骨手從邊緣位置探了出來，扣住了地面後，其身體也開始慢慢地往上爬。\n\n\n\n  動作很慢，顯得有些遲鈍，像是一具玩偶，被一個技藝很粗糙的學徒藝人在操控著，而且，似乎也能看出他的艱難。\n\n\n\n  但那種氣場，卻像是與生俱來的東西，哪怕它身體殘破了，哪怕原本在它體內的靈魂不知道經歷了什麼事情最後落在了周澤這裡。\n\n\n\n  「啪！」\n\n\n\n  他從洞穴里爬了出來，但頃刻間，他的身體開始抑制不住地向後退，仿佛有什麼無形的力道正在壓制著他。\n\n\n\n  地上開始出現了一串火星，足以可見摩擦之劇烈。\n\n\n\n  「吼！」\n\n\n\n  他張開嘴，只剩下一半的嘴以極為誇張和驚悚的方式張開，另外半張草莖編織的臉瞬間崩潰散落，他在做著無聲的咆哮，顯然是對這種情況很是憤怒。\n\n\n\n  「噗通…………」\n\n\n\n  周澤跟唐詩根本就什麼反應都沒有做，就看著這剛剛好不容易爬出來的殘軀又跪倒在了地上，而後又被強行拖入了洞穴之中。\n\n\n\n  整個畫面和過程看起來有些滑稽，拉風氣勢如虹的出場，而後又莫名其妙地被拖拽下去，像是一個演員剛上台還沒說話就落幕了。 \n\n\n\n  不過，這個情況也讓周澤等人這邊的壓力頓時消散了不少，心頭上積攢的凝重也被消除了很多。\n\n\n\n  「老闆，這是以前的你？」\n\n\n\n  老道問周澤。\n\n\n\n  周澤點點頭。\n\n\n\n  「看樣子這身體出現問題了啊，真的是頭上長草了。」\n\n\n\n  周澤懶得搭理他，但沒想到老道自言自語上癮了，繼續道：\n\n\n\n  「老闆，感覺你真的運氣背到家了，自家墳頭老是被盜，先是上輩子的屍體被人挫骨揚灰當成黑芝麻糊給吃了。\n\n\n\n  然後這個屍體，又被人當盆栽種，嘖嘖，老闆，貧道本行是給人看墓穴的，下次你再打算死的話，找貧道我，貧道肯定給你選一個安全的…………」\n\n\n\n  老道越說越激動，但一看周澤的目光，他的聲音又慢慢地低下去了。\n\n\n\n  「去前面看看，下面到底是什麼東西。」周澤對老道說道。\n\n\n\n  「嗯？」\n\n\n\n  老道悚然一驚。\n\n\n\n  臥槽，\n\n\n\n  我就是一個打醬油的，負責在旁邊舔包喊6666的，\n\n\n\n  你叫我去前面看？\n\n\n\n  老道把目光看向了唐詩，希望唐小姐否定老闆這個明顯帶著公報私仇的命令。 \n\n\n\n  但沒想到唐詩直接點點頭，附和道：\n\n\n\n  「也好。」\n\n\n\n  「…………」老道。\n\n\n\n  老道沒辦法，只能硬著頭皮慢慢地往前走。\n\n\n\n  「不用擔心太多，剛剛那個東西明顯是在這裡受到了限制，所以八十年來，它明顯發生了異變，甚至被什麼玩意兒給鵲巢鳩占了，但依舊沒辦法離開這裡。\n\n\n\n  而我和你老闆都是『鬼』，你是活人，不會刺激到下面可能存在的東西。」\n\n\n\n  唐詩在後面給老道解釋道。\n\n\n\n  聞言，老道心裡踏實了不少，湊過去之後，手電筒向下照一下，然後伸頭快速瞥了一眼。\n\n\n\n  「老闆，下面像是一口井，還有水。」老道招呼道。\n\n\n\n  周澤和唐詩這才靠近過去，果然，下面不是什麼洞穴，而是一口井。\n\n\n\n  「下面怎麼辦，誰知道當初你是怎麼靈魂出去的？」唐詩蹲在旁邊，有些無奈地整理了一下自己的頭髮，「或者，我們就離開吧，等明天專家組下來，等他們發現這裡之後讓他們想辦法用炸彈炸掉他，反正他也逃脫不出去。」\n\n\n\n  「你認為會炸掉他？」周澤反問道，「如果他們發現這具身體的話。」\n\n\n\n  「嗯？」\n\n\n\n  「一個明明死成這樣還能活動的身體，這無分國界，無分意識，他們肯定也會忍不住帶回去當作研究對象的。」 \n\n\n\n  「那不也挺好，你可以為現代醫學做出屬於自己的貢獻。」唐詩一副無所謂的樣子。\n\n\n\n  「你長得很漂亮。」周澤說道。\n\n\n\n  「謝謝。」\n\n\n\n  「但現在你知道有多少少男因為沒錢或者沒機會每天積攢的那種生理需求沒地方發泄麼，為什麼你不去幫幫他們？」\n\n\n\n  唐詩眼中紫色的光芒一閃即逝，顯然，她生氣了。\n\n\n\n  她記得以前的周澤不是這樣子的，\n\n\n\n  確實，\n\n\n\n  人是會變的。\n\n\n\n  尤其是當你發現自己的實力已經沒必要對面前的人卑躬屈膝的時候，這是人之常情，而最不習慣的，往往是以前站在高處的那一方。\n\n\n\n  「喂喂喂，兩位，別吵了，別吵了，下面水開始沸騰了。」\n\n\n\n  老道指著下面說道，他是知道唐詩的性格的，也清楚自家老闆經歷了一次屍體被盜之後的憤怒，現在他發現自己的屍體又出問題了，肯定是難以接受的。\n\n\n\n  井口裡的水開始「咕嘟咕嘟」的沸騰起來，\n\n\n\n  隨即，\n\n\n\n  水面開始迅速地上升，像是地下泉水開始湧出來一樣。\n\n\n\n  一時間，\n\n\n\n  水位甚至沒過了洞穴，開始向四周瀰漫起來，這節奏和速率，比消防栓炸裂更加的恐怖。 \n\n\n\n  一隻只老鼠再次被沖了上來，緊隨其後的是很多草莖樹枝一類的東西。\n\n\n\n  水的噴涌速度越來越快，甚至聽得下面像是有什麼東西叫了一聲，水流速度又增大了好幾倍。\n\n\n\n  一時間，研究所里的水位已經到了人的腰部位置。\n\n\n\n  唐詩身體下意識地後退，讓四周的水流距離自己遠一些，但是在下一刻，一隻手忽然在水下抓住了她的腳踝。\n\n\n\n  「嗖！」\n\n\n\n  兩道玻璃片瞬間切入水面之下，但只看見下面的水流一陣激盪，唐詩整個人被抓著倒翻進了水下。\n\n\n\n  進入水下之後，唐詩才看見剛剛那個爬出來又被拖拽回去的殘破身體居然在悄無聲息間再度爬了出來。\n\n\n\n  腳踝位置刺骨的疼痛和冰冷，四周的水流在自己的念力操控之下瘋狂地衝擊那個軀體，但對方就像是一塊大噸位鋼板一樣，巋然不動！\n\n\n\n  「噗通！」\n\n\n\n  就在這時，\n\n\n\n  周澤沒入了水中，直接撲向了那個殘軀，十指指甲毫不留情地刺入對方的頭骨之中，絲毫沒有因為對方是自己以前的身體而手下留情。\n\n\n\n  「吼！」\n\n\n\n  殘軀張開嘴，鬆開了唐詩的腳踝，而後雙手死死地扣住周澤的脖子，兩個人竟然糾纏扭打在了一起。 \n\n\n\n  「咕嘟…………咕嘟…………咕嘟………………」\n\n\n\n  水面之下又開始傳來聲響，而此時老道則是站在辦公桌上，他的頭頂都快觸碰到天花板了，見唐詩浮出水面，馬上伸手把她給拉拽了過來。\n\n\n\n  「老闆呢？老闆呢？」\n\n\n\n  唐詩沉著臉，也顧不得看自己還在流血的腳踝位置，直接雙手放入水面之下，而後發出了一聲厲喝。\n\n\n\n  「嘩啦…………」\n\n\n\n  幾乎快充斥滿這間實驗室的水面一下子被分裂開，露出了周澤和那個殘軀的身影。\n\n\n\n  殘軀不停地在拉扯著周澤，但周澤的十指指甲卻死死地嵌入對方的頭骨之中。\n\n\n\n  然而，可以清晰地看出來，殘軀的目標根本就不是周澤，他還在堅定地向一個方向走來，就是唐詩所在的方向。\n\n\n\n  一時間，\n\n\n\n  冥冥之中，\n\n\n\n  唐詩產生了一種預感，\n\n\n\n  那個東西想要的，不是和他有千絲萬縷關係的周澤，而是自己！\n\n\n\n  這到底是怎麼回事？\n\n\n\n  「呼嚕嚕…………呼嚕嚕…………」\n\n\n\n  水流開始急促地旋轉，之前覆蓋整個實驗室的書面開始迅速地下降，就像是放滿水的浴缸被拔了塞子一樣。 \n\n\n\n  龐大的漩渦本身就帶著一種天然的吸扯力，外加在失去了這些水的庇護和遮掩之後，又重新爬出洞穴的殘軀再度感受到了那種可怕的排斥和禁錮的力量，他的身體在極度不甘心之下開始迅速地後滑動，直致又落入了洞穴之中。\n\n\n\n  而他一直死死抓著的周澤，\n\n\n\n  這一次也沒能倖免，\n\n\n\n  只聽得一聲石頭落水的聲響，\n\n\n\n  周澤和殘軀一起落入了井裡。\n\n\n\n  四周完全風平浪靜，\n\n\n\n  甚至在地上連一滴水漬都沒有留下來，\n\n\n\n  還是乾的。",

    "content": "「咕嘟…………咕嘟…………」\n\n\n\n  周澤記得自己好幾次沉入過水中了，但那時候要麼是在地獄要麼是在夢裡，尤其是在經過那個碰見無面女的水潭時。\n\n\n\n  但這次不同，這次的窒息感和危機感是那麼的強烈，從他被拉拽著下來開始，他清楚，自己的生命就開始進入了倒計時。\n\n\n\n  沒後悔那個時候跑去救唐詩，哪怕二人剛剛還吵了架，唐詩臭婆娘脾氣周老闆也很是看不慣，仿佛這個世界上除了那個「瞎子」，其他男人他都看不上眼的樣子。\n\n\n\n  但不管怎麼樣，唐詩這次是特意從上海過來幫自己的，自己如果那個時候作壁上觀也未免有些太不厚道。\n\n\n\n  當時也沒想太多的東西，就像是當初在著火的電影院裡，自己也沒多想，就直接往火堆里去跑準備救人了。\n\n\n\n  最重要的是，唐詩雖然有時候看起來很強大，但她的身體是一個很大的弱點，一旦被近身之後，她就很難有什麼辦法，自己至少還有一搏的機會。\n\n\n\n  「咕嘟…………咕嘟…………」\n\n\n\n  氣泡不斷地從口齒間和鼻尖冒出，肺部的空氣開始越來越少。\n\n\n\n  但那個殘缺的只剩下半張臉的身體還是死死地抓著自己，草莖締結出來的藤蔓不斷地交叉編織著，完善出了另外半張臉。\n\n\n\n  左邊原本的臉依舊平靜，但右邊綠色的臉則是帶著清晰的猙獰，仿佛帶著滔天的怨氣，根本不像是一個人，更像是另外的一種意識形態表現。 \n\n\n\n  對方好像很恨自己，恨自己沒讓他抓的成唐詩？\n\n\n\n  他想要抓唐詩下來的目的，又是什麼？\n\n\n\n  「噗…………」\n\n\n\n  對方壓著自己繼續往下，其實也沒多深的樣子，從洞**到下面也就十幾米的深度，但在下方，周澤看見了一個老樹根盤踞在那裡，樹根沒有想像中那麼的大，恰恰相反的是它顯得很是「苗條」，但又看起來格外地精緻，一張似男似女的臉在樹根中部不停地扭曲著。\n\n\n\n  在這張臉上，周澤看見了滿滿的怨念。\n\n\n\n  這種感覺，很難以形象，就像是一個壯年小伙給他下了大量的烈性chun藥，捆綁著他的雙手雙腳然後強迫著他看成人動作片，每一秒都是劇烈的煎熬，何況這貨估計被煎熬了不少年了。\n\n\n\n  「砰！」\n\n\n\n  周澤被按壓在了樹根旁邊，樹根上的那張臉看向了周澤，那張臉一開始是憤怒和不屑，但慢慢的，那張臉又出現了新的情緒。\n\n\n\n  震驚、\n\n\n\n  恐懼、\n\n\n\n  惶恐、\n\n\n\n  然後又是疑惑，\n\n\n\n  最後，\n\n\n\n  變成了狂喜！\n\n\n\n  川劇變臉聞名天下，但這樹根的表情表現比變臉更加地傳神。 \n\n\n\n  「是…………你…………」\n\n\n\n  樹根內部居然傳來了話語聲，天知道這聲音是怎麼在水中傳播的，周澤竟然也能聽得到，只是有一點點的不清楚和嘈雜。\n\n\n\n  你認出我來了？\n\n\n\n  周澤心想。\n\n\n\n  然後周澤又有些不好意思，\n\n\n\n  的確是不好意思，\n\n\n\n  你看，\n\n\n\n  人家都認出自己來了，\n\n\n\n  但我自己本人卻還不認識自己。\n\n\n\n  「滋滋滋…………」\n\n\n\n  樹根的藤蔓開始激動地顫抖起來，顯然，它一開始是沒認出周澤的，所以才選擇先抓唐詩，至於它抓唐詩的目的，現在周澤好像也能猜到一些，它想挪窩！\n\n\n\n  它被困在了這裡，\n\n\n\n  哪怕它的藤蔓將那具失去靈魂的殘缺身體給控制住，但它不曉得是什麼原因，也被死死地釘在了這裡，它要抓唐詩可能是因為控制了唐詩後有機會幫它脫困。\n\n\n\n  但現在周澤都能感知到這樹根已經有點失去理智了，大部分影視文學作品裡，樹精都顯得很是沉穩睿智，基本是以老爺爺的形象見人，然而周澤眼前這貨卻像是嗑藥嗑嗨了一樣，跳起了霹靂舞。\n\n\n\n  「你…………死…………」 \n\n\n\n  那聲音又傳來了，\n\n\n\n  帶著一種陰森和怨毒！\n\n\n\n  與此同時，那殘缺的身體開始更加瘋狂地撕扯自己的身體，這次，他是動真格的了！\n\n\n\n  濃重的危機感襲來，\n\n\n\n  之前對方可能是存著省力氣把自己拖到水下淹死讓自己自生自滅的心思，\n\n\n\n  現在，對方是想親手殺死自己，體驗復仇的快感。\n\n\n\n  而周澤，之前其實也是在多等等多看看，畢竟不到真正萬不得已的時刻，周老闆真不想進入殭屍狀態，這意味著他回去之後又要躺半個月。\n\n\n\n  但這次是沒辦法了，看著幾乎和自己貼著臉的那傢伙，周澤張開了嘴，兩根獠牙迅速生長出來，同時身體開始迅速脫水，變得乾癟起來，眼眸深處，更是被綠色的光芒所覆蓋，他的氣質也完全發生了變化，變得癲狂和恣意！\n\n\n\n  「吼！」\n\n\n\n  「吼！」\n\n\n\n  兩個人一起張開嘴，發出了咆哮，仿佛是被刺激到的老虎，正在宣示著屬於自己的威嚴！\n\n\n\n  若是畫面在此定格，仔細觀察的話，你甚至能夠發現二人咆哮時的神態有著極大的相似之處。\n\n\n\n  「轟！轟！轟！！！！！！！」\n\n\n\n  一連串的恐怖暴擊聲從下方傳來， \n\n\n\n  周澤像是一頭髮了瘋的餓狼，拼命地撕扯著面前的這具殘缺卻無比堅韌的身體，可以看得出來，周澤占盡了絕對的優勢。\n\n\n\n  畢竟，\n\n\n\n  面前這具殘缺的身體，早就不再是八十年前那一天大殺四方的那位了，一個只是曾經的殼兒，而且是一個破裂的殼兒，而周澤這裡，則是有著曾經的內在核心！\n\n\n\n  殘軀被踹開，四周，無數根藤蔓忽然席捲過來，細如髮絲的它們開始纏繞住周澤的身體。\n\n\n\n  「砰！」\n\n\n\n  周澤身體一顫，\n\n\n\n  那樹根也是一顫，\n\n\n\n  但卻仍然將周澤限制住了。\n\n\n\n  剛剛被周澤踹飛出去的殘缺身體又再度沖了回來，張開嘴，直接咬中了周澤的脖頸位置，他整個人就趴在周澤的身上，瘋狂無比。\n\n\n\n  「你…………死…………」\n\n\n\n  樹根興奮地顫抖著。\n\n\n\n  此情此景，比它自己脫困都更能讓他激動，甚至，它願意以自己脫困為交換，以此來徹底葬送那個人的靈魂！\n\n\n\n  這個人，\n\n\n\n  當初欺騙了自己，\n\n\n\n  害得自己錯過了化形的機會，讓自己一直被困鎖在這裡，只能停留在這方寸之地間。 \n\n\n\n  這種恨，\n\n\n\n  比天高，比海深！\n\n\n\n  「宿命…………報應…………」\n\n\n\n  對方獰笑著。\n\n\n\n  周澤身體不停地在顫抖，像是在試圖反抗，但全身上下的細細藤蔓仿佛是這個世界上最為可怕的鐵鏈，死死地鎖住了周澤全身。\n\n\n\n  樹根在以自己的力量，\n\n\n\n  控制著周澤，壓制著周澤。\n\n\n\n  這還是周澤自從能開「無雙」以來，第一次遇到自己被壓制的情況，要知道以前可都是神擋殺神佛擋殺佛，無往不利的。\n\n\n\n  當然了，現在的周澤根本就失去了思考能力，腦子裡，現在只剩下那種叫做「瘋狂」的情緒。\n\n\n\n  這種僵持，持續了大概十分鐘的時間；\n\n\n\n  樹根開始萎靡下去，顯然它也開始力竭了，但周澤氣息的削弱更是明顯。\n\n\n\n  上次在將軍山，因為長時間進入殭屍狀態，肉身幾乎崩潰，也因此，周澤進入殭屍狀態的時間真的很短很短，根本維繫不了太長。\n\n\n\n  原本周澤脖頸位置的肌肉是完全緊縮著的，現在也鬆弛了下來，殘缺身體的獠牙直接撕裂了周澤脖頸的一塊血肉。\n\n\n\n  「噗…………」\n\n\n\n  鮮血開始瀰漫開來， \n\n\n\n  周澤脖頸位置裂了一個大洞，腦袋幾乎就剩下一點點的皮肉還維繫牽連在脖子上。\n\n\n\n  眼眸中的綠光慢慢地暗淡下來，\n\n\n\n  身上的反抗力量也在越來越式微。\n\n\n\n  樹根更加地激動，它甚至讓那殘破的身體離開了周澤，轉而用自己那密密麻麻的藤蔓將周澤的身體給裹挾了過來。\n\n\n\n  它不能動，\n\n\n\n  但是它要欣賞這個仇人最後的臨死畫面！\n\n\n\n  這是一甲子以來，它最開心的時刻！\n\n\n\n  除了脖子傷口位置，周澤身體其他位置也開始溢出鮮血，每次進入殭屍狀態之後，身體都會因為承受不住這種壓力而龜裂，皮開肉綻。\n\n\n\n  這一次，\n\n\n\n  也不例外。\n\n\n\n  「呵呵…………報應…………宿命…………天譴…………」\n\n\n\n  樹根每次說話都只能說兩個字，此時此刻，它不停地宣洩著自己內心的怒火和幸災樂禍。\n\n\n\n  多麼美妙的一件事啊，\n\n\n\n  一甲子之前坑得自己被鎖困在這裡自此無法動彈一步的罪魁禍首，\n\n\n\n  居然在六十年後自己送到了自己面前，\n\n\n\n  而且還變得這般的虛弱！ \n\n\n\n  這是天意，\n\n\n\n  這是上天睜眼！\n\n\n\n  作為曾有化形機會的妖物，他被那個傢伙坑得太慘太慘了。\n\n\n\n  殘破的身體懸浮在一邊，一動不動，昔日的身體現在被樹根所控制，成了最忠誠的傀儡和打手。\n\n\n\n  「報應…………宿命…………一個…………甲子…………」\n\n\n\n  樹根看著飄浮在自己面前，生命體徵正在越來越弱的周澤，不停地揮舞著自己的藤蔓，載歌載舞。\n\n\n\n  它要靜靜地看著他，\n\n\n\n  近距離地看著他，\n\n\n\n  看著他死，\n\n\n\n  看得他死得透透的！\n\n\n\n  然而，\n\n\n\n  就在這時，\n\n\n\n  周澤那雙原本早就暗淡下去的眼眸忽然綻放出了刺目的綠光，\n\n\n\n  之前，\n\n\n\n  周澤的脖子被那殘缺身體咬掉了一大塊肉，現在只剩下一點點的皮肉和自己的脖子相連著，但這時候，反而得以順利讓其將頭甩了幾乎兩三百度，直接撞向了樹根的面部。\n\n\n\n  兩顆獠牙精準狠地刺了進去，\n\n\n\n  掀翻了樹根的表皮，\n\n\n\n  張開嘴， \n\n\n\n  將裡頭發著光的綠色果實給吞入了口中，且慢慢地咀嚼著，\n\n\n\n  「嘎嘣……嘎嘣……」\n\n\n\n  脆得很！\n\n\n\n  樹根的身體開始抽搐起來，\n\n\n\n  它不敢相信眼前所發生的一切。\n\n\n\n  「等了你…………六十年…………你終於…………熟了…………」\n\n\n\n  周澤一邊咀嚼著嘴裡的東西一邊用一種沙啞的聲音緩緩道：\n\n\n\n  「還有…………\n\n\n\n  六十年了…………\n\n\n\n  你還是那麼的…………\n\n\n\n  好騙。」",

    "content": "我種下一顆種子，\n\n\n\n  終於長出了果實，\n\n\n\n  今天是個偉大日子……\n\n\n\n  此時，果子已經被咀嚼碎了，化作了青綠色的煙霧，慢慢地自周澤的眼耳口鼻之中逸散出來，而後又順著軀幹位置向下籠罩。\n\n\n\n  之前周澤脖子幾乎斷裂了，但他還是在吃果子，顯然，他清楚，這果子並不需要直接通過食道去消化。\n\n\n\n  而那樹根在失去了這枚原本藏身在其最深處的果子之後，慢慢地開始枯萎，它帶著強烈的不甘，帶著難以描述的憤恨。\n\n\n\n  它做夢都想不到，到最後時，居然是這樣子的一個結局。\n\n\n\n  天譴，\n\n\n\n  復仇，\n\n\n\n  因果，\n\n\n\n  最終都成了一句狗屁，至少，對於它來說，確實如此。\n\n\n\n  然而，\n\n\n\n  就在這時，\n\n\n\n  那道殘缺的身體忽然再度顫慄起來，直接沖向了周澤，老樹根以最後一點點的生命精華，化作了復仇的凶焰，無論如何，它要周澤死！\n\n\n\n  只是，\n\n\n\n  那殘缺的身體在剛剛靠近周澤時就忽然停了下來，\n\n\n\n  不光是停下， \n\n\n\n  而且還主動伸手將周澤之前快要掉下去的頭給撐著，讓那綠光在那裡環繞。\n\n\n\n  「這肉身……你當是………留給……你的？」\n\n\n\n  周澤的聲音裡帶著一抹戲謔，仿佛是一盤圍棋，他已經占據了優勢，在對手已然回天無力時，再點評幾番，別有滋味。\n\n\n\n  「他………是我留下的………護園工。」\n\n\n\n  殘缺的身體主動伸手，將自己另一半臉上的草莖直接扯斷，整個動作很是生硬，而後更是將手指探入自己的眼窩子之中，硬生生地將裡頭的草也都拉扯出來。\n\n\n\n  雖然拉扯出來的是草莖，但這種畫面感，不亞於是在生撕自己的血肉。\n\n\n\n  完完全全地完成了反戈一擊。\n\n\n\n  周澤眼眸里的綠色正在慢慢的暗淡下去，而他脖頸位置，則是在以肉眼可見的速度血肉重生著。\n\n\n\n  「嗯？」\n\n\n\n  一聲輕疑自周澤身上發出，\n\n\n\n  「你……在反抗我？」\n\n\n\n  像是在自言自語，其實也真的是在自言自語。\n\n\n\n  「沒有我…………你早死了…………不知道多少次了…………」\n\n\n\n  語氣，和之前面對樹根時，一模一樣。\n\n\n\n  忽然間，周澤眼眸里綠色開始不停地閃爍，時而清明，時而疑惑，時而憤怒，時而又顯得很是彷徨。 \n\n\n\n  「你是…………誕生於我的靈智…………但你…………要清楚…………你也是我的…………一部分！」\n\n\n\n  「嗡！」\n\n\n\n  周澤的身體開始顫抖起來，\n\n\n\n  這種來自內部的反抗帶著一種好不服軟的架勢。\n\n\n\n  下一刻，\n\n\n\n  周澤眼眶中的綠光開始消散，而後，身體開始慢慢地向上浮上去。\n\n\n\n  而那殘缺的身體，則是默默地隱入水底，連帶著那顆已經腐朽乾枯的老樹根一起，慢慢地向下潛去。\n\n\n\n  明明並不是很驚人的水深，但此時卻像是化作了一道可怖的深淵，將二者一起吞噬，不知道最後到底會降入哪裡。\n\n\n\n  人世間，有人世間的規則，凡是不屬於人世間的存在，都將受到壓制和抹殺，普通人有著他們自己的人生軌跡，任何膽敢窺覷不屬於自己所應該觸碰東西的人，也必然會遭受懲罰。\n\n\n\n  八十年前，\n\n\n\n  幾乎失心瘋的日本人將這具殘缺的肉身找到，運送到了這裡，企圖獲得超越人類思維極限的力量，最終的結果則是屍體發瘋，將這裡化作了人間煉獄。\n\n\n\n  冥冥之中，\n\n\n\n  仿佛有一隻手，\n\n\n\n  於黑幕之中， \n\n\n\n  正在調整和糾正著一切，\n\n\n\n  它講究一個，\n\n\n\n  涇渭分明。\n\n\n\n  ………………\n\n\n\n  「咕嘟…………咕嘟…………咕嘟…………」\n\n\n\n  水，\n\n\n\n  又是水，\n\n\n\n  又是這該死的水，\n\n\n\n  周澤現在很討厭水，非常非常地討厭，他已經膩煩了液體充斥自己耳膜的聲響，也厭惡了自己肺部被擠壓時的窒息感。\n\n\n\n  慢慢地，\n\n\n\n  他睜開眼，\n\n\n\n  他看見自己正躺在魚缸里，身穿著泳裝的白鶯鶯正在給自己擦拭搓洗著身體。\n\n\n\n  而且，\n\n\n\n  白鶯鶯是背對著他的，正在幫他擦拭和在熱水中按摩大腿位置。\n\n\n\n  有點醫學常識的人都清楚，一個人如果在床上躺得時間久了，很容易生褥瘡，甚至會導致其他方面肌體的毛病。\n\n\n\n  久病床前是否有無孝子，可以看床上病人身上是否有褥瘡。\n\n\n\n  周澤剛準備動一下，\n\n\n\n  全身上下忽然傳來了極為清晰強烈的刺痛感，這種刺痛感不是來自於皮肉，而是來自於神經位置。 \n\n\n\n  「噗通…………」\n\n\n\n  身體一顫，\n\n\n\n  周澤直接滑入了浴缸之中，\n\n\n\n  把正在踮著腳給周澤擦拭身體的白鶯鶯也給帶倒，\n\n\n\n  一時間，\n\n\n\n  周澤只感覺有兩團肉乎乎極為柔軟的東西壓在了自己的臉上，且中間部分，還有這大夏天吃並欺凌時的冰涼。\n\n\n\n  哪怕是在熱水之中，\n\n\n\n  這種冰涼還是讓人有些難以接受，\n\n\n\n  尤其是周澤這種身體正處於極為脆弱甚至可以說是散架邊緣的病號來說，這一下子，相當於有人拿著磚頭大的冰給他臉上一砸。\n\n\n\n  「咕嘟…………」\n\n\n\n  周澤剎那間又再度陷入了昏厥之中。\n\n\n\n  「呀，老闆！」\n\n\n\n  白鶯鶯尖叫了一聲，馬上起身將周澤的臉又拉出了水面。\n\n\n\n  有些擔心地伸手摸了摸周澤的臉，判斷周澤鼻息還算正常後，白鶯鶯才長舒一口氣，如釋重負。\n\n\n\n  如果自家老闆真的被自己，\n\n\n\n  一臉懵逼，\n\n\n\n  然後悶死了，\n\n\n\n  那玩笑可就開大啦。\n\n\n\n  ……………… \n\n\n\n  第二次醒來時，又是兩天後了，醒來時，周澤發現自己正躺在…………額，我這是躺在哪裡？\n\n\n\n  下面不是床，\n\n\n\n  而是窗台位置的晾衣杆，\n\n\n\n  自己整個人，居然是懸浮在空中！\n\n\n\n  這是又做夢了麼？\n\n\n\n  那我繼續睡好了。\n\n\n\n  閉上眼，\n\n\n\n  等過了大概幾分鐘，\n\n\n\n  周澤又嘗試睜開眼，\n\n\n\n  自己怎麼還是在這個夢裡？\n\n\n\n  飄浮在窗台位置，太陽曬在自己身上。\n\n\n\n  這時候，周澤扭過頭，發現窗戶邊緣位置，坐著正在看書的唐詩。\n\n\n\n  「搞什麼？」\n\n\n\n  唐詩抬起頭，看向周澤，然後拿起旁邊的咖啡杯，喝了一口。\n\n\n\n  不用想，\n\n\n\n  周澤清楚這個女人肯定喝的是自己特意買來的很貴的貓屎咖啡！\n\n\n\n  店裡有很多雀巢速溶啊，你去喝那個啊！\n\n\n\n  「對於病人來說，曬曬太陽，好像有好處，你是醫生，應該懂這個道理。」\n\n\n\n  「那你可以給我放輪椅上推出去曬曬太陽。」 \n\n\n\n  周澤有些莞爾，\n\n\n\n  把自己用念力懸浮出去，\n\n\n\n  跟曬衣服一樣掛陽台上曬，\n\n\n\n  好羞恥啊。\n\n\n\n  「輪椅麼？老道那裡倒是有一個輪椅，就是按一個按鈕還能『嘟嘟嘟』自己跑的那種，我覺得你會不喜歡，所以沒讓你去坐那個。」\n\n\n\n  「謝謝。」\n\n\n\n  周澤這是真心感謝，\n\n\n\n  老道那個輪椅居然還在？\n\n\n\n  試想一下，\n\n\n\n  以後萬一哪一天老道或者許清朗拿出手機給自己看一個視頻，視頻上自己坐在電動輪椅上，旁邊還在「嘟嘟嘟」放著兒歌，這簡直就是最黑的黑歷史。\n\n\n\n  「現在，放我下來。」\n\n\n\n  唐詩點點頭，周澤被從窗台位置挪動到了床上。\n\n\n\n  「你醒了，沒事了吧？」唐詩問道，「你這次昏迷了二十天，真夠久的。」\n\n\n\n  「你怎麼沒回上海？」周澤問道。\n\n\n\n  事兒都解決了，你怎麼還留在這裡？\n\n\n\n  你留這裡就算了，\n\n\n\n  我知道你也不會幫忙招呼客人不會幫忙賺錢，\n\n\n\n  不把客人用鋼筆戳死就已經算是你天大的貢獻了， \n\n\n\n  而且你留在這裡還喝我的貓屎咖啡？？？\n\n\n\n  唐詩沒回答這個問題，她的性格就是這樣，明明是因為周澤那一晚在研究所算是救了她一把，她覺得自己應該留在這裡等周澤醒來，否則就覺得有些過意不去，但想要讓她說出來，難。\n\n\n\n  「要我去喊白鶯鶯麼？」唐詩問道。\n\n\n\n  「先不用，我有點事情想問你。」周澤說道。\n\n\n\n  「什麼事？」\n\n\n\n  「我覺得，我身體裡存在著一個東西。」\n\n\n\n  「看出來了，就像奧特曼變身一樣。」唐詩又喝了一口咖啡，\n\n\n\n  「那一晚，你掉下去了，然後你又浮出來了。\n\n\n\n  然後，事情就解決了。」\n\n\n\n  周澤的心在滴血。\n\n\n\n  「怎麼了，一般人還羨慕不來呢，鳴人的九尾封印，奧特曼的變身，誰不想自己體內封印著強大的力量？」\n\n\n\n  唐詩說著勾了勾小指頭，「你對我態度的轉變，不也是因為你有那個力量作為依仗麼？」\n\n\n\n  「問題的關鍵是，它在發生變化。」\n\n\n\n  周澤很嚴肅地說道，\n\n\n\n  「一開始，我能感覺到，它是無意識的，一個無意識的東西，無所謂，是吧，我想用就拿來用。 \n\n\n\n  副作用無非就是在床上躺半個月。\n\n\n\n  但現在，\n\n\n\n  隨著用的次數的變多，我發現它在變化，我清楚地感知到它的意識，甚至，還能感覺到它的意識和思維正在不斷地完善。\n\n\n\n  隨著我一次次激發出它甦醒，它也在做著自我的修補。\n\n\n\n  像是一個人，它在不斷地療傷，不斷地復原。\n\n\n\n  我每次使用它應對危局時，\n\n\n\n  它在幫我解決問題的同時，也會給自己弄點補品，我的大部分敵人和對手，都成了它的口糧。」\n\n\n\n  唐詩聞言，面色也開始凝重起來，同時道：\n\n\n\n  「所以，你是在擔心？」\n\n\n\n  「對，我是在擔心，\n\n\n\n  甚至開始感到恐懼；\n\n\n\n  因為，\n\n\n\n  有可能，\n\n\n\n  當我下次讓它甦醒時，\n\n\n\n  就是它徹底取代我的時候。」",

    "content": "周澤醒了，\n\n\n\n  這件事，\n\n\n\n  沒有在這個書店裡掀起太大的波瀾。\n\n\n\n  許清朗依舊在敷臉，給自己做著臉部按摩。\n\n\n\n  老道依舊在直播，猴子幫他拍攝。\n\n\n\n  死侍繼續坐在書店角落，除了哪裡髒了，否則他絕不會起身動一下。\n\n\n\n  就連白鶯鶯，也還在自己房間裡吃雞，一直等到那一把結束她才放下耳機來到周澤單獨的臥室房間裡。\n\n\n\n  老闆醒了，\n\n\n\n  該咋樣咋樣唄，反正老闆經常睡。\n\n\n\n  你不能怪這家店的店員都太冷漠，換做你身處於一個老闆經常消失半個月一個月不會醒來的公司企業里，你也會變得和他們一樣的散漫………墮落。\n\n\n\n  在白鶯鶯的幫助下，周澤洗了澡，換了身衣服坐在了底樓靠窗的熟悉位置。\n\n\n\n  陽光明媚，最是宜人，但周澤好像覺得自己之前才「甦醒」過來沒多久。\n\n\n\n  這種忽然昏迷半個月的情況以後得少來了，否則人家過一個月的日子，自己才過了兩天，壽命明顯是一樣的，但自己總覺過得虧得慌。\n\n\n\n  最重要的是，周澤有點不敢讓那個意識再甦醒了。\n\n\n\n  借著陽光和煦，周澤思量了一下。 \n\n\n\n  不讓那個意識再甦醒的前提條件，就是自己不能再落入一個很尷尬很危險的境地，一個超出了自己現在能力所能解決和遇到的困境。\n\n\n\n  而不讓自己落入束手無策的險境，就要求自己懂得足夠的趨利避害，避免麻煩。\n\n\n\n  而不讓自己招惹過大的麻煩先決條件就是自己要足夠的冷靜，學會躲避麻煩，讓麻煩不要找到自己。\n\n\n\n  所以，\n\n\n\n  還是要做鹹魚啊，\n\n\n\n  鹹魚才是王道，\n\n\n\n  要更加堅定和貫徹地鹹魚下去，\n\n\n\n  不看不聞不出門，\n\n\n\n  每天曬曬太陽，舒舒服服地喝喝咖啡，堅決不去搞事情也不讓事情搞自己。\n\n\n\n  周老闆之前只是覺得鹹魚很舒服，是自己的選擇，\n\n\n\n  現在，鹹魚真正地變成了生存準則了。\n\n\n\n  然而，周老闆剛醒，白鶯鶯正在幫周澤泡咖啡的時候，事情，就來了。\n\n\n\n  進門的，是張燕豐。\n\n\n\n  聽洗澡時白鶯鶯說，他這三周每隔兩天就來一次，都被他們以老闆出差為藉口搪塞過去了。\n\n\n\n  這次，張燕豐一進門就看見了周澤，然後馬上走了過來。\n\n\n\n  周澤低下了頭，側躺在沙發上，閉著眼，不想看見他啊。 \n\n\n\n  「看新聞了麼，那裡挖掘工作結束了，揭露了日本當年在中國的罪行，舉國譁然。」說著說著，張燕豐的神色有些尷尬，「就是研究所遺蹟里那些慘死的日本人讓這個宣傳口徑有些尷尬。」\n\n\n\n  「有你親戚的屍骨麼？」\n\n\n\n  「很難找了，一具一具地做DNA鑑定的話工程量太大，代價也太大，而且那裡還有焚化爐，說不定我那位親戚也早就被燒成灰了。」\n\n\n\n  「你看得開就好。」\n\n\n\n  「挖掘工作結束的那天，我晚上做夢時，發現自己腳上沒鐵鏈了，像是解開了一個心結一樣。」張燕豐笑著說道。\n\n\n\n  「恭喜恭喜。」\n\n\n\n  「對了，你最近去哪裡了？我來找你好多次了，你店員都說你不在。」\n\n\n\n  「去借錢去了。\n\n\n\n  你知道的，在南大街開書店生意真的不行，我又對這個書店有感情，所以需要借錢維繫這家店的運轉和存在。\n\n\n\n  唉，但沒借出來多少。」\n\n\n\n  「額…………」張燕豐有些尷尬地摸了摸自己的手背，道：「可惜了，我沒什麼錢，不然肯定會借給你。」\n\n\n\n  這時候，白鶯鶯把周澤的咖啡端過來，放在了桌上。\n\n\n\n  張燕豐以為是待客給自己準備的咖啡，道了一聲「謝謝」後就端起來自顧自地喝了。 \n\n\n\n  周澤的嘴角抽了抽，\n\n\n\n  心在滴血。\n\n\n\n  「我要出門借錢去了，耽擱不得，就不招待你了。」\n\n\n\n  周澤直接下了逐客令。\n\n\n\n  「額，我來找你是有事兒的。」\n\n\n\n  我知道你有事兒所以才讓你走的！\n\n\n\n  周老闆雙手捂住自己的太陽穴，痛苦道：\n\n\n\n  「頭疼，頭疼死了，錢啊，借不到錢，苦啊，愁啊，難啊…………」\n\n\n\n  「錢的事兒先不急。」\n\n\n\n  「…………」周澤。\n\n\n\n  周澤真的很想指著對方的鼻子開罵，\n\n\n\n  錢的事兒不急？\n\n\n\n  我信你是大公無私的人民好警察，但你這樣說話你的良心不會痛麼？\n\n\n\n  「一開始我來找你，是為了挖掘工作的事情，之後則是因為我想到了手頭上的一件滯留了很久沒進展的案子。\n\n\n\n  你之前說過我如果遇到很懸疑的案子可以來找你試試看，我就…………」\n\n\n\n  「我說過這句話麼？」周澤馬上問道。\n\n\n\n  「你說過，那天在公園裡。」\n\n\n\n  「那當不得真的，而且那時候我剛被你抓緊看守所，我懾於你的官威，所以才瞎說的。」 \n\n\n\n  「…………」張燕豐。\n\n\n\n  話題，似乎很難繼續下去了。\n\n\n\n  但張燕豐很快就繼續跟進，他把卷宗放上來，道：「這是那起案子的卷宗，我把能讓你看的部分拿來的，如果你想看更多的細節，可以到我辦公室里來看。\n\n\n\n  老實說，以前很多事情我是不信的。\n\n\n\n  我是一名黨員，我信馬列，而且是一名堅定的無神論者。」\n\n\n\n  周澤伸手把卷宗往外推了推，「對的嘛，我這種神棍你真的不應該和我靠得太近。」\n\n\n\n  「但***教育過我們，要依靠和團結一起可以團結的力量！」張燕豐說得義正言辭，「所以，我覺得你可能有能力給我在這件案子上提供一些看法和猜想。」\n\n\n\n  「我不是警察，就是一個開書店的負翁，參合你這種案子，不合適吧？」\n\n\n\n  「我可以給你警局顧問的身份。」\n\n\n\n  警局顧問？\n\n\n\n  上一個警局顧問現在眼睛還瞎著呢。\n\n\n\n  周澤下意識地抬頭看了看天花板，唐詩說她馬上要回去了，瞎子那邊還需要她的照顧。\n\n\n\n  「實話和你說吧，我現在不想去做其他的事情。」周澤嘆了口氣，「上次研究所的事兒，讓我付出了很大的代價。」 \n\n\n\n  「這樣吧，我不為難你，這個卷宗，我先放在你這裡，你想看的時候就看，反正是陳年舊案了。我先告辭了，謝謝款待。」\n\n\n\n  「結帳…………」\n\n\n\n  周澤喊了一聲，\n\n\n\n  但張燕豐像是沒聽見一樣直接走出了書店。\n\n\n\n  而坐在吧檯邊正在直播的老道顯然裝作沒聽見周澤的提示，\n\n\n\n  笑話，\n\n\n\n  你讓我去跟一個警官要錢？\n\n\n\n  貧道才沒那麼傻呢！\n\n\n\n  周澤覺得自家的書店迫切地需要一場整風行動，糾正這一股尸位素餐、貪圖享受不干正事的歪風邪氣！\n\n\n\n  「你醒了，我走了。」\n\n\n\n  唐詩從樓上走了下來，換了一身衣服，手裡拿著車鑰匙。\n\n\n\n  「再見。」\n\n\n\n  周澤對她揮揮手。\n\n\n\n  她點點頭，走出了書店。\n\n\n\n  「老闆，喝茶。」白鶯鶯端來一杯茶。\n\n\n\n  「咖啡呢？」周澤問道。\n\n\n\n  「剛剛泡出來的是最後一杯了，現在那種咖啡已經喝光了。」白鶯鶯回答道。\n\n\n\n  「喝沒了？」\n\n\n\n  周澤咬了咬嘴唇， \n\n\n\n  心，\n\n\n\n  痛得無法呼吸。\n\n\n\n  「這卷宗怎麼辦？」白鶯鶯指著桌上的卷宗問道。\n\n\n\n  「丟到我看不見的地方去。」周澤很是嫌棄地掃了一眼這個卷宗。\n\n\n\n  他才不會打開去看呢，也不想去了解有什麼冤屈，兇手有多殘忍，被害者有多可憐，情節有多惡劣。\n\n\n\n  看都不想看，就當自己完全不知道。\n\n\n\n  不知道就沒愧疚，沒愧疚就不會有事情，沒事情就不會有麻煩。\n\n\n\n  端起茶，喝了一口，周澤拿起自己的鬼差證看了一眼，那上面的績點很久沒漲了，而且一直停留在一個很低的位置。\n\n\n\n  皺了皺眉，\n\n\n\n  周澤覺得自己這陣子成天正事兒不做到處瞎折騰真的是一種罪過，現在看來自己得好好尋思尋思該去哪裡找鬼提升一下績點了。\n\n\n\n  但說實話，通城就這麼大一個城市，你讓它忽然一下子鬼滿為患，也不現實。\n\n\n\n  「對了，我上次叫你封存的彼岸花呢？」周澤問道。\n\n\n\n  「那個啊，林可中途來了一趟，把彼岸花拿走了，她去找辦法做成了密封的液體罐子，自己留了一部分，其他的都送回來了。」\n\n\n\n  周澤有些欣慰地點點頭， \n\n\n\n  一覺醒來，\n\n\n\n  總算是聽到了一件好消息。\n\n\n\n  這時候，周澤看向了許清朗，喊道：\n\n\n\n  「晚上吃什麼？」\n\n\n\n  許清朗摘下了臉上的面膜，看著周澤，像是見了鬼一樣，他是不清楚周澤現在對於可以「大快朵頤」這件事到底有多麼的渴望。\n\n\n\n  「行了，我出去買菜。」\n\n\n\n  許清朗一副無可奈何的樣子。\n\n\n\n  活脫脫地老公不爭氣，\n\n\n\n  整天死賴在家裡懶人一個，但自己還得捏著鼻子給他做飯吃的姿態。\n\n\n\n  「陪我出去走走，躺太久了。」\n\n\n\n  「好的，老闆。」\n\n\n\n  白鶯鶯攙扶著周澤走出了書店，\n\n\n\n  剛出門口，周澤就看見有一個拾荒老太婆模樣的人在自家書店櫥窗那邊摸摸索索著。\n\n\n\n  「去問問，幹嘛的。」周澤說道，因為看樣子那老太婆也不像是討飯的，對方雖然衣著破爛，但臉上和頭髮卻都顯得很乾淨，很是精神。\n\n\n\n  白鶯鶯跑去問了，老太婆連說帶比劃地跟白鶯鶯說著什麼。\n\n\n\n  周澤扶著旁邊的電線桿點了一根煙，還沒抽兩口鶯鶯就回來了， \n\n\n\n  「老闆，問清楚，她說她在找東西。」\n\n\n\n  「找什麼東西？」\n\n\n\n  「找花。」",

    "content": "拿煙的手，\n\n\n\n  微微顫抖。\n\n\n\n  剛剛發下大宏願，\n\n\n\n  立志做好一隻好好偷懶天天犯困的鹹魚，\n\n\n\n  誰成想，\n\n\n\n  這宏願還熱乎著呢，\n\n\n\n  但麻煩，就上門了。\n\n\n\n  上次的土墳，進去後的小街春樓，癩頭和尚的紙人分身，再加上自己從那裡順回來當調味品的彼岸花。\n\n\n\n  最讓周澤頭痛的是，\n\n\n\n  這「大快朵頤」自己還沒體驗呢，\n\n\n\n  失主就找上門來了。\n\n\n\n  當然了，要說愧疚，這還真沒有。\n\n\n\n  周老闆也沒有當小偷偷了別人家東西的負罪感，\n\n\n\n  那幫人布置了那個小結界，吸引附近的亡魂過去，把他們當作了飼料，讓他們供養彼岸花，活脫脫地把原本可以下黃泉進地獄投胎的亡魂折磨得廢了，斷絕了往生的機會。\n\n\n\n  這是很損陰德的事兒，周澤沒吹噓自己是「替天行道」已經算是含蓄的了，哪還會因為這件事而有負罪感？\n\n\n\n  「我的花，花呢？」\n\n\n\n  老太婆哆哆嗦嗦地走到了周澤面前，伸手抓住了周澤的肩膀，那凹陷下去的眼眸里，帶著一種絕望和瘋狂，拼命地搖晃著周澤的身體，大喊大叫著。 \n\n\n\n  周老闆剛剛從昏迷中甦醒，身子骨還孱弱著呢，這老太婆看似弱不禁風的，但還真有一把子力氣，硬是將周老闆搖得快憋過氣兒去了。\n\n\n\n  「放開手！」\n\n\n\n  白鶯鶯馬上伸手提開了老太婆，老太婆身體向後一倒，然後直接摔在了地上，昏迷了過去。\n\n\n\n  「……」白鶯鶯。\n\n\n\n  「……」周澤。\n\n\n\n  「老闆，這是碰瓷兒的？」白鶯鶯問道。\n\n\n\n  周澤也皺了皺眉，想了想，不應該啊，當初自己也曾和小蘿莉思考過布置那個結界養彼岸花的人，無論對方是活人還是死人，無論是在陽間還是在地獄，至少也該是有點頭臉的人物吧？\n\n\n\n  普通人，沒資格更沒那種本事有那麼大的手筆。\n\n\n\n  但這上門討債的老太婆，也太弱雞了吧？\n\n\n\n  白鶯鶯一推，\n\n\n\n  就昏過去了？\n\n\n\n  想訛錢？\n\n\n\n  周老闆倒是不介意花點冥鈔或者人民幣把對方餵飽送走，比起這件事可能引起的連鎖麻煩，周澤覺得花錢消災完全是可取的。\n\n\n\n  畢竟，\n\n\n\n  在意識到自己以前最大的依仗變成了最大的火藥桶之後，周澤的心態也發生了一些變化。 \n\n\n\n  以前是周泰迪，覺得自己可以牛逼到日天日地日空氣，\n\n\n\n  現在是周鹹魚。\n\n\n\n  路上倒是有不少行人投來目光，但還沒有人特意走過來看看，大家都不想惹麻煩事兒，至多經過時，走慢一點，尋思著有沒有什麼熱鬧看看。\n\n\n\n  這就像是「純良」的男人，無論年紀大小，經過街邊小洗頭房門口時，總是會裝作不經意的樣子看看裡面小姐姐今天穿什麼顏色的絲襪一個道理。\n\n\n\n  所以，周老闆並不覺得自己現在的心態和生活態度有什麼問題。\n\n\n\n  睜眼看看，\n\n\n\n  滿大街上，喧囂俗世，\n\n\n\n  來來往往的，\n\n\n\n  都是鹹魚。\n\n\n\n  ……………………\n\n\n\n  「嗯嗯嗯…………好吃好吃！！！！」\n\n\n\n  「好吃啊…………味道好好！！！！」\n\n\n\n  飯桌上，\n\n\n\n  周澤靠著椅子坐著，許清朗在旁邊看著哪個菜少了就重新再炒一點上菜。\n\n\n\n  老太婆一個人吃得那叫一個「狼吞虎咽」，像是古代剛從牢里放出來的一樣，尤其左手拿著的那個巨油膩的肘子，\n\n\n\n  吃得那叫一個滿嘴流油。 \n\n\n\n  那本是許清朗今晚特意為周澤「大快朵頤」整的一個硬菜。\n\n\n\n  老道在旁邊陪著喝酒，給老太婆倒酒，老太婆也不時跟老道碰杯，一飲而盡，豪邁得緊。\n\n\n\n  當然了，\n\n\n\n  雖然看起來年歲相仿，但老道可不喜歡自己的同齡人，他更喜歡的還是髮廊店裡頭那些四十歲上下的晚輩可憐女人。\n\n\n\n  是，她們開始年老色衰，按照約良老色鬼白居易的形容就是那些「門前冷落車馬稀」的女人。\n\n\n\n  但若你去光顧她，愛護她，她能更感激，服務得就更好，不像那些小年輕，生意好，機車得很。\n\n\n\n  但老道也覺得老太婆挺親切的，否則，你總不能讓白鶯鶯去陪人家吧？\n\n\n\n  雖說白鶯鶯的年紀好像也夠大的。\n\n\n\n  老太婆一直吃，不停地吃，像是餓死鬼投胎。\n\n\n\n  許清朗今晚買回來準備給周澤做大餐的食材基本都進了老太婆的肚子了，周澤這個時候自然也不會沒事找事做把那彼岸花做成的口服液拿出來得瑟一下吃飯。\n\n\n\n  「呼………………」\n\n\n\n  飽了。\n\n\n\n  老太婆拍了拍自己滾圓滾圓的肚皮，\n\n\n\n  一臉的滿足。\n\n\n\n  然後她看了看一邊的許清朗，豎起大拇指道： \n\n\n\n  「姑娘，你飯做得真好。」\n\n\n\n  「…………」許清朗。\n\n\n\n  老許忽然覺得自己菜里沒放點砒霜，有點不圓滿。\n\n\n\n  「嘿嘿，妹兒，他是男的，哈哈哈哈哈。」\n\n\n\n  老道笑哈哈地解釋道，\n\n\n\n  「妹兒，你不知道，我第一眼見到他，都差點石更了。」\n\n\n\n  「嘖嘖，是男的？」老太婆又仔細看了一遍許清朗，點點頭，道：「還真是一個俊俏後生，可惜嘍，若是擱在前清那會兒，你這模樣上台演個小生，不曉得得迷倒多少人，勾欄圍子裡，儘是你的人迷兒。」\n\n\n\n  老太婆張口就是一句「前清」，\n\n\n\n  這B格和追憶得可真夠深遠的。\n\n\n\n  這讓旁邊的老道都不懂怎麼接話了，咱倆年紀瞅著一般大，但我也只是在解放前一年生的，那時候也離前請隔著八丈遠吶。\n\n\n\n  「只是這油水，用得過重了一些，想來是以前大鍋飯做多了，流水席面下久了，自然而然地就缺乏了那麼點的精細。\n\n\n\n  味道是極好的，但這天下菜餚好吃得多的去了，甭管你各種口味高低，說實話，再好吃真能把人舌頭給吃進去？\n\n\n\n  無非是在精細上面下的心思不同，曉得伐？」\n\n\n\n  許清朗聞言，微微一愣，然後點點頭，「受教了。」 \n\n\n\n  老太婆吹出一口氣，有些意興闌珊道：\n\n\n\n  「罷了，罷了，這飯食不管咋樣，也算是不錯了，你加油，日後好好鑽研，爭取更上一層樓。前清那會兒，王府上的廚子手藝，看來以後是真的吃不到了。」\n\n\n\n  「嗯。」許清朗點點頭。\n\n\n\n  「等你廚藝再上一步，估摸著你也該死了，到時候到地下來，專門給我做飯。」\n\n\n\n  「…………」許清朗。\n\n\n\n  許清朗負面情緒+999\n\n\n\n  周澤目光一凝，\n\n\n\n  重頭戲，\n\n\n\n  來了麼？\n\n\n\n  談到地獄，\n\n\n\n  談到彼岸花，\n\n\n\n  就意味著雙方的身份已經扯開了，也就沒必要再霧裡看花藏著掖著了。\n\n\n\n  但許清朗這是哭笑不得，這是誇人麼？這是獎勵麼？\n\n\n\n  「哭喪著一張臉幹啥，你這半桶子玄術水平，這輩子甭想改命了，生老病死，你也逃不掉。\n\n\n\n  再說了，\n\n\n\n  跟著一個小小的陰司衙役，\n\n\n\n  有跟著老婆子我好？」\n\n\n\n  說著，\n\n\n\n  老太婆還很不客氣地伸手指了指周澤，一副很不屑的樣子。 \n\n\n\n  但她此時那種舉手投足間的氣場，也不像是裝出來的，一般人，沒那種經歷，沒那種氣質，也裝不出來這種感覺。\n\n\n\n  「妹兒啊……哦不對，大姐啊，你在下頭，也是大人物啊？\n\n\n\n  嘿，貧道我早就看出來了，大姐你一看就不是普通人，聽樣子，大姐您是旗人？\n\n\n\n  不瞞您說，貧道我祖上也是旗人，鈕鈷祿氏的!」\n\n\n\n  老道馬上獻上馬屁。\n\n\n\n  您忠誠的老道已經上線。\n\n\n\n  人老了之後，關心的無非就是自己的後事，但老道無兒無女，也就不用擔心後代問題了，現在有機會可以關心關心自己以後死了之後的事兒，這可是大機緣啊。\n\n\n\n  「哦？」\n\n\n\n  老太婆眯著醉眼看著老道，同時還伸手在老道臉上拍了拍，\n\n\n\n  「真是旗人？」\n\n\n\n  「是啊，是啊。」\n\n\n\n  「可老太婆前清那會兒，是同盟會的，那頓王府上的飯食，也是殺進一個王爺家蹭的飯。」\n\n\n\n  「…………」老道。\n\n\n\n  周澤伸手輕輕敲了敲桌面，道：「說正事吧。」\n\n\n\n  吃飽喝足了，\n\n\n\n  你也該言歸正傳了。 \n\n\n\n  「呵，說正事兒？」老太婆伸了個懶腰，「彼岸花，在你這裡？」\n\n\n\n  「算是吧。」\n\n\n\n  是福不是禍，是禍躲不過，周老闆也就乾脆硬氣起來了。\n\n\n\n  「你知道我是誰麼？」老太婆指了指自己的臉問道。\n\n\n\n  「不知道。」周澤搖搖頭。\n\n\n\n  一開始周澤猜對方可能是孟婆，但既然對方是清末的人，那就應該不是孟婆了。\n\n\n\n  況且孟婆那種地府大人物，親自來到陽間，也不太可能。\n\n\n\n  「呵呵，所以我不知道到底是什麼給了你勇氣。」老太婆站起身，伸手放在了周澤的胸口位置，「老婆子我要看看，你的勇氣和依仗，來自於哪裡？」\n\n\n\n  那油膩拿過肘子的手，在自己胸口亂摸。\n\n\n\n  有著潔癖的周老闆很是難受和煎熬，忍不住伸手打開了對方的手。\n\n\n\n  「喲，瞧出來了，沒想到這小小通城，居然還真藏龍臥虎。\n\n\n\n  一個陰司的小鬼差，居然也有背後的身份。」\n\n\n\n  老太婆又喝了一口米酒，笑得黃色的門牙都露出來了，\n\n\n\n  「但你知不知道，你只是你體內那位昏迷時恰巧在這段時間裡誕生的靈智，換句話來說，你壓根兒什麼都不是。 \n\n\n\n  你傲氣個啥呀？\n\n\n\n  人死後，變成殭屍，那也是由死向生的新生命，\n\n\n\n  你呢？\n\n\n\n  連那個都算不上。\n\n\n\n  充其量，就是主人離家時栓在門口的看門狗，\n\n\n\n  等主人回來，\n\n\n\n  就殺狗肉燉湯嘍。」",

\n\n\n\n  之前她沒表露身份，倒是無所謂，\n\n\n\n  現在她表露身份了，周澤卻比之前更加地怠慢她，她無法忍受！\n\n\n\n  就像是那些皇帝微服私訪一樣，他微服時你和他開玩笑無所謂，一旦他穿上龍袍後你再跟他沒輕沒重的，那就得菜市口走一圈的下場了。\n\n\n\n  「不給？」\n\n\n\n  周澤看向了坐在前面的老道，道：\n\n\n\n  「扁她。」\n\n\n\n  老道一個哆嗦，\n\n\n\n  臥槽，\n\n\n\n  扁她？\n\n\n\n  老闆，\n\n\n\n  我可是會死的人啊，我死了後咋辦？\n\n\n\n  老道還在猶豫，這他娘的換誰不猶豫？\n\n\n\n  除非你能篤定自己長生不老，就算長生不老你也保不準會出啥意外啊。\n\n\n\n  但看周澤的神情，\n\n\n\n  老道知道今天不遵從命令，自己可能都等不到以後老死的那一天，老闆會提前給自己發快遞。\n\n\n\n  「啪！」\n\n\n\n  老道舉起手，\n\n\n\n  對著老太婆的胳膊，\n\n\n\n  輕輕地拍了一下。\n\n\n\n  這力道，這分量， \n\n\n\n  與其說是在打人，\n\n\n\n  更像是老夫老妻之間的打情罵俏。\n\n\n\n  路遙知馬力日久見人心啊。\n\n\n\n  周澤輕輕摸了摸自己的頭，然後輕輕揮揮手。\n\n\n\n  關門，\n\n\n\n  放鶯鶯。\n\n\n\n  反正鶯鶯是正統殭屍，\n\n\n\n  她就算是死，也不入輪迴，是直接生死道消的結局，也不會下地獄走黃泉，所以，她不怕秋後算帳。\n\n\n\n  而且這丫頭，對周澤有一種天然的追隨和服從。\n\n\n\n  果然，\n\n\n\n  鶯鶯沒讓周澤失望，\n\n\n\n  直接走向前去。\n\n\n\n  「你敢罵我家老闆是狗？」白鶯鶯叉著腰，看著老太婆子。\n\n\n\n  「哈哈，他就是一條狗啊，小女娃，你的血統其實比他純正多了，他只是扯虎皮做大衣，他根本就不是他。」\n\n\n\n  周澤深吸一口氣，\n\n\n\n  他有些猶豫，\n\n\n\n  也有些迷茫，\n\n\n\n  不是因為老太婆說的話，\n\n\n\n  而是因為白鶯鶯。\n\n\n\n  是的，白鶯鶯是對自己很順從，但那是建立在她從自己身上感應到高等殭屍氣息的基礎上形成的，是自己體內的血統對她的血統產生了壓制，才讓她不得不臣服自己，從一個冷厲的冰山女殭屍變成了自己的嚶嚶怪。 \n\n\n\n  現在，\n\n\n\n  她知道自己只是一個門面，\n\n\n\n  她是否還會繼續聽自己的話？\n\n\n\n  甚至，如果自己體內的那個意識發出了呼喚，\n\n\n\n  白鶯鶯是否會直接遵從那個意識的命令，對他反戈一擊？\n\n\n\n  周老闆現在有點虛啊，\n\n\n\n  忽然之間，他發現自己真的毫無本錢。\n\n\n\n  以前覺得自己是穿著滿級神裝的小號，可以到處裝逼到處跑，\n\n\n\n  現在他發現自己這身裝備都是被別人綁定後借給自己的，甚至自己可能都是別人預定好的經驗條。\n\n\n\n  慌，\n\n\n\n  不能不慌，\n\n\n\n  鹹魚之慌。\n\n\n\n  「啪！」\n\n\n\n  白鶯鶯一巴掌抽在了老太婆的臉上，直接把老太婆抽飛了出去，狠狠地撞在了牆壁上。\n\n\n\n  她是真沒留力道！\n\n\n\n  老太婆也經打，居然只是嘴角流血破了點皮。\n\n\n\n  「你！！！！！！」\n\n\n\n  老太婆手指著白鶯鶯，\n\n\n\n  「你放肆！小小殭屍，小小污穢，不入輪迴，天…………」 \n\n\n\n  「砰砰！！！！！！」\n\n\n\n  白鶯鶯直接伸手抓著老太婆的脖子，\n\n\n\n  把她提了起來。\n\n\n\n  「你………………」老太婆想說話卻說不出話來。\n\n\n\n  「敢罵我家老闆！」\n\n\n\n  白鶯鶯瞬間化身暴力高中美少女風，\n\n\n\n  抓著老太婆的脖子，\n\n\n\n  「砰！砰！砰！」\n\n\n\n  不停地對著牆壁狂砸！\n\n\n\n  一下，\n\n\n\n  兩下，\n\n\n\n  三下，\n\n\n\n  四下…………\n\n\n\n  砸得不停，砸得不歇！\n\n\n\n  估計隔壁的店面還以為書屋正在搞裝修呢。\n\n\n\n  老道看著倒吸一口涼氣，\n\n\n\n  許清朗看得沉默不語，\n\n\n\n  小猴子看得連爪子上的花生都落到地上去了，\n\n\n\n  就連一直貼著牆壁坐著一動不動地死侍也因為牆壁的顫抖而不停地搖晃著。\n\n\n\n  周澤在旁邊繼續抽著煙，\n\n\n\n  抽得很兇。\n\n\n\n  終於，\n\n\n\n  在不知道多少次撞擊之後， \n\n\n\n  白鶯鶯把老太婆丟了下來。\n\n\n\n  老太婆被撞得鼻青臉腫，頭髮散亂，牙齒都掉落了不知道多少根。\n\n\n\n  但她居然還沒死！\n\n\n\n  「你們…………你們…………你們敢這樣…………敢這樣對我…………你們別死…………你們別死…………」\n\n\n\n  老道坐在邊上不停地搖手，\n\n\n\n  示意和自己無關啊。\n\n\n\n  因為書店裡頭，\n\n\n\n  白鶯鶯和老闆不會死，許清朗還年輕，娘的，算來算去就他死得最早最快啊。\n\n\n\n  周澤丟了菸頭，顫顫巍巍地站起身，走到了老太婆面前，緩緩地蹲了下來。\n\n\n\n  白鶯鶯站在邊上，絲毫沒有暴力砸沙包的痛快和豪邁感，反而在周澤靠近之後，她居然眼裡噙著淚，像是在哭。\n\n\n\n  周澤有些意外地抬起頭，看向身邊的白鶯鶯，問道：\n\n\n\n  「哭什麼？」\n\n\n\n  「她說老闆你壞話，我氣不過。」\n\n\n\n  「她說得又不是假的，沒啥好生氣的。」\n\n\n\n  周澤安慰道。\n\n\n\n  她說的，\n\n\n\n  畢竟是事實啊。\n\n\n\n  「不是，她說得才不對咧。 \n\n\n\n  老闆就是老闆，不是哪門子的看門狗，老闆就是老闆。\n\n\n\n  在鶯鶯眼裡，你就是我老闆，不是你身子裡的那個東西。\n\n\n\n  那個東西，好嚇人的，鶯鶯不喜歡。」\n\n\n\n  「嘿嘿。」\n\n\n\n  周澤笑得很開心。\n\n\n\n  然後，周澤伸出手，手指上長出了指甲，對著老太婆的腦殼就直接抓去，而後狠狠地往上一提。\n\n\n\n  你是打不死的小強，\n\n\n\n  那我就把你的靈魂抽出來！\n\n\n\n  老太婆的靈魂真的被周澤抽出來了，\n\n\n\n  但她的形象一下子就變了。\n\n\n\n  還是老太婆的模樣，\n\n\n\n  但頭戴黑色的長帽子，帽檐不斷地延伸下去，脫落到了地上，臉上還掛著不少的手勢，一看就不是凡鬼。\n\n\n\n  「那個陣法，不是你布置的才對，彼岸花，也不是你種的。」\n\n\n\n  周澤分析道：\n\n\n\n  「你除了抗揍，沒其他的本事。所以，你是從地獄裡出來特意來調查這件事的人？」\n\n\n\n  「你知道我是從地獄來的，居然還敢這樣對我！」老太婆猙獰道。\n\n\n\n  「你是條大魚，我的績點很久沒漲了。 \n\n\n\n  還有，\n\n\n\n  我聽說地獄當差的，油水都不少，雁過拔毛嘛，你在我這兒吃了這麼一頓美餐，送你下去的話，不光是業績，那冥鈔也應該很豐厚吧。」\n\n\n\n  「你敢！」\n\n\n\n  老太婆有點慌了，\n\n\n\n  她這個身份層次的人上來一次不容易，代價極大，如果任務沒完成就下去，那她的下場也會很難看！\n\n\n\n  周澤點點頭，看來自己猜對了啊。\n\n\n\n  緊接著，\n\n\n\n  周澤拿出了手機，點開微信，給小蘿莉撥了一個微信視頻邀請。\n\n\n\n  那邊很快接了，\n\n\n\n  露出了躺在床上穿著蘿莉裙的林可。\n\n\n\n  「她，你認識麼？」\n\n\n\n  周澤把手機對準了老太婆。\n\n\n\n  「她…………她是奈何橋的守夜人，她怎麼會出現在這裡？\n\n\n\n  是來調查彼岸花的麼？\n\n\n\n  啊，\n\n\n\n  她的靈魂怎麼出來了，\n\n\n\n  誰弄的！\n\n\n\n  是你？」\n\n\n\n  周澤點點頭。\n\n\n\n  「周澤，你闖禍了，如果讓她下去，把你的罪行告訴到下面，到時候奈何橋到陰司那邊告你一狀，別說你現在只是鬼差了，哪怕你是巡檢，也扛不了！」 \n\n\n\n  「我懂你的意思了。」周澤恍然，「你的意思是，不能送她靈魂下地獄，而是應該直接在這裡給滅掉。」\n\n\n\n  「…………」林可。\n\n\n\n  林可：**&amp;*@@#￥%￥\n\n\n\n  話音剛落，\n\n\n\n  周澤的指甲就開始瘋狂地揉捏刺穿著這老太婆的靈魂，\n\n\n\n  像是發了瘋一樣！\n\n\n\n  叫你說老子是看門狗，\n\n\n\n  叫你把老子說得一文不值！\n\n\n\n  叫你在老子面前裝逼！\n\n\n\n  老子今兒個就讓你曉得，\n\n\n\n  就算是狗，\n\n\n\n  急了，\n\n\n\n  也是會咬人的！\n\n\n\n  在老太婆的悽慘叫聲之中，\n\n\n\n  她的靈魂最終被周澤成功地撕碎，\n\n\n\n  四周，\n\n\n\n  蕩漾起陣陣菸灰，\n\n\n\n  結束了，\n\n\n\n  都結束了。\n\n\n\n  周澤嘴角掛著殘餘的笑容，\n\n\n\n  閉上眼，\n\n\n\n  直接坐在了地上。\n\n\n\n  不知道為什麼，\n\n\n\n  在這一刻，\n\n\n\n  他忽然找回了在小時候一個人坐在孤兒院後院時的感覺。",

    "content": "「來，苦丁茶。」\n\n\n\n  王軻將茶水放在了周澤面前。\n\n\n\n  苦丁茶，又稱苦茶，茶如其名。\n\n\n\n  但王軻自從開始喝茶時，就迷上了這種味道，平日在自家或者在辦公室時，都是喝這種茶。\n\n\n\n  可以說他是在憶苦思甜，他也確實配得上「憶苦思甜」。\n\n\n\n  從一無所有的孤兒，走到今天這一步，已經算是成功得不能再成功了，其間所付出的艱辛，都在這杯苦茶裡頭蕩漾著。\n\n\n\n  周澤端起茶杯，喝了一口，慢慢咀嚼著茶末子，放下茶杯，又點了一根煙。\n\n\n\n  「孤單了吧？」\n\n\n\n  王軻說道。\n\n\n\n  周澤點點頭。\n\n\n\n  作為一名心理醫生，最擅長的，其實還是察言觀色，這是一門看似很容易學實際上想學得好卻很難的學問。\n\n\n\n  「你女兒呢？」\n\n\n\n  「哦，快放學了。」\n\n\n\n  「嫂子呢？」\n\n\n\n  「做頭髮去了；\n\n\n\n  然後應該去接孩子放學，用不了多久就該回來了吧。」\n\n\n\n  「你也是心大，還敢放心讓她出門去。」\n\n\n\n  「她大部分時候，還是正常的。」 \n\n\n\n  王軻對著自己面前的茶杯呼了一口氣，然後端起來品了一口。\n\n\n\n  苦味入喉，不亞於白酒穿腸。\n\n\n\n  「我想找人說說話，但不知道找誰，然後就想到了你。」\n\n\n\n  周澤說完後，笑了笑。\n\n\n\n  可以看出來，他情緒其實是有些低落的。\n\n\n\n  一舉滅殺了那個老太婆的靈魂，並沒有讓周老闆發泄出內心的什麼怒火，反而像是路邊吃了「快餐」之後，看似激烈運動結束，\n\n\n\n  但走出來時，卻難掩內心深處滿滿的失落和空虛。\n\n\n\n  周澤沒覺得自己那個舉動很乾脆很殺伐果斷，\n\n\n\n  那真的只是狗急跳牆，\n\n\n\n  一個人被逼迫到了一個情緒拐角之後所表現出的瘋狂罷了，\n\n\n\n  莽夫之舉，\n\n\n\n  沒啥好吹噓的。\n\n\n\n  最終，\n\n\n\n  奈何橋會不會知道這件事，\n\n\n\n  自己會不會面臨處理，\n\n\n\n  他不清楚，也不知道。\n\n\n\n  「我能理解你這種感覺，小時候，我們都是一樣的。」王軻將菸灰缸向周澤面前推了推，繼續道：「我們起步比同齡人差太多太多，也比同齡人更有危機感，因為我們體驗過一無所有的惶恐，所以我們更懂得珍惜的道理。」 \n\n\n\n  周澤看著王軻，沒說話。\n\n\n\n  「你現在，給了我一種仿佛我們還在孤兒院時的感覺。」\n\n\n\n  「呵呵。」\n\n\n\n  「是真的，那種無所依靠，對未來的彷徨和迷茫，我在你身上，看見了，看得清清楚楚。」\n\n\n\n  「我本來就一無所有了，上輩子，摸爬滾打到三十歲，一場車禍，付之一炬；\n\n\n\n  這輩子，卻發現了更讓我難以接受的真相，原來我整個人的存在，也只是一個誤會，一個概率，甚至可以說是……一個玩笑。」\n\n\n\n  「然後呢，你決定怎麼辦呢？」\n\n\n\n  王軻伸手摩挲了一把下巴。\n\n\n\n  老實說，對於王軻來講，面對各種顧客，他都有恃無恐，他的才學和心理學方面的造詣以及他的經驗，能夠幫助他解決絕大部分的問題。\n\n\n\n  但面對周澤時，\n\n\n\n  王軻以前所有的那種自信直接蕩然無存了。\n\n\n\n  畢竟，\n\n\n\n  學校里可沒有一門課專門講「鬼」的心理學研究。\n\n\n\n  「你這個問題，太空泛了。」周澤說道。\n\n\n\n  「那這樣吧，明天的你，準備打算怎麼辦，去做些什麼？\n\n\n\n  比如早上起來，你打算做什麼，中午時打算做什麼，晚上時打算做什麼，這樣就具體清晰起來了。」 \n\n\n\n  「早上…………」\n\n\n\n  周澤沉吟了一會兒，回答道：\n\n\n\n  「早上會坐在書店靠窗的位置，曬曬太陽，再喝喝咖啡。」\n\n\n\n  「…………」王軻。\n\n\n\n  抑制住咳嗽的衝動，王軻硬著頭皮繼續問道：\n\n\n\n  「那中午呢？吃了飯之後，繼續看報紙？」\n\n\n\n  周澤笑了，搖搖頭，道：「當然不是看報紙了，也不喝咖啡了。」\n\n\n\n  「嗯，那就好。」\n\n\n\n  王軻長舒一口氣，\n\n\n\n  覺得自己這個發小，\n\n\n\n  還有得救啊。\n\n\n\n  「報紙就那麼一點版面，中午到下午，換本書看看吧，書店裡的書不少，而且也不坐原來的位置了，上午太陽還算舒服，下午的太陽就大了，選一個角落的位置，側躺著，翻翻書。\n\n\n\n  興趣來了，看看一些嚴肅文學或者一些古代的著作。\n\n\n\n  覺得乏味了，再找找一些當代小說換換口味，有時候也覺得這些小說挺有意思的。\n\n\n\n  也不喝咖啡了，畢竟咖啡喝太多對心臟也不好，我以前是當醫生的，懂這個道理。\n\n\n\n  換喝茶吧，不過不會喝你這種苦茶，我那裡有不少高價買來的好茶葉。」 \n\n\n\n  「…………」王軻。\n\n\n\n  「晚上嘛，看看有沒有生意上門，有生意上門的話就做，沒生意的話就到點關門，洗個澡，睡覺。」\n\n\n\n  王軻看了看面前的菸灰缸，\n\n\n\n  不知道為什麼，\n\n\n\n  他心裡忽然有了一個衝動，\n\n\n\n  那就是舉起這個菸灰缸，給自己這個發小砸他個頭破血流！\n\n\n\n  「這樣子的生活，有趣麼？」\n\n\n\n  王軻組織著自己的言辭，繼續道：\n\n\n\n  「或者，這樣子的生活，對於你現在所面臨的困擾，有幫助麼？能改善你的問題和解決你的憂患麼？」\n\n\n\n  周澤搖搖頭。\n\n\n\n  顯然不能。\n\n\n\n  這個世界上，沒有天下掉餡兒餅的好事。\n\n\n\n  「那你還打算這麼做？」王軻循循善誘。\n\n\n\n  講真，\n\n\n\n  他覺得自己好累，真的好累。\n\n\n\n  「但我的憂患和擔心，其實就是以後的我，可能就不能再過這種鹹魚一樣的生活了。\n\n\n\n  我又為什麼，\n\n\n\n  為了保護我的這種生活狀態，現在卻主動地自己改變這種狀態？」 \n\n\n\n  王軻伸手擦了擦額頭，\n\n\n\n  他被周澤這番話給繞暈了。\n\n\n\n  是的，\n\n\n\n  周老闆挺喜歡這種生活，\n\n\n\n  一家書屋，一個女僕，一份報紙，一縷陽光，一天一夜，就這樣過去，一個月，一年，也這樣過去。\n\n\n\n  他不喜歡破壞這份平靜，也不捨得去摧毀這種氛圍。\n\n\n\n  這是他死後感悟出的道理，一種和上輩子截然不同的人生觀。\n\n\n\n  兩個男人的談話，進入了瓶頸。\n\n\n\n  好在，玄關門被打開了。\n\n\n\n  小蘿莉和自己的母親回來了。\n\n\n\n  剛進門，小蘿莉就盯著周澤一陣猛看，眼眸深處的憤怒，無比清晰！\n\n\n\n  他又惹禍了，\n\n\n\n  他又惹事兒了，\n\n\n\n  小蘿莉很委屈，\n\n\n\n  為什麼自從跟著他之後，自己每天都得過擔驚受怕的日子！\n\n\n\n  跟著他之後，\n\n\n\n  小蘿莉忽然覺得自己的生活變得格外刺激！\n\n\n\n  刺激得不要不要的！\n\n\n\n  王軻的妻子帶著孩子回來後就自顧自地上樓了， \n\n\n\n  對此，\n\n\n\n  周澤這個客人沒有絲毫那種被冷遇的感覺，\n\n\n\n  恰恰相反，\n\n\n\n  如果王軻妻子熱情地挽留他留下來吃晚飯才是周澤最不能接受的事情。\n\n\n\n  「小蕊啊，去寫作業吧。」\n\n\n\n  王軻示意自己的女兒先離開。\n\n\n\n  王蕊很是聽話地點點頭，背著書包也上樓回房間了。\n\n\n\n  周澤也順勢起身，告辭了。\n\n\n\n  王軻留下他想再聊一會兒，他覺得自己應該給自己這個發小的人生觀多注入一些活力，但很顯然，這有點對牛彈琴的意思。\n\n\n\n  走出王軻家，周澤沒急著離開，而是在小區花園裡的長椅上坐了下來。\n\n\n\n  不一會兒，一道嬌小的身影走到周澤身後。\n\n\n\n  「很生氣？」\n\n\n\n  周澤不用回頭看就知道是誰來了。\n\n\n\n  「氣麻木了。」\n\n\n\n  小蘿莉在周澤身邊的長椅上坐了下來，\n\n\n\n  「你的語文是數學老師教的吧？」小蘿莉嘲諷道。\n\n\n\n  她之前和周澤視頻時，周澤居然把人靈魂給直接撕碎了！\n\n\n\n  還說什麼領會了她的意思！ \n\n\n\n  「呵呵，記得以前當過語文課代表。」\n\n\n\n  「那閱讀理解真是滿分。」小蘿莉氣呼呼地說道，「你就這樣把人殺了，這意味著一旦事發後，就徹底沒有轉圜的餘地了？」\n\n\n\n  「留著她，就有餘地了？」\n\n\n\n  周澤搖搖頭，很隨意地道：\n\n\n\n  「人……哦不，鬼已經殺了，再討論這個，也沒什麼意義了。」\n\n\n\n  「那你下面打算怎麼辦？」\n\n\n\n  「什麼怎麼辦，繼續過自己的日子唄。」\n\n\n\n  「點了火藥桶，然後裝作什麼都沒發生？」\n\n\n\n  周澤沉默了。\n\n\n\n  過了十分鐘，\n\n\n\n  周澤開口道：「有什麼修煉的法門麼？」\n\n\n\n  「你想學？」小蘿莉有些意外地看著周澤，「你想變強？」\n\n\n\n  「有時候會覺得無聊，所以想找點事情做做。」\n\n\n\n  「你當這是弱智的修仙玄幻小說麼？\n\n\n\n  和你書店裡書架上放著的那些書一樣？\n\n\n\n  我們鬼差，比如我，自還陽開始，一切能力就都是固定的，我們的天賦，我們的神通，早就定型了。\n\n\n\n  除非你去當廟神積攢香火供奉，或者用其他陰損的法子，正兒八經的修煉，在地獄可能有一點效果，但在陽間這個地界，沒用。」 \n\n\n\n  「那還真是讓人頭疼呢。」\n\n\n\n  周澤有些神傷，\n\n\n\n  下意識地伸手揉了揉自己的太陽穴。\n\n\n\n  不過心裡也安定了下來，最後一絲的愧疚也被抹除了。\n\n\n\n  你看，\n\n\n\n  不是我不想上進，不是我想當一隻鹹魚，\n\n\n\n  事實是修煉和不修煉，沒啥區別啊。\n\n\n\n  「不過…………」小蘿莉忽然轉了畫風。\n\n\n\n  然後，\n\n\n\n  周老闆猛地站起身，\n\n\n\n  快步走到小區門口伸手準備攔車，\n\n\n\n  就差捂著耳朵跺跺腳高呼「不聽不聽王八念經」了。\n\n\n\n  這讓一旁準備來個轉折掉一下周澤胃口的小蘿莉一時間瞠目結舌，\n\n\n\n  甘霖娘！\n\n\n\n  這貨就生怕我說出什麼修煉的法門害他不能當鹹魚麼！",

"計程車是一種很奇怪的存在，\n\n\n\n  當你不需要它時，\n\n\n\n  它一輛接著一輛在你面前打著燈「無客」慢悠悠地開過去，司機師傅還對你眨眨眼，像是期待你的入座。\n\n\n\n  但當你需要它時，\n\n\n\n  你會發現它又沒了，\n\n\n\n  就算是有，上面也是有客了。\n\n\n\n  周老闆現在就是這種情況，\n\n\n\n  車呢？\n\n\n\n  車呢？\n\n\n\n  車去哪裡了？\n\n\n\n  「餵。」\n\n\n\n  小蘿莉雙手別在身後，慢慢地走了過來。\n\n\n\n  老實說，小蘿莉對周澤有點絕望了。\n\n\n\n  陰差陽錯之下，身份顛倒，周澤從本來她面前的「用完銷毀」，變成了如今掌握她生死的「捕頭」老大。\n\n\n\n  願意也好，願意也罷，都無法改變此時的局面和現實。\n\n\n\n  也因此，每次周澤做出出格的事兒時，小蘿莉都沒得選擇，只能和她眼裡的那頭蠢女殭屍一樣幫他擦P股。\n\n\n\n  這裡是通城，她也是通城的鬼差，她跟周澤又有從屬的關係，所以，她跟周澤真的是一榮俱榮一損俱損。\n\n\n\n  榮沒看見， \n\n\n\n  損是連續好多次了。\n\n\n\n  憂傷，\n\n\n\n  心累。\n\n\n\n  但是，\n\n\n\n  她是最願意看見周澤奮發不要變鹹魚的那一批人，\n\n\n\n  頗有一種妻子看自家不成器丈夫的感覺。\n\n\n\n  打著罵著，讓他看看別人家的丈夫如何如何努力，而你卻只知道在家吃軟飯，不思進取；\n\n\n\n  但打罵之後，還得看看他有沒有餓死。\n\n\n\n  周澤點了一根煙，也不招手喊車了，只得道：\n\n\n\n  「說吧。」\n\n\n\n  「以前在蓉城開冥店的那位，你認識吧？」\n\n\n\n  「別說廢話。」\n\n\n\n  「他就能比以前變強很多。」小蘿莉說起那個人時，仿佛又被勾引起蓉城那個雨夜的噩夢記憶，臉上的神情也變得嚴肅起來，「如果你能找到他的話，可以去問問他，當然了，可能他的方法並不適合你，因為你們之間有很大的區別。」\n\n\n\n  當初，最先發現他的是蓉城的鬼差。\n\n\n\n  在鬼差的追捕下，那個人明明在一開始只能抱頭逃竄，根本就沒有還手之力。\n\n\n\n  事實上，如果不是蓉城那幫鬼差一開始被那個仿佛連鬼的心思都能看透的男孩耍得團團轉的話，那個人，應該早就落網了。 \n\n\n\n  那個男孩也是因為那件事，被殺的。\n\n\n\n  鬼差們很少殺人，或許可以說是不敢殺人，但那個男孩還是被殺了，\n\n\n\n  因為他連鬼都能騙，那雙眸子，仿佛可以看穿和洞悉一切。\n\n\n\n  然後，\n\n\n\n  那個之前只能逃竄的男人，\n\n\n\n  主動回來了。\n\n\n\n  在他身邊的人一個被一個地抓起來或者打傷追逃之時，\n\n\n\n  他回來了。\n\n\n\n  之後，就是那血色的一夜，靈魂在燃燒，大家在自相殘殺，落下來一地的，\n\n\n\n  鬼差證。\n\n\n\n  說著說著，\n\n\n\n  小蘿莉伸腳踢開了面前的一塊石子兒，那一幕，她不想再回憶了，不過還是繼續道：\n\n\n\n  「我記得無面女在我面前說過你，她對你的評價很高，甚至是高得可怕，我以前不懂她的意思，現在我有點懂了。\n\n\n\n  其實，還有一個辦法，更適合你，也絕對能行得通。」\n\n\n\n  「說。」\n\n\n\n  「你是那個強大存在在昏迷時誕生的一縷意識，而且形成了獨立的自我人格，甚至具備了靈魂的存在形式。\n\n\n\n  那個老太婆罵你不過是一條看門狗， \n\n\n\n  你大可以先認下來。」\n\n\n\n  周澤陷入了沉思，他好像聽懂了點什麼。\n\n\n\n  「你是看門狗，你是看大門的，你守著一個巨大的財富寶藏！\n\n\n\n  你可以……\n\n\n\n  監守自盜啊！」\n\n\n\n  監守自盜！\n\n\n\n  周澤的嘴角下意識地抽了抽。\n\n\n\n  「他不是還沒完善麼？\n\n\n\n  他不是還沒甦醒麼？\n\n\n\n  他不是還殘缺著麼？\n\n\n\n  這正是你的機會啊！\n\n\n\n  他的力量，\n\n\n\n  他的能力，\n\n\n\n  他的天賦神通！」\n\n\n\n  說著，小蘿莉主動抓起周澤的手掌，掰著周澤的手指說道：\n\n\n\n  「就比如這黑指甲，這就是你監守自盜的一種表現啊，你已經在無意識之中完成了一部分了，哪怕只是一小部分，但在很長時間裡，其實已經足夠你自保了，甚至能支撐起你當起鬼差的職責。\n\n\n\n  你可以偷更多，\n\n\n\n  你可以竊取更多啊，\n\n\n\n  把他的都偷來，或者，偷一半！\n\n\n\n  只要偷一半過來，你還用得著怕他麼甦醒麼？ \n\n\n\n  再極端點，\n\n\n\n  當初你還只是一個臨時鬼差時都有勇氣在心裡生出對我取而代之的念頭，\n\n\n\n  你現在就不敢對他取而代之麼？\n\n\n\n  你是周澤，你是一個獨立人格，你是一個人！\n\n\n\n  憑什麼不能？」\n\n\n\n  周澤聽完這些話後，又看了看自己的手指，默默地點了點頭。\n\n\n\n  是啊，\n\n\n\n  與其去跟別人請教修煉變強的方法，自己這邊明明有一座類似少林寺的藏經閣在自己身邊，門鑰匙還在自己手上，\n\n\n\n  又何必去捨近求遠呢？\n\n\n\n  「你拿與不拿，這些東西現在都放在這裡；\n\n\n\n  你不拿，也不是你的。\n\n\n\n  你拿了，就是你的。\n\n\n\n  放這裡，也是浪費。」\n\n\n\n  小蘿莉的話語聲帶著些許的煽動性，\n\n\n\n  「所以，拿過來，搬回自家的東西，才是自己的。」\n\n\n\n  「但如果他甦醒過來，取代了我，對你來說，不是更有利麼？」周澤看向小蘿莉，問道。\n\n\n\n  「我只是一個鬼差。」小蘿莉笑了笑，「你體內的那個東西完全醒來，在他眼裡，我只是一個屁。甚至他在吞噬你時，估計也不會介意把我順帶一起吞了，畢竟，我的魂血，也在你手裡。」 \n\n\n\n  這個解釋，\n\n\n\n  說得通。\n\n\n\n  「我知道了。」周澤說道。\n\n\n\n  「以後，從你珍貴的曬太陽看報紙喝咖啡的寶貴時間裡，抽出一小部分，嘗試一下吧。」小蘿莉繼續勸說道。\n\n\n\n  像是一個操心操力的母親，在盡力地勸說自己不成器的腦癱兒子稍微爭一點氣。\n\n\n\n  「對了，還有一個問題。」周澤看著自己面前的小蘿莉，「你剛剛說的話，挺多的。」\n\n\n\n  還不是為了你。\n\n\n\n  「能告訴我，你生前，是做什麼的麼？」周澤問道。\n\n\n\n  「企業家，女企業家。」小蘿莉直接回答。\n\n\n\n  「哦？」\n\n\n\n  「靠國企改制，私吞國有資產發的家。」\n\n\n\n  周澤恍然，\n\n\n\n  所以這妞剛剛勸說自己監守自盜時，\n\n\n\n  才這麼熟練啊。\n\n\n\n  ………………\n\n\n\n  打車回到書店，\n\n\n\n  一路上周澤都在思考如何監守自盜這件事。\n\n\n\n  寶山在自己面前，自己也有大門鑰匙，因為自己可以主動喚醒它，然而，自己卻不知道如何金銀財寶從那裡運出來放到自家的方法。 \n\n\n\n  這是一個很讓人頭疼的問題，\n\n\n\n  有點像是當初無面女偽裝成林醫生勾引自己的那一夜，\n\n\n\n  有心無力。\n\n\n\n  下了車，已經是傍晚時分，店裡亮著燈，\n\n\n\n  然後，\n\n\n\n  書店裡好多人。\n\n\n\n  是的，好多人。\n\n\n\n  依照周老闆的記憶中，自家書店好久沒這麼熱鬧了。\n\n\n\n  走進書店，基本都是學生模樣的青年，男女都有，他們安靜地坐在座位上，看著自己面前的書，看著筆記本。\n\n\n\n  有幾個，還在嘴唇微動，應該是在背誦英語單詞。\n\n\n\n  周澤有些疑惑，\n\n\n\n  今晚，\n\n\n\n  生意真好。\n\n\n\n  許清朗坐在吧檯旁邊，當周澤走近時，許清朗聳聳肩，道：「怎麼樣，今晚生意是不是好得出奇？」\n\n\n\n  「怎麼了？」\n\n\n\n  忽然來了這麼多的鬼，意味著這麼多的業績，周老闆有些不適應。\n\n\n\n  過慣了苦日子了，賤唄。\n\n\n\n  「等天亮高考就開始了。」\n\n\n\n  許清朗點了一根煙，吐出一口煙圈，繼續道： \n\n\n\n  「這些都是學生的亡魂，他們不知道自己死了，卻還認為自己明天要高考，所以到這裡備考來了。」\n\n\n\n  「這麼多？」\n\n\n\n  「昂，還有以前高考失敗，跳樓自殺的。」\n\n\n\n  「哦。」\n\n\n\n  兩個大男人，一起坐在吧檯邊，抽著煙。\n\n\n\n  周澤沒急著把這些人收入地獄之門換績點，因為他們一個個複習得很緊張，很投入，周澤暫時不想打擾他們。\n\n\n\n  「我學習成績打小就不好。」許清朗感嘆道，「沒經歷過高考。」\n\n\n\n  周澤點點頭，道：\n\n\n\n  「上學的時候，班上長得漂亮的，學習成績基本都不會太好。」\n\n\n\n  「…………」許清朗。\n\n\n\n  「你呢，你成績應該很好吧？高材生？不然也做不到天才外科醫生吧？」\n\n\n\n  「你可以翻資料，我是那一年通城理科狀元。」\n\n\n\n  許清朗愣了一下，\n\n\n\n  「喲，沒看出來啊，你還是學霸啊。」\n\n\n\n  「學霸怎麼樣，到頭來，還是變成了鬼。」\n\n\n\n  書店門口，又走進來一個客人，是一個婦人，衣著樸素。\n\n\n\n  是熟人， \n\n\n\n  以前來過店裡。\n\n\n\n  「您這兒換地方了啊，我一頓好找。」婦人說道。\n\n\n\n  「哦，先坐坐吧，待會兒再上路。」周澤指了指旁邊的椅子。\n\n\n\n  「哎，好。」\n\n\n\n  婦人坐下了。\n\n\n\n  之前她來過周澤的書店，陪著那個丟柯基的富家女一起進來的。\n\n\n\n  不過當初她說要給今年高考的兒子陪讀，所以周澤網開一面，讓她離開了，沒收她下地獄。\n\n\n\n  天亮了，就要高考了，她的陪讀任務也結束了，所以按照約定，她來報導了。\n\n\n\n  「不等孩子放榜了再過來，至少可以看看你兒子考上了哪所大學。」周澤問道。\n\n\n\n  「有啥好看的，我這個當媽的，能做的也就只有這麼多了，陪著他每晚複習到深夜，他睡著了我就在旁邊陪著看著，他爹粗心，我得時不時地託夢告訴他爹明天得給孩子吃啥，補一補什麼的。\n\n\n\n  他高考了，\n\n\n\n  無論考得好壞高低，\n\n\n\n  無論上什麼學校，\n\n\n\n  我都不在乎了。\n\n\n\n  他有自己的人生，有自己的路要走，只是一個高考而已，他的人生才剛開始呢，未來的路，很長很長的。 \n\n\n\n  也不是一個高考所能完全決定的，未來，還是得靠他自己去努力去爭取。」\n\n\n\n  「看開就好。」周澤點點頭。\n\n\n\n  這一坐，\n\n\n\n  就幾乎坐到了天快亮的時候，\n\n\n\n  今天書店打烊的時間，比平時都要晚上許多。\n\n\n\n  時候，差不多了，\n\n\n\n  周澤站起身，\n\n\n\n  先打開了地獄之門，\n\n\n\n  然後拍拍手對著書店裡同樣複習了整夜的學生們喊道：\n\n\n\n  「高考了，\n\n\n\n  同學們到我這裡領准考證，\n\n\n\n  祝你們，\n\n\n\n  一路順風。」\n\n\n\n  邊上，\n\n\n\n  許清朗端出來後半夜趕製出來的糕點和糯米粽子，\n\n\n\n  對那些站起來的學生亡魂喊道：\n\n\n\n  「上路前，\n\n\n\n  一人拿一個米糕再拿一個粽子再走，\n\n\n\n  叔叔祝你們，\n\n\n\n  糕粽（高中）！」",

    "content": "周老闆今天收穫真的很大，甚至可以說是好長時間都沒有這麼大的一次收穫了，無論是業績點還是冥鈔，這次是賺得足足的。\n\n\n\n  畢竟不管什麼時候也不管事哪個行業，學生的錢，總是最好賺的。\n\n\n\n  送完這批學生亡魂上路後，周澤去洗了一個澡，然後上樓準備休息，白鶯鶯鋪好床，早就把自己洗白白洗得香噴噴的候著了。\n\n\n\n  走到床邊的周澤並沒有急著上床，而是先站在窗口邊上點了一根煙。\n\n\n\n  許清朗知道周澤有這個習慣，笑稱他別人都是事後煙抽得有滋有味，周老闆喜歡抽事前煙。\n\n\n\n  不過今天周老闆這「事前煙」連續抽了好幾根，\n\n\n\n  躺在床上早就擺好姿勢的白鶯鶯發覺到奇怪，就差喊一聲：\n\n\n\n  「老闆，你來嘛，你來嘛……」\n\n\n\n  周澤回過頭，看見鶯鶯，笑了笑，道：「不好意思，本來很困的，現在又不困了。」\n\n\n\n  說著，又點了一根煙。\n\n\n\n  白鶯鶯下了床，給周澤搬來一張椅子讓周澤坐在上面，她則是站在後面給周澤捶著肩，柔聲道：\n\n\n\n  「老闆，想什麼呢？」\n\n\n\n  周澤沒回答，而是默默地攤開雙手，十根黑色的指甲慢慢地長出來，點點黑霧在指甲間不斷地環繞醞釀著。 \n\n\n\n  白鶯鶯的身體連續顫抖了幾下，對於周澤的指甲，她有著一種本能地畏懼。\n\n\n\n  「你說，我除了這雙灰指甲，還剩下什麼？」\n\n\n\n  周澤像是在問白鶯鶯，又像是在自言自語。\n\n\n\n  小蘿莉給了周澤「監守自盜」的建議，\n\n\n\n  所以現在周澤開始真正思考這個問題，\n\n\n\n  怎麼盜，\n\n\n\n  如何盜，\n\n\n\n  盜得讓公家不起絲毫懷疑，不引起反彈和追責，甚至還得謝謝你，\n\n\n\n  這可是一門很高深的學問。\n\n\n\n  白鶯鶯沒能明白老闆的意思，既然沒明白，她就不多問了，專心給老闆按摩。\n\n\n\n  這時，\n\n\n\n  周澤的手機響了，是小蘿莉的電話。\n\n\n\n  「喂，什麼事？」\n\n\n\n  一夜前才剛見面說過話，這個時候再打電話來，周澤也覺得有些奇怪。\n\n\n\n  「小事，常州的一名鬼差有事要經過通城，給我打了聲招呼，我來知會你一聲。」\n\n\n\n  「哦。」\n\n\n\n  電話掛斷了。\n\n\n\n  周澤揉了揉自己的太陽穴，轉而又陷入了沉思。 \n\n\n\n  人類有著天生的模仿能力，這種能力從原始的不能再演化一步，就是「學習」。\n\n\n\n  放下電話後，周澤慢慢地閉上眼，腦子裡開始慢慢地回憶自己體內那道意識甦醒時的感覺。\n\n\n\n  最好的盜竊，\n\n\n\n  其實就是模仿，\n\n\n\n  讀書人的事兒，能叫偷麼？\n\n\n\n  更何況，說一千道一萬，都是自家的東西。\n\n\n\n  白鶯鶯發現老闆的氣息正在慢慢地變悠長，她以為老闆是睡著了，也開始慢慢地減弱按摩的力道。\n\n\n\n  周澤其實不是睡著了，他的思維仍然很清晰著，他只是暫時拋除了自己的雜念，開始全身心地投入到那種狀態之中。\n\n\n\n  第一次進入那種狀態，\n\n\n\n  是在高樓天台上面對青衣娘娘時，\n\n\n\n  自己站在天台邊緣位置不停地來回搖擺，生死一線；\n\n\n\n  之後就是在林家，和小姨子的鬼差亡魂斗的那一場，之後則是在鹽城和將軍山這些地方。\n\n\n\n  每次，\n\n\n\n  當那個意識甦醒過來時，\n\n\n\n  那種睥睨一切的氣勢，\n\n\n\n  那種絕對的自信，\n\n\n\n  那種仿佛一切盡在掌握的感覺， \n\n\n\n  周澤正在慢慢地把哪時候的情緒調動起來。\n\n\n\n  而後，\n\n\n\n  還在邊上給周澤慢慢按摩的白鶯鶯忽然愣住了，因為她看見周澤的皮膚正在慢慢地乾癟下去，身上的氣息也在越來越內斂，內斂到了仿佛根本就感知不到他活人的氣息一樣。\n\n\n\n  同時，周澤的指甲開始變得更長，散發著幽然的光澤，周圍的空氣也在慢慢地壓抑下來，像是一切都陷入了一種凝滯。\n\n\n\n  白鶯鶯的小心肝「噗噗噗」地直跳，那種來自血脈上的壓迫讓白鶯鶯有些承受不了，甚至，產生了想要跪下來的衝動。\n\n\n\n  這還是白鶯鶯第一次如此近距離地接近這種狀態下的周澤，以前每次都是周澤癱瘓之後她再負責照顧的。\n\n\n\n  「老闆…………老闆…………」\n\n\n\n  周澤依舊閉著眼，仍然在細心地追逐尋找著那種感覺，乃至於，或許是因為太過沉浸其中的原因，周澤本人根本就沒有意識到自己身上正在發生的變化。\n\n\n\n  指甲開始越來越長，\n\n\n\n  周澤的身體也在越來越佝僂，\n\n\n\n  原本他是軟塌塌地葛優躺一樣的姿勢斜靠在椅子上的，畢竟這樣子讓白鶯鶯按摩更舒服也更方便一些。\n\n\n\n  現在，\n\n\n\n  周澤的身體像是泄了氣的氣球，開始變得縮水起來，就像是一個人步入老年，身體的水分開始流失。 \n\n\n\n  但那指甲，\n\n\n\n  真得長到了令人瞠目結舌的地步，\n\n\n\n  周澤的雙手是垂放在膝蓋上的，\n\n\n\n  但此時他的指甲，\n\n\n\n  卻長長到了可以接觸到地面的地步，足足有幾分米長，幾乎可以拿來當鐮刀用。\n\n\n\n  而且原本黑色的指甲，此時居然還有暗紅色的光澤正在流轉。\n\n\n\n  「滋滋滋滋………………」\n\n\n\n  十根指甲的尖端接觸到了瓷磚地面，地面上竟然刮蹭出了一串火花，瓷磚居然像是被燒融了，留下了深刻的痕跡。\n\n\n\n  白鶯鶯都看傻看呆了，\n\n\n\n  好粗，\n\n\n\n  好長，\n\n\n\n  好硬啊，\n\n\n\n  這被插一下，\n\n\n\n  誰能受得了啊！\n\n\n\n  嚶嚶嚶嚶嚶！！！！\n\n\n\n  身邊的女僕是什麼反應，周澤是一概不知的，他還不知道自己已經在不知不覺間解脫了新的「姿勢」。\n\n\n\n  看起來，很簡單。\n\n\n\n  但實際上，如果沒有小蘿莉白天的那番話，周澤根本就想不到可以這麼做，這可能就是當局者迷吧。\n\n\n\n  但至少，目前來看，見效很快。 \n\n\n\n  「嗡………………」\n\n\n\n  然而，\n\n\n\n  就在周澤還沉浸在這種「回憶」的感覺時，\n\n\n\n  他的身體忽然輕微地顫抖了一下。\n\n\n\n  一邊還在感嘆感懷又粗又大的白鶯鶯目光瞬間一凝，她感覺到老闆的氣息正在發生著劇烈的變化。\n\n\n\n  冥冥之中，\n\n\n\n  周澤感覺自己的意識陷入到了布滿粘稠液體的沼澤里，當他警覺到時，想睜開眼從沉思中醒來卻發現根本就沒辦法做到。\n\n\n\n  「咔嚓咔嚓咔嚓………………」\n\n\n\n  周澤的身體開始劇烈地顫抖起來，\n\n\n\n  椅子都開始出現了裂縫，\n\n\n\n  而後直接崩裂，化作了碎片亂飛，\n\n\n\n  但周澤卻在下面沒有椅子的前提下，依然保持著坐的姿勢，根本就沒有摔下來。\n\n\n\n  因為他身體的重量和平衡完全被這十根指甲給支撐住了，\n\n\n\n  很詭異的姿勢，\n\n\n\n  很違和的畫面。\n\n\n\n  周澤的眼皮開始瘋狂地顫抖，像是在做著劇烈的掙扎。\n\n\n\n  那個意識，\n\n\n\n  那個意識居然在自己「回憶」時，被自己無意中激發出來了？ \n\n\n\n  這似乎是一種大勢所趨，周澤還沒嘗試過在它要甦醒時阻止，因為每次讓它甦醒，都是周澤自己本意所為。\n\n\n\n  遇到了危急的情況，\n\n\n\n  需要更為強大的力量，\n\n\n\n  周澤主動召喚它的甦醒，借用它的力量，\n\n\n\n  然而這一次，\n\n\n\n  周澤並不是主動的。\n\n\n\n  並且周澤清楚，如果是真的遇到絕對的危險召喚它出來也就罷了，無非是兩害相較取其輕，但現在自己都快睡覺了，在書店裡，\n\n\n\n  沒事做把它弄甦醒做什麼？\n\n\n\n  這好比是在做買賣，真得虧得慌，付出和收穫完全沒有可比性。\n\n\n\n  克制，\n\n\n\n  克制，\n\n\n\n  克制！\n\n\n\n  周澤慢慢地仰起頭，\n\n\n\n  他在竭力克制那個意識的甦醒，正在發力把控住自己的身體主動權。\n\n\n\n  你，\n\n\n\n  給我，\n\n\n\n  回去！\n\n\n\n  「噼啪劈啪噼啪………………」\n\n\n\n  隔壁房間裡，正躺在床上拿著書看睡前讀物的許清朗忽然發現屋子裡的燈好像出了什麼問題，開始忽明忽暗。 \n\n\n\n  老道房間裡猴砸馬上從床上跳下來，「吱吱吱」地叫著。\n\n\n\n  老道睡得死，雙腳用力夾著被子轉個身繼續睡了。\n\n\n\n  而和老道同一個房間一整夜都坐在床上的死侍，\n\n\n\n  直接跪在了地板上。\n\n\n\n  古語有云，旱魃一出赤地千里，周澤這邊的動靜當然不可能有「赤地千里」那麼誇張，但他周圍的小環境以及周圍的人，都受到了極為明顯的影響。\n\n\n\n  「額………………」\n\n\n\n  壓抑的聲音自周澤喉嚨里傳來，\n\n\n\n  他感覺自己就像是在拔河，\n\n\n\n  拔河的彩頭就是這扇門的鑰匙到底還能不能掛在自己的腰間。\n\n\n\n  如果對方在自己不願意的情況下依舊能夠甦醒過來掌控這具身體，那就意味著對方其實已經掌握了絕對的主動權。\n\n\n\n  身體上傳來了陣陣骨節脆響，\n\n\n\n  周澤慢慢地抬起頭，\n\n\n\n  脖子位置青筋畢露。\n\n\n\n  他的嘴張開，發出了無聲的嘶吼，\n\n\n\n  整個書店二樓幾個房間的窗戶包括電視劇電腦屏幕在此刻集體崩碎。\n\n\n\n  這一切過去之後，\n\n\n\n  周澤的身體一陣搖晃，但還是靠著插在地上的指甲穩定住了自己的身形。 \n\n\n\n  「呼呼…………呼呼…………」\n\n\n\n  嘴張得大大的，不停地喘息著，\n\n\n\n  周澤緩緩地睜開眼，\n\n\n\n  眼眸里，\n\n\n\n  還是清明的。\n\n\n\n  但冷汗已然打濕了周澤全身，\n\n\n\n  這是嚇的。\n\n\n\n  因為在剛才，周澤清楚地感知到，對方似乎知道了自己的用意，並且展開了反擊！\n\n\n\n  雖然這一次壓制住了，但下一次想要再以同樣地方式去竊取一些東西，還真得先掂量掂量了。\n\n\n\n  不過，\n\n\n\n  當周澤的眼睛看向自己那十根長到可以扳斷下來送給農民伯伯當鐮刀割麥子的指甲時，\n\n\n\n  他嘴角還是露出了笑意，\n\n\n\n  至少，\n\n\n\n  這波，\n\n\n\n  沒虧啊。",

    "content": "《鹹魚大典》第一列第一章第一條：\n\n\n\n  「人，要懂得滿足。」\n\n\n\n  作為一個勵志要做鹹魚王的男人，\n\n\n\n  周老闆在揮舞了幾下自己的「新爪子」像是一個小孩拿到了新玩具竊喜了一陣之後，\n\n\n\n  沒一會兒就把爪子收回去，跑到樓下重新洗了個澡，然後摟著女僕白睡大覺去了。\n\n\n\n  這種「監守自盜」的行為，真的很危險，尤其體內的那個意識也對此產生了反感甚至開始了反抗，好在最後被周澤鎮壓回去了。\n\n\n\n  但從另一個角度來說，這種感覺，還真刺激。\n\n\n\n  周老闆像是「偷雞」成功了一樣，\n\n\n\n  抱著反正已經賺了的心態，\n\n\n\n  這一覺睡得格外香甜。\n\n\n\n  興許是昨晚消耗了太多的原因，周澤一直到下午才睡醒，起床後發現自己的身體上下很多地方都在酸疼，就像是一個平時不怎麼運動的人忽然心血來潮高呼減肥地口號咬牙運動了一次的後果。\n\n\n\n  作為曾經的醫生，周澤當然清楚這是乳酸一下子分泌過多的原因，也沒當一回事兒，照舊悠哉悠哉下來洗漱，然後在一樓坐了下來。\n\n\n\n  白鶯鶯馬上送上來茶水和今天的報紙，\n\n\n\n  報紙是白鶯鶯特意事先熨燙過的。 \n\n\n\n  很長一段時間裡，貴族看報紙前僕人會事先把報紙熨燙一下，這是因為以前印刷技術不行，熨燙一下報紙可以避免翻閱時手指沾到油墨污漬，現在其實沒這個問題了，但白鶯鶯喜歡這種儀式感。\n\n\n\n  周澤也就聽之任之。\n\n\n\n  現如今，周老闆在白鶯鶯的無微不至照顧之下，很像是前清時每天早上就提著鳥籠出門遛鳥的旗人老爺。\n\n\n\n  老道在看著新聞，坐在吧檯旁邊，猴子坐他懷裡，他一邊看新聞一邊給猴子抓虱子。\n\n\n\n  其實猴砸很愛乾淨，自己也懂得去清理毛髮，但老道反正習慣這種感覺了，抓不抓到虱子無所謂，猴毛軟乎乎的，手感真不錯，揉揉捏捏也舒服得很。\n\n\n\n  猴砸也很享受，小腦袋靠在老道胸膛位置，一臉地愜意。\n\n\n\n  一人一猴無所事事的狀態，比市井小民口中的那種每天喝茶看報紙的機關辦公室更加得頹廢慵懶。\n\n\n\n  「喲，老闆，這位明星自殺了啊。」\n\n\n\n  老道指了指電視屏幕對周澤喊道。\n\n\n\n  「誰啊？」\n\n\n\n  周澤頭也沒抬，他對娛樂圈的新聞並不感興趣。\n\n\n\n  「就是唱《%￥@@#》的那位男歌手啊。」\n\n\n\n  「哦。」\n\n \n\n  歌知道，人不知道。\n\n\n\n  「他凌晨在微博上自爆出軌，還自爆了自己吸D，另外自爆了自己是同性戀，哇塞，這他娘的是成佛頓悟了吧。\n\n\n\n  自己把自己黑歷史在網上抖了個一乾二淨，然後從酒店樓上跳樓自殺了，嘖嘖，他的幾首歌貧道還是很喜歡的。」\n\n\n\n  說著說著，老道還伸手抓了擼了一把猴毛，\n\n\n\n  「猴砸也很喜歡，經常用自己手機切這歌。」\n\n\n\n  「哦。」\n\n\n\n  周老闆還是繼續享受熨貼的報紙給他帶來的舒適體驗感，他確實對這方面新聞沒什麼興趣。\n\n\n\n  死人，\n\n\n\n  他見多了。\n\n\n\n  男的，女的，高的，矮的，環肥燕瘦，秀外慧中，渣男好老公等等等，\n\n\n\n  在周老闆眼裡幾乎快成了流水線上的南京鹽水鴨，\n\n\n\n  赤條條地過來，套路性地打包，然後發送給地獄接收。\n\n\n\n  據說有法醫喜歡在自己工作的地方睡覺，因為那樣可以讓他覺得有人在陪伴自己的溫暖感，可能真不是人心理出問題了，人畢竟是一個習慣能力很強的動物。\n\n\n\n  「咦，等下。」\n\n\n\n  老道拿出手機又翻了翻，驚喜道： \n\n\n\n  「老闆，這歌星昨天在通城有商演，他就是在通城大飯店頂樓跳下去的。」\n\n\n\n  「哦。」\n\n\n\n  通城大飯店在很長一段時間裡，是通城人民心中的地標性建築物，十多年前通城人吹牛時喜歡吹自己昨兒個去通城大飯店吃飯了云云。\n\n\n\n  老道越來越激動，根本忽視了自家老闆的敷衍，繼續道：\n\n\n\n  「老闆，你說他今晚會不會來咱書店？\n\n\n\n  我得準備好牛眼淚啊，如果他來的話，我們興許還能聽他原聲唱一首歌。」\n\n\n\n  周澤抬起頭，瞥了一眼老道，\n\n\n\n  「不是所有死人都會來我們書店的。」\n\n\n\n  周澤提醒道。\n\n\n\n  如果死人都得來書店，那書店的GDP真的很恐怖了，周老闆得忙到連喝咖啡的時間都沒有，估計趕捕頭超巡檢都不是夢了。\n\n\n\n  但實際上絕大部分的亡魂是自己會下地獄的，只有少數中的少數不聽話的亡魂寶寶會通過書店這個渠道被送進地獄去。\n\n\n\n  「老闆，我覺得他很有冤屈啊，你看，他臨死前自爆了自己一切黑歷史，然後再自殺，這裡面有天大的冤情啊！」\n\n\n\n  「所以？」\n\n\n\n  「所以他很可能今晚就真的到書店裡來啊！」 \n\n\n\n  老道滿滿的追星范兒感覺。\n\n\n\n  講真，\n\n\n\n  老道這種追星方式在一定程度上可以說是完爆了有名的「虹橋一姐」，\n\n\n\n  你堵機場門口，我堵地獄門口。\n\n\n\n  「想追星？我倒是知道一個地方明星很多，還有張榮梅芳這類我也很喜歡的明星在。」\n\n\n\n  「真的？」老道驚喜道。\n\n\n\n  「嗯，趕緊找根繩子自己吊上去，我負責把你靈魂送進地獄，說不定還能趕上他們的地下演唱會。」\n\n\n\n  「…………」老道。\n\n\n\n  晚上，許清朗又準備了一桌大餐，周老闆第一次鄭重其事地拿出了自己珍藏的彼岸花牌果汁，小心翼翼地喝了一小口，接下來只覺得胃口大開，真的是飽餐了一頓！\n\n\n\n  桌上其他人看周老闆的感覺跟前天看那個奈何橋老阿婆狼吞虎咽時差不多。\n\n\n\n  果然，\n\n\n\n  地獄的生活條件差，\n\n\n\n  看把這些鬼餓得。\n\n\n\n  飯畢，\n\n\n\n  有些撐到的周老闆乾脆搬著一把椅子在書店門口坐了下來，借著彼岸花葯勁兒沒過的餘韻，周澤接過白鶯鶯端來的果子蜜餞繼續吃著。\n\n\n\n  幸福地進餐， \n\n\n\n  享受食物的美妙感覺，\n\n\n\n  這種久違的幸福，\n\n\n\n  如果不是周老闆刻意忍著憋著，可能在飯桌上都會哭出來。\n\n\n\n  許清朗走到店門口，點了一根煙，表情有些失落。\n\n\n\n  今天的這一餐，標誌著許清朗的以酸梅汁為主打的系列汁水飲品即將退出市場。\n\n\n\n  沒說話，沒交流，抽完煙後許清朗就回書店忙活自己的事情去了。\n\n\n\n  周老闆很是安逸地享受著傍晚南大街最後的喧囂，\n\n\n\n  同時心裡也在盤算著今晚是花點時間把昨天出來的鐮刀爪子練練先熟一下手呢還是繼續偷雞一把？\n\n\n\n  後一種衝動很快被周澤抑制住了，算了，貪多嚼不爛，慢慢來吧。\n\n\n\n  一輛小轎車在書店門口停了下來，車窗拉下，周澤看見裡面坐著一個身穿著藍色裙子的……男人！\n\n\n\n  喉嚨里的蜜餞一下子噎到了，周澤咳嗽起來。\n\n\n\n  對方側過臉，看了看周澤，表情上有一點點的不滿意，但也沒說什麼。\n\n\n\n  拿出手機，像是在重新定位一樣，最後，他又往周澤這邊看了看，這才推開車門，下了車。\n\n\n\n  等到對方下車時，周澤這才發現自己之前可能是看錯了，對方穿著一件黑色精緻的小西服，之前在車上可能是把女人的裙子披在了自己的身上在開車。 \n\n\n\n  人還沒走近，那一股子香味就已經瀰漫了過來，是香水的味道，很刺鼻，很濃郁。\n\n\n\n  此情此景之下，周澤很想把許清朗喊出來比劃比劃。\n\n\n\n  你遇到對手了！\n\n\n\n  不過，很快周澤就發現了不同，老許是直男，那方面功能和興趣都沒啥問題，他的偏女人容顏是天生的，而眼前這位，則是充滿著一種矯揉造作的氣息，而且作為一名資深外科醫生，周澤能看出來對方的臉上應該動過了不少刀子，這是硬生生地把自己整修出女人的味道來的。\n\n\n\n  「來到貴地，打個招呼，我叫劉楚宇，新晉鬼差，常州來的，今晚要羈押一名亡魂回去。」\n\n\n\n  對方對周澤伸出手，打算握手，但對方事先在手掌上放著一道手絹，意思很明顯了，他嫌棄周澤的手髒。\n\n\n\n  周老闆自己還有潔癖呢，看到這一幕笑了笑，也懶得跟這貨握手，直接問道：\n\n\n\n  「林可和我說了有個越界的常州鬼差要到這裡來，怎麼，從我這裡帶鬼走，搶生意？」\n\n\n\n  「我可以在其他方面對你進行補償，這個亡魂對我來說很重要，我需要親自給他送行，而且中途可能會出現一些意外。」\n\n\n\n  對方彎下腰，看著周澤：\n\n\n\n  「如果我的態度和姿態讓你覺得很不舒服，那我在這裡先給你道歉，我不想在這裡惹事。 \n\n\n\n  我不是孤傲，也不是清高，\n\n\n\n  而是因為這具身體的慣性太過強大，\n\n\n\n  我現在的很多行為細節都被這具身體以前的習慣帶動著，還沒完全適應過來，不好意思。」\n\n\n\n  「身體的慣性？」\n\n\n\n  「哦，簡而言之，這具身體本能地排斥男人，討厭男人，但偏偏他自己又是一個男人。」\n\n\n\n  劉楚宇一副哀莫大於心死的表情，\n\n\n\n  「落入這個寄主身體身上，我也很絕望啊。」\n\n\n\n  說著，劉楚宇還仔細看了看周澤，笑了笑，道：\n\n\n\n  「老兄，你這身體選得不錯，還挺帥的，我真是羨慕你啊。」\n\n\n\n  「呵呵。」\n\n\n\n  周澤本想和對方說說落到殺死自己的仇人身上也不是什麼值得被羨慕的事兒，\n\n\n\n  但再看看面前的這位，\n\n\n\n  他忽然覺得徐樂還是有他的可愛之處的。",

    "content": "書店裡，\n\n\n\n  劉楚宇在一個位置上坐著，旁邊有茶水和果盤，他也沒拿什麼書來裝裝樣子看，而是自顧自地拿出化妝鏡給自己補妝。\n\n\n\n  那個細膩，那個造作，那個神態，\n\n\n\n  嘖嘖。\n\n\n\n  許清朗見到他這一幕後，發現自己都有些無法接受，最後乾脆眼不見為淨，直接上樓準備休息了。\n\n\n\n  周澤隱約聽見剛上樓梯的許清朗那邊傳來了很不屑地一聲：\n\n\n\n  「sa、o 貨。」\n\n\n\n  老道依舊老神地在吧檯那邊坐著，手裡拿著一本《****歷險記》看得津津有味，\n\n\n\n  還不時地掏弄一下褲襠。\n\n\n\n  之前老道沒事做就拿《白潔的執教生涯》來看，\n\n\n\n  連那幾百萬字的後傳也都看完了，並且翻來覆去地又重新看了好幾遍。\n\n\n\n  到最後，老道甚至有些埋怨老闆借屍還魂得太早了，應該讓那個該死的徐樂多寫一點兒才好，畢竟這是造福幾代人的偉業，甚至會成為幾代人內心深處的青春痕跡。\n\n\n\n  白鶯鶯坐在周澤的後面，不時地給周澤添熱茶，然後自己手裡捧著一本《女僕的自我養成修養》在細細地鑽研著。\n\n\n\n  而且這還是日文版的， \n\n\n\n  周澤都有些驚訝白鶯鶯居然自學成才會了日文。\n\n\n\n  但想想也就釋然了，一個活了兩百年身體和精神都沒退化的話，她的智慧，應該很難用常人的眼光去看待了。\n\n\n\n  就這樣，漸漸的開始入夜了。\n\n\n\n  老道在等亡魂，他在等那個歌手，期待著那個歌手亡魂可以過來滿足一下老道特殊的追星需求。\n\n\n\n  那位常州新晉鬼差劉楚宇也是在等他的亡魂。\n\n\n\n  周澤伸了個懶腰，\n\n\n\n  抬頭看了一眼那兩位，\n\n\n\n  想到他們會不會等的是一個人？\n\n\n\n  似乎，\n\n\n\n  還真有這種可能。\n\n\n\n  但這位隔壁的同僚，也是追星一族？\n\n\n\n  就是為了追星才當鬼差的？\n\n\n\n  呵呵，\n\n\n\n  也沒那麼極端吧。\n\n\n\n  「吱呀…………」\n\n\n\n  書屋的門被推開了，\n\n\n\n  走進來一個頭上戴著斗笠的高瘦男子，男子手持一根竹竿兒，居然還戴著墨鏡。\n\n\n\n  大晚上的戴墨鏡，\n\n\n\n  還有那個斗笠，\n\n\n\n  真的好想讓人錘爆他的頭啊。 \n\n\n\n  從頭到尾都顯示出一種「我在裝逼」「我是高人」的高瘦男子找了一處靠窗的位置坐了下來\n\n\n\n  ，也沒喊茶水，更沒去書架拿出，就那樣繼續戴著墨鏡正襟危坐著。\n\n\n\n  倒是老道上點路子，隨手接了一杯礦泉水給他端過去，同時對那裝逼男囑咐道：\n\n\n\n  「一百塊最低消費啊。」\n\n\n\n  把水放下，老道又走回了吧檯，繼續拿起書看起來。\n\n\n\n  猴砸無聊，湊在老道身邊，像是抓虱子一樣給老道抓褲襠。\n\n\n\n  猴子身子小，老道又坐吧檯後面，所以周老闆沒看見，如果周澤看見了，估計一巴掌直接扇老道臉上去。\n\n\n\n  在周澤的記憶之中，有一個畫面一直忘不了，就是猴子站在急診室外面掏出他的「鐵棒」在瘋狂擼動的情景。\n\n\n\n  現在這小猴子保持著一開始的純真，還挺好的，周老闆可不會眼睜睜地看著老道繼續把猴子帶上歪路。\n\n\n\n  多了一個人之後，書屋裡的氛圍就更加安靜了。\n\n\n\n  沒人說話，沒人聊天，\n\n\n\n  大家各看各的。\n\n\n\n  周澤乾脆眯著眼，身子往後躺了躺，白鶯鶯起身幫周澤按起了肩膀。\n\n\n\n  就這樣似睡非睡地等到了大概十二點的時候，外面，起風了，緊接著，溫度好像都因此降低了一些。 \n\n\n\n  周澤有些疑惑地抬起頭，看向窗外。\n\n\n\n  白鶯鶯嘀咕道：「老闆，來的這是鬼麼？好大的排場啊。」\n\n\n\n  是的，\n\n\n\n  起風了，\n\n\n\n  落小雨了，\n\n\n\n  就差一首BGM了，活脫脫地電影主角出場模式。\n\n\n\n  周老闆在這家書店送鬼無數，別人都是悄悄地進村，打槍滴不要，今兒還是第一次碰到這種高調的情況。\n\n\n\n  風裡夾雜著鬼氣，\n\n\n\n  是鬼無誤了。\n\n\n\n  接下來，BGM居然也有了，有一個男人在外面唱歌，唱的是一首九十年代曾經很是流行的情歌，聲音婉轉，帶著一種特有的滄桑。\n\n\n\n  老道馬上站起身，一臉地激動！\n\n\n\n  臥槽，\n\n\n\n  真來了！\n\n\n\n  劉楚宇一動未動，繼續照著鏡子裡的自己，他保持這個姿勢和動作大概有幾個小時了，真是越看自己越想看，越覺得自己好看，整個人深深地沉醉在了其中。\n\n\n\n  戴著斗笠的裝逼男也沒有動，他自進來之後一直是正襟危坐，這個范兒，真的跟此時坐在那裡一動不動的死侍有得一拼，倆人像是在較勁一樣。\n\n\n\n  來客派頭擺得足足的， \n\n\n\n  最先進來的，\n\n\n\n  是一名穿著酒紅色西裝的男子，男子在深情地歌唱，臉色慘白。\n\n\n\n  老道差點直接跑過去跟人要簽名了，結果在男子身後，居然還有一個女人，一名身穿著紅色連衣裙的女人，就連這女人腳上，也是穿著紅色的高跟鞋。\n\n\n\n  普通人看不見，\n\n\n\n  但周澤可以看見，\n\n\n\n  這個女人身上的紅色，已經化作「水」一樣的液體滴淌下來了，她所走過之處，都有點點殷虹的殘留。\n\n\n\n  劉楚宇終於站了起來，走到了女人面前，目光炯炯，看著這個女人。\n\n\n\n  女人抬起頭，看向他，而後微微一笑，攤開雙手，道：\n\n\n\n  「鬼差大人，我遵照約定，請自縛入地獄。」\n\n\n\n  劉楚宇抿了抿嘴唇，顯得有些憤怒。\n\n\n\n  周澤能理解這位新晉同僚為什麼憤怒，可能，劉楚宇和這個女鬼之前有過什麼約定，就像是自己以前跟那個陪兒子高考複習的婦人一樣。\n\n\n\n  但現在結果卻是，\n\n\n\n  女人成了厲鬼，\n\n\n\n  厲鬼，\n\n\n\n  不具備再入地獄下輪迴的資格。\n\n\n\n  就像是原本新鮮可以賣個好價錢的水果已經爛掉了，別說賣了，自己吃都怕鬧肚子。 \n\n\n\n  「把他給我放開，你下不了地獄，自行消散了吧，他還可以，你放開對他的束縛，我送他下地獄。」\n\n\n\n  「喂！」\n\n\n\n  白鶯鶯很不滿地開口想要說什麼，\n\n\n\n  卻被周澤伸手抓住了手腕，示意她不要說話。\n\n\n\n  周澤知道白鶯鶯想抱怨什麼，你是來找女鬼的，結果發現女鬼變成厲鬼無法變成績點之後，居然想著送男鬼下去。\n\n\n\n  這裡是通城，是我家老闆的地盤，\n\n\n\n  你跑這裡搶生意是啥子意思？\n\n\n\n  「我要跟他在一起的呢。」\n\n\n\n  女鬼的手和男鬼緊緊地牽在一起，男鬼一臉迷茫，女鬼滿眼深情。\n\n\n\n  這他娘的才叫死忠追星粉啊，\n\n\n\n  狂熱到我就算是死了，\n\n\n\n  變成鬼，\n\n\n\n  也要帶著你一起下地獄。\n\n\n\n  老道白天說過這位男歌星的死有點異常，死前把自己生前所有黑歷史都自爆出來了，然後跳樓。\n\n\n\n  看來，應該是受到了鬼物的影響。\n\n\n\n  周澤心神微微一凝，\n\n\n\n  有鬼物在自己的通城殺人了啊。\n\n\n\n  這可不是什么小事了。 \n\n\n\n  「你自己作踐自己，現在又拉了他一起下水，別不知廉恥！」\n\n\n\n  劉楚宇盯著女鬼，一字一字地說道。\n\n\n\n  女鬼有些嬌羞，也有些哀怨，但還是對著劉楚宇跪了下來，哭泣哀求道：\n\n\n\n  「上差大人，求你了，黃泉路上有他和我一起走，我才不覺得寂寞。」\n\n\n\n  「黃泉路？你以為你還有機會下黃泉麼？\n\n\n\n  現在，你給我放開他，我送他下去，他已經被你害得夠慘了。」\n\n\n\n  「但我為了墮過三次胎，為他付出了一切！\n\n\n\n  我愛他，\n\n\n\n  愛他甚過愛我的家人，\n\n\n\n  我對不起我的家人了，\n\n\n\n  我現在只想要他跟我在一起，哪怕一起下地獄！」\n\n\n\n  女鬼像是有些瘋癲了，\n\n\n\n  當然了，\n\n\n\n  你不瘋癲不執念深重，你也化不了厲鬼。\n\n\n\n  「你給我滾開！」\n\n\n\n  劉楚宇將自己之前坐在那裡一直把玩的鏡子翻轉過來，一束紫光激射而出，直接打在了女鬼的身上，女鬼重重地摔在了地上，靈魂都變得單薄了許多。\n\n\n\n  緊接著，\n\n \n\n  劉楚宇一把抓住了那個男歌星亡魂。\n\n\n\n  「不要，不要，求求你，上差，不要啊，不要啊！！！」\n\n\n\n  女鬼苦苦哀求著，她的雙手抓住了劉楚宇的腿，\n\n\n\n  而劉楚宇居然因此而不能動彈。\n\n\n\n  從開始到現在一直在安心做「吃瓜群眾」的周澤臉上終於露出了一抹恍然之色，\n\n\n\n  之前周澤就在心裡疑惑，為什麼這位新晉隔壁同僚要特意跑到通城來追捕一名女鬼，哪怕這名女鬼變成了厲鬼，其實也沒那麼重要，她跑通城來就由通城的鬼差收拾也是一樣的。\n\n\n\n  問題的關鍵點在於女鬼被打傷魂體之後，\n\n\n\n  居然還能牽制住一名鬼差的行動！\n\n\n\n  這絕不是一名普通的女鬼，\n\n\n\n  確切地說，\n\n\n\n  不是這個女鬼死後有什麼異常變化，\n\n\n\n  而是這個女人在生前，\n\n\n\n  絕非一般！\n\n\n\n  這是一條大魚啊。\n\n\n\n  現實里，是有類似癩頭和尚那種通玄的人存在的；\n\n\n\n  其實，許清朗也算是這一種吧，但他半桶水的厲害，老道祖上應該也是闊綽過，否則也不可能留下這麼有用的符紙，而且跟大白菜批發一樣，老道用完一張還有一張。 \n\n\n\n  周澤點了一根煙，他還是沒動，若是女鬼沒變成厲鬼的話，周老闆現在說不定就玩一把強行黑吃黑。\n\n\n\n  不過，周澤沒動，之前那個頭戴著兜里一副恨不得告訴天下人「我在裝逼」的高瘦男子，緩緩地站了起來。\n\n\n\n  他摘下了兜里，\n\n\n\n  露出了謝頂的頭，\n\n\n\n  那一雙三角眼眸，給人一種很促狹的感覺。\n\n\n\n  看著死死抱住劉楚宇的腿求情的女鬼，\n\n\n\n  看著正在不斷用鏡子抽打呵斥女鬼的劉楚宇，\n\n\n\n  瘦高男子深吸一口氣，\n\n\n\n  沉聲道：\n\n\n\n  「過分了，你們這幫天殺的鬼差。」\n\n\n\n  「…………」周澤。\n\n\n\n  坐在邊上根本什麼話都沒說動也沒動的周老闆一臉黑人問號？\n\n\n\n  這真的是，\n\n\n\n  人在家中坐，\n\n\n\n  鍋從天上來。\n\n\n\n  ——————\n\n\n\n  PS：《深夜書屋》上閃屏推薦了，就是重新打開起點客戶端時會出現的推薦，這是515粉絲戰隊時，大家參加戰隊幫龍爭取到好名次所得到的推薦獎勵，龍在這裡真誠地感謝大家。\n\n\n\n  大家可以微信「添加朋友」搜索「純潔滴小龍」或者「kongbu66」，關注龍的公眾微信號，龍在裡面已經發布了白鶯鶯和老道的人物小傳，接下來會繼續寫番外在那裡發布發布。",

    "content": "生活，在很多時候，並不是小時候所看的臉譜化電視劇，裡面就兩種人：\n\n\n\n  一種是朱時茂，\n\n\n\n  一種是陳佩斯，\n\n\n\n  只有兩個陣營，\n\n\n\n  一個是好人，\n\n\n\n  另一個是壞人。\n\n\n\n  就比如現在的周老闆，舉著陰陽冊，高呼「我喊你你敢應一聲麼？」\n\n\n\n  丟進西遊記里，\n\n\n\n  滿滿的十分鐘龍套既視感，\n\n\n\n  甚至戲份上可能還比不過那個「大王叫我來巡山」的小妖。\n\n\n\n  一件事情，因為雙方勢力的加入和互相忌憚，最終將以平穩的局面收場，但周老闆橫插一腳。\n\n\n\n  他的行為是好是壞？\n\n\n\n  能分得清楚麼？\n\n\n\n  說到底，這還是周澤第一次碰見真正的薩滿法師，也是第一次看見那些傳說中能夠上身的「大仙兒」，這也是他第一次主動拿出陰陽冊打算用用。\n\n\n\n  陰陽冊有一個功能，可以收取靈魂！\n\n\n\n  當初那個據說曾被周澤前身給強爆過的女人說過，如果周澤願意，完全可以收幾個艷鬼進去，沒事做時就進去體驗一下；\n\n\n\n  當然，只能體驗個半套了。 \n\n\n\n  周老闆當然不會無聊到拿這個陰陽冊去裝艷鬼，如果真的把這個當作一個高級的飛機杯，也著實太暴殄天物了。\n\n\n\n  今兒個，\n\n\n\n  第一次碰見所謂的東北的大仙兒，\n\n\n\n  周老闆一時興起，\n\n\n\n  拿起陰陽冊，\n\n\n\n  準備拿個一血！\n\n\n\n  以前無冤無仇，\n\n\n\n  現在毫無瓜葛，\n\n\n\n  但你既然來到我的書店了，\n\n\n\n  就意味著，\n\n\n\n  咱倆有緣啊！\n\n\n\n  八姑奶回歸頭，看向周澤，她沒有回應，也沒有喊一聲「俺老八在此！」\n\n\n\n  但陰陽冊在周澤注入煞氣的催動之下，自己開始顫抖起來，一聲貓叫，悠然響起，仿佛沉睡已久的凶獸，露出了屬於它的猙獰。\n\n\n\n  八姑奶後退一步，\n\n\n\n  但陰陽冊上卻撒照出來一束白色的光芒直接將這個瘦高個男子全身籠罩，\n\n\n\n  瘦高個男子臉上露出了極為痛苦的表情，\n\n\n\n  而後一縷縷黑煙自其天靈蓋位置升騰而起，黑煙先在上方不斷的盤旋著，像是在掙扎，在抵抗。\n\n\n\n  下邊， \n\n\n\n  手持陰陽冊的周老闆身體不停地劇烈顫抖，\n\n\n\n  媽的，\n\n\n\n  這陰陽冊居然像是大功率抽油煙機一樣，不停地在汲取自己身上的煞氣！\n\n\n\n  「呃呃呃………………」\n\n\n\n  周老闆拼命保持著身體的平衡，同時也在不停搜刮著自己體內的煞氣。\n\n\n\n  但在旁邊老道看來，自家老闆像是忽然捧著一個筆記本發起了羊癲瘋，跳起了老年迪斯扣，就差嘴角再點綴一點白沫子了。\n\n\n\n  白鶯鶯在旁邊見狀，馬上伸手過來搭在了周澤肩膀上，其身上的煞氣也一起過渡了進去，幫周澤分擔壓力。\n\n\n\n  不能怪周澤這個時候幾乎出洋相，\n\n\n\n  實在是因為這種「高科技產品」周老闆也是第一次使用，而且還沒有說明書。\n\n\n\n  這玩意兒周澤平時也不敢帶在身邊，基本都是讓白鶯鶯妥善保存在某個地方，因為帶著這個東西走路它會不停地提醒你你身邊哪些人馬上要死了。\n\n\n\n  你是救還是不救呢？\n\n\n\n  明明是那些素麵平生的人，也和你沒有半點瓜葛，如果你知道他們要死了卻沒有絲毫行動，平白地給自己增添負罪感做什麼？\n\n\n\n  生老病死各種意外不都是人之常情麼？\n\n \n\n  但誰又能真得看得開呢，哪怕當初自己吃了自個兒良心的周老闆，如果走路上忽然看見某個小孩或者一個孕婦命不久矣，\n\n\n\n  真能無動於衷？\n\n\n\n  之前的準備不足，\n\n\n\n  加上此時的倉促，\n\n\n\n  確實讓周澤這邊有點亂了手腳，\n\n\n\n  但還在八姑奶也沒多給力，或者說是這陰陽冊確實對強橫靈魂類生物有著一種天然的克制，畢竟是判官標配的法器，哪怕它跌了品相也絕不是那麼好相與的。\n\n\n\n  「可惡…………然而…………」\n\n\n\n  在留下了幾聲似是而非的吶喊之後，\n\n\n\n  這一團黑霧所凝聚的八姑奶最終還是被周澤收入了陰陽冊之中。\n\n\n\n  周澤只覺得這冊子好像變得重了一些，而且封面也發生了改變，原本只有一隻黑貓的，現在變成了黑貓在左，一條花蛇在右，貓的體格明顯比蛇大了不少，正對著花蛇咆哮著，而那條蛇則顯得有些迷茫和顫慄。\n\n\n\n  「啪！」\n\n\n\n  反手將筆記本扣在了吧檯上，\n\n\n\n  周澤不停地做著深呼吸。\n\n\n\n  累啊，\n\n\n\n  太累了，\n\n\n\n  全身上下已然被冷汗給打濕了， \n\n\n\n  不得已之下，周澤只能坐在身後的椅子上繼續大口喘著氣。\n\n\n\n  瘦高個昏迷在了地上，一會兒請神上身一會兒神又被以強硬的手段剝離開，再加上中途又被海扁了一頓，瘦高個是真的被透支得厲害，直接不省人事了。\n\n\n\n  而劉楚宇，他的目光帶著濃濃的忌憚先是在瘦高個身上掃過，隨後又著重地看向周澤。\n\n\n\n  周老闆沒在他面前遮掩自己的虛弱，\n\n\n\n  不是周老闆忽略了，\n\n\n\n  而是他壓根覺得沒這個必要。\n\n\n\n  一個新晉鬼差而已，自己哪怕氣喘吁吁，對付他，也不成問題。\n\n\n\n  甚至，周澤心裡還有一點點的衝動，希望對方忍不住出手來搶奪陰陽冊，自己正好有藉口用他練習一下自己新進階的「龍抓手」。\n\n\n\n  那鐮刀一樣長且鋒銳的爪子，周老闆還真想在實戰中體驗一下那種感覺。\n\n\n\n  然而，\n\n\n\n  劉楚宇似乎比想像中更懂得大體，或者說，他其實更加謹慎一些，八姑奶前車之鑑在前，他對周澤的看法也瞬間發生了變化，\n\n\n\n  他只是湊到周澤身邊，小聲道：\n\n\n\n  「哥們兒，你這法器，強得厲害啊，東北大仙兒，一個照面下來就被你給鎮壓了？」 \n\n\n\n  周澤笑笑，伸手接過白鶯鶯遞來的茶水，連喝了好幾口。\n\n\n\n  「但哥們兒，雖說東北大仙兒歷來數目稀少，而且建國以來想成精就更難了，\n\n\n\n  但他們是出了名的團結，今兒個你收了一個，保不准明後天就有其他的大仙來找你麻煩。」\n\n\n\n  周澤聞言，倒是沒被對方這三聲兩聲地恐嚇給嚇到，\n\n\n\n  周老闆現在真的是虱子多了不怕咬了，自己身上還有一個大炸彈隨時可能會引爆呢，俗話說千金之子不坐垂堂，但周老闆就像是一個身上背著炸藥包的亡命之徒。\n\n\n\n  比如奈何橋來的那個老太婆，周澤直接殺了。\n\n\n\n  這個東北大仙兒周澤不知道擅自收了他會引起什麼連鎖反應？\n\n\n\n  無所謂了，\n\n\n\n  收了，\n\n\n\n  正好試試自己這法器靈不靈光。\n\n\n\n  倒不是周鹹魚忽然明白過來準備洗心革面奮發搞事情了，\n\n\n\n  當年連慈禧老太后也敢跟世界列強集體宣戰呢，\n\n\n\n  說到底，\n\n\n\n  這只能說明周澤的鹹魚狀態又提升了一層，\n\n\n\n  進入了破罐子破摔境！\n\n\n\n  劉楚宇又伸手指了指那個男歌手，道：「哥們兒，大頭你吃了，這小頭，我來吃吧？」 \n\n\n\n  意思是讓他多少送一個鬼下去，獲得一點點的績點，也算他沒白折騰。\n\n\n\n  他覺得這個要求並不過分，這件事，周澤從開始到整個過程基本啥事兒都沒幹，但最後卻收服了一位大仙兒，不考慮接下來會引起的連鎖反應，單看現在，周澤已經算是吃了個滿嘴油了。\n\n\n\n  他喝一口湯，\n\n\n\n  不為過吧？\n\n\n\n  誰知道周老闆正對他的「識大體」反應很不爽呢，自己的鐮刀牌指甲看來還得等一段時間才能練手，面對對方的「合理請求」，直接道：\n\n\n\n  「滾吧。」\n\n\n\n  「…………」劉楚宇。\n\n\n\n  臥槽，\n\n\n\n  你這個臭男人，\n\n\n\n  忒不要臉了吧！\n\n\n\n  劉楚宇掌心一揮，\n\n\n\n  還在老道跟前的那面小鏡子當即飛了起來，然而，在半途中白鶯鶯卻直接伸手，攥住了那面鏡子。\n\n\n\n  鏡子在白鶯鶯手裡不停地顫抖著，卻無法掙脫白鶯鶯的「魔爪」。\n\n\n\n  「嚶嚶嚶，老闆，人家喜歡這個小鏡子，這樣人家以後就能畫更好看的妝伺候你了呢。」\n\n\n\n  白鶯鶯蹲在周澤面前賣萌撒嬌道。\n\n\n\n  「收下收下。」 \n\n\n\n  周扒皮一副理所應當的樣子。\n\n\n\n  「哥們兒，別欺人太甚，大家都是同僚，面子做得太死可誰都不好看！」\n\n\n\n  劉楚宇手指著周澤呵斥道。\n\n\n\n  周澤聞言，笑笑，\n\n\n\n  大大方方地換了葛優躺姿勢，\n\n\n\n  嘲弄之意溢於言表。\n\n\n\n  「真的道理講不通了？」\n\n\n\n  劉楚宇開始進行「勿謂言之不預」的流程了。\n\n\n\n  事實上，周澤真想他能夠直接跳步，當初自己殺的鹽城那兩位鬼差時，人家也沒這麼墨跡啊。\n\n\n\n  然而，\n\n\n\n  之前痛扁瘦高個，又呵斥女鬼的劉楚宇，\n\n\n\n  此時卻顯得無比的謹慎和從心，\n\n\n\n  從心得連老道都有點看不下去了。\n\n\n\n  擦，\n\n\n\n  老闆都這樣壓榨欺負你了，\n\n\n\n  你還不敢反抗？\n\n\n\n  你不光是臉上動了刀子，\n\n\n\n  下面也咔嚓過了吧？\n\n\n\n  「以後，走著瞧！」\n\n\n\n  劉楚宇居然放下這句「狠話」之後，直接轉身準備走了。 \n\n\n\n  周澤有些茫然，看著白鶯鶯，指了指自己問道：\n\n\n\n  「我剛當鬼差時，沒他這麼慫吧？」\n\n\n\n  白鶯鶯搖搖頭，\n\n\n\n  然後又馬上點點頭。\n\n\n\n  走到門口，推開書店門，\n\n\n\n  背對著周澤等人的劉楚宇幾乎是在咬牙切齒。\n\n\n\n  而這時，周澤又喊住了他：\n\n\n\n  「喂，停下。」\n\n\n\n  劉楚宇心裡忽然長舒一口氣，轉過身，看向周澤，笑道：\n\n\n\n  「哥們兒準備化干戈為玉帛了？這就對了嘛，做人留一線，日後…………」\n\n\n\n  「我忘了我要當捕頭的，還差幾個鬼差小弟。\n\n\n\n  這樣吧，\n\n\n\n  你魂血留給我，\n\n\n\n  然後你再走吧。」\n\n\n\n  「…………」劉楚宇。\n\n\n\n  一張不知道打過多少次玻尿酸，下過多少刀的臉，\n\n\n\n  在此時硬生生地被憤怒逼成了豬肝色！\n\n\n\n  「欺人…………太甚…………」",

    "content": "做好人太累，\n\n\n\n  做那種可以被拿出來當宣傳畫冊的大好人更累，\n\n\n\n  那意味著你將自始至終地保持自己的絕對乾淨和高尚品格，否則那些無所不如的槓精肯定會往死里搜索關於你的一切黑歷史。\n\n\n\n  相反的是，\n\n\n\n  當反派就舒服多了。\n\n\n\n  周老闆覺得自己現在就很輕鬆，壓榨新晉同僚，一層層扒皮，簡直愜意得一比。\n\n\n\n  「欺人太甚！」\n\n\n\n  劉楚宇攤開手，掌心之中長出了一根肉芽，像是豆芽發芽了一樣，空氣中，當即開始瀰漫出一股淡淡的清香。\n\n\n\n  周澤下意識地屏住呼吸，繼續盯著眼前的這個人，確切的說，是盯著對方手掌上長出的那顆植物。\n\n\n\n  每個鬼差都有自己的看家本領，比如自己的指甲和小蘿莉的口技。\n\n\n\n  而眼前的這貨明顯是在他自己體內種下了什麼，這也就能夠解釋為什麼之前劉楚宇能如此能忍了，人是很容易被主觀情緒所影響的生物，但植物，卻能更冷靜地進行趨利避害感知一些東西。\n\n\n\n  興許，就是因為體內這株植物的關係，使得劉楚宇先前一而再再而三的忍讓。\n\n\n\n  「以大欺小麼，那我要看看，你到底配不配！」\n\n \n\n  劉楚宇掌心中的豆芽迅速生長而起，與此同時，書屋外圍和內部區域的所有夾縫間都開始長出了藤蔓和雜草。\n\n\n\n  匆匆翠翠，\n\n\n\n  鬱鬱蔥蔥，\n\n\n\n  貨真價實的「綠色環保書屋」。\n\n\n\n  一根根藤蔓拔地而起，直接掃向了周澤所在的區域。\n\n\n\n  白鶯鶯主動上前，雙手抓住了幾根藤蔓，向下一扯，直接將其扭斷，但斷裂的藤蔓卻迅速再生，像是狗皮膏藥一樣不停地環繞捆綁著白鶯鶯，白鶯鶯一時間還真的沒辦法脫開身。\n\n\n\n  老道那邊已經被藤蔓裹成了綠色的粽子，就連小猴子，也被裹成了小球在地上翻來覆去。\n\n\n\n  坐在角落裡的死侍身體也被包裹住了，但他只是有些迷茫地不停左右側頭，他似乎是在思考，這些植物到底算是書屋的綠化呢還是髒亂差的表現呢？\n\n\n\n  在思考好這些問題，或者是周澤主動發布命令之前，死侍估計得一直這樣糾結下去。\n\n\n\n  他生前是一位特別會搞事情的神父，可以說是機關算盡太聰明，到頭來變成這種天然呆的模樣，不得不說也是一種很有趣的諷刺。\n\n\n\n  這不是一種攻擊屬性的法術，可能只是單純地拿來進行拖延和防禦用的，又或者是劉楚宇這傢伙還沒能把這顆植物給養熟，所以效果不是很明顯。 \n\n\n\n  但至少眼下來講，確實起到了阻礙對手的效果，這也說明，劉楚宇也沒打算硬磕，他是打算抽空逃離這裡。\n\n\n\n  逃回大吊州，\n\n\n\n  到時候常州那裡還有幾個鬼差，如果周澤還想要跑常州抓小弟，肯定會激起整個蘇南地區鬼差的公憤。\n\n\n\n  周澤嘴裡吐出一口煙圈，\n\n\n\n  劉楚宇還沒走，\n\n\n\n  他走不了，\n\n\n\n  因為他的藤蔓已經把書店裡其他人都纏繞住了，但唯獨缺一個周澤。\n\n\n\n  周澤仍然坐在那裡，悠哉悠哉，而那些藤蔓卻不敢近他的身。\n\n\n\n  恐懼，\n\n\n\n  畏懼，\n\n\n\n  害怕，\n\n\n\n  這些情緒通過藤蔓這個載體也清晰地傳遞到了劉楚宇的腦中。\n\n\n\n  「呵呵，我說了，我們有緣分。」\n\n\n\n  周澤笑了笑，\n\n\n\n  在那個研究所地下，他吞吃了老樹根體內的那株果子，老樹根何許人也？幾乎就是一隻大妖了。\n\n\n\n  劉楚宇這個剛剛發了嫩芽的東西，怎麼敢在自己身上放肆？\n\n\n\n  這就像是當初的白鶯鶯很是畏懼自己身上流露出的殭屍氣息一個道理， \n\n\n\n  人在很多時候可以喊出「王侯將相寧有種乎」來造反，但對於妖物和其他類別的生物來說，血脈上的層級壓迫真的太過巨大和可怕。\n\n\n\n  周澤將菸頭丟下，用鞋底去踩了踩，然後站起身，雙手輕輕拍了拍。\n\n\n\n  「小時候看《神奇寶貝》，裡面要收服野生的神奇寶貝，都得先把它扁一頓當它奄奄一息時才好收服。\n\n\n\n  一般電視裡收小弟，也是一個道理，得先把他打一頓，小弟以後才能服帖。」\n\n\n\n  「嚶嚶嚶…………」\n\n\n\n  即使被綠色的藤蔓糾纏得很是困擾的白鶯鶯，\n\n\n\n  在此時居然還能分心配合一下自家老闆，\n\n\n\n  示意自己也是被老闆狠插之後才被老闆收服的。\n\n\n\n  周澤微微側了一下頭，看著劉楚宇，\n\n\n\n  「我們打一架吧，其實，當我小弟也不錯的，比如林可，就是通城的那位老鬼差。\n\n\n\n  她一直說，\n\n\n\n  奉我為捕頭，做我的小弟，\n\n\n\n  是她這輩子做得最正確的一個決定。\n\n\n\n  還有通城另一個鬼差，是我的小姨子，你看，我和我的小弟們關係真的很好，大家跟著我，其樂融融得很。」\n\n\n\n  周澤差點說得自己都信了，覺得自己真的是一個好老闆，好老大。 \n\n\n\n  劉楚宇臉色一陣陰晴變幻，下一刻，他果斷地將手中的莖芽收回，轉身都不走門了，直接準備撞破玻璃離開。\n\n\n\n  周澤一看他要撞門了，\n\n\n\n  也不敢耽擱了，\n\n\n\n  昨晚他偷出了「龍爪手」，\n\n\n\n  差點引起體內的那位甦醒，結果雖然被鎮壓下去了，但同樣的也是把書店裡的玻璃窗子以及各種屏幕全都震碎了。\n\n\n\n  自己是下午醒來的，所有人沒一點怨言。\n\n\n\n  老道拿公費先請人把玻璃換了一遍，然後買了更貴更好的電視機換上，白鶯鶯喜不自禁地又換了一個更貴的遊戲顯示屏。\n\n\n\n  反正都是走公款，大家都沒意見，就當提前提高生活質量水平了。\n\n\n\n  但花的可是周老闆的錢袋子啊，\n\n\n\n  周老闆心疼啊，\n\n\n\n  這玻璃白天剛換上，\n\n\n\n  你又要給我撞？\n\n\n\n  電視劇電影看多了吧，不走門偏偏喜歡撞玻璃？\n\n\n\n  周澤手掌一揮，\n\n\n\n  五根長長的指甲當即長了出來，\n\n\n\n  一股陰風當即蕩漾開去，\n\n\n\n  可怕的吸扯力直接貼住了劉楚宇的身體，劉楚宇剛起跳，還沒碰到玻璃呢，整個人就直接倒飛了回去，重重地砸在了地上。 \n\n\n\n  周澤快步上前，劉楚宇雙手撐開，一根根藤蔓自他身上長出來，企圖攔住周澤。\n\n\n\n  但周澤的長指甲真得太過鋒銳，頃刻間就將其給完全撕裂成碎片，而後彎腰，下蹲，兩根指甲直接卡在了劉楚宇的脖子兩邊。\n\n\n\n  這時候，\n\n\n\n  周澤只需要輕輕一夾，\n\n\n\n  劉楚宇就得被「狗頭鍘」伺候。\n\n\n\n  周澤停了下來，\n\n\n\n  看著劉楚宇。\n\n\n\n  劉楚宇覺得今天的經歷，實在是太過匪夷所思。\n\n\n\n  他是來抓鬼的，來沖業績的，\n\n\n\n  結果鬼沒抓到，還惹來了東北大仙兒，\n\n\n\n  東北大仙兒倒是很講道理，說話也很好聽。\n\n\n\n  但最後的結局偏偏就是自己被一層層扒皮之後，還得賣身給他？\n\n\n\n  新晉鬼差劉楚宇心裡可以說是滿滿的陰影，他在常州還是認識幾個其他的鬼差的，大家平時談不上多熟絡，但也算是點頭之交，彼此之間也還算客氣。\n\n\n\n  怎麼一到通城來，\n\n\n\n  就感覺這裡的同行像是土匪一樣？\n\n\n\n  一滴魂血自劉楚宇的額頭上浮出，帶著濃郁的憤懣和不甘，\n\n \n\n  這真的是被周澤逼良為娼了。\n\n\n\n  收起對方的魂血，周澤也不耽擱，直接將其融入了自己的鬼差證上，契約成功，完美。\n\n\n\n  收起了指甲，\n\n\n\n  劉楚宇慢慢地爬了起來，掃了一眼周澤鬼差證上的績點，原本就臉色蒼白的他更是直接面如死灰。\n\n\n\n  「怎麼了？」\n\n\n\n  周澤問道。\n\n\n\n  「你的績點……比我還少……」\n\n\n\n  「…………」周澤。\n\n\n\n  在業績上被自己的下屬鄙視了和超越了，作為領導來說，臉上難免有些掛不住。\n\n\n\n  其實，也是因為周老闆的鹹魚作風，外加隔三差五的一個昏迷就半個月一個月的，導致其正兒八經在做業績的時間並不多，而且周澤之前有一段實習鬼差的時間，也算是被耽擱了。\n\n\n\n  「作為領導，你不需要去知道具體的事情需要怎麼去做，只需要知道要做什麼事，你明白麼？」\n\n\n\n  周澤伸手拍了拍劉楚宇的臉，\n\n\n\n  好滑，\n\n\n\n  好嫩，\n\n\n\n  該死的，\n\n\n\n  這得打了多少玻尿酸！\n\n\n\n  劉楚宇不想再爭辯了，他爬起來後，對周澤又單膝跪下， \n\n\n\n  「拜見捕頭！」\n\n\n\n  「嗯嗯，起來吧，起來吧，地上涼，別凍著自個兒身子。」\n\n\n\n  「…………」劉楚宇。\n\n\n\n  「行了，這沒你的事兒了，你回常州吧，以後有事兒我就打電話給你，反正常州距離這裡也近得很。」\n\n\n\n  「額……好。」\n\n\n\n  劉楚宇爬起來，\n\n\n\n  然後道：「我的鏡子…………」\n\n\n\n  「端午節快到了吧。」\n\n\n\n  「啊……嗯。」\n\n\n\n  「逢年過節給領導送點東西孝敬一下，不過分吧？」\n\n\n\n  「額……不過分……不過……」\n\n\n\n  「那你還不走？」\n\n\n\n  「哦，好，我走。」\n\n\n\n  劉楚宇失魂落魄地走出了書店，他感覺自己像是做了一個夢。\n\n\n\n  「老闆，這鏡子很好玩哎。」\n\n\n\n  白鶯鶯拿著鏡子說道，\n\n\n\n  鏡子裡的她，笑靨如花，戴著古代頭飾，嬌羞可人。\n\n\n\n  說著，\n\n\n\n  白鶯鶯還把鏡子對準了周澤，「老闆，你來照照，它好像能照出前世嘢。」\n\n \n\n  當鏡子對準周澤的臉時，\n\n\n\n  只聽得「咔嚓」一聲，\n\n\n\n  鏡面出現了裂紋，而後更是直接炸裂。\n\n\n\n  「嘶……」\n\n\n\n  白鶯鶯收回手，\n\n\n\n  看著地上的一攤碎片，有些不知所措。\n\n\n\n  剛剛從下屬手裡潛規則收禮的周澤也是一愣，\n\n\n\n  搖搖頭，\n\n\n\n  嘆息道：\n\n\n\n  「唉，敗家娘們兒。」",

    "content": "今兒一早，\n\n\n\n  周老闆照常坐在習慣坐的位置，\n\n\n\n  陽光，\n\n\n\n  報紙，\n\n\n\n  咖啡，\n\n\n\n  葛優，\n\n\n\n  鹹魚，\n\n\n\n  周老闆的一天，就這樣開始了。\n\n\n\n  哪怕昨天的事情很多，周澤也是在起床後一股腦地都拋到腦後，怡然自得地享受自己晨間的生機勃勃。\n\n\n\n  白鶯鶯坐在旁邊，對著一堆小碎片發著呆，神情有些低落。\n\n\n\n  老道從旁邊經過，掃了一眼，道：\n\n\n\n  「這就是昨天被老闆帥炸了的鏡子？」\n\n\n\n  說這句話時，老道故意提高了音量，生怕老闆聽不到。\n\n\n\n  白鶯鶯抬起頭，嘟著嘴，\n\n\n\n  忍了很久，\n\n\n\n  還是「噗」的一聲笑出來了。\n\n\n\n  她其實還在為昨天把鏡子弄碎了的這件事感到傷心和難過，她知道自家老闆家底薄，也沒啥好東西，好不容易弄來一件，還沒玩熱乎呢，就被自己弄碎了。\n\n\n\n  老道也嘆了口氣，把嘴湊過去小聲道：\n\n\n\n  「其實這鏡子是被老闆丑哭了，你看這裂紋，像不像是淚痕？」 \n\n\n\n  「啪…………」\n\n\n\n  周澤合上了手頭的報紙。\n\n\n\n  老道悚然一驚。\n\n\n\n  「報紙上說，通城正在競選文明城市的關鍵時刻。」\n\n\n\n  「嗯？」老道有些不明所以，但他有種不祥的預感。\n\n\n\n  「老道。」\n\n\n\n  「哎，在。」\n\n\n\n  「去出份力吧，店門口的馬路，掃一下。」\n\n\n\n  「…………」老道。\n\n\n\n  老道蔫吧著腦袋扛著掃帚和拖把出去了，周澤也站起身，跟著一起走了出去。\n\n\n\n  點了一根煙，\n\n\n\n  伸了個懶腰。\n\n\n\n  就在這時，也就是在街對面的位置，聚集了一群人，有個女人在裡頭大喊大叫著，聲音很大，極為潑辣。\n\n\n\n  大早上的，南大街人流本就很大，這下子自然聚攏了不少吃瓜群眾。\n\n\n\n  對面應該是一家網咖，新開沒多久。\n\n\n\n  周老闆夾著香菸，慢騰騰地走了過去，從背影看過去，活脫脫的一個一天到晚沒一件正事兒就喜歡東家逛西家扯的懶漢。\n\n\n\n  「我兒子期中就沒考得好，老師還找我們家長，說他最近上課精神不集中什麼的，我還納悶呢，好啊，今兒個被我逮到了！ \n\n\n\n  還跟我說早點去學校晨讀，原來是跑到網吧里玩遊戲了！\n\n\n\n  天殺的，\n\n\n\n  是誰發明的遊戲啊！\n\n\n\n  國家怎麼不把這些該死的做遊戲和開網吧的都抓進牢里去，\n\n\n\n  這不是故意要毀掉我們的孩子麼！\n\n\n\n  孩子他懂什麼啊，\n\n\n\n  他有遊戲就玩，\n\n\n\n  他覺得好玩就玩，\n\n\n\n  這東西就跟毒癮一樣，\n\n\n\n  孩子完全不知道啊！」\n\n\n\n  中年婦人不停聲嘶力竭地嘶吼著。\n\n\n\n  在他前面，站著一個穿著藍襯衫的青年，青年******，很是斯文，女人說話時，他就微笑著站在她對面，沒有反駁，也沒有呼喊。\n\n\n\n  在二人旁邊，有一個頭髮散亂的高中生模樣的青年，低著頭，臉頰發燙，顯然是覺得在這大庭廣眾之下自己媽媽這樣大喊大叫讓他覺得很是羞恥。\n\n\n\n  女人說累了，\n\n\n\n  終於停歇了下來，\n\n\n\n  算是中場休息。\n\n\n\n  斯文青年終於找到了插口的機會，很平和地道：\n\n\n\n  「女士，如果你想教育你兒子，可以帶他回家或者帶回學校跟老師一起慢慢教育。 \n\n\n\n  我們這裡是網吧，是營業性場所，你堵在這裡吵鬧已經影響到我們的正常營業了。」\n\n\n\n  「我呸！你還好意思營業！\n\n\n\n  你們這些開網吧的老闆，就沒一個是好東西，全都是騙孩子的錢。\n\n\n\n  大家評評理，我剛去裡面看了一下，全都是一些玩遊戲的人，一個個眼睛盯著屏幕上看得仔細啊。\n\n\n\n  還有一些個油光滿面的，一看就是玩了一宿的，都不去上班了，也不去上學了，就一門心思地只知道玩遊戲！\n\n\n\n  要是他們爹媽看見他們這個樣子，\n\n\n\n  該有多心疼啊！」\n\n\n\n  「女士，您兒子已經成年了，他要來上網，我們不可能攔著…………」\n\n\n\n  「什麼狗屁成年不成年的，我兒子還只是一個學生，明年就要高考了！\n\n\n\n  我說我兒子成績為什麼下降了，\n\n\n\n  原來都是這個遊戲，\n\n\n\n  都是這個網吧給害的！\n\n\n\n  政府就應該把所有做遊戲的公司都關了，淨是帶壞孩子，讓我們這些家長操心！」\n\n\n\n  女人還在不停地叫喊著。\n\n\n\n  斯文男子伸手扶了扶自己的鏡框，搖搖頭，拿出手機，準備打電話。 \n\n\n\n  「你什麼意思啊，我在跟你講道理啊！\n\n\n\n  你想打電話喊人是不是？\n\n\n\n  你想對我玩黑社會是不是？\n\n\n\n  坑了我孩子，讓我孩子沉迷遊戲學習下滑，\n\n\n\n  還敢叫人來打我？\n\n\n\n  我告訴你，我也不是嚇大的，我也是本地人，我看看你敢叫人動我一下試試！」\n\n\n\n  「我報警。」\n\n\n\n  「報警？」女人愣了一下。\n\n\n\n  「你影響我正常營業了。」\n\n\n\n  「滾，你還有臉沒臉！」女人抬手直接打了過去，「啪」一聲，斯文男子的手機被女人打了下來，摔在了地上，手機正好滾落到周澤面前。\n\n\n\n  「還報警？我孩子明年考不上好大學就因為你這種狗東西開網吧，我還要報警呢！\n\n\n\n  大家評評理，\n\n\n\n  我們這些當家長的容易麼？\n\n\n\n  供孩子吃，供孩子穿，供他們上學，誰不希望自家孩子成材，誰不希望自家孩子能考上好大學啊。\n\n\n\n  但就是有這些做遊戲的混帳，有這些開網吧的黑心傢伙，\n\n\n\n  就想著從孩子身上賺這些黑心錢，\n\n\n\n  他們這是在毀了孩子啊！ \n\n\n\n  天吶，\n\n\n\n  救救孩子們吧，\n\n\n\n  這些天殺的遊戲啊。」\n\n\n\n  這時，男子身後走出來一個年輕女孩，她應該是這家網咖的員工，她先走到周澤面前蹲下來把手機撿起，隨後直接指著女人的鼻子就開始輸出：\n\n\n\n  「救救孩子？\n\n\n\n  你還有臉提？\n\n\n\n  自家孩子自己教育不好，自己沒家教，自己教不好孩子，還有臉怪遊戲身上去，還好意思怪開網吧的？\n\n\n\n  你家孩子就是個煞筆，他沉迷遊戲就意味著他是一個煞筆，就是一個智障，說明你就是智障的父母！\n\n\n\n  媽的，\n\n\n\n  我還要喊吶，\n\n\n\n  救救遊戲吧，\n\n\n\n  管管這些煞筆孩子吧！\n\n\n\n  管管你們這幫煞筆父母吧！\n\n\n\n  我們成年人想玩個遊戲，血都不能是紅的，得變成綠的，暴力血腥鏡頭都得減掉，因為影響未成年人！\n\n\n\n  未成年人偷個錢，搶個東西，就全是遊戲害的，\n\n\n\n  合著這個世界上全都是好人是吧？\n\n\n\n  全都是遊戲害的是吧？\n\n\n\n  別總想著推卸責任，這個社會一樣米養百樣人，有人能混的好，自然得有人墊底，別人為什麼不沉迷遊戲？別人為什麼能學習成績好？ \n\n\n\n  只會生不會養的狗東西，\n\n\n\n  只知道把責任往其他身上推，\n\n\n\n  你不會帶不會教當初爽的時候幹嘛不戴、、、套！」\n\n\n\n  女人愣在了當場，\n\n\n\n  附近不少吃瓜群眾在聽完這個女孩兒犀利反擊之後居然還在起鬨叫好。\n\n\n\n  這讓這個女人更加受不了了，直接衝上去和女孩兒扭打起來。\n\n\n\n  「你這個小浪蹄子，叫你罵我，叫你罵我！」\n\n\n\n  兩個女人廝打在了一起，很快就被周圍吃瓜群眾給拉開了。\n\n\n\n  周圍不少人開始勸女人先讓孩子去上學，別鬧了，女人也被女孩之前一頓罵給弄沒了氣勢，又留下了幾句狠話後就拉著自己的兒子走了。\n\n\n\n  周澤跟著那個女人走了一段路，等到女人把孩子送到公交站台時，趁著女人還在數落自己兒子的空檔，走到了女人伸手，伸手撩了一下女人的頭髮。\n\n\n\n  女人回過頭看了一眼周澤，大概覺得周澤穿得還算不錯，不像是揩油的色狼，就當是無意的沒繼續理會，轉而回過頭趁著公交車沒來，繼續罵自己的兒子。\n\n\n\n  周澤又晃晃悠悠地走回了網咖那邊。\n\n\n\n  網咖門口已經沒人了，恢復了正常營業。\n\n\n\n  周澤走了上去， \n\n\n\n  這家網咖的環境還真不錯，機器也很新，所以哪怕是大早上的，但裡面的顧客也不算少了。\n\n\n\n  斯文男子正在給女孩兒脖子那邊上藥，應該是剛剛扭打時被抓傷了。\n\n\n\n  女孩兒還很是憤憤不平地對斯文老闆說著些什麼，\n\n\n\n  但斯文男子只是隨意地笑笑，手指在女孩的鼻子上颳了刮。\n\n\n\n  女孩兒嘟了嘟嘴，回過頭，看見了周澤，馬上問道：\n\n\n\n  「早上好，身份證出示一下先生。」\n\n\n\n  「我不是來上網的。」周澤把手伸在櫃檯上面，看這這個女孩兒。\n\n\n\n  女孩兒微微皺眉，顯然是把周澤當作一個流氓了。\n\n\n\n  這時候，斯文老闆端著茶水走了過來，看見周澤時愣了一下，道：\n\n\n\n  「先生，我能幫你做些什麼？」\n\n\n\n  「其實，剛剛吵架時，我挺支持你們的。」周澤說道。\n\n\n\n  「呵呵，讓先生你見笑了，事情都過去了。」斯文男子說道。\n\n\n\n  「我就是對面開書店的，在七八年前，我這種賣小說的和你們開網吧的一個待遇，都被家長認為是帶壞他們孩子的元兇。\n\n\n\n  時代在變，社會在變，很多古文化都失傳了，\n\n \n\n  但這一代代家長推卸責任的水平，\n\n\n\n  倒是完整地傳承了下來。」\n\n\n\n  「既然是鄰居，那就到裡面來，我請先生你喝茶。」斯文男子熱情地說道。\n\n\n\n  周澤抬起手，示意不忙，\n\n\n\n  緊接著，周澤把用自己指甲夾著的一隻黑色的小蟲子放在了吧檯上。\n\n\n\n  小蟲子有些奄奄一息的架勢，像是蛆，但身上帶著彩色的斑斕。\n\n\n\n  手指著這隻小蟲子，\n\n\n\n  周澤慢悠悠地問道：\n\n\n\n  「同情歸同情，\n\n\n\n  理解歸理解，\n\n\n\n  那個女人，我也不喜歡，\n\n\n\n  但就這樣讓她去死，\n\n\n\n  也太過了一些吧？」",

    "content": "斯文老闆看了一眼自己的雇員，搖搖頭，對周澤做了一個「請」的動作，示意周澤可以進去聊。\n\n\n\n  女雇員在旁邊緊張地雙手掐著自己的衣服邊角，急得眼淚都要掉出來了，顯然是怕得很，她不是怕周澤，而是怕自己的老闆。\n\n\n\n  周澤走進了裡面的隔間。\n\n\n\n  很少有網咖會特意開一個辦公室的，大部分都是恨不得榨乾最後一點點的空間，能多安排一個機位就安排一個機位，能多弄個包廂就多弄個包廂，至於工作人員的休息場所，也是能簡單就簡單。\n\n\n\n  而且，這個辦公室還真的挺寬敞，裡頭還有一個房間，應該是臥室，主廳有沙發還有辦公桌，地毯是一幅有封膜的水墨畫，行的是山水大格局畫風，人踩在上面時，仿佛真有一種置身於白山黑水之間的錯覺。\n\n\n\n  牆壁上掛著的都是字畫，裡面還有幾個連周澤這個不通字畫的人都有些印象的名家落款，也不曉得到底是真是假。\n\n\n\n  但……應該是真的吧，畢竟對方能在南大街這種地方開網咖，而且還極為奢侈地在裡頭弄這麼大一個空間作為生活休息區域。\n\n\n\n  周澤現在看這位，頗有一種以前別人看自己的感覺。\n\n\n\n  在一個城市最黃金的商業街階段，開一家肯定賠錢的書店，\n\n\n\n  嗯，\n\n\n\n  這個老闆肯定「深不可測」，至少很有錢。 \n\n\n\n  對方泡了茶，主動端了過來。\n\n\n\n  「請坐。」\n\n\n\n  周澤在沙發上坐下，他可以說是來興師問罪的，但實際上情感傾向沒那麼重。\n\n\n\n  任何人，做任何事情時都難免帶上一些主觀情感傾向，比如周澤看那個女人不是很舒服，雖然出手幫她把那蟲子給摘取了出來，但要急哄哄地給她討個說法報仇什麼的，也不至於。\n\n\n\n  「這件事，是我的錯，我沒管教好我的人，也謝謝兄弟出手幫忙，否則，後果不堪設想。」\n\n\n\n  說著，\n\n\n\n  斯文男子直接捏碎了手中的茶杯，\n\n\n\n  而後右手抓著一根陶瓷片，對著自己的左臂直接劃了下去！\n\n\n\n  一時間，\n\n\n\n  左手手臂自肩膀往下的位置，\n\n\n\n  出現了一道可怖的傷口，\n\n\n\n  鮮血淋漓。\n\n\n\n  周澤低下頭，喝了一口茶，茶香四溢，沁人心脾。\n\n\n\n  對方的血滴落在了地毯上，匯聚了一灘，但對方卻像是什麼事兒都沒發生一樣，右手扶了扶鏡框，左手垂在了身旁，走到了周澤面前，問道：\n\n\n\n  「兄弟，這個交代，您看怎麼樣？」\n\n\n\n  周澤點點頭，示意足夠了。 \n\n\n\n  其實，按照周老闆的善惡觀來說，他可沒有什麼「特殊人士」為禍人間必須要「替天行道」的覺悟，周澤不清楚這個世界是否真的有「龍虎山道士」「嶗山道士」這類的存在，但他明白一點，不管怎麼安排，懲惡揚善，維護人間正道秩序的責任怎麼落都不可能落到他這個鬼差的身上。\n\n\n\n  充其量，\n\n\n\n  周澤真正過來的原因，無非是無意之間發現就住在街對面的這個鄰居，有點不一般，本著臥榻之側的忌諱，所以來摸摸底。\n\n\n\n  「兄弟，敢問你是哪家的路數？」\n\n\n\n  先是一番自我懲戒，\n\n\n\n  而後開始摸底細，\n\n\n\n  這是江湖上常見的套路。\n\n\n\n  周澤伸手指了指地下，\n\n\n\n  意思是我乃地下工作者。\n\n\n\n  「哦，盜墓的兄弟，也不知道兄弟師承盜墓哪一派？」\n\n\n\n  「…………」周澤。\n\n\n\n  「是我唐突了，我叫渠明明，老家是河南的，家裡祖上是從醫的；\n\n\n\n  不過到我這一代，呵呵，我喜歡玩遊戲，小時候經常蹺課不喜歡醫堂喜歡去網吧，所以現在從家裡出來，我也就開了一個網吧，這家網吧開了有半年了。\n\n\n\n  這樣看來，也是我的疏忽，居然不知道附近有兄弟這種藏龍臥虎的人。」 \n\n\n\n  「我還以為你是從苗疆來的。」\n\n\n\n  「是因為那隻蟲子麼？其實，自古以來，醫蠱不分家的，甚至在更久遠的時期，醫生還兼職算卦等等其他職業，在部落里被稱之為巫師。\n\n\n\n  現在的人因為一些影視文學作品的影響，認為只有苗疆才有蠱術，這只能算是大眾的誤區而已。\n\n\n\n  那隻蟲子，是以中藥調和餵養出來的，潛入人體之後能釋放慢性毒素，讓人心肺功能開始陷入衰竭周期。\n\n\n\n  我也沒想到我家的小妹這次出手這麼重，是我的疏忽，現在想想，還不由得有些後怕，多虧了兄弟出手，才沒有釀成大禍。」\n\n\n\n  這個世界上，確實是有不少奇人異士的，他們不一定通玄，但他們一個個的手段，也都絕對不容小覷。\n\n\n\n  對方既然誤以為自己是盜墓行當的人，那麼也就是說明他不具備「陰陽眼」的能力，看不透自己的真實身份。\n\n\n\n  而且，對方無論是從態度上還是從自我懲戒的角度上，都表現得很完美，進退有據，很是誠懇，也確實沒有可以指摘的地方。\n\n\n\n  至於那位吧檯網管小妹，這個男人在自己面前的自殘，已經算是代為受罰了，周澤也不會再追究下去，\n\n\n\n  難不成真給警察打電話報警說警察叔叔這裡有人用「苗疆蠱術」要殺人？ \n\n\n\n  估計如果接電話是一個風趣的警察叔叔他說不定會回你一句：好，那就請你代表月亮消滅她吧！\n\n\n\n  「既然是鄰居，那麼兄弟留下來吃頓飯吧，小弟不才，廚藝上還能過得去。」\n\n\n\n  吃飯？\n\n\n\n  算了。\n\n\n\n  周澤不習慣在外面吃飯。\n\n\n\n  周澤正準備拒絕，誰成想這位渠明明同學居然又加了一句：\n\n\n\n  「我擅長藥膳，以藥入味，可調理周身氣血，活熱經脈。\n\n\n\n  觀氣色，我發現兄弟你是不是經常受傷？\n\n\n\n  所以身上累積之淤氣凝而不散，這些東西終究對身體有害處。\n\n\n\n  調理一下，能夠起到延年益壽的效用。\n\n\n\n  人依氣而活，氣活則人盛，鬼差不敢侵也。」\n\n\n\n  「…………」周澤。\n\n\n\n  「不必了。」\n\n\n\n  周澤站起身，準備離開，自家身體自家清楚，難不成以後開一次無雙就來這裡「調理」一次？\n\n\n\n  到時候這這位網咖老闆可能還以為自己多敬業呢，老是去盜墓時碰到粽子要搏鬥。\n\n\n\n  不對，\n\n\n\n  粽子，\n\n\n\n  聽起來有點刺耳啊。 \n\n\n\n  周澤走到了門口，\n\n\n\n  渠明明居然又開口道：\n\n\n\n  「我的藥膳，對調理隱疾有很大的效果。」\n\n\n\n  隱疾？\n\n\n\n  周澤停住了腳步，\n\n\n\n  伸手揉了揉自己的脖子，感嘆道：\n\n\n\n  「脖子好像確實有些酸了，以前確實受過傷，那就調理一下吧。」\n\n\n\n  ………………\n\n\n\n  廚房在二樓，\n\n\n\n  是的，\n\n\n\n  渠明明包下了兩層樓，一層樓做網咖和辦公室臥室，\n\n\n\n  這第二層樓，\n\n\n\n  則是分門別類地堆放著各種藥材還有好幾口大小爐子以及鍋具，簡直就是吃貨的天堂。\n\n\n\n  周澤上來參觀了一遍之後，就下去了，有一處被簾幕遮擋的區域渠明明沒掀開讓他進去，周澤也就識趣兒地沒去。\n\n\n\n  其實，\n\n\n\n  周澤已經「聽」到了，那裡面有密密麻麻「細細碎碎」的聲響，存放的是什麼，也就不言而喻了。\n\n\n\n  對於那些蠱蟲，周老闆是沒多大的興趣的。\n\n\n\n  渠明明負責做藥膳，他說做好了會端下來。\n\n\n\n  周澤也就一個人在辦公室里欣賞著這些畫卷，那個吧檯小妹噙著淚走了進來，跪在地上用抹布把地毯上的血漬給擦去。 \n\n\n\n  她很傷心，也很難過，看見她時，周澤仿佛看見了白鶯鶯。\n\n\n\n  自己受傷流這麼多血的話，白鶯鶯應該也會很難過的吧。\n\n\n\n  一念至此，周澤拿出手機給白鶯鶯打了一個電話，說自己在對面網咖上網，就不回來吃飯了。\n\n\n\n  白鶯鶯喊叫著說等忙完了書店的生意也要來跟周澤一起雙……飛，\n\n\n\n  哦不，是雙排開黑。\n\n\n\n  她以為周澤是跑到網咖玩遊戲去了。\n\n\n\n  放下電話，周澤發現那個小女孩正站在原地，一臉複雜地看著自己。\n\n\n\n  周澤伸手指了指自己的臉：\n\n\n\n  「怪我？」\n\n\n\n  小姑娘沒反應，伸手擦了擦眼淚，嘟著嘴，走出了辦公室，一副她很委屈的樣子。\n\n\n\n  周澤聳聳肩，這年頭，小迷妹最難處理，只能希望渠明明能看管好她，不過周澤也沒多當一回事兒，這種非鬼類存在殺人傷人好像也不歸他管，世界上每天發生的謀殺以及其他惡性事件多了去了。\n\n\n\n  …………\n\n\n\n  小姑娘擦完了血漬，洗了手，走到了二樓。\n\n\n\n  渠明明正蹲在小爐灶旁看著火候，鍋里燉著的藥膳味道濃郁，卻不膩，反而散發出一種類似薄荷一樣的清香。 \n\n\n\n  「哥，你沒必要這樣子的。」\n\n\n\n  小姑娘走到她老闆身邊，有些心疼地抓起老闆的左手。\n\n\n\n  「沒事，妹妹不懂事，闖了禍，當然是由我這個做哥哥的來承擔罪責了，下面那個人也是個明事理的，也沒過多為難我們。」\n\n\n\n  「不過是一個土耗子罷了，下九流的角色，還真把自己當什麼官面上的人物了。」\n\n\n\n  「渠真真，做錯了就是做錯了，沒有他出手，你手上可能就沾染上一條人命血債了，蠱蟲有靈，你真想有一天被自己親自飼養的蠱蟲給反噬麼？」\n\n\n\n  「好啦好啦，真真錯了，真真錯了。」\n\n\n\n  渠真真伸手撫摸著自家哥哥的手臂，把臉埋下去，用自己的舌頭輕輕地舔舐著傷口。\n\n\n\n  「哥，你對我真好。」\n\n\n\n  「廢話，你是我妹妹，我不對你好，對誰好？」\n\n\n\n  「嗯，哥哥最愛我了。」\n\n\n\n  「呵呵。」\n\n\n\n  渠明明伸手摸了摸妹妹的臉。\n\n\n\n  渠明明抬起頭，一臉愛慕地看著自家哥哥，道：\n\n\n\n  「哥哥，妹妹會一直好好地當你的爐頂的。」\n\n\n\n  「乖。」渠明明掀開蓋子看了一下，然後道：「要入藥了，他陽氣虛，陰氣重，可能是長時間待在墓室那種地方的原因。 \n\n\n\n  不過也挺有意思的，\n\n\n\n  一般的盜墓的，下墓頻率也不可能有這麼快，他給我的感覺，就像是天天都睡在墓室里一樣。\n\n\n\n  算了，\n\n\n\n  取九瓢蟲三錢，銀線蟲一錢，暗火蟲一錢，這樣的話能調理好他體內的陽虛之疾。」\n\n\n\n  渠明明說完後，把手放在了自家妹妹的下顎位置。\n\n\n\n  「嗯，好嘞。」\n\n\n\n  女孩點點頭，\n\n\n\n  然後張開嘴，\n\n\n\n  下一刻，\n\n\n\n  有三隻翅膀上帶著花紋的小蟲子從她嘴裡飛出來，\n\n\n\n  有一隻銀色的小蟲從她左耳里慢慢蠕動爬出，\n\n\n\n  有一隻暗色的金顆粒一樣的蟲子從她眼角位置硬生生地擠出來，\n\n\n\n  這些蟲子都很乖地落到了渠明明的手掌中，\n\n\n\n  渠明明手掌一翻，\n\n\n\n  將這些蟲子都丟入鍋中，\n\n\n\n  一時間，\n\n\n\n  藥膳的味道更加清香了。",

    "content": "煮藥膳需要一點時間，辦公室里等著的周澤最先等到的，居然不是明明，而是鶯鶯。\n\n\n\n  「老闆？」\n\n\n\n  白鶯鶯站在辦公室門口喊了一聲。\n\n\n\n  周澤走了出來。\n\n\n\n  「老闆，你在這裡做什呢，不在玩遊戲啊？」\n\n\n\n  白鶯鶯掃了一眼網吧裡面，很多屏幕上都在玩吃雞。\n\n\n\n  「網咖老闆是個廚子，在給我做飯，我等著吃呢。」\n\n\n\n  周澤當然不可能說他在等煎藥吃藥，\n\n\n\n  否則白鶯鶯再追問吃藥治什麼病時該怎麼回答？\n\n\n\n  「啊，那許娘娘得傷心死了，他的汁水你也不吃了，\n\n\n\n  現在連他做的飯你也不吃了。」\n\n\n\n  白鶯鶯一副很替同事心疼的樣子，但目光很快就看向了吧檯。\n\n\n\n  「你去玩兒吧，等我要走時喊你。」\n\n\n\n  「好嘞。」\n\n\n\n  白鶯鶯馬上跑去吧檯那邊充錢，然後很是開心地去了八十元一個小時的頂配VIP廳。\n\n\n\n  周澤站在吧檯邊，隨手拿了一包煙，拆開，抽出一根，點燃。\n\n\n\n  恰巧渠真真從二樓走了下來，看見周澤在拿煙，她也沒說什麼，只是面無表情地走到了吧檯里整理東西。 \n\n\n\n  周澤忽然覺得自己像是一個惡鄰，跑人家家裡連吃帶拿的。\n\n\n\n  吃人嘴軟，拿人手軟，周澤也不想看這個女孩一直冷冰冰的樣子，人家哥哥又是自殘又是做藥膳的，自己也不能總繃著個臉拽得跟二五八萬一樣。\n\n\n\n  「你哥挺帥的，長得跟李一鋒一樣。」\n\n\n\n  網吧聲音有點嘈雜，\n\n\n\n  渠真真聽了周澤的話，有些疑惑地抬起頭看向周澤，問道：\n\n\n\n  「長得跟******一樣？」\n\n\n\n  「…………」周澤。\n\n\n\n  「算是吧，******叔叔也挺帥的。」周澤認下了。\n\n\n\n  「今天，是我的錯，我哥哥已經教訓過我了。」渠真真嘆了口氣，「但那個女人敢罵我哥哥，還打了他，我實在是看不過。」\n\n\n\n  「事實上是這樣子的，你們也不算是很普通的人，但如果想過普通人生活的話，在心態上，還是需要調節一下的。」\n\n\n\n  「那換做你呢？」渠真真看著周澤，「剛剛過去的那個女孩，和你很熟吧？如果現在網吧里有人去罵她打她，你會是什麼反應。」\n\n\n\n  「我會繼續抽我的煙。」周澤很平靜地說道。\n\n\n\n  渠真真皺了皺鼻子，對周澤這個人她真的是沒辦法有什麼好感了，當下也不說話了，坐下來整理自己面前的東西。 \n\n\n\n  周澤吐出一口煙圈，看了一眼坐在那邊VIP玻璃包廂里的白鶯鶯。\n\n\n\n  笑話，\n\n\n\n  誰敢跑去惹她，罵她，打她，\n\n\n\n  她會跟你嚶嚶嚶？\n\n\n\n  直接把你生吞活剝了都有可能。\n\n\n\n  周澤可是見過白鶯鶯本來面目的。\n\n\n\n  倒是這對兄妹，是真的眼瞎，自己是鬼差看不出來，硬說是盜墓的，白鶯鶯是一頭殭屍她也看不出來。\n\n\n\n  香味傳來，\n\n\n\n  周澤回過頭，\n\n\n\n  看見明明同學端著一個砂鍋從樓梯上走了下來。\n\n\n\n  周澤主動上前，問道：「燙不燙手？」\n\n\n\n  「有點。」明明同學回答道。\n\n\n\n  渠明明剛打算說「沒關係他自己能拿得起，不用周澤幫忙」，\n\n\n\n  但誰知道周澤下一句話卻是：\n\n\n\n  「那你小心點，別撒出來了，我等了這麼久呢。」\n\n\n\n  「…………」明明。\n\n\n\n  砂鍋上桌，\n\n\n\n  周圍再擺上了一套古色古香的碗筷。\n\n\n\n  周澤把瓷碗拿在了手中，把玩了一下，欣賞著上面的精緻雕紋，道： \n\n\n\n  「真奢侈，乾隆年間官窯出來的吧？」\n\n\n\n  「行家呀！」\n\n\n\n  不愧是做倒斗營生的。\n\n\n\n  周澤心裡呵呵一笑，\n\n\n\n  他上輩子那個活法，哪有錢有閒工夫玩什麼古董啊；\n\n\n\n  這碗他認識是因為鶯鶯的陪葬品里就有一對，周澤拿去當的時候，這一對瓷碗就有五十多萬了。\n\n\n\n  「當中醫很有錢麼？」周澤好奇地問道。\n\n\n\n  拿這種碗吃飯，一般人還真消受不起，這是托著五十萬吃飯啊。\n\n\n\n  「其實還好，不過現在中醫被炒過頭了，很多傳銷方面喜歡拿中醫打名頭；\n\n\n\n  而且，真正的中醫是需要時間的靜養沉澱的，很難速成，所以社會上活動的，真正有水平的中醫，真的不多。」\n\n\n\n  渠明明親自給周澤盛了一碗，只是湯，沒有菜，更沒有亂七八糟的補品在裡頭，湯澤靚麗，湯水清澈，絲毫不覺得油膩。\n\n\n\n  周澤在事先就已經偷偷喝了一點彼岸花口服液了，這會兒自然是可以慢條斯理地將碗托起，喝了一口。\n\n\n\n  鮮美，\n\n\n\n  很鮮美，\n\n\n\n  而且喝下去之後，\n\n\n\n  仿佛有一股熱流，瞬間湧入自己的腸胃。 \n\n\n\n  又連續喝了幾口，\n\n\n\n  等了一會兒，\n\n\n\n  只覺得好幾股小小的熱流在自己四肢百骸位置不斷地流淌，到最後，一同向下而去，\n\n\n\n  匯聚向了不可說的位置。\n\n\n\n  「呵。」\n\n\n\n  這效果，\n\n\n\n  真牛逼，\n\n\n\n  趕得上偉、、、哥了。\n\n\n\n  渠明明給周澤盛第二碗，擺在了周澤面前，做了一個「請」的手勢。\n\n\n\n  「有點飽了。」\n\n\n\n  周澤一邊說著一邊又端起了碗，\n\n\n\n  喝了一口後問道：\n\n\n\n  「你怎麼不喝？」\n\n\n\n  渠明明聞言，\n\n\n\n  微微一笑，\n\n\n\n  有點自信，\n\n\n\n  一切，\n\n\n\n  盡在不言中。\n\n\n\n  周澤忽然覺得這湯的味道，沒之前那麼美味了。\n\n\n\n  「周先生經常下墓，自然是見聞廣闊，不過我有一件事很好奇，通城這片區域，古墓應該很少才對，周先生為何會選擇在這塊地方落足？」\n\n\n\n  「你喜歡去嫖的話，難道還得把家買在會所對面？」 \n\n\n\n  渠明明點點頭，似乎覺得這句話很有道理。\n\n\n\n  「如果周先生手中有需要出手的東西，可以送到我這裡來，你也看見了，我個人喜歡收藏古董。」\n\n\n\n  「呵呵。」\n\n\n\n  周澤也就乾脆把這個誤會繼續下去了，點點頭，道：\n\n\n\n  「好。」\n\n\n\n  喝好了湯，周澤起身準備告辭，渠明明將周澤送到了網咖門口。\n\n\n\n  白鶯鶯還在那裡玩，周澤看她玩得正盡興，也就沒喊她，反正離家又不遠，就隔著一條街，周澤自己先回了書店。\n\n\n\n  這會兒，\n\n\n\n  老道剛剛掃好馬路，哦不，是為了創建文明城市做好了貢獻收工回來；\n\n\n\n  不過，在老道身邊站著兩個穿著城管制服的青年人。\n\n\n\n  老道夾在二人中間，有些難堪，尤其是見到周澤也正好走回來時，更是有點手足無措。\n\n\n\n  周澤微微皺眉，\n\n\n\n  難不成老道中途開小差又去慰失足去了？\n\n\n\n  但也不對啊，\n\n\n\n  沒見過城管掃黃啊。\n\n\n\n  「是他麼？」一個年輕城管指著周澤問道。\n\n\n\n  「嗯，哎，不是，不是…………」老道開始解釋什麼，但不知道該如何去解釋。 \n\n\n\n  「哦，就是你啊。」\n\n\n\n  一名年輕城管向前走了幾步，走到了周澤面前，指著周澤的鼻子呵斥道：\n\n\n\n  「你就是他兒子？」\n\n\n\n  「…………」周澤。\n\n\n\n  周澤看向老道。\n\n\n\n  老道嚇得一個激靈，暗道完犢子嘍。\n\n\n\n  「你是怎麼當兒子的！\n\n\n\n  大夏天的，叫老人出來掃馬路，萬一老人中暑了怎麼辦，我告訴你，你這是虐待老人！」\n\n\n\n  周澤舔了舔嘴唇，倒也沒急著反駁什麼。\n\n\n\n  「這次是被我們發現了，我不是警察，也不是工商，管不到你，但你要知道一個道理，人在做天在看。\n\n\n\n  不管老人以前和你的關係怎麼樣，但你這個做兒子的自己心裡得有一桿稱，稱一稱自己的良心！」\n\n\n\n  說著，\n\n\n\n  這名年輕城管還伸手在周澤胸膛位置拍了拍，\n\n\n\n  「記住了啊，下次我還來，如果再讓我發現你虐待老人，讓老人再在這種大太陽底下掃馬路的話，有你好看的。\n\n\n\n  我可是城管，\n\n\n\n  城管什麼名號，\n\n\n\n  儂曉得伐？」\n\n \n\n  年輕城管說這話時還故意裝出一臉兇橫的模樣，還把城管的名頭拿出來自污一下以增強威懾力。\n\n\n\n  「呵呵。」\n\n\n\n  周澤笑著點點頭，取出煙，遞給對方一根。\n\n\n\n  「少跟我套近乎！」\n\n\n\n  年輕城管根本不接，「對老人好點，知道不？」\n\n\n\n  說完，他又走到了老道身邊，拍著老道的肩膀道：\n\n\n\n  「老先生，下次你兒子再對你不孝順，你跟我們說，可以去城管局找我們，我們給你主持公道！」\n\n\n\n  老道一張臉簡直比哭還難看，一邊糾結地看了看面前的年輕城管，一邊又偷偷地看了看老闆的反應，只能硬著頭皮千恩萬謝地把這兩個好心城管小伙送走。\n\n\n\n  兩個城管上了旁邊的公務車，其中一個在接電話，倒是沒急著開走。\n\n\n\n  老道戰戰兢兢地走到了周澤旁邊，小心翼翼地解釋道：\n\n\n\n  「老闆，聽我解釋啊，是他們多管閒事主動過來問我的，我就是想找個由頭別讓他們煩我，誰知道隨口一提是兒子讓我…………\n\n\n\n  他們就當真了，\n\n\n\n  還硬要跟著我回來找我兒…………」\n\n\n\n  周澤吐出一口煙圈，\n\n\n\n  看著老道， \n\n\n\n  喊了聲：\n\n\n\n  「爹？」\n\n\n\n  「哎喲，哎喲！！！！！！！」\n\n\n\n  老道嚇得直接對著周澤跪了下來，如果不是在這街上，老道都想直接對著周澤磕頭了。\n\n\n\n  娘類，\n\n\n\n  要遭咧！\n\n\n\n  完犢子嘍！\n\n\n\n  周澤把菸頭丟在了地上，道：「站起來，他們還沒走。」\n\n\n\n  老道只能重新站了起來，但臉色都嚇綠了。\n\n\n\n  「襠里還有符紙吧？」\n\n\n\n  「沒咧，沒咧，祖傳的符紙，精貴少滴很，上次就用光咧，上次就是最後一張咧。」\n\n\n\n  周澤直接忽視了老道這句話，\n\n\n\n  指了指那邊城管的公務車道：\n\n\n\n  「去給他們車後面貼一張符。」\n\n\n\n  說完，\n\n\n\n  周澤直接走入了書店。\n\n\n\n  「車後面貼張符？」\n\n\n\n  老道疑惑地扭過頭看去，沒發現什麼異樣，\n\n\n\n  但想著老闆不可能玩兒自己，\n\n\n\n  當下取出了自己兜里的牛眼淚，抹了一下，\n\n\n\n  老道整個人直接愣住了， \n\n\n\n  先前城管公務車後車位置是空空如也的，\n\n\n\n  但現在，\n\n\n\n  竟然塞滿了慘白的花圈！",

    "content": "回到吧檯後面，周澤自己給自己倒了一杯水，剛喝兩口，老道就回來了。\n\n\n\n  「貼了？」\n\n\n\n  「貼了，老闆。」\n\n\n\n  老道撓撓頭，又問道：「老闆，為啥他們車後面會有這麼多花圈？」\n\n\n\n  而且那不是真的花圈，不塗抹牛眼淚根本就看不見。\n\n\n\n  中國人都清楚，花圈是給死人用的，對活人來說是很不吉利的東西，車後面忽然多出這些玩意兒，肯定是不好的。\n\n\n\n  也因此，雖說那倆年輕城管差點讓自己在老闆這邊吃了掛落，但人家也是好心好意，老道還是把自己褲襠里藏著的符紙貢獻出去了，也心甘情願。\n\n\n\n  「被人在後面吐口水吐多了，也就有了。」\n\n\n\n  周澤笑了笑，沒當回事兒，想叫白鶯鶯給自己泡茶，才記起來鶯鶯還在網咖血戰。\n\n\n\n  「幫我泡壺茶。」\n\n\n\n  「哎，好嘞。」\n\n\n\n  老道手腳也是麻利得很，泡茶時也有模有樣的，他其實懂得很多，也善於學習，之前周澤就看見老道在許清朗不在的時候給客人調雞尾酒。\n\n\n\n  「老闆，什麼叫被人罵多了？」\n\n\n\n  「經常有人看見城管的車後，在車後面吐口痰，再罵一句『早死早超生』。 \n\n\n\n  慢慢地，花圈兒就多了起來了。」\n\n\n\n  「咒的？」\n\n\n\n  「算是吧。」\n\n\n\n  「但那倆小年輕城管人還不錯啊。」\n\n\n\n  「那位跳樓自殺的老師人也不錯。」\n\n\n\n  「額……這個……」\n\n\n\n  「放心吧，那花圈也弄不死人，至多讓人運勢弱一些，你那符紙貼上去後，應該就沒什麼問題了。」\n\n\n\n  「唉，貧道我是心裡替那倆孩子覺得委屈，憑什麼城管的惡名，需要他們來擔？」\n\n\n\n  「因為大部分人喜歡端起碗吃飯放下筷子罵娘；\n\n\n\n  如果自己開車或者走路時道路被小攤小販擋住了要罵；\n\n\n\n  網上看見城管『打』人的視頻，『欺負』小販的報導，也要罵。」\n\n\n\n  「唉，人言可畏，人言可畏啊。\n\n\n\n  老闆，茶泡好了。」\n\n\n\n  老道把茶水送上來，居然還一本正經地重新拿起抹布開始東擦擦西摸摸，哪怕書店裡頭被死侍給打掃得乾乾淨淨，但老道心裡發虛啊，生怕周澤再把之前「兒子」的事兒拿出來發作。\n\n\n\n  周老闆則是在沙發上躺了下來，剛躺下，許清朗就從樓上走了下來。\n\n\n\n  「中午在外面吃的？」 \n\n\n\n  許清朗這話裡頭帶著點興師問罪的意思。\n\n\n\n  「嗯。」\n\n\n\n  「呵呵。」\n\n\n\n  老道識趣兒地走遠了一些。\n\n\n\n  「老周，跟我出去一趟，幫我個忙。」許清朗對周澤道。\n\n\n\n  周澤有些無奈地睜開眼，看著換了一身幹練衣服的許清朗，猶豫了一下，還是點點頭。\n\n\n\n  作為朋友，既然人家開口了，你還真不好意思去當面拒絕，尤其你現在還躺在沙發上，一副什麼事兒都沒有的架勢。\n\n\n\n  想找藉口搪塞一下，都找不到。\n\n\n\n  而且不管怎麼說，老許一直以來也算是幫了周澤很多忙的。\n\n\n\n  許清朗開車，周澤坐在副駕駛位置上。\n\n\n\n  車是往許清朗老家門海縣去的，倒也不遠，通城這邊除非發生交通事故基本不會堵車，估計也就不到一個小時的車程。\n\n\n\n  「事情就是這樣，上次遷墳遇到的問題，現在開始發酵了。」\n\n\n\n  許清朗剛剛把事情的經過和周澤說了一下。\n\n\n\n  這件事周澤是知道的，當初許清朗曾不止一次地離開書店回老家，就是忙遷墳的事情，雖說許清朗的玄術水平在周澤跟小蘿莉眼裡就是一個半桶水，但他的水平比農村的白事兒先生以及所謂的遊方道士，真的高出了太多太多。 \n\n\n\n  所以遷墳的事情也是許清朗親自主持的，他測算了方位和日期，一切都按部就班地弄，但問題還是發生了。\n\n\n\n  首先是祖墳那邊先出了水，按照許清朗的說法就像是地下溫泉噴滲透出來了一樣，那水還冒著白煙，熱乎著呢。\n\n\n\n  之後開挖時，又遇到了不知名的塌陷，沒弄出什麼人命動靜，但也把一桿負責遷墳的村民嚇得夠嗆。\n\n\n\n  到最後實在是沒辦法了，只能搶救性挖掘，弄出了一堆白骨之類的東西，有的棺材時間久了，自己也腐爛了，骨頭都埋在泥土裡頭了，有的以前窮，下葬時連棺材都沒有，直接一卷草蓆上路。\n\n\n\n  除了這些年上面有碑文的墳頭還好，其餘的大部分白骨到底是誰家的祖宗自家都沒辦法分清楚，反正一個村大部分都一個姓，也無所謂了，囫圇吞棗地全都遷移到另一個位置又集體下葬了。\n\n\n\n  至於老墳頭那裡還有沒有剩餘沒被遷走的屍骸，也沒人再去費心思找了，而且找的難度也實在是太大，總不可能直接喊挖掘機過來把這塊地給重新翻一遍吧？\n\n\n\n  但這之後，怪事就開始發生了，村里開始丟東西，而且一些人家養的家畜也開始莫名其妙地暴斃，還有人做夢夢到自家太爺爺太奶奶這類的來哭訴，總之，說這個村子被弄得雞犬不寧有些誇張了，但至少也是草木皆兵。\n\n\n\n  許清朗想過辦法去解決，但都無濟於事，只能請來周澤幫忙。 \n\n\n\n  到許清朗村子裡時，已經是下午三點多了，雖說是村子，但家家戶戶基本都是二層小洋樓，外面不遠處就是大公路，村子裡頭也都是水泥路，不少人家場子上還停著好車。\n\n\n\n  江浙滬這邊的農村跟西南地區的農村差別還是很大的，一是因為當地經濟發展原因，二則是因為地理環境原因，發展起來確實比西南地區多山環境要方便適宜得多。\n\n\n\n  許清朗把車停在田埂旁的水泥路上，他很乾脆，也不說回老家了帶周澤去見個長輩親戚什麼的，直接帶著周澤就上墳頭去了。\n\n\n\n  老祖墳區域已經長滿了雜草，顯得很是寂寥。\n\n\n\n  「遷墳是因為征地，這裡會有高鐵線從這裡走，之前村子裡不是很願意，在獲得一筆賠償款之後，大家才同意了。」\n\n\n\n  許清朗蹲在田埂邊，點了一根煙。\n\n\n\n  周澤圍繞著墳圈走了一遍，然後聳聳肩，道：\n\n\n\n  「沒發現什麼問題，也沒感知到鬼氣之類的，這裡乾淨得像是每晚敷完面膜的你。」\n\n\n\n  「我也試著找過，但也沒在這裡發現什麼，我原本以為是我道行不夠，既然你都發現不了什麼，那問題可能不是出現在這裡。」\n\n\n\n  「之前挖出來的屍骸最後怎麼處置的？」周澤問道。\n\n\n\n  「除了能分清楚的被單獨安葬，其餘的基本都被合葬了。」許清朗說道。 \n\n\n\n  「那可能七婆跟八婆生前就是仇人，死後被不小心合葬在一起吵架了？」\n\n\n\n  周澤半開玩笑地說道。\n\n\n\n  「事情沒那麼簡單，鬼魂會吃家畜？」\n\n\n\n  就在二人一起抽著煙聊分析這件事的時候，遠處忽然傳來了大喊聲：\n\n\n\n  「跳水啦！跳水啦！跳水啦！！！！！！」\n\n\n\n  呼喊的是一個老婆婆，一把年紀了，但嗓門兒依舊洪亮，這一聲聲叫喊，足以將半個村子給驚動。\n\n\n\n  許清朗和周澤馬上跑過去，已經有幾個男子下池塘了，也沒等許清朗和周澤有什麼反應，那幾個人就把一個婦人從水塘里拉了上來。\n\n\n\n  江南農村有喜歡自家修水塘的習慣，可以自己養養魚做點水產什麼的。\n\n\n\n  婦人被拉上來時，臉色泛白，倒是還醒著，手在無意識地抓著什麼，像是還停留在剛溺水時的絕望階段。\n\n\n\n  許清朗馬上過去檢查她的狀況，周圍村民也紛紛跟許清朗打招呼。\n\n\n\n  周澤站在邊上看著，他忽然想到了一個問題，老許不是因為拆遷得了二十幾套房麼，這裡又是他的老家，為什麼這裡沒拆遷？\n\n\n\n  又或者，這裡是他的老家沒錯，但他當初和爹媽一起住時，並不是生活在這個村里？\n\n \n\n  周澤也沒好意思問許清朗這個，人家正在著急著呢，這個時候他也沒興致拿自己二十幾套房出來裝逼。\n\n\n\n  跳水自殺，在哪裡都不算罕見，周澤在水塘邊蹲了下來，水塘的水不是很清澈，上面漂浮著不少綠藻。\n\n\n\n  伸手，撥開面前的綠藻，周澤微微側頭，看向水面下面，還是什麼都沒發現，也什麼都沒看見，池塘雖然髒，但絕不是有「髒東西」的髒。\n\n\n\n  婦人被背回屋裡去了，附近聚攏了不少村民，通城屬於東部沿海地區，所以哪怕是農村裡的青壯年，上班的話也能就近找到工作崗位，沒必要背井離鄉出去打工，農村裡的人氣兒還是很足的。\n\n\n\n  許清朗還在裡頭忙活著，周澤站在人群外面，抽著自己的煙。\n\n\n\n  就在這時，前面走來一個衣著有些邋遢的老頭，一邊走一邊罵，周圍村民臉上都露出了噁心排斥的表情，紛紛讓開。\n\n\n\n  老頭自顧自地罵著自己的東西，\n\n\n\n  先罵振幅，\n\n\n\n  再罵村長，\n\n\n\n  又罵了這些見錢眼開的村民，\n\n\n\n  一副恨其不爭的感覺，\n\n\n\n  一邊走一邊罵，唾沫星子橫飛，罵得有多難聽就有多難聽，\n\n\n\n  數典忘祖，見錢眼開，對不起先人………… \n\n\n\n  周澤在旁邊當熱鬧看著，靠在一棵槐樹上。\n\n\n\n  老頭在周澤眼裡倒是挺可愛的，人活到這個歲數了，也沒啥看不開看得開的了，想罵就罵，想鬧就鬧，想瘋就瘋，反正老子沒幾年好活快蹬腿的人了，幹嘛還受你這人間鳥氣。\n\n\n\n  只是，\n\n\n\n  老頭罵著罵著居然拐向了周澤這邊，當他看見周澤時，下意識地瞪大了眼睛。\n\n\n\n  「爺爺，爺爺…………」\n\n\n\n  一個小女童從遠處跑來，拉住了自家爺爺的手，她生怕爺爺亂跑亂鬧。\n\n\n\n  但老頭還是繼續盯著周澤在看。\n\n\n\n  「這是外面來的叔叔，不是村裡的。」\n\n\n\n  女童對自家爺爺說道，爺爺年紀大了，腦子不大能記事兒了。\n\n\n\n  「什么叔叔！」\n\n\n\n  老頭對著周澤直接一口唾沫吐出來，\n\n\n\n  吐在了周澤的鞋面上，\n\n\n\n  「死鬼！」\n\n\n\n  「對不起，對不起，叔叔，對不起對不起。」\n\n\n\n  女童馬上蹲下身用自己的衣袖給周澤擦鞋面，她生怕這個外來的叔叔打自家爺爺。\n\n\n\n  「回來，給什么小鬼擦鞋面！\n\n\n\n  咱老崔家，丟不起這個人！ \n\n\n\n  人是人，鬼是鬼，活著的時候堂堂正正，\n\n\n\n  死後也就不用給這幫小鬼卑躬屈膝！」\n\n\n\n  老頭呵斥自家孫女，同時把孫女給拉了回來。\n\n\n\n  孫女站在老頭身邊不停地對周澤道歉，喊「對不起對不起」。\n\n\n\n  周澤低下頭，看了看自己剛剛被小女孩擦拭過的鞋面，他是有潔癖的人，老頭的一口濃痰雖然被擦去了，但心裡的膩歪卻難以消除。\n\n\n\n  再見這老頭雖然神神叨叨的，被村民所不喜，但居然是一個藏龍臥虎的傢伙，看似瘋瘋癲癲，但實際上比這個村子裡其他人都看得要更清楚。\n\n\n\n  「你不怕閻王，那你的孫女呢，要不，我帶她先下去？」\n\n\n\n  周澤半開玩笑似地說道。\n\n\n\n  「豎子，爾敢！」\n\n\n\n  老頭大吼一聲，\n\n\n\n  直接撞向了周澤。\n\n\n\n  「噗通！」\n\n\n\n  周澤原本就站在池塘邊，\n\n\n\n  這下子被老頭一撞，\n\n\n\n  居然跟老頭一起摔入了池塘水中。\n\n\n\n  「又有人跳水了，又有人跳水啦！！！」\n\n\n\n  「救人，救人，快救人啊！」 \n\n\n\n  「爺爺，爺爺！」\n\n\n\n  「崔瘋子跳水了！！」\n\n\n\n  岸上傳來村民們的呼喊聲……",

    "content": "周老闆曾不止一次地落水過，\n\n\n\n  尤其是在落在池塘這種水域；\n\n\n\n  在地獄裡，\n\n\n\n  在夢裡，\n\n\n\n  都有過，\n\n\n\n  但這還是第一次在現實里落水，而且還是被一個瘋瘋癲癲的糟老頭一記頂牛頭頂下去的。\n\n\n\n  早知道，\n\n\n\n  就不那麼嘴賤了，\n\n\n\n  自己好端端地跟一個瘋子一般見識做什麼，\n\n\n\n  平白地遭受他這一擊「野蠻撞擊」，\n\n\n\n  而且更讓周澤驚愕的是，這老頭在落水後居然死死地抓住自己的肩膀同時雙腿絆住了自己的小腿，這是打算硬生生和自己一起溺死在水底啊。\n\n\n\n  上面倒是有村民開始準備下水救人，但周澤可不敢把自己的命運的選擇權交給這些村民，而是直接長出了指甲，對著老頭的後背戳過去。\n\n\n\n  剛剛還夾得起勁的老頭，\n\n\n\n  瞬間一個哆嗦，\n\n\n\n  直接軟塌塌了下去。\n\n\n\n  周澤扛著這個老頭浮出了水面，周老闆的水性其實也就一般，但這裡又不是什麼大江大河，只是一個小池塘，托一個沒多少分量的老頭上來還是沒多大問題的。\n\n\n\n  上岸之後，許清朗直接衝到了周澤面前吼道： \n\n\n\n  「你怎麼了？發生什麼事兒了？」\n\n\n\n  「是崔瘋子發瘋把人小哥給撞下水塘的，這崔瘋子，整天瘋瘋癲癲罵罵咧咧的，現在還開始準備殺人了。」\n\n\n\n  「打電話報警吧，他無兒無女的，無所謂，但如果下次換了誰家其他人被他給推下去怎麼辦？」\n\n\n\n  「對，報警，最好讓精神病院把他給收了，他越來越不像話了。」\n\n\n\n  小女孩跪伏在爺爺身邊，看著昏迷不醒的爺爺不停地抹著眼淚，喊著爺爺快點醒來。\n\n\n\n  「把他送回去，他身上有線索。」\n\n\n\n  周澤對許清朗說道。\n\n\n\n  許清朗點點頭，不疑有他，直接走過去把老頭扛起來。\n\n\n\n  「我送他先回去，報警的事情先不急，先把眼前的事情處理好，大家不要慌張。」\n\n\n\n  說完，許清朗就扛著崔老頭走出了人群。\n\n\n\n  周澤和小女孩跟在後面。\n\n\n\n  小女童一路上還是在哭泣著，周澤倒是覺得心裡有點過意不去了，開玩笑的是他，而且是這種玩笑，他被人家爺爺撞著一起下水也是活該。\n\n\n\n  「你家在哪裡？」周澤問小女孩。\n\n\n\n  「他家就在前面路口的泥房子裡，這老頭無兒無女的，平時又喜歡酗酒，腦子有點問題，所以日子過得不是很好。」 \n\n\n\n  許清朗對村子這邊的情況還是很熟悉的。\n\n\n\n  很快，眾人來到了那個泥房子的位置。\n\n\n\n  在四周都是二層甚至是三層四層的小洋房之間，還有一個上世紀很久遠的泥房矗立在這裡，確實有些扎眼。\n\n\n\n  門沒關，或許這屋子也沒什麼值得小偷惦記的東西。\n\n\n\n  泥房子有三個房間，中間是客廳，一半擺滿了這陣子老頭剛收來的易拉罐酒瓶子這類的廢品，另一半則是供奉著神像，供桌那頭倒是打掃得乾乾淨淨的。\n\n\n\n  左邊是臥室，老式的木床，右邊是廚房，用的還是土灶。\n\n\n\n  許清朗把崔老頭先在床上安置了下來，然後看了看周澤，道：「現在把他弄醒？」\n\n\n\n  言語之中，有一種不信任的感覺。\n\n\n\n  倒不是不信任周澤，許清朗是不信任這個在他很小的時候就瘋瘋癲癲的老頭這裡能有什麼線索。\n\n\n\n  這又不是什麼書店書架上放著的那些小說，\n\n\n\n  荒山野嶺撿個戒指裡面還能住著個老爺爺，\n\n\n\n  少林寺最牛逼的是那個藏經閣的掃地僧。\n\n\n\n  「他有陰陽眼。」\n\n\n\n  周澤說道。\n\n\n\n  能一眼看出自己是鬼， \n\n\n\n  除了陰陽眼，沒有其他的解釋。\n\n\n\n  而且在老頭身上，周澤沒感應到其他的氣息波動，如果老頭是玄學人士，他也就沒必要直接用頭把自己頂下水塘玩兒同歸於盡的把戲了。\n\n\n\n  「陰陽眼？」\n\n\n\n  許清朗有些意外地看了眼躺在床上還沒醒的老頭。\n\n\n\n  「真沒想到啊。」\n\n\n\n  「他能一眼看出我的身份。」\n\n\n\n  周澤走到了門檻邊，坐了下來。\n\n\n\n  「我出去買點東西，當晚餐。」許清朗說著走出了屋子。\n\n\n\n  周澤對旁邊顯得有些怯生生的小女童揮揮手，示意她走過來。\n\n\n\n  小女孩有些怕生，叫了幾次她才走過來，同時歉然道：\n\n\n\n  「叔叔，我爺爺不是故意的，他真的不是故意的。」\n\n\n\n  「嗯嗯，我知道，是叔叔的不對，玩笑開過頭了。\n\n\n\n  對了，你知道村子最近發生的事情麼？」\n\n\n\n  小女童點點頭。\n\n\n\n  「那你爺爺有沒有說是什麼原因？」\n\n\n\n  「爺爺說，爺爺說…………」\n\n\n\n  小女孩有些難以啟齒，掐著自己的手指，似乎是在猶豫著該說不該說。 \n\n\n\n  「放心吧，和叔叔說，叔叔不會告訴別人的。」\n\n\n\n  「爺爺說，是村子裡的人們貪圖賠償款，為了那點錢，連祖墳都不要了，祖宗泉下有知，都得氣得跳腳。\n\n\n\n  爺爺還說，\n\n\n\n  本來我們村的祖墳位置是極好的，這次本不應該拆遷到我們這裡，是村長和上面什麼人勾結，硬生生地把這條線遷向了這邊。\n\n\n\n  前些年西村被拆遷了，西村的人都賠了好多房子和錢，大家都住進城裡去了，村民們眼饞得不行，也都想著拆遷。」\n\n\n\n  周澤聞言，點點頭。\n\n\n\n  祖宗有意見，或許是有的吧，但搞破壞的，應該不是那些「魂歸來兮」的祖宗。\n\n\n\n  「你爺爺還說了些什麼？」\n\n\n\n  「他叫我晚上不要亂跑，說最近不安生，有髒東西在村子裡亂竄呢，我問爺爺是什麼，是不是狐狸還是野狗，爺爺也不告訴我。」\n\n\n\n  髒東西，\n\n\n\n  亂竄？\n\n\n\n  晚上才出來？\n\n\n\n  周澤點了一根煙，心裡慢慢地琢磨著。\n\n\n\n  之前姑娘說的西村的事兒，應該就是老許之前所在的村子，東村西村應該是一個姓，大家的祖墳應該也劃拉在一起，以老許如今的身家，他應該是不屑於貪圖這點補償款的，之所以承擔這件事，也是看在這裡頭也有自個兒先人躺在裡頭的原因。 \n\n\n\n  如果不是鬼魂作祟的話，\n\n\n\n  會不會是成了精的東西再搞怪？\n\n\n\n  如果是精怪的話，那一切也就說得通了，但精怪處理起來，其實比鬼魂更麻煩一點。\n\n\n\n  這時候，屋子裡傳來了咳嗽聲，那個老頭醒了。\n\n\n\n  周澤走到臥室門口，看著已經坐起來的老頭。\n\n\n\n  老頭又看了一眼站在周澤身邊的小女童，當即罵道：「你這挨千刀的小鬼，你敢對我孫女動手，我就……\n\n\n\n  我就…………我就…………」\n\n\n\n  想了半天，崔老頭都沒能想到有什麼可以進一步威脅的方式。\n\n\n\n  「我來這裡是受人之託解決問題的，沒功夫跟你瞎鬧，你再胡攪蠻纏，我就找關係把這女孩送福利院去，反正看你這個樣子和條件也不像是能帶好孩子的樣子。」\n\n\n\n  「你…………你敢…………」\n\n\n\n  老頭的氣焰當即衰弱了一些。\n\n\n\n  小女童很會聰明伶俐，給周澤抽來一張木質小板凳讓周澤坐下，周澤道了一聲謝謝，吐出一口煙圈，伸手指了指老頭道：\n\n\n\n  「說吧，到底是個什麼情況，你是有陰陽眼吧，應該能看見那幫村民所看不見的東西。」\n\n\n\n  崔老頭囁嚅了幾下嘴唇，試探性地問道：「你真是來幫忙的？」 \n\n\n\n  「我騙你，有好處麼？」\n\n\n\n  「好，我跟你說，這是造孽，這是後人造的孽！這幫數典忘祖的東西，這幫…………」\n\n\n\n  「直入正題，在村里搞事情的，是先人的亡魂麼？」\n\n\n\n  「不……不是。」崔老頭搖搖頭。\n\n\n\n  「那你罵他們做什麼？」\n\n\n\n  「我只是氣不過，多好的祖墳啊，多好的風水方位啊，我的爹媽我的爺爺奶奶，也都葬在那裡，結果被他們一挖，大家的屍骸都滾落到一起去了。\n\n\n\n  你中有我，我中有你，\n\n\n\n  到底誰是誰家的，都沒人能分得明白！\n\n\n\n  你說這不是造孽是什麼？」\n\n\n\n  周澤點點頭，「繼續說，到底是什麼東西。」\n\n\n\n  「你看見我家門檻了麼？」\n\n\n\n  「看見了，很高。」\n\n\n\n  「具體點。」\n\n\n\n  周澤站起身，走到了客廳門檻邊上，這門檻有些年頭了，跟這個老泥房一樣，但在外側有兩道最近才剛剛摩擦出來的痕跡。\n\n\n\n  「那晚，他來了，撞開了我家門，想要進來。\n\n\n\n  但門檻太高，\n\n\n\n  他跳不起來。」 \n\n\n\n  周澤抬起頭，看向依舊坐在床上的崔老頭，沉聲道：\n\n\n\n  「僵屍？」\n\n\n\n  「咳咳咳…………」崔老頭咳嗽起來，「除了殭屍，還會是什麼？」\n\n\n\n  「那你為什麼什麼都不說？」\n\n\n\n  「那天，他是穿著衣服的……」崔老頭面露猙獰道：「穿的是，當地人的衣服，我怎麼知道，他到底偽裝成了哪個人？天黑著，我看不清楚他的長相，也不敢跑到外頭去看。」\n\n\n\n  「我回來了。」\n\n\n\n  許清朗提著一些熟菜回來了，還買了幾份盒飯。\n\n\n\n  「你醒啦。」許清朗看了一眼崔老頭。\n\n\n\n  「呵呵。」崔老頭笑笑，沒再說什麼，他是認識許清朗的，畢竟也是在這塊地界兒長大的孩子，不用別人攙扶，崔老頭自己慢騰騰走到了客廳。\n\n\n\n  許清朗把菜放到了小桌上，又拿來幾張板凳。\n\n\n\n  盒飯擺上去，熟菜也在塑膠袋上攤開，\n\n\n\n  周澤在旁邊坐了下來，看了一眼小飯桌，有些奇怪地問道：\n\n\n\n  「你怎麼就買了三份盒飯？」\n\n\n\n  「什麼叫就買三份？\n\n\n\n  就我們三個人，所以買三份啊，\n\n\n\n  難道你今天胃口更好了？\n\n\n\n  那我把我的飯勻一部分給你。」",

    "content": "三個人？\n\n\n\n  周澤猛地看向自己身後一直怯生生站在那裡的小女童。\n\n\n\n  小女童被周澤的目光給嚇到了，下意識地後退幾步，目光求助性地看向自己的爺爺。\n\n\n\n  村民們和許清朗都說過，\n\n\n\n  崔老頭無兒無女，\n\n\n\n  是個瘋子，\n\n\n\n  那麼他又怎麼可能有一個孫女？\n\n\n\n  還有就是小女童一直以來只和自己說話交流，無論是之前在池塘那邊還是在屋子裡頭，她都沒有再和別人有過任何的交流。\n\n\n\n  之前周澤並沒有注意到這一點，現在著重回憶了一下，才真正的琢磨出味道。\n\n\n\n  「喂，怎麼了？」\n\n\n\n  許清朗往嘴裡扒了一口飯問道。\n\n\n\n  周澤看向了崔老頭，他需要一個解釋。\n\n\n\n  崔老頭悶著頭，拿起筷子，開始吃飯，似乎根本就沒打算理睬周澤，同時還埋怨許清朗怎麼沒給自己打點酒回來。\n\n\n\n  「給我一個解釋。」周澤說道。\n\n\n\n  「嗯？」許清朗有些疑惑地看著周澤。\n\n\n\n  「這豬頭肉肯定缺斤兩了，豬頭四那傢伙肯定是不認識你了，不然也不應該宰你啊。」崔老頭嘆息道：「這世道，踏踏實實做人好像怎麼都發不了財了。」 \n\n\n\n  崔老頭還是完全拿周澤當空氣了。\n\n\n\n  許清朗慢慢地放下了筷子，他能察覺到氛圍有點不對，更重要的是，他了解自己這個朋友，別看他平時喜歡一個人躺在沙發上曬曬太陽，但骨子裡，是一個控制欲很強的人。\n\n\n\n  這可能跟他上輩子做醫院主任有關係吧，喜歡把一切掌握在手中，書店裡，自己算是無欲無求的一類，接下來再看看都是些什麼人？\n\n\n\n  老道？\n\n\n\n  鶯鶯？\n\n\n\n  死侍？\n\n\n\n  放在古代，就是家丁、女僕、護衛。\n\n\n\n  許清朗自我感覺良好沒把自己歸於「廚娘」一類。\n\n\n\n  崔老頭一邊吃一邊砸吧著嘴，吃得滿嘴流油，\n\n\n\n  而後，\n\n\n\n  一隻手出現在了他的腦後，\n\n\n\n  「啪！」\n\n\n\n  「唔唔唔唔唔唔…………」\n\n\n\n  崔老頭整張臉被壓在了熟菜堆里，任憑這老頭如何掙扎和反抗都無濟於事。\n\n\n\n  「以為有一雙陰陽眼，\n\n\n\n  以為自己年紀大，\n\n\n\n  就可以把任何人都不當一回事兒了？」\n\n\n\n  「砰！」 \n\n\n\n  周澤一腳踢斷了小桌子的一根腿，崔老頭整個人直接趴在了地上，老頭還在喊叫著什麼，但只剩下了口啃泥。\n\n\n\n  小女童哭喊著衝過來想要推開周澤，把自己爺爺解救出來，但周澤左手直接長出了指甲，一縷縷黑霧將小女童纏繞住，小女童只能被困在原地，無法動彈。\n\n\n\n  但似乎也是因為黑霧的原因，讓許清朗也終於看見了小女童的身影。\n\n\n\n  「這…………這…………這裡怎麼還有一個孩子！」\n\n\n\n  周澤退後一步，崔老頭馬上從地上爬了起來，伸手抹去了臉上的油污和飯菜，直接「嗷嗷叫」地衝上來要跟周澤拼命。\n\n\n\n  這一次，周老闆有防範了。\n\n\n\n  手臂直接揮舞過去，一記肘擊，重重地砸在了崔老頭的胸口位置，崔老頭到底年紀大了，哪怕周老闆再鹹魚，至少也是年輕氣盛的階段，崔老頭再度被掀翻在地。\n\n\n\n  小女童被困鎖在原地，著急地不停哭泣。\n\n\n\n  「你不跟我說，我就自己扒開來看看。\n\n\n\n  到底是什麼東西，能讓我也分不出她居然不是人！」\n\n\n\n  周澤上前一步，指甲慢慢地長出來。\n\n\n\n  女童的存在，讓周澤都沒覺得有絲毫的異樣，這就是最大的異常，因為許清朗以及村民們是看不見她的。 \n\n\n\n  她是虛幻的，\n\n\n\n  但她又是那麼的真實！\n\n\n\n  指甲慢慢地靠近女童的皮膚，\n\n\n\n  如果你願意一層一層一層的剝開我的心，你會發現你會訝異…………\n\n\n\n  周澤現在真的是打算剝開女童看看她的構成到底是什麼。\n\n\n\n  「別碰她，我說，我說，她是我從祖墳那邊撿回來的屍胎。」\n\n\n\n  崔老頭似乎是放棄了一切掙扎，打算開誠布公。\n\n\n\n  這個老頭，帶著一種這個年齡層次的人普遍所存在的倔強，從村民對他的態度上也可以看出來，他在為人處事方面有著一種巨大的缺陷。\n\n\n\n  他只是蠢，是真的蠢，居然在一個鬼差面前擺他的臭架子。\n\n\n\n  「屍胎，是什麼東西？」許清朗問道，他沒問崔老頭，而是問的周澤。\n\n\n\n  「你看我做什麼？」周澤反問道。\n\n\n\n  「你不知道？」\n\n\n\n  「我怎麼知道。」\n\n\n\n  崔老頭嘆了口氣，道：「屍胎，是屍氣所化之形體，並不是屍體懷孕生了孩子，是屍體在被埋葬時，已然有了身孕。\n\n\n\n  但她死了，腹內的胎兒也就一起死了，變成了死胎。\n\n\n\n  不過，如果風水合適或者其他一些機緣巧合因素促使之下，腹中的死嬰，可以在肉身已經死亡的狀態下，以靈魂的方式脫離肉身重新孕育出來。 \n\n\n\n  小釵就是這樣子的一個存在，三年前我在墳地上經過，看見她跪在那裡哭。\n\n\n\n  我見她面生，就問她是哪個村的人，她說她媽媽在地下，她是自己貪玩從地下跑出來的，現在不知道該怎麼回去。\n\n\n\n  然後我就把她帶回來養著了。」\n\n\n\n  許清朗聽完崔老頭的敘述後，馬上問道：\n\n\n\n  「你養著她？」\n\n\n\n  「她只需要每天喝一點點血，雞血鴨血都可以，人血也可以，只要一小碗就夠了，好養得很，人也乖，也很貼心，更知道照顧心疼我，她就是我的親孫兒，不，比親孫女兒還親！」\n\n\n\n  崔老頭看著小女童說道。\n\n\n\n  「我之前沒問，那就是為什麼那頭殭屍要晚上來敲你家門，是因為她麼？」\n\n\n\n  周澤指了指小女童。\n\n\n\n  「她是我的，她是我的！」\n\n\n\n  崔老頭馬上把小女童抱在懷中，\n\n\n\n  「她就是我孫女兒，是我親孫女兒！誰都不准把她從我身邊奪走，我死也不會讓人把她從我身邊帶走！」\n\n\n\n  「那個殭屍已經在村子裡搞小破壞了，如果他只是為了找回自己的女兒，而你一直阻攔著讓他找不到，很可能會逼他發狂。\n\n\n\n  只是偷點雞鴨，泄露的煞氣讓人做點噩夢，這只是小事。 \n\n\n\n  你知道如果一頭殭屍真的把自己的耐心耗光後，會是怎樣的後果麼？你是天生陰陽眼，這些東西，應該懂得比常人多！」\n\n\n\n  周澤看著崔老頭問道。\n\n\n\n  「他們死，就讓他們去死好了，一幫數典忘祖的東西！\n\n\n\n  為了一點拆遷款，連祖墳都不要了，這幫人，死不足惜！\n\n\n\n  該死，\n\n\n\n  該死！\n\n\n\n  哪怕他們死光，也別想讓我把小釵送出去，我不可能讓小釵離開我！」\n\n\n\n  「爺爺，小釵也不要離開爺爺，小釵要一直跟著爺爺你。」\n\n\n\n  小女童和崔老頭抱在一起痛哭著。\n\n\n\n  「是因為這個原因麼？」許清朗湊到周澤身邊小聲問道。\n\n\n\n  如果這一切的起因是因為有天生陰陽眼人生又極為失敗的崔老頭想要這個孫女兒，那麼，把這個女童交出去，似乎才是最恰當的處理方式。\n\n\n\n  村子可以避免一場災禍，而且這女童本就是屍胎化形，也算不得是活人。\n\n\n\n  「時間對不上。」周澤搖搖頭，「殭屍的目標應該是這個女童，但可能並不是所謂的父女或者母女關係，你沒聽這老頭說麼，他在三年前就領養了這個女童了。\n\n\n\n  她的父母如果真的還在，也如果真的變成殭屍的話，一來，她很難自個兒跑出來，二來跑出來這麼久她的父母不可能耽擱了三年後才來找她。」 \n\n\n\n  「那你怎麼看的？」\n\n\n\n  「祖墳拆遷，甚至可能是這個工程，導致哪個地方的土層出現了變化，然後讓一頭殭屍出來了。\n\n\n\n  這種大工程導致的怪事兒真的很多，上海延安路高架龍柱，就是其中之一。\n\n\n\n  然後，這頭殭屍憑著本能，聞到了這個女童的味道，想要吃她進補。」\n\n\n\n  「那你怎麼對她沒感覺？」許清朗問道。\n\n\n\n  「遠古人過茹毛飲血的生活，古代人有一口米糠吃就謝天謝地，現在的人不光是要吃得飽，更追求吃得好。」\n\n\n\n  「裝個逼得瑟自己血統高還要這麼拐彎抹角。」許清朗不屑道。\n\n\n\n  周澤沒再反駁什麼，\n\n\n\n  因為他知道，\n\n\n\n  真實原因是因為自己現在沒進入殭屍狀態，\n\n\n\n  如果讓自己體內的那個意識甦醒，估計他要做的第一件事，就是把這個女童往嘴裡塞吧，他似乎很喜歡吃這種特殊的亡魂來滋補自己。\n\n\n\n  「這屍胎怎麼辦？可以送她投胎麼？」\n\n\n\n  「可以的，她也是亡魂形成，不過是靈魂上沾染了屍氣產生了一些變化，但本質上還是亡魂，處理一下，還是能夠送入地獄投胎的。\n\n\n\n  而且，送她下去的績點，應該很高。」 \n\n\n\n  「那就再等等？先幫我把那頭殭屍處理一下？」\n\n\n\n  周澤沒說話。\n\n\n\n  「喂，幫個忙，你知道的，我們第一次見鶯鶯時，多恐怖，我一個人搞不定啊。」\n\n\n\n  周澤還是沒說話。\n\n\n\n  「這裡好歹是我家鄉，我不想看到生靈塗炭的事兒。」\n\n\n\n  周澤看向許清朗，然後又低下頭，看著鞋尖，\n\n\n\n  鞋尖在地上蹭了蹭，道：\n\n\n\n  「唉，上輩子好不容易存了錢買了一套房，這輩子居然連一套房子都沒有，真失敗啊。」\n\n\n\n  「…………」許清朗。\n\n\n\n  「不帶這樣子的兄弟，你這是趁火打劫啊。」許清朗半天憋出這句話。\n\n\n\n  「那你還能給出一個更好的理由說服我出手麼？」周澤反問道。\n\n\n\n  「我靠，說到底，這不都是你家親戚麼！\n\n\n\n  你家親戚要搞事情，\n\n\n\n  你能坐視不理？」\n\n\n\n  「…………」周澤。",

    "content": "入夜了，小泥房的門半遮掩著。\n\n\n\n  女童被周澤故意安排讓她坐在門檻上，至於崔老頭，則是讓許清朗用繩子捆綁了起來，堵住了嘴，讓他坐在客廳的小板凳上。\n\n\n\n  正如崔老頭自己所說的那樣，他寧願全村人都被殭屍殺光，他也不願意自己的「孫女兒」離開他。\n\n\n\n  這是人之常情，\n\n\n\n  做出這種選擇，說出這種話，也無可指摘，很正常。\n\n\n\n  也因此，\n\n\n\n  許清朗為了保護自己出生的這個村子，讓小女童當作誘餌站在屋外，也很正常，也無可指摘。\n\n\n\n  周澤打算等到事情結束之後，把女童送入地獄讓她轉世輪迴，也沒錯，畢竟生老病死自然規律，小女孩已經死了，那麼去地獄獲得再次投胎的機會才是正途，留在陽間遲早會出問題。\n\n\n\n  你崔老頭不在乎全村人的死活，周澤跟許清朗又何必在乎他的意見？\n\n\n\n  最重要的是，\n\n\n\n  這老頭脾氣臭得實在是讓人討厭，反正周老闆是沒一點點衝動想要幫他做點什麼，大家公事公辦就好，也沒必要講什麼人情往來，忒費勁。\n\n\n\n  周澤跟許清朗都站在門後面，靠著門框。\n\n\n\n  「會來麼？」\n\n\n\n  「就看這老傢伙有沒有再隱瞞什麼了。」周澤掃了一眼被捆成「粽子」的崔老頭。 \n\n\n\n  「他還有什麼隱瞞？」\n\n\n\n  「一個自出生開始就有陰陽眼的人，活到了現在，他這輩子，可能這麼風平浪靜麼？」\n\n\n\n  「也是。」\n\n\n\n  等到了深夜時，許清朗有些疲憊了，直接坐在了地上靠著牆根，周澤還好，一根煙接著一根煙抽著，他是不需要咖啡什麼東西來抵擋睡意的，反正沒有冰櫃或者白鶯鶯他又睡不著。\n\n\n\n  不過，這樣等也挺無聊的。\n\n\n\n  崔老頭折騰累了，此時居然先睡著了，而女童則是繼續很乖巧地坐在門檻上，不停地東張西望，還不時地回過頭看看自己的爺爺。\n\n\n\n  能狠下心來拿一個女童當誘餌，周澤自己心裡都有些負罪感，但捨不得孩子套不住狼，而且女童是一個屍胎，也沒必要真把她當一個純粹的小孩來看待。\n\n\n\n  「咔嚓…………咔嚓…………」\n\n\n\n  遠處的菜地里，出現了聲響。\n\n\n\n  周澤馬上直起了身子，原本有點打瞌睡的許清朗也馬上站起來。\n\n\n\n  女童雙手抱著自己的肩膀，她感知到了寒冷，同時，也感知到了畏懼。\n\n\n\n  「咔嚓…………咔嚓…………」\n\n\n\n  聲音越來越近了。\n\n\n\n  周澤透過門的縫隙向外看著，只是現在只能聽到聲音，還沒看見那個蹦蹦跳跳的身影。 \n\n\n\n  又等了大概十分鐘，那個聲音還在附近逡巡著，把它自己隱藏在了黑幕之中，但遲遲沒有露面。\n\n\n\n  「殭屍也有智商的啊？」\n\n\n\n  許清朗驚嘆道。\n\n\n\n  「…………」周澤。\n\n\n\n  不過這個時候也不是吵架的時候，那個殭屍可能真的是察覺到有什麼問題，所以暫時不敢靠近。\n\n\n\n  女童回過頭，她的恐懼情緒越來越重，她下意識地想喊爺爺，但是站在其身後的周澤對她做了一個「噓」的手勢，女童強忍住了，但眼圈憋得通紅。\n\n\n\n  周澤這個時候伸出手掌，上面長出了指甲，一層層黑霧開始環繞，周澤蹲下來，將指甲刺入了地面。\n\n\n\n  黑霧開始瀰漫出去，指向了一個方向！\n\n\n\n  「在那裡！」\n\n\n\n  下一刻，\n\n\n\n  周澤直接衝出了門檻。\n\n\n\n  既然那東西遲遲不過來，那自己就主動出擊吧，對付一頭殭屍而已，周老闆還真沒覺得需要害怕什麼。\n\n\n\n  當初和白鶯鶯人生若只是初見時，\n\n\n\n  白鶯鶯的氣場跟武則天臨朝一樣，到最後還不是被自己插到哭？\n\n\n\n  前面，是一片菜地，有簡單地籬笆擋著，當周澤衝過去時，一道人影也主動地「跳」過來。 \n\n\n\n  的確是跳，對方穿著一件黑色的T恤，短褲，跳出來時，將周圍的籬笆全部撞斷。\n\n\n\n  「砰！」\n\n\n\n  周澤的身體和對方撞擊到了一起，自對方身上傳來了類似鋼板一樣的硬度，而且對方的沖勢不減，帶著一種可怕的決絕。\n\n\n\n  而周澤的指甲也順勢刺入對方的胸膛位置，\n\n\n\n  在指甲面前，\n\n\n\n  再堅硬的胸膛也得化作繞指柔。\n\n\n\n  「吧唧！」\n\n\n\n  像是手指插入了開了瓢兒的西瓜里的感覺，膩膩的，酥酥的，還帶著一種濃稠的感覺。\n\n\n\n  對方身體一顫，而後直接扭曲起來，蜷縮在了地上，像是一條被撒上鹽巴的水蛭。\n\n\n\n  「怎麼樣了？」\n\n\n\n  許清朗也跑了過來。\n\n\n\n  「解決了。」\n\n\n\n  周澤在這個男子身邊蹲了下來，男子已經漸漸停止了抽搐，身上也開始有黑色的霧氣升騰起來。\n\n\n\n  拿出手機，照了一下男子的臉，周澤發現這男子他白天還見過，是下水救那個落水婦人的村民之一。\n\n\n\n  怎麼會是他？\n\n\n\n  此時，男子已經沒了氣息，身體也開始發軟，黑色的膿血開始從他的眼耳口鼻位置溢出。 \n\n\n\n  被周澤的指甲直接刺入，等於是攪亂了他的根基，就是當初的白鶯鶯被周澤指甲擦到都難以忍受，何況這貨明顯和白鶯鶯不能比。\n\n\n\n  「這人我認識。」許清朗也拿出手機照了一下，「是徐家嬸子的三兒子，叫…………」\n\n\n\n  「我也認識。」\n\n\n\n  周澤打斷了許清朗的話，轉而將男子的脖子給翻轉了過來。\n\n\n\n  在對方脖子的左邊位置，有兩道清晰的齒痕。\n\n\n\n  周澤的手指在齒痕上摩挲著，而後目光猛地一凝：\n\n\n\n  「不對，這是剛剛被殭屍咬被控制成行屍的替身！」\n\n\n\n  下一刻，\n\n\n\n  周澤馬上起身沖回了小泥房，原本坐在門檻上的女童已然消失不見。\n\n\n\n  等到周澤衝進屋子裡時，之前被許清朗捆成粽子的崔老頭人也不見了，原地只剩下了一圈繩子和一個板凳。\n\n\n\n  中計了，\n\n\n\n  居然中計了。\n\n\n\n  許清朗跑回來時看見屋子裡空蕩蕩的一幕也是緊皺眉頭。\n\n\n\n  「這怎麼可能…………」\n\n\n\n  許清朗有些難以置信。\n\n\n\n  這殭屍不是周澤，也不是有著白夫人兩百年滋養的白鶯鶯， \n\n\n\n  但居然會玩「調虎離山」？\n\n\n\n  「這老頭也被殭屍吃了？」許清朗自言自語道。\n\n\n\n  「不對。」\n\n\n\n  周澤蹲了下來，將散落在地上的繩子撿起。\n\n\n\n  「繩子斷裂位置是經過反覆切割弄出來的，不是殭屍的指甲抓斷的，老頭是自己掙脫的。」\n\n\n\n  說著，周澤站起身，他先看了看外面的方向，\n\n\n\n  「我們剛剛就在前面的菜地里，老頭如果從屋子裡跑出來，我們不可能不知道，而且老頭明知道外面有一頭殭屍在對他虎視眈眈時，應該也不至於蠢到衝出來企圖逃跑，至少在屋子裡，我們還能保證他跟他孫女的安全。」\n\n\n\n  許清朗聞言，先走到了廚房那邊看了一下，接著又走到了臥室那邊，然後指著床鋪位置喊道：\n\n\n\n  「這下面，有地道！」\n\n\n\n  周澤起身，走了過去，果然，床鋪被掀開著，下面居然真的有地道。\n\n\n\n  一個孤寡老頭，只有一個鬼孫女陪伴，在村子裡人緣又非常之差，他挖地道做什麼？\n\n\n\n  難道是崔老頭年輕時看《地道戰》入了迷，沒事做時給自己家也弄了一個？\n\n\n\n  「你先去處理那具屍體，弄到屋子裡來藏好，我跟著地道去追，注意安全。」 \n\n\n\n  周澤對許清朗吩咐道。\n\n\n\n  許清朗點點頭，那具行屍剛剛被周澤殺了，但屍體就這樣露在外面等天亮有村民經過時難免會引起大的波亂，確實需要一個人先去處理一下。\n\n\n\n  等許清朗走後，周澤一個人跳入了地道之中，地道不寬敞，大部分區域都得彎著腰甚至帶著點爬行的方式才能通過。\n\n\n\n  而且，地道真的不短。\n\n\n\n  周澤在心裡都開始佩服起那位老光棍晚上折騰的能力了，人家是耕田播種，他就在這裡打洞。\n\n\n\n  大概四分鐘後，地道開始向上，周澤也發現了有人剛剛從這裡經過的摩擦痕跡，上面的門板也是開著的，周澤很輕鬆地走了出來。\n\n\n\n  進來後，\n\n\n\n  周澤意外地發現這裡居然也是一個老瓦房，很是陳舊了，而且應該沒什麼人會經常過來的樣子。\n\n\n\n  農村里這種房子很多的，以前一般都是給老人住，等老人過世之後，年輕一代都早就住進蓋起來的樓房裡了，這種老房子要麼當廚房要麼就當堆放雜物的地方了。\n\n\n\n  果不其然，周澤拐了個彎走入廳堂位置時，看見了一個靈台，上面有兩盞燈燭，沒點燃，也掛著蜘蛛網，燈燭中間有一個香灰爐，後面則是有一個老太太的黑白照片。\n\n\n\n  老太太露著白牙，笑得很開心。 \n\n\n\n  崔老頭的地道是通到這裡的，難不成這老太生前是崔老頭的姘頭？\n\n\n\n  可能老太早就喪偶了，但有子女，所以不方便跟崔老頭在一起，在農村這種給喪偶的爹媽找另一半還是很困難的一件事，關鍵還是子女覺得自己面子上抹不開。\n\n\n\n  但崔老頭這種挖地道私會的精神，還真的是讓人感動。\n\n\n\n  但物是人非，\n\n\n\n  老太先走一步了，\n\n\n\n  估計這地道崔老頭也很久沒用過了，這一次，純粹是當逃命轉移的手段了。\n\n\n\n  「呵呵。」\n\n\n\n  周澤搖搖頭，從廳堂穿過去，他現在要去儘快找到崔老頭，因為他清楚，那頭有靈智的殭屍，也在找他們爺孫倆。\n\n\n\n  而且，\n\n\n\n  那頭殭屍一開始只是偷雞摸狗，\n\n\n\n  現在已經開始殺人了！\n\n\n\n  周澤沒看見的是，\n\n\n\n  當他從廳堂穿過去之後，\n\n\n\n  布滿蜘蛛網的靈台上，\n\n\n\n  那張黑白照片裡原本就在笑的老太，\n\n\n\n  笑容，\n\n\n\n  更盛了。",

    "content": "孤零零的小泥房子裡，\n\n\n\n  許清朗陷入了深深地沉思，\n\n\n\n  在他面前，\n\n\n\n  擺放著那具自己剛剛從外面菜地里拖回來的屍體。\n\n\n\n  這屍體他認識，是村子裡徐嬸兒家的仨兒子，今年不到三十歲，未婚，平時在船廠上班，在村子裡名聲很好，因為他樂於助人。\n\n\n\n  東家西家的，誰家有事兒支應他一聲，他一準兒過來幫忙，比如這家要修個房子，那家來不及收麥子等等，所付酬勞，無非是一頓飯一頓酒而已。\n\n\n\n  這是屬於老一輩才有的那種鄰里互幫的風氣，在年輕一代身上已經很罕見了，但他一直保存著，不少同齡人覺得他憨傻。\n\n\n\n  當然了，他的人緣再好，也跟許清朗沒多大的關係，他雖說是在村子裡出生，但很早就不在村子裡了。\n\n\n\n  現在也不是悲傷緬懷開哀悼會的時候，\n\n\n\n  他得想辦法把這具屍體先給處理掉。\n\n\n\n  許清朗記得以前看《鹿鼎記》時，韋小寶有那種化骨水，直接往人身上澆上幾滴，人馬上就會被腐蝕得乾乾淨淨，現實里有沒有這玩意兒許清朗不清楚，但他清楚自己現在沒時間去找這玩意兒。\n\n\n\n  又或者，\n\n\n\n  分屍？\n\n\n\n  把屍體一點點分解下來，還能炒個菜啥的？ \n\n\n\n  好像有點變態啊。\n\n\n\n  但心裡怎麼忽然有種躍躍欲試的衝動呢？\n\n\n\n  肯定是被周澤那個變態給傳染了。\n\n\n\n  搖搖頭，許清朗決定還是先用最笨的辦法，\n\n\n\n  挖個坑，\n\n\n\n  把這屍體先給埋了。\n\n\n\n  等回頭再燒點冥鈔，這件事應該也就能過去了，畢竟人雖然是周澤殺的，但實際上這傢伙被殺時就已經是行屍了，他早就死了，周澤殺他，相當於是給他送一個解脫。\n\n\n\n  許清朗從屋子裡招來鐵鍬，走到屋門前的菜地位置，開始挖坑。\n\n\n\n  其實，泥房子裡也沒有鋪什麼瓷磚或者打什麼水泥，也是泥地，但多少年不停地給人走來走去，那泥地早就被踩得嚴嚴實實的了，根本就挖不動。\n\n\n\n  挖著挖著，許清朗雙手拄著鐵鍬，忍不住地喘著氣，對於平時不怎麼下地最近也開始進入保養狀態的他來說，再幹這種活兒，還真有些吃不消。\n\n\n\n  「嗚嗚嗚………………」\n\n\n\n  遠處，像是傳來了淡淡的嗚咽生，有點像是有人在哭，但仔細聽起來，又不像是在哭，那調子有點抑揚頓挫宛轉悠揚。\n\n\n\n  農村的晚上還是很安靜的，尤其是都到這個點了，哪裡來的這種響動？ \n\n\n\n  許清朗伸手下意識地摸了摸口袋裡的護心鏡，老實說，周老闆現在不在身邊，許清朗心裡還真有點惴惴不安，總覺得不踏實。\n\n\n\n  嗚咽的聲音由遠及近，許清朗猛地舉起了鐵鍬，雖然只聽見聲音沒有看見任何的東西，但那種危機感確實如此地強烈，直刺激得他腎上腺素開始瘋狂地分泌。\n\n\n\n  「呼呼…………呼呼…………」\n\n\n\n  深呼吸，\n\n\n\n  不停地深呼吸，\n\n\n\n  許清朗一隻手拿著鐵鍬，一隻手捏著護心鏡。\n\n\n\n  難不成是老周沒追到殭屍，結果那頭殭屍又來了一個回馬槍？\n\n\n\n  氛圍，\n\n\n\n  變得十分緊張，\n\n\n\n  許清朗額頭上的冷汗都開始滴淌下來。\n\n\n\n  僵持，\n\n\n\n  對峙，\n\n\n\n  一直持續著。\n\n\n\n  大概過了二十分鐘後，\n\n\n\n  黑夜裡，有幾隻調皮的烏鴉不睡覺從頭上飛過，\n\n\n\n  發出「呱…………呱…………呱…………」的聲音。\n\n\n\n  一陣風吹來，\n\n\n\n  幾片落葉打著旋兒自身前吹拂而去。\n\n \n\n  許清朗與空氣，\n\n\n\n  對峙了二十分鐘。\n\n\n\n  那嗚咽聲開始慢慢地變低，最後到了微不可察的地步。\n\n\n\n  經過了這麼長時間的聆聽，許清朗至少確定了一件事，那就是肯定不是有人在哭，反而更像是有人大晚上地不睡覺在那裡悠哉悠哉地吹簫。\n\n\n\n  誰特麼閒得！\n\n\n\n  又警惕的等了好一會兒，一直到那聲音徹底消失不見之後，許清朗才長舒一口氣，警報解除。\n\n\n\n  又繼續挖了一會兒，原本想挖得更深一點的，但許清朗疲憊感已經襲來了，也就挖了一個很將就的深度，反正之後的事情還是得靠冥鈔來規避麻煩，現在把屍體埋起來只是不想在近期被村民發現而已。\n\n\n\n  走進屋子裡，那具屍體還很安靜地躺在那兒，胸口位置有一處清晰地凹陷，在凹陷的周圍則是五個小洞。\n\n\n\n  殭屍肯定是很硬的，\n\n\n\n  事實上死人如果屍體保存得好一些的話，屍體形成屍僵之後確實會比活著的時候「硬朗」許多，而殭屍更是由鬱結怨念所化，身體更是堅固。\n\n\n\n  但再堅固的身體，還是被周澤的指甲直接給洞穿了。\n\n\n\n  許清朗喝了一口水，拿出手機，準備給周澤發個信息，問問他現在在哪裡，到底有沒有找到崔老頭。 \n\n\n\n  終日打雁，終被雁啄吧。\n\n\n\n  許清朗本人和周澤都沒料到，那個脾氣臭到爆的崔老頭居然也會玩一出「暗度陳倉」，先裝睡且偷偷摸摸地不知道拿什麼把繩子給割斷了，然後趁著那頭行屍出現自己跟周澤衝出屋子對付時帶著孫女兒果斷地走地道逃脫。\n\n\n\n  老頭為什麼要逃，也很簡單，因為自己二人拿他寶貝孫女兒當誘餌，同時周澤還打算等事情結束之後把他孫女兒送去投胎。\n\n\n\n  只能說，周澤之前說得對，一個天生陰陽眼，活到這麼大一個歲數，真沒點什麼藏著掖著的本事，別人也難以信服啊。\n\n\n\n  「怎麼沒信號了？」\n\n\n\n  許清朗敲了敲手機。\n\n\n\n  也就在此時，原本躺在那裡早就死透透的屍體居然慢慢地坐了起來。\n\n\n\n  悄無聲息，\n\n\n\n  根本就沒有發出絲毫的動靜。\n\n\n\n  許清朗繼續鼓搗著手機，他想儘快聯繫到周澤，完全忽略了身後的情況。\n\n\n\n  倒不是說許清朗有多粗心大意，事實上哪怕是周澤本人在這裡都不認為那具已經被自己用指甲刺死的行屍還能再翻騰出什麼浪花來。\n\n\n\n  但偏偏地，\n\n\n\n  他起來了。\n\n\n\n  而且他慢慢地張開嘴， \n\n\n\n  露出了兩顆陰森獠牙。\n\n\n\n  「嗯？」許清朗吸了吸鼻子，怎麼忽然傳來了一股子醃蒜的味道。\n\n\n\n  到底是以前當過廚師，對味道的天然敏感讓許清朗在此時下意識地向後看了一眼，\n\n\n\n  而後，\n\n\n\n  四目相視！\n\n\n\n  屍體猛地向前一撲，獠牙直接刺入了許清朗的脖頸位置。\n\n\n\n  許清朗瘋狂地將推打面前的這貨，但這傢伙卻像是一條毛毛蟲一樣，死死地貼在了許清朗身上。\n\n\n\n  強忍著脖子位置的劇痛，\n\n\n\n  許清朗取出了自己口袋裡護心鏡，\n\n\n\n  低喝道：\n\n\n\n  「天地無極，玄心正法！」\n\n\n\n  護心鏡鏡面上蕩漾起一層淡藍色的波紋，\n\n\n\n  下一刻，\n\n\n\n  許清朗直接將護心鏡砸向了面前這東西的身上。\n\n\n\n  這東西身體不停地顫抖著，像是很痛苦，但還是死死地咬住許清朗不放，且雙手雙腳開始攀爬了上來，像是一條八爪魚一樣，想要霸王硬上弓！\n\n\n\n  「噗通」一聲，\n\n\n\n  許清朗還真被對方給壓倒在了地上，\n\n\n\n  對方的身體不停地顫抖和蠕動著， \n\n\n\n  將許清朗按在地上盡情地摩擦！\n\n\n\n  噁心，\n\n\n\n  反胃，\n\n\n\n  難受，\n\n\n\n  痛苦，\n\n\n\n  疼…………\n\n\n\n  許清朗清楚，除非周澤能夠像港片裡的警察一樣在最後關頭趕到，否則自己今天很可能就交代在這裡了。\n\n\n\n  但這東西，\n\n\n\n  明明是涼透了，\n\n\n\n  怎麼又能動起來的？\n\n\n\n  對了，\n\n\n\n  是簫聲！\n\n\n\n  肯定和那個簘聲有關！\n\n\n\n  但這個時候再去想什麼簘聲已經來不及了，也沒有絲毫的意義。\n\n\n\n  第一次，\n\n\n\n  許清朗覺得這個自己出生的村子，是那麼的令他陌生和惶恐，仿佛有一層簾幕一直遮掩在上面，他其實一直都沒有真正走進去過一樣。\n\n\n\n  雙手拼命地掙扎著，\n\n\n\n  許清朗觸碰到了一個凹陷的位置，\n\n\n\n  那是之前周澤指甲洞穿的位置。\n\n\n\n  「天地無極，玄心正法！」\n\n\n\n  許清朗最後一次念動咒語， \n\n\n\n  一咬牙，\n\n\n\n  直接將自己的護心鏡從那個傷口位置塞入了行屍的胸膛之中。\n\n\n\n  「嘶嘶嘶嘶嘶嘶嘶………………」\n\n\n\n  行屍的眼耳口鼻開始不斷地有黑霧冒出，他整個人從許清朗身上跳起來，而後又倒在地上瘋狂地打滾，像是一條蟲子被噴灑了殺毒劑一樣，在做著最後的掙扎。\n\n\n\n  護心鏡在行屍體內不斷地發出藍光，不停地灼燒著對方。\n\n\n\n  到最後，\n\n\n\n  行屍再次躺在了地上一動不動了，而且，他的屍體慢慢地開始腐爛，化作了一灘膿水。\n\n\n\n  很快，\n\n\n\n  當水漬被泥地給吸收，\n\n\n\n  地上只留下了一道清晰的人印。\n\n\n\n  許清朗之前心心念念的韋小寶的化骨水，這次倒是真的夢想成真了。\n\n\n\n  彎下腰，許清朗用衣袖裹著自己的手掀開了人印中間的那個黑乎乎的東西，這是他的護心鏡，但現在已經徹底成黑炭了。\n\n\n\n  他許清朗家底薄，玄術是個半桶水，這小法器已經算是他少數幾個能拿出手的東西了，這下也徹底廢掉了。\n\n\n\n  然而，\n\n\n\n  這不是最棘手的。\n\n\n\n  許清朗撿起手機，來到了廳堂的破鏡子前， \n\n\n\n  打開手機的後置手電筒，對著自己的脖子位置，\n\n\n\n  鏡子裡，\n\n\n\n  自己左側脖子位置上，\n\n\n\n  有極為清晰的一對牙印，\n\n\n\n  附近的皮肉也被撕扯得皮開肉綻，但是卻沒有鮮血流出來，反而不斷有黑色的小顆粒在裡頭不停地翻滾著，看起來極為噁心。\n\n\n\n  許清朗用顫抖地手輕輕撫摸著自己的傷口，\n\n\n\n  一股不祥的預感，\n\n\n\n  慢慢襲來…………",

    "content": "江浙農村不少地方的房屋格局就是一側是老平房，一側是二層以上的樓房，老一輩基本住在平房裡，下一代和更年輕一代則是住在樓房中。\n\n\n\n  等到老人去世後，平房要麼被當作儲物間被保留，要麼就直接推掉再蓋一個新的平房當廚房之類的來使用。\n\n\n\n  周澤在走出這個平房後，所看見的是一棟三層小洋樓，門口有一個很大的場院，再外面還有一個自家修葺的魚塘。\n\n\n\n  四周則是被農田包裹著，雖說這在農村很普遍，但換一個角度來說，這算是貨真價實的鄉間小別墅。\n\n\n\n  崔老頭從他家的泥房子地道里出來，應該就是來到了這裡，但現在問題來了，崔老頭離開這個平房之後到底又去了哪兒？\n\n\n\n  夜晚黑幕之下，如果崔老頭帶著他的閨女兒隨便往田地哪個疙瘩一躲的話，周澤還真的很難找到他。\n\n\n\n  樓房裡的人還沒睡，已經是深夜了，裡面還傳來喝酒歡笑的聲音。\n\n\n\n  周澤走到樓房前的場子上，點了一根煙，今兒個晚上的事情讓他覺得有些心煩，可能對於現在的周老闆來說，坐在書屋裡等願者上鉤才是最愜意的一件事。\n\n\n\n  這就像是打賓館門縫下塞的小紙條，你打電話過去來的人肯定沒照片上漂亮，但至少可以保證即插即用。\n\n\n\n  如果你親自去外面一個地方一個地方的找，你沒會員卡不是老顧客可能人家也懶得鳥你，跟你說我們這裡是絕對正規的服務，純潔得像是一朵精緻的白蓮花。 \n\n\n\n  但也就在周澤抽菸的時候，\n\n\n\n  他的鼻子忽然動了一下，\n\n\n\n  倒不是周老闆的鼻子進化成了狗鼻子，而是因為前世的身份讓他對某一種味道極為敏感，\n\n\n\n  那就是消毒水的味道！\n\n\n\n  此時此刻，在這棟屋子裡，居然傳來了消毒水的味道，這讓周澤不禁轉過身，面向這棟樓，丟下手中的煙，用鞋底踩了踩，周澤走到側房門口的位置，用指甲打開了門鎖，推開門，走了進去。\n\n\n\n  一樓里應該是廚房和客廳，周澤所在的這個側室裡頭還有一個很大的苞穀場。\n\n\n\n  也就只有農村才能這般奢侈地對住房面積這般使用。\n\n\n\n  走到客廳拐角處，有樓梯，可以上二樓。\n\n\n\n  歡笑聲則是在二樓傳來，周澤慢慢地走了上去，那種消毒水的味道也開始越來越濃郁了。\n\n\n\n  「老三怎麼還沒來，不是說好今晚一起喝酒看球的麼？」\n\n\n\n  「誰知道他呢，指不定哪家寡婦又請他去家裡修廁所了吧，哈哈哈哈。」\n\n\n\n  「老三這個人啊，就是太熱心，別讓讓他幹啥他都去做，真傻。」\n\n\n\n  「少見多怪，我告訴你啊，老三骨子裡可精明著呢，指不定摸了多少小媳婦兒的房門了。」 \n\n\n\n  客廳里，有三個男人坐在那裡一邊看著電視一邊喝著酒，小桌上擺放著豬頭肉花生米一類的吃食，氛圍很是熱烈。\n\n\n\n  「喲，進了！哈哈哈哈，真的進了！」\n\n\n\n  「媽的！」\n\n\n\n  「我叫你別買沙特贏你偏要買，沙特那支球隊是亞洲魚腩隊，俄羅斯是歐洲魚腩隊，雖然都是魚腩，但差距還是很大的，你讓國足去和沙特踢，沙特也就六四開。」\n\n\n\n  「上次亞洲杯上國足還贏的沙特吧。」\n\n\n\n  「對，上次亞洲杯上先是王大雷撲出點球，之後於海任意球變線進了，一比零贏的好像。」\n\n\n\n  「我這不是看賠率高想搏個冷門麼？」\n\n\n\n  「哥，順子，你們兩個小聲點，嫂子跟孩子還在裡頭睡覺吧。」\n\n\n\n  「沒事兒，大老爺們兒晚上看個球，娘們兒敢說什麼？不打緊，不打緊。」\n\n\n\n  三個男人赤膊著上身，一邊看著球賽一邊吹著牛皮，周澤從樓梯走上來，沒進客廳，而是轉身走向了另一側的房間那邊。\n\n\n\n  因為周澤嗅到了更奇怪的味道，\n\n\n\n  同樣的，是那種讓周澤上輩子職業覺得很敏感的味道，\n\n\n\n  鮮血的味道。\n\n\n\n  周澤推開臥室的門，呵呵，說真的，還真有一種鄉土小H文里描寫的那種大半夜跑鄰居家裡偷香竊玉的意思。 \n\n\n\n  只不過周老闆這會兒心裡可沒有半點這種想法，因為那種血液的腥味開始越來越濃郁。\n\n\n\n  屋子裡關著燈，裡面陳設很簡單，一張大床，櫥櫃之類的東西，面積很是寬敞。\n\n\n\n  周澤剛踏出腳走進去，就停住了。\n\n\n\n  腳底下，好像踩到了什麼，有點黏。\n\n\n\n  伸手在門旁邊的牆壁上摸索了一會兒，周澤找到了燈的開關裝置。\n\n\n\n  「啪！」\n\n\n\n  一聲脆響，\n\n\n\n  周澤打開了燈。\n\n\n\n  一灘血漬，從床上一路滴淌下來，慢慢地鋪陳開去，而周澤的鞋底，正好踩在了慢慢流淌過來的血液上。\n\n\n\n  床上應該是一對母子，死的時候身體扭曲，死狀極為慘烈，像是被野獸啃食過一樣，而且是那種帶著濃郁報復性色彩的啃食。\n\n\n\n  周澤走了過去，檢查了一下，他不是警察，也干不來刑偵這方面的事情，他只是想先確認一下，到底是哪種東西下的手，\n\n\n\n  是人，\n\n\n\n  還是？\n\n\n\n  觀察好了傷口，周澤發現床上的母子是被咬死的，而且是以一種極為迅速地方式咬死的。\n\n\n\n  最可笑的是，\n\n\n\n  女人的丈夫和這個小孩的父親， \n\n\n\n  此時還正在客廳里跟著自己的兩個朋友喝著酒看著球賽，對臥室里發生的慘劇絲毫不知情。\n\n\n\n  「我去上個廁所，媽的，這沙特害老子輸錢了。」\n\n\n\n  一個男的直接去了二樓的衛生間。\n\n\n\n  「哥，你買的是四比零吧？」\n\n\n\n  「對，四比零。」\n\n\n\n  「還差一個球了。」\n\n\n\n  「放心吧，可以的，沙特已經被打崩了，沒信心了。」\n\n\n\n  比賽快到尾聲時，俄羅斯又進了一球，比分四比零了。\n\n\n\n  「椰絲！椰絲！」\n\n\n\n  男主人雙手握拳大吼著。\n\n\n\n  旁邊的這位看這位中了，心裡有些不是滋味，他也買球了，但已經黑了，當下只能無奈道：\n\n\n\n  「順子怎麼去廁所還沒回來，我去看看他，別想不開在廁所自殺了。」\n\n\n\n  客廳里，只剩下了男主人一個人，他一個人美滋滋地喝著酒吃著花生米，開心得一比。\n\n\n\n  比賽已經到傷停補時了，局面基本就這樣固定下來了，他可以等著收米。\n\n\n\n  世界盃揭幕戰他就贏錢了，足以證明他這陣子的手氣很紅。\n\n\n\n  而這邊，周澤繼續查看著臥室里的情況，現在可以確定一點是，這應該是殭屍所為，但這頭殭屍的習性，讓他有點陌生。 \n\n\n\n  和白鶯鶯和自己完全不同，這頭殭屍有著一種極強的主觀性，包括用行屍來吸引自己和許清朗出來，從另一個角度來說，確實是幫著崔老頭「瞞天過海」了。\n\n\n\n  而後，這屋子裡的女主人和孩子慘死在殭屍獠牙之下，似乎也是在預示著什麼。\n\n\n\n  許清朗的老家，怎麼破事兒這麼多。\n\n\n\n  周澤有些不耐煩地搖搖頭。\n\n\n\n  給床上的死者蓋上了被子，關了燈，周澤將自己隱藏在了黑暗之中，他能感覺到，那個東西，應該和自己一樣，也隱藏在房子的某個角落裡。\n\n\n\n  只殺兩個人，應該不過癮吧？\n\n\n\n  這屋子裡，還有三個男人，血氣最為旺盛，上吧，我等著你。\n\n\n\n  拿人當誘餌的事情，周澤也不是第一次做了，之前拿小女童做，結果出了意外，但這並不會影響周澤再來一次的選擇。\n\n\n\n  如果自己冒然出手，提醒這裡的人，讓那個隱藏在黑暗中的傢伙逃跑了，天知道它又會逃去哪裡，自己可沒那麼多的功夫陪它玩躲貓貓的遊戲。\n\n\n\n  時間，\n\n\n\n  慢慢地流逝。\n\n\n\n  忽然間，周澤聽到了遠處衛生間的動靜，一切只是在剎那間，但周澤感應到了，他馬上繞過了客廳位置，從側面沖向了衛生間所在的方向。 \n\n\n\n  衛生間的門是打開著的，裡面是蹲坑的格局，沒有馬桶。\n\n\n\n  當周澤過來時，恰巧看見一道黑影從前面竄出去，周澤經過衛生間門口時，看見兩具男屍交叉地躺在蹲坑位置，肚子已經破了個大洞，腸子什麼的也都被拉扯了出來。\n\n\n\n  速度好快，\n\n\n\n  是真的快，\n\n\n\n  這種速度，\n\n\n\n  讓周澤都有些不可思議，自己之前所解決的行屍和這頭本尊比起來，根本就不是一個量級。\n\n\n\n  周澤是釣魚的人，但魚兒卻以極快地速度吞掉了餌料不等自己收杆兒就跑了。\n\n\n\n  …………\n\n\n\n  男主人並不知曉自家已經進了陌生人，\n\n\n\n  而且進來的，\n\n\n\n  是兩頭殭屍。\n\n\n\n  他還在喝著酒，愜意地等著比賽結束，只剩下最後一分鐘了，美滴很，美滴很。\n\n\n\n  但也就在此時，\n\n\n\n  俄羅斯球員戈洛溫一腳任意球越過人牆直掛死角，沙特門將鞭長莫及，比分被改寫成了「五比零」！\n\n\n\n  「艹！」\n\n\n\n  男主人氣憤之下直接將面前的花生米盤子掃在了地上，\n\n\n\n  到手的獎金飛了， \n\n\n\n  而且是在裁判都快吹哨的最後一刻，\n\n\n\n  他心裡真的好不鬱悶。\n\n\n\n  「媽的，你們兩個，死廁所里啊！」\n\n\n\n  男主人見自己兩個朋友還沒從廁所回來忍不住罵道。\n\n\n\n  他雙腳翹在了茶几上，點了一根煙，真的是不爽，非常非常的不爽。\n\n\n\n  煙還沒點燃呢，\n\n\n\n  忽然間，\n\n\n\n  男主人聽到了茶几下面好像有什麼東西的聲響，\n\n\n\n  像是有老鼠在吃東西。\n\n\n\n  「艹，什麼玩意兒！」\n\n\n\n  男子收下了腳，\n\n\n\n  低下頭向下面看去，\n\n\n\n  是有東西在進食，\n\n\n\n  當男子把頭探下去時，\n\n\n\n  他看見一個身材佝僂一身壽衣的女人正埋頭吃著自己剛剛推下桌子的花生米和豬頭肉。\n\n\n\n  女人愣了一下，\n\n\n\n  扭過頭，\n\n\n\n  看了過來，\n\n\n\n  這是一張很恐怖的臉，\n\n\n\n  頭髮花白，\n\n\n\n  嘴唇上下全是鮮血，那一雙眼眸里，更是泛著暗紅色的光澤，但她卻自帶一種嘴角弧度，就像是黑白照片裡的她一樣。 \n\n\n\n  她在笑，\n\n\n\n  她很喜歡笑，\n\n\n\n  每一張照片她都在笑，\n\n\n\n  所以她死後，她兒子選擇她遺照去放大時，發現都是在笑的照片，最後只能硬著頭皮選了一張。\n\n\n\n  男主人見到這一幕，\n\n\n\n  嚇得一個哆嗦，\n\n\n\n  嘴巴張開，\n\n\n\n  半天只吐出來一個字：\n\n\n\n  「媽…………」",

\n\n\n\n  對於她的兒子，她似乎顯得更加地瘋狂，也是更加地迫不及待，就像是一場盛宴，先一道道品嘗前面的菜，到最後壓軸菜上來後，才是整場宴會真正的高……潮！\n\n\n\n  「啊啊啊啊啊啊！！！！」\n\n\n\n  一道黑霧忽然升騰而起，掃中了老太婆，老太婆發出了一聲類似貓被踩到尾巴的厲嘯，身形倒退出去。\n\n\n\n  更為誇張的是，\n\n\n\n  她居然真的攀爬在了牆壁上，側著頭查看情況，而且從身法上來說，很是穩定。\n\n\n\n  周澤走到了客廳里，看著牆壁上的老太婆，面露凝重之色，這老太婆的速度，比他預想中的，還要快上很多。\n\n\n\n  「救我…………救救我…………」\n\n\n\n  男主人倒在地上，伸手向周澤求救。\n\n\n\n  「她是你媽？」\n\n\n\n  周澤問道。\n\n\n\n  「是我媽。」男主人點頭道。\n\n\n\n  「哦。」\n\n\n\n  周澤再次看向那個牆壁上的老太婆。\n\n\n\n  那就是血親復仇麼？\n\n\n\n  一般來說，如果埋藏在地下的先祖屍變出來之後，它最容易感應到的，應該就是和自己有直系血緣關係的人，這對於剛成為殭屍的它們來說，就像是黑夜裡的明燈，會指引著他們前去，將其殺死。 \n\n\n\n  其實，這也可以理解成新生命對舊有關係的一種斬斷。\n\n\n\n  「我媽死了啊，死了好幾年了啊。」男主人對著周澤哭喊道，他的世界觀已經崩塌了。\n\n\n\n  對於一個普通人來說，看見自己死去多年的母親忽然出現在自己面前，還要搞死自己，這種精神衝擊，足以讓人崩潰。\n\n\n\n  周澤沒理會這個在旁邊自言自語的兒子，\n\n\n\n  而是伸手指了指那個在牆壁上張望著這裡的老太婆。\n\n\n\n  「你想殺他麼？」\n\n\n\n  周澤指了指男主人，\n\n\n\n  「那就下來殺啊。」\n\n\n\n  老太婆還是謹慎不向前，她的眸子不時地在周澤手指甲那裡逡巡，顯然，她很忌憚這個東西。\n\n\n\n  「呵呵。」\n\n\n\n  周澤有些苦惱，\n\n\n\n  他是真沒見過這麼敏捷的殭屍，哪怕是白鶯鶯，她的特點也僅僅是體現在力量強大方面，但你讓白鶯鶯飛檐走壁，也不現實。\n\n\n\n  只是眼前的這個老太婆就做到了，她顯得更加地靈活，如果不是她身上的屍氣是如此的濃郁，周澤都要開始懷疑這他娘的到底是殭屍還是猴子大仙上身了。\n\n\n\n  很難受，\n\n\n\n  人家在牆壁上， \n\n\n\n  周老闆又不會輕功，上不去啊；\n\n\n\n  同時，周澤也明白了為什麼自己之前和這老太婆沒能碰到，這老太婆估計先前一直在房子外部牆壁上來回移動，伺機進來殺人，她根本就不需要跟自己一樣從門那邊走進來。\n\n\n\n  「喂，你殺不殺？」\n\n\n\n  周澤把地上的男主人提了起來，\n\n\n\n  晃了晃，\n\n\n\n  「來殺啊，給你殺，真的，不騙你，乖，你下來。」\n\n\n\n  「…………」男主人。\n\n\n\n  老太婆還是不下來，她忌憚周澤，怕周澤，這種畏懼情緒，甚至壓制了她想要殺自己兒子的衝動。\n\n\n\n  「喂，你再叫幾聲媽媽，喊你媽媽過來。」\n\n\n\n  周澤對男主人說道。\n\n\n\n  男主人哭喪著臉，\n\n\n\n  他總覺得事情有點不對啊。\n\n\n\n  「你是誰…………」男主人問周澤。\n\n\n\n  「我叫你喊媽媽，你問這麼多幹嘛。」\n\n\n\n  說著，周澤一巴掌抽在了男主人的臉上，然後又看向牆壁上的老太婆，\n\n\n\n  「喂，你再不下來我就給你兒子撕票啦。」\n\n\n\n  老太婆微微扭了扭頭，繼續作壁上觀。 \n\n\n\n  周澤搖搖頭，將男主人又丟在了地上，也就在此時，老太婆忽然動了，她原本是在牆壁側面的，這下子直接壁虎漫步，\n\n\n\n  從天花板上移動過來，而後垂直落下！\n\n\n\n  速度奇快，\n\n\n\n  果然媽媽最是放不下兒子啊。\n\n\n\n  周澤身形一頓，而後雙手張開向上，十根指甲瞬間長長，化作了類似鐮刀一般的長度，直接懟了上去！\n\n\n\n  老太婆來勢如風，當她看見周澤那可怖的指甲後，整個人直接愣住了，但她的去勢已經無法被阻攔，也無法滯緩。\n\n\n\n  「嘩啦啦…………」\n\n\n\n  指甲撕開了她的身體，刺入了她的體內，那麼的乾脆，那麼的順滑，沒有絲毫的阻滯，論起打殭屍，周澤比植物更加的專業。\n\n\n\n  吃過牙籤肉麼？\n\n\n\n  周澤現在覺得自己就像是「串串香」後台串肉的夥計，\n\n\n\n  那個老太婆的胸膛位置，被自己十根指甲完全刺入，同時，當老太婆滑下來時，還沒死透的她居然張開嘴企圖咬周澤。\n\n\n\n  周澤馬上一個側步，雙臂向下一揮，老太婆被周澤狠狠地甩了出去，砸翻了電視，落在了地上。\n\n\n\n  她想要爬起來，但卻顯得很艱難，但她的眼眸卻一直死死地盯著自己的兒子。 \n\n\n\n  周澤掃了一眼自己指甲上流下的黃黃綠綠液體，只覺得無比噁心，現在他只想著早點解決掉這個老太婆然後去修修自己的指甲。\n\n\n\n  然而，當周澤再度走向老太婆時，樓梯口位置衝上來一個人。\n\n\n\n  居然是崔老頭！\n\n\n\n  崔老頭看見了周澤，然後舉起了手臂，他的手上，拿著的是一把斧頭。\n\n\n\n  「呼…………」\n\n\n\n  崔老頭毫不猶豫地將斧頭投擲向了周澤，周澤指甲一揮，將斧頭給格擋開，但在下一刻，崔老頭又把背上背著的一個東西拿了起來，竟然是一把弩！\n\n\n\n  一把遊樂園裡經常可以看見打氣球獲獎品的弩。\n\n\n\n  「嗡！」\n\n\n\n  一聲脆響，\n\n\n\n  剛剛掃開斧頭的周老闆還沒來得及反應過來，只覺得自己胸口一沉，整個人後退了兩步後，不得不跪在了地上。\n\n\n\n  「啊啊啊啊！！！」\n\n\n\n  老太婆掙扎著雙手在地上攀爬著，她沒敢再沖向客廳，而是朝著崔老頭所在的位置衝過去了，不過她並沒有攻擊崔老頭，而是用自己的手臂夾著瘦小的崔老頭直接跳下了陽台。\n\n\n\n  周澤只聽見一陣「噗通」的聲響，那兩個傢伙應該落地了。\n\n\n\n  強忍著胸口的疼痛，周澤站了起來，追向了陽台，崔老頭那種窮逼，當然玩不起高端的東西，否則崔老頭出現時拿的就不是弩箭而是RPG了！ \n\n\n\n  而且，\n\n\n\n  這弩箭也不是真正的行貨，估計真可能是崔老頭從遊樂場裡偷來的，射出的箭矢只有箭頭刺入了周澤的身上，並沒有造成太大的傷害。\n\n\n\n  然而，\n\n\n\n  當周澤來到陽台位置準備也跳下去繼續追時，\n\n\n\n  他的身形忽然一個踉蹌，\n\n\n\n  整個人竟然跪伏在了地上，\n\n\n\n  視線開始旋轉，\n\n\n\n  腦子開始陷入了混沌，\n\n\n\n  艹，\n\n\n\n  這老頭，\n\n\n\n  在箭頭上抹了藥。\n\n\n\n  周澤的眼睛一陣泛紅，\n\n\n\n  他下意識地想要進入那種狀態再度追上去，\n\n\n\n  事實上，\n\n\n\n  周澤清楚，\n\n\n\n  一旦進入那個狀態，那個崔老頭跟老太婆肯定跑不掉，但是周澤不敢，也不願意。\n\n\n\n  以前不知道副作用，隨便開大瞎幾把爽。\n\n\n\n  現在周澤可不敢再這樣繼續刺激那個東西不斷甦醒了。\n\n\n\n  哪怕這棟屋子裡已經死了好幾個人，\n\n\n\n  但周澤也沒有犧牲自己給他們報仇的想法， \n\n\n\n  或許，\n\n\n\n  還是因為自私吧？\n\n\n\n  周澤靠著陽台欄杆坐了下來，意識開始陷入混沌。\n\n\n\n  …………\n\n\n\n  「她……怎麼會…………怎麼會…………」\n\n\n\n  在周老闆靠在陽台上昏昏沉沉時，\n\n\n\n  那個男主人終於踉踉蹌蹌地爬起來了，\n\n\n\n  他先本能地去了臥室，他要喊自己的妻子和兒子一起跑，家裡來怪物了，\n\n\n\n  他媽居然復活了！\n\n\n\n  只是，當他推開臥室門時，\n\n\n\n  看見床上的慘劇後，\n\n\n\n  他驚恐地抱著自己的頭，嘴巴張得大大的，他不敢相信面前所發生的一切。\n\n\n\n  他的妻子，\n\n\n\n  他的兒子……\n\n\n\n  都……\n\n\n\n  都……\n\n\n\n  男主人渾渾噩噩地又走回了客廳，\n\n\n\n  他覺得這是一場噩夢，\n\n\n\n  一場讓他心悸讓他渴望立刻醒來的噩夢。\n\n\n\n  默默地，\n\n\n\n  他掃了一眼坐在陽台上的周澤，\n\n\n\n  然後， \n\n\n\n  他撿起了地上剛剛崔老頭丟出來的斧頭，\n\n\n\n  一步一晃地走向了陽台。\n\n\n\n  「你們…………都是魔鬼…………都是劊子手…………都是…………魔鬼…………」\n\n\n\n  男主人提著斧頭，\n\n\n\n  走向了周澤。\n\n\n\n  而周澤的眼睛一直是眯著，他頭好疼，按理說，他應該被麻醉睡著的，但是他睡不著，麻藥安眠藥都沒用的，然而，就是這種死活睡不著的感覺才最為難熬。\n\n\n\n  周澤甚至不清楚周圍的情況，只是不停地在和體內的藥效進行著抗爭。\n\n\n\n  「砰！」\n\n\n\n  一聲悶響傳來，\n\n\n\n  周澤強撐著睜開了眼，\n\n\n\n  他看見男主人倒在自己面前，男主人的身邊還掉落著一把斧頭，在男主人身後，他看見了模模糊糊的熟悉的身影。\n\n\n\n  ……\n\n\n\n  哦，\n\n\n\n  是老許你來了啊……\n\n\n\n  老許，\n\n\n\n  我頭好暈，\n\n\n\n  那個崔老頭，\n\n\n\n  果然跟那頭殭屍，\n\n\n\n  是一夥的啊。\n\n\n\n  …… \n\n\n\n  「擦……擦……」\n\n\n\n  腳步聲傳來。\n\n\n\n  ……\n\n\n\n  老許，\n\n\n\n  扶我起來，\n\n\n\n  先離開這裡，免得天亮了有麻煩，我兜里還有冥鈔，可以燒一些。\n\n\n\n  ……\n\n\n\n  周澤感知到自己臉上傳來了對方呼出的氣息，\n\n\n\n  帶著點溫熱和潮濕，\n\n\n\n  他知道，是許清朗蹲在他面前了。\n\n\n\n  緊接著，\n\n\n\n  周澤感到自己臉上傳來了濕膩的感覺。\n\n\n\n  ……\n\n\n\n  老許，\n\n\n\n  快扶我起來啊，\n\n\n\n  額，\n\n\n\n  我艹，\n\n\n\n  你有病啊，\n\n\n\n  你舔我臉做什麼……",

    "content": "迷迷糊糊，對外界有著感知，但是腦袋又很是昏昏沉沉，明明覺得自己現在應該昏睡過去，卻沒辦法成功，這種半睡半醒的感覺，最是煎熬。\n\n\n\n  周澤以前聽唐詩說過，她當初為了想睡覺什麼方法都嘗試過，安眠藥麻醉藥這類的都是小兒科，但除了把自己整得渾渾噩噩身體幾乎崩潰，於睡眠卻無半點效用。\n\n\n\n  從地獄裡爬出來的人，就像是離開了水的魚，失去了地獄的環境，就百般不適應。\n\n\n\n  腦袋快炸開了，像是一個人在不斷循環做著噩夢，不停地在一個又一個夢境裡往返，你到底夢到了什麼，說不清楚，也都忘記了，甚至沒有絲毫的印象，唯一記得的就是自己好難受好痛苦。\n\n\n\n  好像是藥效慢慢地過去了，\n\n\n\n  周澤緩緩地睜開眼，\n\n\n\n  疲憊，\n\n\n\n  深深地疲憊，\n\n\n\n  隨之而來的更是身體上的酸疼。\n\n\n\n  「醒啦。」\n\n\n\n  許清朗的聲音自旁邊傳來。\n\n\n\n  周澤扭過頭，看見許清朗剛剛搓了一條濕毛巾過來，給自己擦臉。\n\n\n\n  自己胸口位置的傷口被包紮過了，問題應該不大，最重要的是天知道那個崔老頭居然在這上面淬了藥。\n\n\n\n  許清朗身上也有幾處包紮過的傷口，尤其是脖子位置，包裹了厚厚的一層。 \n\n\n\n  周澤有些疑惑，問道：\n\n\n\n  「你身上怎麼了？」\n\n\n\n  「昨晚被你殺了的行屍在你走後忽然又蹦躂起來了，好在還是被我解決了。」\n\n\n\n  「你沒事吧？」\n\n\n\n  「沒事。」\n\n\n\n  周澤點點頭，從床上坐了起來，這才發現自己二人現在還是在崔老頭的泥房子裡。\n\n\n\n  「崔老頭跟那頭殺人的殭屍，是一夥的。」周澤說道。\n\n\n\n  「嗯。」許清朗倒是沒有顯得太過吃驚，其實當崔老頭利用行屍的出現金蟬脫殼之後，這種思路就已經很是清晰了。\n\n\n\n  「你怎麼樣？」\n\n\n\n  「有點頭疼。」\n\n\n\n  說著，周澤下了床，手掌輕輕拍著自己的額頭，現在腦袋上還是有些不舒服。\n\n\n\n  「嗚嗚嗚…………」\n\n\n\n  一陣嗚咽聲傳來，是那個男主人。\n\n\n\n  「他…………」周澤指著男主人問道。\n\n\n\n  「哦，你坐在陽台上時，這小子想拿斧頭砍你，被我打暈了，然後我順手把他也捆了過來了，冥鈔我燒了一些，我們暫時應該不會有什麼麻煩，那些人畢竟不是我們殺的。\n\n\n\n  那個屋子裡的屍體我也沒有處理，不畫蛇添足了，再說了，也不是那麼好處理。」 \n\n\n\n  周澤聞言，起身，走到了男主人的面前。\n\n\n\n  老實說，這個男主人很值得同情，他具備一切值得同情的因素。\n\n\n\n  首先，\n\n\n\n  他有一個死了都要愛他的媽媽，\n\n\n\n  死後化作殭屍也要來找他說話，\n\n\n\n  他的妻子兒子也都剛剛死了，\n\n\n\n  他的倆朋友也死了，\n\n\n\n  那個他口中的「三兒」，應該就是昨晚的行屍，\n\n\n\n  還有就是，\n\n\n\n  他昨晚輸了一大筆錢。\n\n\n\n  但不知道為什麼，周澤就是對他同情不起來。\n\n\n\n  伸手拿開對方嘴裡的髒布條，\n\n\n\n  對方嘴巴一獲得自由就想喊「救命」，\n\n\n\n  結果周澤一巴掌拍了下去。\n\n\n\n  「啪！」\n\n\n\n  「救…………」\n\n\n\n  「啪！」\n\n\n\n  「救…………」\n\n\n\n  「啪！」\n\n\n\n  「…………」\n\n\n\n  「啪！」\n\n\n\n  最後一巴掌時，對方明顯是老實了，不敢喊了，但周澤的巴掌還是送了上去。 \n\n\n\n  對方忽然覺得好委屈，\n\n\n\n  我喊你打我，理所當然，\n\n\n\n  我不喊了認慫了，為什麼還要抽我？\n\n\n\n  周澤愣了一下，歉然道：\n\n\n\n  「不好意思，剛起床，有點起床氣，就想抽人巴掌發泄一下。」\n\n\n\n  「…………」男主人。\n\n\n\n  找了張小板凳，坐了下來。\n\n\n\n  許清朗從外面端進來一份菜炒飯。\n\n\n\n  「老崔頭懶到家裡也雞鴨都沒養，做不了更好的了，將就一下吧。」\n\n\n\n  周澤接過碗筷，有些尷尬道：\n\n\n\n  「我沒帶彼岸花口服液。」\n\n\n\n  因為周老闆沒料到這裡的事情會變得這麼嚴重，也沒想到會耽擱這麼久，所以沒帶吃飯的傢伙。\n\n\n\n  許清朗嘆了口氣，似乎早就料到如此，手伸入口袋，\n\n\n\n  取出了一瓶酸梅汁，\n\n\n\n  放在了桌上。\n\n\n\n  周澤愣了一下，笑了笑，\n\n\n\n  「好幾天沒吃這玩意兒了，也挺想的。」\n\n\n\n  一口酸梅汁下肚，借著那股子酸勁兒，周澤開始猛扒飯，像是剛從牢里放出來的犯人。 \n\n\n\n  莫名其妙的，\n\n\n\n  周澤覺得好像還是這種狼吞虎咽吃東西更暢快一點，的確，一些習慣只要養成了，就很難再改回去了，無論這個習慣在別人眼裡是好的還是壞的。\n\n\n\n  吃了飯，\n\n\n\n  周澤用筷子敲了敲男主人的頭，這貨被捆綁在這裡老許也沒給他吃也沒給他喝，但他精神意志很強大，遭遇變故之下居然還能繼續保持著這種頑強的生命狀態，也確實令人佩服。\n\n\n\n  「你叫什麼名字？」\n\n\n\n  「孫克旺。」\n\n\n\n  「你媽什麼時候死的？」\n\n\n\n  「四年前。」\n\n\n\n  這個叫孫克旺的男人，在此時顯示出了一種異常的配合，昨晚的一幕，可能已經把他身上刺兒頭已經都壓平實了，可能拿起斧頭想要砍周澤時的他，是最後的勇氣體現，但還是被及時趕到的許清朗給破壞了。\n\n\n\n  有些事情，可一不可再。\n\n\n\n  「四年前。」\n\n\n\n  周澤回味著這個回答。\n\n\n\n  他認為這應該是血親復仇，變成殭屍的先人從地下出來，第一反應就是找自己直系親屬去殺，那個老太婆也是如此。\n\n\n\n  「你媽是葬在哪裡的？」\n\n\n\n  「村口祖墳那邊。」 \n\n\n\n  「土葬的？」\n\n\n\n  「嗯，土葬的。」\n\n\n\n  周澤搖搖頭，如果火葬的話，就沒這麼多破事兒了。\n\n\n\n  「羨慕了？」許清朗在旁邊一邊喝著水一邊不忘補刀。\n\n\n\n  「我羨慕什麼？」\n\n\n\n  「羨慕人家是土葬的，但你回來時，只能捧著自己的骨灰，沒辦法欣賞自己上輩子的盛世美顏。」\n\n\n\n  「呵呵。」\n\n\n\n  「哦，我忘了，你骨灰都沒了。」\n\n\n\n  「…………」周澤。\n\n\n\n  「行了，你繼續問，我不打岔了。」\n\n\n\n  「沒事兒，咱再嘮嘮嗑，老許啊，你說是我先死還是你先死？」\n\n\n\n  「你是鬼差，肯定我先死。」許清朗回答道。\n\n\n\n  「那誰給你辦葬禮？」\n\n\n\n  「…………」老許。\n\n\n\n  「你是喜歡骨灰湯泡飯呢，還是喜歡骨灰咖喱雞腿飯？」\n\n\n\n  「…………」老許。\n\n\n\n  以前，周澤確實是在地攤文學上見過這種說法，說國家推行火葬是為了防止殭屍出現，這基本上是無稽之談，但反過來說卻挺有道理，那就是火化的推行確實讓殭屍出現的概率降低了。 \n\n\n\n  屍體如果化成灰，你就算是有再打的問題，也不可能澆點水弄點兒水泥給自己重塑肉身吧？\n\n\n\n  「你媽是四年前下葬的，不算太晚了，之前村里遷墳時，你沒見到你媽的骨灰？」許清朗問道。\n\n\n\n  「沒見到。」\n\n\n\n  「怎麼可能沒見到，老的墓找不到就算了，你這是…………」許清朗忽然想到了什麼，「你下葬時沒弄棺材？」\n\n\n\n  孫克旺搖搖頭。\n\n\n\n  「你可真夠孝順的。」許清朗嘲諷道。\n\n\n\n  在這個年代，土葬在大部分區域是不合法的，一些鐵頭娃硬要土葬的話，也是想追求一個體面，但孫克旺這種把自己媽土葬卻連棺材都沒準備的做法，還真是讓人有些看不懂了。\n\n\n\n  「對了，最重要的問題沒問，你媽是怎麼死的？」周澤問道。\n\n\n\n  這是問題的關鍵，\n\n\n\n  他媽跟崔老頭有一腿是肯定的，這條地道就是最好的證明。\n\n\n\n  之前如果不是崔老頭出現，周澤早就解決問題了。\n\n\n\n  孫克旺猶豫了一下，最後艱難地回答道：\n\n\n\n  「病死的。」\n\n\n\n  「啪！」\n\n\n\n  周澤一巴掌扇過去。\n\n \n\n  很脆的一巴掌，\n\n\n\n  很迫不及待的一巴掌，\n\n\n\n  這足以說明周老闆的起床氣還沒發泄完。\n\n\n\n  「剛剛抽巴掌的感覺太爽，還沒盡興，謝謝你又給了我這個機會。」\n\n\n\n  說著，周澤把自己地臉湊到孫克旺的臉面前，指了指旁邊的許清朗：\n\n\n\n  「你是不是覺得他長得這麼漂亮，就就很好騙？」\n\n\n\n  「…………」許清朗。\n\n\n\n  孫克旺搖搖頭。\n\n\n\n  「啪！」\n\n\n\n  又是一巴掌。\n\n\n\n  「不會說話了？」周澤問道。\n\n\n\n  孫克旺的臉幾乎被周澤抽腫了。\n\n\n\n  他在這24小時的時間內，已經遭遇了最慘絕人寰的打擊，但是此時此刻，還得面對周澤這種近乎戲謔方式的折磨，他其實早就崩潰了。\n\n\n\n  「會。」\n\n\n\n  「好，再告訴我一遍，你媽是怎麼死的。」\n\n\n\n  「病……」\n\n\n\n  「啪！」\n\n\n\n  一巴掌。\n\n\n\n  「繼續回答。」\n\n\n\n  「她是……她是……我的錯……都是我造的…………」 \n\n\n\n  「啪！」\n\n\n\n  「請不要感情渲染和鋪墊，直入主題。」\n\n\n\n  「我殺的。」\n\n\n\n  周澤直起身子，伸了個懶腰。\n\n\n\n  倒不是周澤明察秋毫，早就洞悉了一切，而是這貨演技不行，第一次回答他媽死因時支支吾吾猶猶豫豫的，那些被網上吐槽的流量小鮮肉演技都比他在行一些。\n\n\n\n  「為什麼殺你媽？」\n\n\n\n  「她懷孕了。」\n\n\n\n  周澤和許清朗對視一眼。\n\n\n\n  那個老太婆，六七十的人了吧？\n\n\n\n  「這麼大年紀還能懷孕？」\n\n\n\n  許清朗問周澤，周澤畢竟上輩子是醫生，知道的多一些。\n\n\n\n  「國內有六十多歲懷孕生子的例子，國外則有七十歲的。」周澤回答道，「但這很危險。」\n\n\n\n  孫克旺像是進入了狀態，他現在的精神情緒有點瘋執，沒等周澤繼續發問，他就咬牙接著道：\n\n\n\n  「這麼一大把年紀了，居然還和男人亂搞，把肚子搞大了，還跟我說想和那個姘頭住一起，求我哪怕不扯證不辦事兒只要住一起就成！\n\n\n\n  肚子都大了，\n\n\n\n  這讓我這個當兒子的臉往哪兒擱啊， \n\n\n\n  我叫她把孩子打了，\n\n\n\n  她還不願意，\n\n\n\n  哈哈哈哈，\n\n\n\n  我就跟我幾個朋友一起，\n\n\n\n  把她……\n\n\n\n  把她……\n\n\n\n  把她用被子，\n\n\n\n  悶死了！」",

    "content": "幾乎陷入癔症的孫克旺被許清朗用抹布重新堵住了嘴巴，隨後，許清朗點了一根煙，走到了門口位置，周澤已經站在那裡吞雲吐霧著了。\n\n\n\n  「難以想像，就因為這種事，居然自己把他媽給殺了。\n\n\n\n  最開始出現的行屍，在村里綽號叫三兒，很樂於助人，那件事，居然他也幫忙了，幫了這個姓孫的，殺了他的媽媽。還真是村里大好人。」\n\n\n\n  「有什麼難以想像的。」周澤抖了抖菸灰，「這不很正常麼，你以為只有豪門貴族才在意自己的名聲？」\n\n\n\n  「什麼？」\n\n\n\n  「古代皇室，為了遮掩自己的醜聞，什麼事情都能做得出來，殺人滅口這種事情只能算是小兒科了，但那不說情有可原，至少我們還能夠理解。\n\n\n\n  但實際上，越是這種小門小戶，它也越是在意自己的門面，哪怕在外人看來它並沒有什麼門面。越是落後的地方就越是在意這種規矩。\n\n\n\n  在國內，到現在為止還有不少地方女人不能上桌吃飯呢，尤其是在有客人來的時候，哪家女人服服帖帖懂事反而被認為是一件很有面子的事情。\n\n\n\n  他媽懷孕了，對於孫克旺來說，不亞於他的『皇家血統』受到了玷污，可能對於你這個局外人來說不算是什麼，但站在他的角度上來講，這可能會讓他成為村子裡的笑柄，影響到他在村子裡的威嚴和體面。 \n\n\n\n  因為他這一輩子，只有村子這麼個大小，他的天，也就只有這個村子頭頂一般大。」\n\n\n\n  「你能理解？」\n\n\n\n  「不能理解，但我能習慣。別忘了鶯鶯是怎麼死的，不就是跟一個窮酸書生約會去了麼，被家裡發現後就被浸豬籠了。\n\n\n\n  還不是為了家風，為了面子，你說，這兩件事上有什麼本質區別麼？」\n\n\n\n  「先不說這個問題，我有一件事一直很奇怪。」\n\n\n\n  「說。」\n\n\n\n  「昨晚那個崔老頭是怎麼用弩箭把你給射中的，我記得，你身上有一套鎧甲的吧？」\n\n\n\n  周澤聞言，愣了一下，臉色變得有些奇怪。\n\n\n\n  「怎麼了？」許清朗追問道。\n\n\n\n  「我得想想今晚該怎麼把那頭殭屍給抓住，還有那個屍胎，如果被那老太婆給吃了的話，問題會變得比之前更棘手。」\n\n\n\n  「喂，別轉移話題。」許清朗抓著不放。\n\n\n\n  「你好煩。」\n\n\n\n  「回答我的問題，身為堂堂鬼差，居然被一個普通人拿遊樂場裡的弩箭給放倒了，你丟不丟人？」\n\n\n\n  「我怎麼能想到他在丟了一把斧頭過來後居然還能拿出一把弩？」\n\n\n\n  「然後呢？」 \n\n\n\n  「然後…………」\n\n\n\n  周澤伸手摸了摸自己的額頭，\n\n\n\n  「好像是最近太陽曬多了，鹹魚得時間也夠久了，我都忘了，自己身上居然還有鎧甲的。」\n\n\n\n  「…………」許清朗。\n\n\n\n  「好了，別再糾結這個問題了，你再繼續這樣糾結下去，我會越來越覺得自己昨晚是多麼的魚唇。」\n\n\n\n  許清朗走到周澤面前，雙手忽然掐住了周澤的脖子，惡狠狠地道：\n\n\n\n  「也就是說，昨天你不被這個弩箭射中，他們就不可能跑掉，我們今天事情也就可以結束了！\n\n\n\n  我們現在還停留在這裡，殭屍跟崔老頭還沒抓到，還得繼續在這裡磨洋工抓耳撓腮，根本原因，\n\n\n\n  就是因為你自己忘了自己的能力？」\n\n\n\n  「鬆手啊，老許，鬆手。」\n\n\n\n  周澤一開始以為許清朗只是開玩笑，但沒想到對方的手勁居然越來越大，掐得自己都快有些喘不過氣來了。\n\n\n\n  剎那間，\n\n\n\n  自周澤身上開始蕩漾出一道黑色的波紋，一套神秘威嚴的黑武士鎧浮現而出，且護住了脖子位置。\n\n\n\n  周澤感覺自己脖子一松，許清朗的勁道一下子被鎧甲給分去了很多。 \n\n\n\n  許清朗這個時候才收回手，找了個張板凳坐了下來，雙手扶著自己的臉，歉然道：\n\n\n\n  「對不起，我激動了，一想到昨晚死去的那一家子，我心裡就有點難受。\n\n\n\n  孫克旺是死有餘辜，但他沒死，然而，最不該死的，還是他的妻子和兒子。\n\n\n\n  今晚如果不解決掉那頭殭屍的話，村子裡可能還會有人繼續死，我不認為崔老頭能夠控制住那頭殭屍，哪怕那頭殭屍生前是他的姘頭。」\n\n\n\n  周澤長舒一口氣，身上的甲冑慢慢地褪去。\n\n\n\n  「放心吧，今晚不可能再出問題了，我回床上躺一會兒，等到了晚上時再喊我起來，還有，老許你最近是不是自己偷偷去健身房了，這手勁變大了啊。」\n\n\n\n  說完，\n\n\n\n  周澤轉身走向了臥室。\n\n\n\n  許清朗一個人坐在板凳上，\n\n\n\n  他鬆開遮著自己臉的手，\n\n\n\n  有些驚恐地看著自己的掌心，\n\n\n\n  在剛才，\n\n\n\n  那股子暴力的殺意像是沒辦法克制住一樣，這是一種自體內升騰而出的本能衝動，是一種恨不得把自己眼前可以殺死的生命徹底蹂躪的渴望。\n\n\n\n  而後，\n\n\n\n  許清朗伸出舌頭， \n\n\n\n  舔了舔自己的掌心，\n\n\n\n  掌心上，還殘留著他的味道，\n\n\n\n  好好味哦。\n\n\n\n  ………………\n\n\n\n  入夜了，\n\n\n\n  興興許是燒了冥鈔的關係，孫克旺家裡死人的事情還沒曝出去，再加上村里人住得散，孫克旺平時都是跟一些狐朋狗友交往，也因此，他一天沒在村子裡出現，也沒村子想著去看看。\n\n\n\n  也因此，這一夜，村子裡的主題依舊是平靜。\n\n\n\n  孫克旺被周澤綁在了槐樹上，嘴裡照樣塞著東西。\n\n\n\n  周澤自己則是在下面靠著槐樹站著，他在等，等昨晚的那個老太重新出來。\n\n\n\n  化身殭屍，上輩子的仇恨加上血親復仇的衝動，老太婆對於殺死自己這個兒子有著難以遏制的執念。\n\n\n\n  她會來的，\n\n\n\n  肯定會來的。\n\n\n\n  孫克旺的身上被周澤用指甲刺出了幾個口子，鮮血不停地滴落下來，不會讓人死亡，但這就像是放點兒血吸引鯊魚一個道理。\n\n\n\n  許清朗站在邊上，他的臉在夜幕之下，顯得有些陰沉。\n\n\n\n  到了後半夜時，\n\n\n\n  風慢慢地大了起來。\n\n\n\n  遠處菜田裡，走來了一個佝僂的身影，崔老頭一個人走了過來，走到了距離周澤不到十米的位置。 \n\n\n\n  這次，他沒有帶斧頭，背上也沒有弩箭。\n\n\n\n  這讓周老闆心裡有一點點的失望，他多麼希望崔老頭再對自己射幾箭，然後自己身上鎧甲浮現完美格擋攻擊，好找回昨天的場子。\n\n\n\n  但崔老頭今天的架勢，就差舉著一面白旗了。\n\n\n\n  「來談談吧。」\n\n\n\n  崔老頭看著周澤，很平靜地說道。\n\n\n\n  「好像沒什麼好談的。」周澤搖搖頭，「那個老太婆被你困住了麼？但你能困住多久，她忍不住的。相信我，這個世界上，比我更了解殭屍的人，真的不多。」\n\n\n\n  「他，讓她殺了吧。」\n\n\n\n  崔老頭伸手指著被掛在樹上的孫克旺，繼續道：\n\n\n\n  「他該死。」\n\n\n\n  周澤沒說話，等著崔老頭繼續說下去。\n\n\n\n  「讓她了了心愿，然後我們一家子，自己解決，柴火堆我都準備好了，汽油也準備好了，就等著這一天呢。」\n\n\n\n  「那個屍胎，果然是你的女兒。」\n\n\n\n  「我恨我有這一雙陰陽眼，我倒是寧願我能一直糊塗下去！」崔老頭面露猙獰地嘶吼道：「但我看得見，我看見了，我看見了我們的女兒一個人在墳頭哭，我看見了她在下面哭泣。\n\n\n\n  我多麼希望她是病死的，多麼希望她是病死的！」 \n\n\n\n  人們常說，人間看似很美好，但至少，它還有一個「看似」，周澤其實也覺得，鬼，無非就是撕開了社會上虛偽偽裝之後所露出的人性最本質的一面。\n\n\n\n  他能理解崔老頭的心情，甚至可以說是感同身受。\n\n\n\n  「你可以報警的。」\n\n\n\n  「報警？告訴警察，我能看見鬼？告訴警察，他死去的媽媽告訴我，是他殺了她？」\n\n\n\n  崔老頭笑著反問道。\n\n\n\n  「你讓開吧。」\n\n\n\n  崔老頭對周澤道。\n\n\n\n  與此同時，\n\n\n\n  在周老頭身後出現了一道匍匐在地爬行的身影，在那道身影旁，小女童傻愣愣地站在那裡，她是最迷茫也是最無知的一個。\n\n\n\n  老太婆胸口上的傷口依舊清晰可見，這使得今天的她，速度很慢，但她那眼眸子中的恨意，仍然如此的濃郁，尤其是在看見樹上掛著的自己的兒子時。\n\n\n\n  你的敵人，準備投降了，他們準備在了結完最後一點心愿之後，自我了結。\n\n\n\n  忽然間，\n\n\n\n  周澤覺得這好無趣，自己蓄勢待發的一拳，打算給昨晚自己洗刷恥辱的心理建設，全都變成了無用功。\n\n\n\n  「對不起，職責所在，我不可能看著你殺人。」 \n\n\n\n  周澤主動向前走去。\n\n\n\n  「你用得著這麼迂腐麼？」\n\n\n\n  崔老頭看著不斷逼近的周澤咬牙切齒道：「我現在還能控制得住她，一旦我先死了或者她逃走了，會是什麼麻煩，你不清楚？」\n\n\n\n  「我也是職責所在，不好意思。」\n\n\n\n  說著，\n\n\n\n  周澤舉起了自己的拳頭，對著崔老頭打了過去。\n\n\n\n  崔老頭吃了周澤一拳，身形倒退了兩步，但也下意識地一腳踹向了周澤，周澤沒有躲避，這一腳直接踹中了周澤的小腿。\n\n\n\n  「啊呀…………」\n\n\n\n  周澤應聲倒在了地上，抱著自己的胸口，一副很難受我已經身受重傷的樣子。\n\n\n\n  「…………」崔老頭。\n\n\n\n  「…………」許清朗。\n\n\n\n  許清朗這個時候走來，看了看地上的周澤，小聲提醒道：「他踢得是你的腿，你捂的是胸口。」\n\n\n\n  周澤白了許清朗一眼，很浮誇地解釋道：\n\n\n\n  「這老頭，好深厚的內力！」",
