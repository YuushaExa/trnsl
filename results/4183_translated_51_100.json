    "content": "Not long after Xu Qinglang kicked the door, Zhou Ze came downstairs. He opened the bookstore door; his forehead was beaded with sweat, and he looked exhausted, as if he hadn't rested well.\n\nTo be honest, he had just woken up. But it wasn't the usual waking up naturally—he'd been startled awake.\n\nThe last image from his dream—the strands of black hair coiled around his body—was enough to make his scalp tingle even now just thinking about it.\n\n\"Xu Le!\"\n\nHis sister-in-law stood with her hands on her hips, posturing as if to say, *I need an explanation!*\n\nZhou Ze nodded to Xu Qinglang, signaling for him to come in. Then, right in front of his sister-in-law, Zhou Ze locked the bookstore door again, shutting her out.\n\nHis sister-in-law stared in disbelief.\n\nXu Le actually dared to ignore her!\n\nThe young woman's princess temper flared up. She had come this time intending to demand an explanation for her sister, and she had even learned about the Maserati woman from Xu Qinglang. How could she just walk away?\n\n*Fine, you're locking the door, are you!*\n\nThe sister-in-law bent down, found a large rock on the ground, and prepared to smash the glass door. But just as she was about to take a running start, Zhou Ze, inside the bookstore, turned his head and glanced at her.\n\nAt that moment, a black halo was swirling in Zhou Ze's eyes.\n\nHis sister-in-law was so frightened she shuddered, stumbling back several steps and subconsciously clamping her legs together.\n\nThe terrifying scene from that night in the bathroom resurfaced in her mind.\n\nThat night…\n\n…she had been scared into incontinence.\n\n\"Xu Le, you… you just wait!\"\n\nHis sister-in-law spat out one last threat, then scurried away in a panic, silently berating herself for meddling. It would be better to just go home and tell her parents about all this.\n\nShe'd tell them that the good little live-in son-in-law¹ they'd chosen themselves now had a woman on the side!\n\n***\n\nInside the bookstore, Xu Qinglang had been trying to organize his words ever since he came in, swallowing nervously. He was a man who had seen his fair share of things, but even he felt a deep, lingering fear.\n\nBecause at the time, he, the female corpse, and Zhou Ze had all failed to see that woman's true identity!\n\nIt was too horrifying.\n\nAnd the more you thought about it, the more terrifying it became!\n\nIt's like watching a variety show where celebrity impersonators sing a song; you might find it amusing.\n\nBut if someone suddenly started impersonating your parents, your husband, or your wife, and lived with you without you noticing a thing—\n\nhow terrifying would that be!\n\n\"Last night, the one who came in the Maserati wasn't Doctor Lin. It wasn't your wife!\n\nYour wife never changed her car. After you confessed to her, she took a leave of absence and hasn't been to work.\"\n\nXu Qinglang finally got the words out.\n\nZhou Ze's pupils contracted slightly.\n\nHe didn't say anything, just sat down on the chair behind the counter.\n\nIn his dream, the man in the sweatshirt from Rongcheng had already given him a warning, so even though he was genuinely shocked to hear Xu Qinglang's words, he could still handle it.\n\n\"How can you be so calm?\" Xu Qinglang asked, a bit puzzled. \"Or do you know who that woman was?\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. \"I really had no idea at the time. I thought she was Doctor Lin.\n\nBut thinking back now, a lot of things didn't add up.\n\nHer suddenly coming to find me, seeming to have gotten over everything…\n\nMe suddenly becoming so forward and impulsive…\n\nHer being so compliant. Every move, while seeming shy and demure, was perfectly calculated to strike the most sensitive chord in a man's heart.\"\n\n\"What kind of ghost was that?\" Xu Qinglang pursed his lips and asked again, \"What type of ghost?\"\n\n\"A woman from beside the Yellow Springs Road to Hell, one who likes to dance with her hands in a pool of water. This woman… has no face.\"\n\nAs he said this,\n\na sudden realization dawned on Zhou Ze.\n\nThe Faceless Woman.\n\nPeople who saw her were always horrified by her featureless face, finding it eerie and bizarre,\n\nbut they overlooked the real point.\n\nShe had no face,\n\nbecause she had the ability to conjure any face she needed!\n\nThat was the true nature of being faceless.\n\n*From nothing, something can be born!*\n\n\"The Faceless Woman?\" Xu Qinglang frowned. \"I think I read about her in some Qing Dynasty collection of strange tales. It said she was a phantom formed from the lingering resentment of the dead on the Yellow Springs Road, always waiting for a chance to return to the world of the living.\"\n\n\"That's more or less it,\" Zhou Ze nodded. At the same time, he said, \"Find that collection of strange tales for me, I'd like to read it too.\"\n\n\"I'll look for it when I get back. I read it as a kid, I probably won't be able to find it anymore.\n\nBy the way, did you… have relations with that female ghost?\n\nLike you just said, she came looking for you to seduce you, right?\"\n\n\"No.\" Zhou Ze shook his head, picked up the new mug on the counter, and took a sip of tea.\n\nHe said with feigned gravity, \"At the critical moment, I sensed something was off.\n\nI sounded the retreat.\"\n\nZhou Ze would never admit that it was because of that damned bastard Xu Qinglang and all the crap he'd said that afternoon about bodies, soul DNA, and being cuckolded that he'd developed a psychological block and failed to be seduced.\n\nIn fact, Zhou Ze himself was puzzled. His bookstore had plenty of physical copies of web novels, including many transmigration and rebirth stories.\n\nThe protagonists in those books had children without any issue; it all seemed perfectly natural, nothing out of place.\n\nWhy was it that when it was his turn to live out a plot from a novel, there were so many convoluted hang-ups?\n\nWas he just…\n\n…bored?\n\nNo, the one with too much time on his hands was Xu Qinglang.\n\nOnly that weirdo would be bored enough to help him analyze and ponder such philosophical questions.\n\nBut he couldn't really blame Xu Qinglang either. If Xu Qinglang hadn't said all that to him that afternoon, he would probably be facing a *fait accompli* by now.\n\nAnd the consequences would have been severe.\n\nShe was fishing, and he had taken the bait. The outcome would have been him ending up as meat on the chopping block.\n\n\"So she failed?\" Xu Qinglang asked.\n\n\"Mhm,\" Zhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"Then why is she targeting you?\"\n\n\"Maybe unlike that Lady Bai, she doesn't care about matching social status,\" Zhou Ze joked.\n\n\"...\" said Xu Qinglang.\n\n\"Maybe it's jealousy. Because I could come back, and she couldn't. And now I have a physical body and a new life,\" Zhou Ze guessed.\n\n\"But she's back now too, and it's obvious her target is you,\" Xu Qinglang analyzed. \"This means her return isn't so simple. There are probably other restrictions.\"\n\n\"Like, for some special purpose, someone intentionally allowed her to return?\" Zhou Ze considered the problem from another angle.\n\n\"I get the feeling you know something. So, I was worried for nothing, right? You've actually got it all figured out?\"\n\n\"I found out in a dream.\"\n\n\"Do you really think I'm stupid enough to believe that kind of crap?\" Xu Qinglang retorted.\n\nZhou Ze reached up and gently touched his forehead.\n\nThe little loli had hastily transferred the duties of a Hell Warden to him, and the Faceless Woman had been released from Hell…\n\nIt was very possible it was all to capture that man from Rongcheng—the one who had warned him in his dream.\n\nBut that Faceless Woman was clearly planning to take advantage of her official business to carry out her own little scheme.\n\nFor instance…\n\n…setting him up?\n\n\"Anyway, for the time being, I'll try not to leave the bookstore. I'll wait for this to blow over.\"\n\n\"That's a given,\" Xu Qinglang nodded, then leaned closer to Zhou Ze. \"Hey, are you still hung up on that whole body and DNA thing?\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. \"Am I that bored?\"\n\n\"Actually, it's easy to get over. DNA is just a code, but a child is also the crystallization of your own soul… ah, forget it, I can't even explain this topic clearly.\n\nAnyway, even normal people who haven't transmigrated or possessed another body can't be sure the children they have with their wives are their own.\n\nYou don't need to worry about it so much.\"\n\n\"I never realized you were so good at comforting people,\" Zhou Ze said, standing up. \"Come to the bathroom with me for a second.\"\n\nXu Qinglang followed Zhou Ze to the bathroom.\n\nZhou Ze directly took off his jacket and the shirt underneath.\n\n\"You need to work out,\" Xu Qinglang said, shaking his head with clear disapproval.\n\nJust then, the female corpse walked down the stairs. The bathroom was right next to the staircase, so Bai Yingying immediately saw the two men in the bathroom together!\n\n\"Oh my, I just realized I haven't had enough sleep.\"\n\nPutting on a show, she feigned a yawn and pretended she was going back up to rest, so as not to disturb their private world for two.\n\n\"Bring the first-aid kit from the second floor. Get gauze and antiseptic ready,\" Zhou Ze said to Bai Yingying.\n\n\"You got it, Boss.\"\n\nBai Yingying hurried upstairs to get the items, wondering to herself, *Are the boss and him going to be that rough? They even need to prepare to stop bleeding beforehand?*\n\n\"What on earth are you doing?\" Xu Qinglang asked, crossing his arms and looking at Zhou Ze, a clear look of disgust deep in his eyes.\n\nZhou Ze smiled. \"You're clearly not gay, so why do you pretend to be like that all the time?\"\n\n\"It's a little spice of life, don't you get it?\" Xu Qinglang pointed at Zhou Ze's stomach. \"Even if it's someone else's body, you should work out more. Look at this flab. Tsk tsk, disgusting.\"\n\nZhou Ze's fingernails instantly grew long.\n\nXu Qinglang froze for a moment.\n\n*Fuck,*\n\n*are you getting this mad just because I made fun of your body?*\n\nBut in the next moment, Zhou Ze used the nail of his index finger to lightly scrape a line from his jaw all the way down his torso. A line of blood slowly appeared, and beads of blood began to seep out.\n\nAt the same time,\n\nfrom Zhou Ze's neck down to his abdomen, lines of black powder appeared. The powder was as fine as the ink lines used by a carpenter, completely invisible before.\n\nAs his nail scraped past, these ink lines flaked off.\n\nZhou Ze let out a long sigh of relief,\n\nlooking at himself in the mirror and the long, bloody scratch on his chest.\n\n\"What is this stuff?\"\n\nXu Qinglang held his breath and crouched down to examine the black powder that had fallen off.\n\n\"It's hair,\" Zhou Ze answered.\n\nHair that had been wrapped around…\n\n…his soul.\n\n\"Boss, I'm coming in,\" Bai Yingying said, walking into the bathroom with the first-aid kit. When she saw the black powder on the floor, a strange look appeared on her face. She said:\n\n\"Boss, is this something you two use… for foreplay?\"\n\n\"You recognize this?\" Xu Qinglang asked, pointing to the black powder.\n\n\"This is Ghost Saliva Incense. It's formed from the resentment of old ghosts, a hundred years or more. My lady used to have some of it too.\"\n\n\"Explain its effect,\" Xu Qinglang demanded.\n\n\"It stimulates a person's impulses. For example, if you wanted to do something at that moment, and you inhaled this stuff, it would make you ten or even a hundred times more desperate to do that thing.\"\n\nHearing this, a smirk tugged at the corner of Xu Qinglang's mouth. He glanced at Zhou Ze,\n\nand laughed:\n\n\"Old Zhou, was this Faceless Woman trying to breed with you?\"\n\n***\n¹A man who marries into his wife's family and lives with them, often seen as a lower-status arrangement.",

    "content": "Zhou Ze didn't believe the Faceless Woman would do anything truly unconscionable. Her limitations had to be even greater than his own; otherwise, she wouldn't have needed to resort to \"disguising\" herself as Dr. Lin to get close to him.\n\nStill, being targeted by someone like her was definitely not a comfortable feeling.\n\nShe could become a security guard at the mall, a bus driver, an old grandma on the roadside waiting for you to help her across the street.\n\nShe could also become the kind, older sister in an alleyway, calling you in for a cup of tea.\n\nAs long as you had a social network, as long as you needed to go outside, she had the ability to approach you, and you had to be constantly prepared for a sneak attack from anyone around you.\n\nWhat on earth she wanted from him, Zhou Ze didn't understand. But judging from the many examples in supernatural folk tales of female ghosts who liked to absorb men's *yang* energy to replenish themselves, the Faceless Woman's motives were probably along those lines.\n\nOr, did she want his body?\n\nOr perhaps, she wanted his current status as a temp?\n\nZhou Ze didn't know if the little loli knew about this, but he feared that even if she did, she wouldn't actually intervene. It was highly likely that the Faceless Woman had been deliberately released by the little loli and her gang of Underworld Emissaries to help them get things done.\n\nThe Faceless Woman hadn't attacked him directly, possibly due to other concerns. Of course, looking at the now incredibly obedient Bai Yingying, perhaps the Faceless Woman was also very wary of his fingernails.\n\nBack when he first entered Hell, the Faceless Woman had tried to keep him there but was injured by his fingernails, allowing him to leave. Perhaps that incident had indeed left a deep impression on her, forcing her to use a honey trap against him.\n\nBut one other thing also made Zhou Ze a bit melancholic.\n\nThe Ghost Saliva Incense.\n\nAn impulse magnified ten, a hundredfold.\n\nAnd he had still managed to restrain himself.\n\nZhou Ze felt no pride in his strong willpower,\n\nonly a faint, intangible sorrow.\n\nSitting behind the counter, flipping casually through some books, Zhou Ze also went online to search for information about the Faceless Woman, to see if he could find anything valuable.\n\nHe didn't find any valuable information, but he did find Stephen Chow's movie, *Forbidden City Cop*.\n\nThen Zhou Ze and Bai Yingying spent half the afternoon rewatching the film.\n\nThere was a villainous BOSS in it who also had no face and could transform into other people.\n\nAfter the movie, it was already evening. Zhou Ze gestured for Bai Yingying to open the shop door.\n\nBai Yingying hesitated slightly and said, \"Boss, aren't you afraid she'll come back?\"\n\n\"Are we not doing business anymore?\" Zhou Ze retorted. \"Or can you contribute some of your burial goods for me to exchange for some cash to tide the shop over?\"\n\nThe female corpse pouted, but still went to open the door.\n\nShe did have money. When Madam Bai was buried, she was a young lady from a wealthy family, so her burial goods must have been considerable. Plus, Madam Bai had lingered in the mortal world for two hundred years. She couldn't take worldly things like money to Hell, so naturally, it had all been left behind.\n\nSeeing how many handbags Bai Yingying had bought during her few limited trips out, Zhou Ze had a good idea of her wealth.\n\nAt first, Zhou Ze had suspected the female corpse was stealing from the shop to go on a spending spree. Later, when he realized all the money in the shop combined wasn't enough to pay for a few of her bags, he stopped suspecting her.\n\nMadam Bai had once been set to be carried in an eight-bearer sedan chair to marry Xu Qinglang, who owned over twenty houses for the living.\n\nBai Yingying was obsessed with brand-name handbags.\n\nThis was definitely not good news for the single dogs of the world. It meant that even after you die and become a ghost, life is still tough.\n\nNot long after the shop door opened, just as Zhou Ze was making a cup of tea, a middle-aged man walked into the store.\n\nBai Yingying stood her ground, staring at him.\n\nZhou Ze also found himself watching the man. Although reason told him the Faceless Woman was unlikely to be so impatient as to change her appearance and come back again, his heart still had to be on guard.\n\nThe middle-aged man wore a leather jacket, faded white in many places. The leather shoes on his feet were also somewhat old, and he wore a pair of casual trousers that weren't exactly sparkling clean.\n\nOn his head, he wore a tall hat, which looked a bit comical.\n\nThe middle-aged man walked over to the bookshelf, subconsciously rubbing his hands together, preparing to find a book to read. But as he looked left and right, his brow furrowed deeper and deeper, and he complained,\n\n\"Boss, all you have here are novels and that sort of rubbish. Don't you have anything else worth reading?\"\n\n\"There's some over here.\"\n\nZhou Ze gestured for Bai Yingying to move the box from behind the counter.\n\nBai Yingying did as she was told.\n\nThe man squatted down and continued to pick through the books in the box. He flipped through several in a row, their covers displaying things unfit for polite eyes.\n\nFor example, *A-Bin*,\n\nfor example, *The Doorman*,\n\nfor example, *Chen Pipi*.\n\nThe middle-aged man's fingers trembled with anger. He shoved the box forward.\n\n\"These things, what are you showing me these for!\"\n\nThe middle-aged man was furious. He stood up and pointed a finger at Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Are all bookstore owners so shameless these days!\n\n\"Harboring filth and vice,\n\n\"Harboring filth and vice!\"\n\nZhou Ze lit a cigarette, propped a foot on the counter, and paid the guy no mind.\n\nThe middle-aged man turned angrily to leave. When he reached the doorway, he glanced back and saw some respectable-looking books on the small shelf by the entrance. He stopped in his tracks, picked out a copy of Mr. Qian Mu's *An Outline of National History*, and sat down on a small stool to read.\n\nZhou Ze didn't bother him. His bookstore, after all, accepted anyone and everyone—humans and ghosts alike, and those who were neither human nor ghost. It was just that things were a bit tense right now, so he needed to pay more attention to the movements of that faceless woman.\n\nJust then, Zhou Ze's phone rang. He took it out and saw that it was a call from his sister-in-law.\n\n\"Hello.\" Zhou Ze listened to the phone carefully.\n\nLast time, it was a message from Dr. Lin on WeChat. This time, it was a call from his sister-in-law. There was no guarantee the Faceless Woman wasn't trying the same half-a-butt routine again.\n\n\"Brother-in-law...\" his sister-in-law cooed on the other end.\n\nZhou Ze hung up immediately.\n\nSomething was wrong.\n\nVery wrong!\n\nSince when was his sister-in-law so sweet?\n\nThis was clearly the prelude to offering up half a butt,\n\njust like that night in the Maserati when Dr. Lin said she'd wear stockings next time.\n\nZhou Ze didn't think he had... no, Zhou Ze didn't think \"Xu Le's face\" possessed the ability to be a lady-killer.\n\nThe phone rang again. It was still her.\n\nAfter a moment's thought, he answered it again.\n\n\"Hello.\"\n\n\"Xu Le, you bastard, how dare you hang up on me!\"\n\nNow *that* sounded like her.\n\n\"What is it,\" Zhou Ze responded coldly.\n\n\"I was at KFC studying with a friend and my wallet was stolen. Do you have any money? Just give me seven or eight thousand to tide me over.\"\n\nZhou Ze hung up again.\n\nYep.\n\nIt had to be the Faceless Woman.\n\nEven if it wasn't the Faceless Woman, hearing \"just seven or eight thousand,\" Zhou Ze was determined to believe she was the Faceless Woman in disguise.\n\nThat's right.\n\nThat had to be it.\n\nThe phone rang again. Zhou Ze was getting annoyed. The middle-aged man sitting there reading frowned at Zhou Ze, clearly disturbed by the repeated ringing.\n\n\"Sorry, I'll put it on silent,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nThe man lowered his head and continued to read.\n\nHowever, his sister-in-law kept calling incessantly. Zhou Ze had no choice but to answer one more time.\n\n\"Xu Le, you can't just watch me die. I can only ask you for this money. Can I borrow it from you?\n\n\"How about I don't tell my parents and my sister about the woman in the Maserati?\"\n\n\"You should go ahead and tell them.\"\n\n\"...\" said the sister-in-law.\n\n*What the fuck, don't just give up and let it all go to hell! You can still be saved!*\n\nAfter paying all his various expenses last time, he only had a few thousand left in his pocket. If he gave it all to her, he'd have nothing left but the northwest wind to drink.\n\n\"Xu Le, please, help me out. I'll tell you the truth. I went to a nightclub with a friend, and both our wallets were stolen. My parents and my sister can't find out about this, or they'll kill me.\n\n\"My friend has to pay her art class fee tomorrow. Her tuition was in her wallet. We can't delay it.\"\n\n\"Tell her to ask her parents,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Her family isn't well-off. She earned this tuition money herself by working during the winter break. Her family won't agree to give her the money. Xu Le, please, let's just say I'm borrowing it from you, okay? I'll pay you back next month when I get my allowance.\"\n\nZhou Ze was about to refuse again,\n\nwhen at that moment,\n\nthe voice on the phone said, \"It's settled then. Our taxi just got here. Good thing I still have a little money on WeChat, enough for the cab, or you wouldn't be seeing me.\"\n\nThe call was disconnected, and two girls walked into the bookstore from outside.\n\nThe two were likely classmates. They were dressed normally, but had clearly put on makeup.\n\nAt their age, girls were as fresh as a lotus emerging from water; makeup was actually a burden. Unfortunately, at their age, they didn't understand this.\n\nZhou Ze stood up and walked over.\n\n\"Xu Le, brother-in-law, please help me out,\" his sister-in-law began to wheedle.\n\nThe girl beside her seemed timid, standing next to her, looking very embarrassed and restrained.\n\nZhou Ze was trying to think of an excuse to refuse,\n\nbut at that very moment,\n\nthe middle-aged man who had been sitting there reading quietly suddenly stood up.\n\nHis breathing grew heavy,\n\nthe veins on his neck bulged,\n\nlike an animal in heat!\n\nZhou Ze slammed a hand onto his shoulder, pinning the man in place.\n\nAt the same time, he said to Bai Yingying, \"Get the money.\"\n\nBai Yingying took five thousand yuan from behind the counter and handed it to Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze took the money with one hand and gave it to his sister-in-law, adding a warning,\n\n\"You have to pay it back.\"\n\n\"I know.\"\n\nAfter taking the money, his sister-in-law's gaze wandered over to Bai Yingying. \"Who is she?\" she asked.\n\n\"A shop assistant. Your sister knows her,\" Zhou Ze explained.\n\n\"Oh, okay.\"\n\nWith the money in hand, his sister-in-law's tone softened. She grabbed her friend and they turned and left the bookstore.\n\nMeanwhile, the middle-aged man beside Zhou Ze made a move as if to chase after them, but Zhou Ze spun around and pressed him against the glass window with both hands.\n\nIf this guy hadn't suddenly gone crazy, why would Zhou Ze have given away the money so readily?\n\n\"A dog can't change its habit of eating shit, can it?\" Zhou Ze said in a low voice. \"I was still hesitating, but now there's nothing to hesitate about. I might as well send you back to Hell.\"\n\nThe middle-aged man continued to struggle.\n\n\"You won't cry until you see your own coffin, is that it?\" Zhou Ze laughed, exasperated. He pointed directly at the glass window in front of them. \"Take a good look at what kind of hat you're wearing.\"\n\nThe middle-aged man looked at the glass window. He saw his own \"reflection.\"\n\nIn the reflection,\n\nhe was wearing a tall hat.\n\nOn the hat were written four large black characters: \"A Beast in Human Clothing.\"\n\nThe middle-aged man froze completely.\n\nHe instantly stopped struggling,\n\nmurmuring to himself:\n\n\"A disgrace to the learned... a disgrace to the learned...\"",

    "content": "\"Yo, a beast in fine clothes?\"\n\nXu Qinglang had just been about to close up when he happened to see a \"customer\" in Zhou Ze's shop and came over to poke fun.\n\n\"Brother, your getup is pretty trendy.\"\n\nZhou Ze pointed a finger at the tall hat on the middle-aged man's head and said, \"What's the meaning of this?\"\n\n\"The verdict is in once the coffin is sealed, of course.\"\n\nXu Qinglang stretched languidly.\n\n\"It's like how emperors, empresses, and high-ranking ministers in ancient times would receive a posthumous title after they died. Or like how an elementary school student's end-of-term report card will have grades like 'Excellent,' 'Good,' 'Pass,' or 'Average'.\"\n\n\"So, this hat is the evaluation given to him by his social circle after he died?\"\n\n\"More or less. It also comes down to luck. Most people aren't famous after they die, so they don't get one of these. Even celebrities rarely do. In short, it depends on luck, just like how you were able to crawl out of hell while ninety-nine point nine percent of other ghosts have to go obediently to be reincarnated.\n\n\"Oh, right, I remember reading in a book that Qin Hui¹ also had a tall hat on his head after he died, with 'Framing the Loyal' written on it.\"\n\n\"Then would the hat on Yue Fei's² head say 'Serve the Country with Utmost Loyalty'?\"\n\n\"Bullshit. You get paraded through the streets wearing a tall hat as a punishment. Why would you need a hat for a good posthumous title?\"\n\nZhou Ze relaxed his hand, looked at his right palm, and prepared to open the Gates of Hell to toss this guy in. Just now, the sight of a young woman had sent this fellow into a frenzy like a bull in heat. He really was a beast in fine clothes, though he did look quite refined and scholarly.\n\n\"Are you going to send me down?\" the middle-aged man asked, seeming to have calmed down.\n\n\"What else?\" Zhou Ze retorted.\n\n\"Could you let me finish the last volume of this book?\" The middle-aged man took a piece of hell money out of his pocket.\n\n\"Heh, are you trying to shoo away a beggar?\" The female corpse at the side couldn't resist mocking him. \"Looks like you were a real failure in life. Even your relatives didn't burn much incense for you.\"\n\nHell money offered by a dead person was different from hell money burned by the living. Of course, the amount of hell money a dead person had was somewhat related to the offerings from their relatives, but there were limits. Otherwise, couldn't you just burn offerings like crazy and create the richest man in the underworld?\n\nThe middle-aged man pursed his lips and looked at Zhou Ze with a pleading gaze. \"I'm begging you.\"\n\nXu Qinglang lit a cigarette nearby and said nothing. This was Zhou Ze's business; it wasn't his place to interfere.\n\nZhou Ze glanced at the book in the middle-aged man's hand, *An Outline of National Studies*, and said, \"I've read this book before. In my opinion, it has several obvious errors.\"\n\n\"Any book with academic research value will have its own errors. Errors are also the accumulation of our predecessors' work,\" the middle-aged man said seriously.\n\n\"But what's the point of a book that's all praise?\" Zhou Ze shot back.\n\n\"In a letter from Zeng Guofan to Zeng Jize, there's a line: 'One should not rashly criticize the ancients.' Boss, although you run a bookstore, you are not a man of letters, after all.\n\n\"Mr. Qian Mu wrote this book against the backdrop of the War of Resistance. When he wrote it, he had already prepared for the worst-case scenario: the fall of our nation. He wrote this book with the thought that if the country truly fell one day, someone could still rely on it to quietly read late at night, to savor the civilization and heritage of our ancestors.\n\n\"Books of criticism and satire are naturally more thrilling to read, but if the nation were to truly fall one day, and someone came across a book full of only ridicule and criticism, who would still feel any sentiment for their old country, for China?\"\n\nThe middle-aged man spoke eloquently, gesturing constantly with one hand while holding the book in the other.\n\nHe was like a teacher on a podium, explaining his reasoning to his students.\n\nVery passionate, and very absorbed.\n\n\"You were a teacher, weren't you?\" Xu Qinglang asked with a smile. \"Oh, I mean when you were alive.\"\n\n\"I was a middle school Chinese teacher,\" the middle-aged man replied.\n\n\"A beast in fine clothes, as expected.\" Xu Qinglang snorted. \"I'm going to bed. Good night, Boss Zhou.\"\n\nXu Qinglang waved and left the bookstore, his swaying figure quite graceful.\n\nZhou Ze turned his head to look at Bai Yingying. \"His silhouette just now as he walked away, didn't it look a lot like a pimp from a brothel in your era?\"\n\n\"My era?\" Bai Yingying thought very seriously, then shook her head and said, \"Even the top courtesans weren't as beautiful as him.\"\n\nZhou Ze pursed his lips, not particularly surprised by Bai Yingying's answer.\n\nThe middle-aged man sat down again to read, seemingly not caring whether Zhou Ze had agreed or not. Reading a little more was what mattered most; perhaps he could savor it a while longer on the road to the underworld.\n\nThinking about this guy's earlier agitation at the sight of a young woman, Zhou Ze felt agitated for him.\n\n\"Boss, I think he seems quite learned,\" the female corpse said in a low voice.\n\n\"The poor scholar your mistress used to fool around with was also quite learned, wasn't he?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nBai Yingying nodded.\n\n\"It's hard to say.\" Zhou Ze also found it difficult to quantify. He could only say, \"Mr. Ji Xianlin wrote in his diary, 'I have no other hope in this life, I only hope to be able to fuck more women, to have contact with women from all different places.'\"\n\n\"Scholars really are all lechers,\" Bai Yingying muttered.\n\n\"All men are lechers,\" Zhou Ze corrected.\n\nBai Yingying looked at Zhou Ze and said coquettishly, \"But Boss, you have so much self-control.\"\n\n\"Go scrub the toilet in the bathroom.\"\n\n\"...\" Bai Yingying was speechless.\n\nFor some reason, Zhou Ze wasn't in a hurry to open the Gates of Hell and throw the middle-aged man in. Instead, he sat down opposite him, took out his phone, and idly browsed the web.\n\n\"What's your name?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nThe other man didn't answer, seemingly immersed in the atmosphere of reading.\n\n\"If you don't answer, you don't get to read.\"\n\n\"Ren Xindu.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded. Just as he was about to try searching the guy's name to see if he could find any old scandals, the bookstore door was pushed open again.\n\nHis sister-in-law had come back.\n\n\"What are you back for?\" Zhou Ze stood up and instinctively reached out to press down on the middle-aged man's shoulder, afraid the guy would go into heat again.\n\nHowever, to Zhou Ze's surprise, the middle-aged man remained seated, reading quietly, showing no signs of agitation at all.\n\nHuh, he's learned his lesson this time?\n\nThe sister-in-law took out her phone, took a picture of the bookstore and Zhou Ze, sent it, and then turned on voice message:\n\n\"Sis, I told you I was at Xu Le Bookstore reading all afternoon, and you wouldn't believe me.\n\n\"Okay, okay, I'm heading back now, I'll be right back, okay?\n\n\"Geez, I just want to read a book in peace and you have to bother me.\"\n\nAfter sending the voice message, the sister-in-law stuck out her tongue, let out a long sigh of relief, and said:\n\n\"That was close. Good thing I hadn't hailed a cab yet, or my cover would've been blown.\"\n\n\"You're still young. Don't go to those shady places. It's easy to get taken advantage of.\"\n\nZhou Ze still gave her a word of advice. Even if she wasn't his sister-in-law, it was purely a middle-aged uncle's guidance to a younger person.\n\n\"Alright, alright, Xu Le, how come you're starting to sound just like my sister?\" The sister-in-law clearly wasn't listening.\n\n\"What about that girl?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"She went home. I just watched her get a cab. She lives pretty far away. I was about to get a cab too when my sister happened to message me to check up on what I was doing.\"\n\n\"What about the money?\"\n\n\"I gave her the money to take back, of course.\" The sister-in-law said nonchalantly, \"Don't worry, it's just five thousand yuan. I'll pay you back when I get my allowance.\"\n\n\"You'll pay me back?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Yeah, who else? Her?\n\n\"Her father is paralyzed at home, and her mother runs a breakfast stall. Life's really tough for them. I don't want to see her suffer through part-time jobs anymore.\n\n\"Also, she was molested by her homeroom teacher in middle school, that's why she's so quiet and withdrawn now.\n\n\"I consider her my best friend, so of course I have to take extra care of her, right?\n\n\"Alright, Xu Le, that's all for today. I'm heading back.\"\n\nThe sister-in-law waved, pushed open the bookstore door, and left.\n\nZhou Ze sat back down in his chair, looking from his phone to the middle-aged man who was engrossed in his book.\n\nThen he muttered to himself:\n\n\"Molested a student in his own class, and after being found out, he jumped off a building and killed himself.\"\n\nThe middle-aged man continued to read as if he hadn't heard a thing, but his tall hat was so clear, and so jarring.\n\nIn ancient times, criminals had to be tattooed on the face to mark their identity, branding them as lower-class citizens. The tall hat before him served a similar purpose.\n\nBai Yingying worked quickly. She couldn't help it; she was originally a young lady from a wealthy family, but now she had no choice but to bow her head under someone else's roof. Plus, Zhou Ze was a bit of a clean freak, which undoubtedly increased her workload.\n\n\"Boss, I'm exhausted.\"\n\nBai Yingying took off her jacket. The cold didn't bother her; she came out wearing just a short-sleeved shirt, holding a rag.\n\nShe looked very young, but she was quite well-developed.\n\n\"Boss, why doesn't he react when he sees me?\" Bai Yingying asked, puzzled.\n\n\"You're a dead person.\"\n\n\"But I'm also very pretty,\" Bai Yingying said, striking a seductive pose.\n\n\"Give it a rest. You're so cold down there, any man who went in would probably freeze solid and be eternally erect. Wouldn't even need Viagra.\"\n\n\"I've never met a boss as mean as you,\" Bai Yingying rolled her eyes at Zhou Ze. \"By the way, did your sister-in-law come back just now? I heard her voice from the bathroom.\"\n\n\"Yeah, she came back and left again.\"\n\nZhou Ze suddenly thought of something.\n\nThat's not right.\n\nIf this middle-aged man didn't react to Bai Yingying because she was a zombie,\n\nthen why didn't he react to his sister-in-law just now?\n\nBy process of elimination, it was easy to arrive at an answer:\n\nThis guy was only interested in the girl who was with his sister-in-law.\n\nThe news reports online protected the victim's privacy, so there were no photos.\n\nSome things...\n\ndon't bear thinking about,\n\nor dwelling on.\n\nSlowly,\n\nZhou Ze started to piece it together.\n\nHis sister-in-law seemed feisty, but she was actually incredibly naive, like a big dummy.\n\n\"Hey, was that girl your student?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nThe middle-aged man continued to read, not answering.\n\nZhou Ze reached out and snatched the book from his hand. \"I'm asking you a question.\"\n\nThe middle-aged man looked up at Zhou Ze, then nodded.\n\n\"Did you actually molest her or not?\" Zhou Ze asked again.\n\nThe middle-aged man still didn't answer.\n\n\"If you don't answer properly, I'll send you to hell right now,\" Zhou Ze threatened.\n\n\"I've finished the book. I'm ready to go.\" The middle-aged man stood up, looking remarkably composed.\n\n\"Are you trying to be Wen Tianxiang³?\" Zhou Ze said sarcastically.\n\n\"No matter what she's like, she was still my student. It's my responsibility for failing to educate her properly,\" the middle-aged man replied.\n\n\"Meaning the news report I just read was fake? You didn't molest her, she intentionally threw mud at you to get compensation from the school?\" Zhou Ze pursed his lips.\n\nThen the situation was easy to figure out. The girl probably stole his sister-in-law's wallet, cooked up a story, and then got another five thousand yuan out of her.\n\nWould a girl from a poor family who worked all winter break carry five thousand yuan of tuition money on her to go party at a disco?\n\nHis sister-in-law had fallen into a trap.\n\n\"Tell me, did you molest her or not?\" Zhou Ze grabbed the middle-aged man's shoulder and asked very seriously.\n\nThe middle-aged man was silent for a moment, then said, \"This is my business. It has nothing to do with you.\"\n\n\"To hell with you! That was my five thousand yuan!\"\n\nZhou Ze really wanted to slap him across the face, but he held back. He raised his hand and swung it at the man's hat. But when his hand hit the hat, Zhou Ze felt a searing pain in his palm.\n\nThis hat...\n\nwas so hard.\n\nIt actually caused a sharp pain around his fingernails.\n\nAnd looking again, even as the man was sent flying, the hat remained firmly rooted on his head.\n\nZhou Ze thought of what Xu Qinglang had said earlier: *Public clamor can melt metal.*⁴\n\nThis hat...\n\nregardless of the truth,\n\ncould not be taken off.\n\n***\n\n**Footnotes:**\n\n1.  **Qin Hui (秦檜):** A notorious chancellor of the Song dynasty, widely regarded in Chinese history as a traitor for his role in persecuting and executing the patriotic general Yue Fei.\n2.  **Yue Fei (岳飛):** A celebrated military general of the Southern Song dynasty, a symbol of loyalty and patriotism in Chinese culture.

    "content": "\"Mom, I'm home.\"\n\nThe girl pushed open the door and called out. From the inner room came the sound of her parents arguing.\n\nWhether she was home or not, or whether she had eaten dinner, was of no importance to her parents.\n\nHer father was paralyzed and bedridden. Although he could move a little, he couldn't do anything besides barely managing to use the chamber pot on his own.\n\nHer mother had to go out every day to run a breakfast stall, working from dawn till dusk.\n\nBy all rights, their family's atmosphere should have been like those depicted in so many TV reports and newspaper articles:\n\nPoor but resilient,\n\nyet not without the warmth and harmony of a family.\n\nAnd she, by all rights, should have been a good student, making her parents proud.\n\nBut perhaps such fairytale stories are the exception, not the rule.\n\nHer own family was vastly different from the similar stories she had read before.\n\nHer father, paralyzed at home, had failed to use the time to improve his character. He was irascible, especially toward her mother, who worked outside every day. He often berated her, accusing her of having a man on the side, a paramour.\n\nHe called her shameless, a bitch.¹\n\nHer mother would argue back every time, and then her father would throw things and roar.\n\nThe rest of this man's life's strength was probably all spent on cursing people from his bed.\n\nAnd yet, she couldn't bring herself to fully sympathize with her mother. The little trinkets and some of the clothes her mother occasionally came home with were clearly not styles her mother would buy for herself.\n\nAnd once, when she and her boyfriend were at a hotel, she ran into her mother—who was supposed to be buying ingredients—entering the same hotel with another man.\n\nThe two parties had nearly walked into the same elevator. If she hadn't reacted quickly and told her boyfriend she needed to use the restroom first, an incredibly awkward scene might have unfolded.\n\nThis was a broken family.\n\nIt looked precarious, and in fact, it was leaking from all sides.\n\nShe didn't know why her mother didn't divorce her father. She also didn't know why her father, a man lying in bed who had lost the ability to work and earn money, who couldn't even do chores, didn't have a shred of self-awareness.\n\nIn short,\n\nshe habitually used her key to open the door,\n\nhabitually heard her parents arguing,\n\nhabitually walked into her small room in the attic,\n\nhabitually poured herself a glass of cooled boiled water,\n\nhabitually opened her latest model Apple laptop,\n\nhabitually took out the gentle makeup remover she had just bought,\n\nhabitually opened a video from her favorite makeup blogger,\n\nand habitually logged into Zhihu.²\n\nThis was her life, her current rhythm.\n\nThe college entrance exams were already a distant, unreachable dream for her. Her grades were too poor, so poor that she had given up all hope.\n\nShe had some regrets.\n\nShe regretted that back in middle school, just for the sake of a few tens of thousands of yuan, she had claimed her homeroom teacher assaulted her.\n\nAt the time, her mother was agitated, her father was agitated. After she told them, her mother stopped running the stall for several days, called over a few relatives, and carried her paralyzed father on a stretcher to the school gate.\n\nThe couple wept in each other's arms.\n\nA truly tragic, miserable scene.\n\nReporters, hearing the news, came like sharks that had smelled blood.\n\nMoral failings, a lack of humanity—\n\nthese were often the hot topics reporters loved most because they weren't politically sensitive, carried extremely low risk, yet could generate an immense amount of buzz.\n\nIn short,\n\nthe direction the incident took was something she hadn't expected at all.\n\nAt first, she had just wanted a little more pocket money to buy clothes.\n\nHer homeroom teacher, who also taught Chinese literature, knew about her family's situation and had helped her out financially before. He would even pay some of her school fees for her in advance.\n\nOccasionally, Teacher Ren's mother would also invite her over for dinner.\n\nTeacher Ren wasn't married yet.\n\nCoupled with the fact that she often went to his office and his home,\n\nit certainly gave many people fodder for baseless rumors.\n\nGossip and rumors had been around even before she made her accusation, but at the time, she didn't care.\n\nAlthough, she had heard them.\n\nAfter the teacher caught her coming out of a bar she had snuck into one night, he became cold toward her. He seemed very disappointed in her.\n\nHis mother no longer invited her over for dinner.\n\nHe even stopped paying her school fees in advance.\n\nHe no longer helped her out financially.\n\nThis made her furious.\n\nSo she used the threat of being assaulted to demand money from him. She needed money. The lipsticks she coveted, the clothes she coveted, the items she saw from online personal shoppers—she needed money to buy them.\n\nBut the teacher refused her, even when she threatened to expose the matter.\n\nEven now, she still felt that her middle school homeroom teacher was truly a man of letters.\n\nBack then, he had even pounded the desk and rebuked her, \"Justice resides in the hearts of the people.\"\n\nHowever,\n\nwas that really the case?\n\nAfter the story broke,\n\nhe was immediately suspended by the school.\n\nThe immense pressure from public opinion eventually caused him to break down.\n\nHe fought back angrily.\n\nHe posted long, rambling rebuttals online,\n\nfull of archaic classical phrases.³\n\nEven though she was just a middle school student at the time, just a slacker, she could see that her teacher's rebuttals were pale and powerless.\n\nAlthough they seemed to ring with conviction, filled with a righteous spirit, unafraid of rumors.\n\nBut in the eyes of outsiders, it was just stubborn denial, self-righteousness, trying to muddle through by relying on his status as a teacher.\n\nThe teacher had taught Chinese his whole life, taught batch after batch of students how to write good essays, but his own \"essay\" was poorly written.\n\nWhat the public and the media wanted to see was not his style of writing. And his resounding counterattack, laced with \"Lu Xun-esque\"⁴ sarcasm, only further provoked the nerves of public opinion.\n\n*What?*\n\n*We're all wrong?*\n\n*You're the only one who's right?*\n\n*Impossible.*\n\nAnd then came an even more intense backlash.\n\nNowadays, when a celebrity gets caught in a scandal, they immediately hire a PR firm to manage the situation and smooth things over.\n\nIf just reasoning and presenting facts were enough, if things were really that simple,\n\nthen most PR firms today would starve.\n\nThen, another piece of information was dug up: the teacher had an uncle who was a section chief in the local education bureau.\n\nA very minor section chief, over fifty, who was a stickler for rules and a bit of an old pedant who enjoyed studying philosophy. As a result, his interpersonal skills were poor, and at fifty, he had no chance of further promotion.\n\nBut for this news, the public only needed a one-line headline: *Background of Beast Teacher Revealed!*\n\nEverything completely blew up.\n\nPeople reveled in venting their \"anger,\" feeling they were fighting against dark forces and the powerful elite.\n\nThe media feasted on the traffic and exposure.\n\nIt was a gluttonous feast she had set in motion.\n\nIn the end, it concluded with the teacher taking a leap from the top of the school building.\n\nAnd the tens of thousands of yuan the school had paid her family in compensation at the beginning—in order to quell the matter and restore normal teaching—served to put the final nail in the coffin for the incident.\n\nIf you weren't guilty,\n\nwhy would you pay?\n\nRight.\n\nAfter learning of the teacher's death,\n\nshe was in agony for one night, and then regretful for a month.\n\nAgony for one night, because she still had a conscience.\n\nRegretful for a month, because she realized that if she had waited until college to pull a stunt like this, she could have profited much more—for example, a recommendation for graduate school, or a larger settlement.\n\nShe took out a wallet from her pocket. It belonged to a girl named Lin Yi, her classmate.\n\nThere was a lot of cash inside, and many VIP cards.\n\nA mocking smile touched the corners of her lips. *Heh, rich people.*\n\n*Rich bitch.*\n\nShe took the five thousand yuan from her own pocket⁵ and put it in her small, locked drawer. She felt today's haul was pretty good. In fact, she had received many donations after the incident, all of which she had split with her parents.\n\nAfter removing her makeup and washing her hair,\n\nshe opened the webpage again,\n\nand logged into Zhihu.\n\nToday, she was going to write about her day.\n\nFor example, how she had a brother-in-law who owned a bookstore, a sister who was a doctor, and a father who ran a pharmaceutical company and had once been a hospital director.\n\nShe wrote that today, a classmate who had been assaulted by a teacher but was actually a \"green tea bitch\"⁶ had lost her wallet. She felt contempt for her, but still got five thousand yuan from her brother-in-law to give to her.\n\nBecause five thousand yuan, to her, was just a fraction of her monthly allowance.\n\nJust consider it pity for this green tea bitch.\n\nShe had a large number of fans who followed her updates. As soon as she posted, many people would reply and like it. She liked this feeling. Here, she had found a new life for herself.\n\nSometimes, she even had trouble distinguishing the virtual world of the internet from the reality of her life.\n\nShe felt like she *was* Lin Yi.\n\nOf course, some people would mock her, saying she looked down on the poor just because she had money and a good family, that she was a snob.\n\nShe would calmly reply: *Who care?*\n\nShe closed her laptop, ready to rest. Staying up late was a woman's greatest enemy. She needed to take good care of herself. Her physical appearance, it seemed, was the only thing of real value her parents had given her.\n\nShe went to the bathroom to wash up.\n\nHer parents' argument was still going on. Her father was smashing a cup, cursing her mother. Her mother cursed back that he was a good-for-nothing and asked why he didn't just die already.\n\nGo find a car on the road, lie down underneath it, and get the family a compensation payout. That would be him finally fulfilling his responsibility as a man.\n\nShe listened and smiled to herself.\n\nAfter washing up, she returned to her bedroom.\n\nShe opened the door,\n\nonly to find someone sitting on her bed.\n\nA man.\n\nThe man was smoking.\n\nHe flicked the ash into the cap of a skincare product she had just bought.\n\nFor a moment, she didn't know how to face this man.\n\nHer laptop, which she had closed, had been reopened by him.\n\nThe man was reading her reply on Zhihu.\n\nSilence.\n\nIt lasted for about three minutes.\n\nShe finally asked, her voice trembling, \"What are you here for?\"\n\nShe recognized him. She had just seen him. He was Lin Yi's brother-in-law, the one who owned the bookstore.\n\nZhou Ze stubbed out the cigarette in her skincare product.\n\nHer mouth twitched. That one was very expensive. She'd bought it after spending a night with an old man.\n\nZhou Ze looked at her with a faint, unreadable smile.\n\nThen he said, very seriously:\n\n\"Give back the money.\"\n\n***\n\n**Footnotes:**\n1.  **Bitch (J貨):** The original text uses \"J貨,\" a censored version of 賤貨 (jiànhuò), a vulgar term meaning \"bitch\" or \"whore.\"\n2.  **Zhihu (知乎):** A popular Chinese Q&A website, similar to Quora.\n3.  **Archaic classical phrases (之乎者也):** The text uses \"zhi, hu, zhe, ye,\" which are grammatical particles from Classical Chinese. It implies the teacher's writing style was overly formal, academic, and out of touch with modern readers.\n4.  **Lu Xun (魯迅):** A celebrated Chinese writer (1881-1936) known for his sharp, critical, and often satirical style.\n5.  **Pocket (兜里):** This refers to the pocket of the stolen wallet, not her own clothing pocket.

    "content": "屋子裡，女孩沒說話，周澤則是慢悠悠地點了第二根煙，然後又拿出女孩的一盒粉底，扭開蓋子，看來是打算繼續當菸灰缸用。\n\n\n\n  當然，外面女孩父母的吵架聲還在繼續，女孩母親開始哭起來，說男人沒良心，隨後男人也開始哭起來，說女人變了。\n\n\n\n  女孩慢慢地抬起頭，看著周澤：\n\n\n\n  「大哥哥，我不知道你這是什麼意思，我和林憶是好朋友，你是她的姐夫，那我們應該……」\n\n\n\n  「嗡！」\n\n\n\n  周澤從口袋裡取出了一把匕首，倒刺在了女孩書桌上。\n\n\n\n  這是女屍的陪葬品之一，說削鐵如泥，誇張了，但確實很鋒銳。\n\n\n\n  周澤不想在面對普通人時也跟梅超風一樣玩「九陰白骨爪」，因為那意味著很多的麻煩，而周澤，最怕麻煩。\n\n\n\n  一把匕首，\n\n\n\n  一聲「嗡」響，\n\n\n\n  賽過了千言萬語。\n\n\n\n  女孩的臉色開始慢慢地變化。\n\n\n\n  周澤原本以為，事情也應該了了，他來，只是想拿回自己給出的錢，另外把傻妞小姨子的錢包拿回去。\n\n\n\n  他沒想過多的節外生枝，哪怕他也覺得，這個女孩兒出門直接被車撞死似乎是最好的結局。 \n\n\n\n  蓉城那位的前車之鑑還在，\n\n\n\n  周澤懶得去搞什麼法律外的懲罰，\n\n\n\n  他沒那麼閒，也沒那種情操。\n\n\n\n  他只要錢，因為他窮。\n\n\n\n  有時候，生活真的需要很大的勇氣，尤其是當周澤環顧四周時，\n\n\n\n  自己的老婆很有錢，買自己房子當紀念品，開著卡宴，自己小姨子也很有錢，五千塊無非是一個月零花錢的一部分。\n\n\n\n  許清朗有二十幾套房，\n\n\n\n  白鶯鶯還有陪葬品，\n\n\n\n  自己身邊都是有錢人，但就自己錢磨子壓手。\n\n\n\n  然而，周澤還是低估了這個女孩兒。\n\n\n\n  一個早就步入社會，早就經歷了「錘鍊」的女孩兒，在這個時候，所表現出來的冷靜，\n\n\n\n  幾乎可以讓人膽寒。\n\n\n\n  女孩兒解開了自己的衣服扣子，\n\n\n\n  只剩下一套內衣，\n\n\n\n  但接下來，\n\n\n\n  她卻連內衣都準備解開。\n\n\n\n  「你是要殺人麼？」女孩兒嘴角露出了一抹笑容，眼神里，也不見了驚慌，反而很深邃，深邃得讓人有些不可思議。\n\n\n\n  「你來殺吧。」 \n\n\n\n  女孩兒主動向周澤走了一步，\n\n\n\n  「我父親癱瘓在床，他沒能力阻止你。\n\n\n\n  我和我母親都是女人，也打不過你。\n\n\n\n  你來殺吧，\n\n\n\n  殺了我們全家。」\n\n\n\n  女孩兒走到了周澤面前，聲音平緩。\n\n\n\n  周澤側著頭，看著女孩，順帶欣賞著對方的身體。\n\n\n\n  只是，\n\n\n\n  的確是有些頭痛啊。\n\n\n\n  這位，\n\n\n\n  生冷不忌的樣子。\n\n\n\n  而且，\n\n\n\n  她似乎篤定自己不想殺人。\n\n\n\n  周澤有些後悔了，早知道應該讓白鶯鶯上來，讓女人來對付女人，似乎是最合適的方式。\n\n\n\n  「又或者，我現在喊一嗓子，就說你非法入室打算強、、、、奸。」女孩兒低下頭，讓自己年輕的臉湊到周澤面前。\n\n\n\n  「然後，我父母會聽到我的聲音過來，鄰居們也會來，也會有人報警，你就會身敗名裂。」\n\n\n\n  周澤笑了笑，道：「是不是這次我不光討不回我的錢，還得另外再給你錢消災？」\n\n\n\n  「你不缺錢吧？」女孩微微抬起下顎，她下顎圓潤，鎖骨也很精緻，連那眼睫毛，都帶著些年輕女孩迷人的姿態，「林家，很有錢的。」 \n\n\n\n  但我窮啊。\n\n\n\n  周澤有些無奈地嘆了口氣。\n\n\n\n  「一千塊，我陪你睡一次。」女孩盯著周澤，伸出舌頭舔了舔自己的嘴唇，「就在這裡，就在我家，就在我父母房間的隔壁，怎麼樣？」\n\n\n\n  周澤感知到一種老司機的氣息撲面而來，\n\n\n\n  羞愧，\n\n\n\n  萬分羞愧，\n\n\n\n  有了上次的三過家門而不入之後，\n\n\n\n  周澤覺得眼前這個女孩經驗豐富到足以引領自己入門。\n\n\n\n  只是她的皮囊很好看，\n\n\n\n  但內在，\n\n\n\n  卻有些陰毒。\n\n\n\n  「當初你的老師，也是這樣被你逼死的麼？」周澤問道。\n\n\n\n  女孩愣了一下，微微皺眉，有些驚訝於周澤為什麼會知道這件事。\n\n\n\n  「他對你不錯，還經常接濟你，還請家裡不方便的你去他家吃飯，他沒碰過你，你卻誣陷說他侵犯了你。」\n\n\n\n  「我對不起他。」女孩聳聳肩，「他確實沒碰過我，但我真的沒想到他會傻到直接跳樓自殺。我當時只是想要學校賠一點錢而已。」\n\n\n\n  「你父母，也知道吧。」周澤問道。\n\n\n\n  「當然。」女孩微微一笑，站直了身子，看著周澤，「你怎麼知道這些的。」 \n\n\n\n  「你這樣做，是不對的。」周澤很認真地說道。\n\n\n\n  手微微抬起來，模仿起了書店裡看書的中年男子說話的架勢：\n\n\n\n  「他對得起自己的良心，也對得起自己的職業道德，而這些，都是他最看重的東西，你卻把它們都毀了。」\n\n\n\n  「你是來說教的？」女孩有些不能理解周遭的腦迴路。\n\n\n\n  自己衣服都脫了，就剩他親自解開自己最後的扣子了，結果眼前的這個男人，卻在這裡和自己上課。\n\n\n\n  她以前倒是遇到過一個客人，是一個好為人師的教授，出手也很大方，做事兒前還教育她應該好好學習，不應該做這個，女孩要自重，諄諄教導她。\n\n\n\n  然後那個教授一晚上要了自己七次。\n\n\n\n  這種人最虛偽了，明明打算解開皮帶了，卻依舊要跟你裝一下正人君子。\n\n\n\n  「你應該給你老師證名，他是被誣陷的。」周澤說道。\n\n\n\n  「憑什麼？」\n\n\n\n  女孩後退兩步，將衣服穿起來，她知道了，眼前的這個男人對自己並不感興趣。\n\n\n\n  「憑良心，做人的良心。」\n\n\n\n  「做人的良心？」女孩攤了攤手，故作調侃道：「我沒想當人啊，如果有的選，我想當鬼的。」 \n\n\n\n  「哦，是麼。」\n\n\n\n  周澤慢慢地站起來，\n\n\n\n  雙手負於身後，指甲已經完全長出來，\n\n\n\n  同時，周澤的眼眸里開始有黑色的光圈流淌，整個人的氣質也瞬間改變。\n\n\n\n  當初，性子大大咧咧的小姨子見到這樣子的自己，嚇得直接尿失禁。\n\n\n\n  而眼前的女孩也是臉色驟然一變，「噗通」一聲坐倒在了地上，手指著周澤，害怕得說不出話來。\n\n\n\n  「你……你是人是鬼……」\n\n\n\n  周澤從抽屜里取出了五千塊錢，還有小姨子的錢包，放入自己口袋裡。\n\n\n\n  至於裡面的其他東西，他沒興趣。\n\n\n\n  他只是回來取走自己被騙的錢，\n\n\n\n  合理合法。\n\n\n\n  其他的事兒，他不想去做。\n\n\n\n  離開時，周澤彎下腰，伸手提起女孩的下巴，很認真地對她道：\n\n\n\n  「我多麼希望你現在是一隻鬼，那樣的話，我會讓你連投胎的機會，都沒有。」\n\n\n\n  說完，周澤離開了這個烏煙瘴氣的家。\n\n\n\n  而女孩，則一直癱坐在那裡，身體不停打著擺子。\n\n\n\n  ………… \n\n\n\n  走到外面，白鶯鶯在那裡等著，她在嚼著口香糖，當周澤出來時，她主動剝開一片口香糖討好似地送入周澤嘴裡。\n\n\n\n  「老闆，錢拿回來了？」\n\n\n\n  周澤點點頭。\n\n\n\n  「那女的呢？」白鶯鶯不在乎錢，這點小錢，她隨便拿自己陪葬品賣一件都不止了，她只是關心那個女孩的下場。\n\n\n\n  當初自己的老闆可是把自己虐得很慘，所以她很期待自己老闆如何料理那女孩的。\n\n\n\n  「在家啊。」周澤開始準備打車。\n\n\n\n  「在家？死在家裡了？」白鶯鶯問道。\n\n\n\n  「我沒對她怎麼樣。」周澤回答道。\n\n\n\n  「為什麼啊！」白鶯鶯很不解，「那種女人，就該受到懲罰。」\n\n\n\n  「那也不是我應該做的事。」周澤很平和地說道。\n\n\n\n  「老闆，你好慫唉。」\n\n\n\n  「人家老師都對我說不關我的事了，我幹嘛要自找麻煩？」\n\n\n\n  說著，周澤伸手指了指四周的花圃草叢，繼續道：\n\n\n\n  「再說了，這裡面不知道藏了多少雙通紅的眼睛，等著我犯錯呢。」\n\n\n\n  蓉城的那位到底日後如何，周澤不清楚，也不確定，小蘿莉可能聯合了其他鬼差一起去圍剿他了，甚至連黃泉路邊的無面女也被放出來參與這次行動。 \n\n\n\n  當然，因為自己在夢中欠了對方一個人情的原因，周澤希望那位能夠安然度過這次事兒。\n\n\n\n  但是，讓自己去學他一樣直接做判官，他做不到。\n\n\n\n  前世他是一個醫生，只會救人，可不會殺人。\n\n\n\n  打車回到了店裡，一路上，白鶯鶯一句話都不說，顯然，她對周澤的消極應對很不滿意。\n\n\n\n  回到書店時，周澤看見那個中年男子仍然坐在那裡看書，他沒跑，哪怕周澤說要把他送入地獄，他也依舊沒跑。\n\n\n\n  「幫我倒杯水。」周澤對白鶯鶯道。\n\n\n\n  「我累了，去休息。」白鶯鶯哼了一聲，直接在櫃檯後面坐了下來。\n\n\n\n  周澤沒說什麼，在中年男子面前坐了下來。\n\n\n\n  「你家裡還有什麼人麼？」\n\n\n\n  中年男子聞言，抬起頭，「父母都已經過世，只有一個姐姐。」\n\n\n\n  「你姐姐聯繫方式告訴我，或者告訴我住址。」\n\n\n\n  周澤拿出了手機，點開了一個視頻，聲音從裡面傳出：\n\n\n\n  「又或者，我現在喊一嗓子，就說你非法入室打算強、、、、奸。然後，我父母會聽到我的聲音過來，鄰居們也會來，也會有人報警，你就會身敗名裂…………」\n\n\n\n  手機視頻里錄製了當時的情景。 \n\n\n\n  中年男子嘴唇微張，有些激動，也有些彷徨，然後戰戰兢兢道：\n\n\n\n  「這個公布出去，會毀了她的人生的。」\n\n\n\n  「那麼，誰來給你的人生負責？以及，被你牽連的學校和你的親戚婦人之仁？」周澤很不客氣道，「以及，對教師這個職業名譽負責。」\n\n\n\n  中年男子面露掙扎之色，然後點了點頭，「好吧，我把我姐姐地址告訴你。」\n\n\n\n  在中年男子說出了地址之後，他的身體開始慢慢的虛化，慢慢地像是融入了地下。\n\n\n\n  書看完了，\n\n\n\n  執念也了結了，\n\n\n\n  他不需要周澤強制送，自己就步入地獄去了。\n\n\n\n  真正的讀書人，走得灑脫。\n\n\n\n  周澤把視頻發給了白鶯鶯，白鶯鶯有些驚喜道：「老闆，只要他姐姐把這段視頻交給警方，他走在黃泉路上時應該就不用戴帽子了吧？」\n\n\n\n  「呵……」周澤笑了一聲，「帽子，摘不掉了。」\n\n\n\n  「怎麼會呢？這件事反轉了呀。」白鶯鶯有些不理解，「公道自在人心。」\n\n\n\n  「通常來說，在網上一名消防員戰士殉職的新聞點擊和討論量遠遠比不過一條寵物狗被虐殺的新聞。」\n\n\n\n  「這是什麼意思？」白鶯鶯顯然有些不了解，她剛接觸網絡才只會玩一些單機遊戲。 \n\n\n\n  「你知道，人們對一件事的關注度取決於什麼麼？」\n\n\n\n  「比如這件事麼？肯定是事情的真相啊。」\n\n\n\n  「不，人們只關心他們所看見的『真相』是否有趣。」\n\n\n\n  周澤伸手指了指頭頂，\n\n\n\n  「當初給他戴上那頂帽子的人，其中能有多少會看見闢謠反轉的消息尚且不得而知，哪怕其中有一小部分人看見了，你猜他們會有什麼反應？」\n\n\n\n  「羞愧，難受？」\n\n\n\n  「如果是面對面做錯了事被別人當面批評了，正常人都會愧疚和難受。」\n\n\n\n  「那不就對了麼？」\n\n\n\n  「但隔著一個屏幕的話，大部分人通常只會有一種反應。」\n\n\n\n  「什麼反應？」\n\n\n\n  「哦。」\n\n\n\n  「哦？」白鶯鶯不理解，追問道：「然後呢？」\n\n\n\n  「然後該幹嘛幹嘛。」",

    "content": "The sister-in-law's wallet was sent back to her by Zhou Ze in an anonymous package.\n\nWell,\n\nThe postage was cash on delivery.\n\nThe two thousand yuan originally inside had been pocketed by Zhou Ze. Anyway, that girl had plenty of allowance, so he just considered it his fee for the trouble of finding her wallet. Zhou Ze felt his fee was very reasonable.\n\nThen, the next day, Zhou Ze saw his sister-in-law post on her Moments:\n\n\"This thief has such good professional ethics. He stole my money but mailed my cards and ID back to me. There really are more good people in this world.\"\n\nZhou Ze read the post and fell silent for a moment.\n\nNever mind. It's better for the silly girl to stay silly. Ignorance is bliss.\n\nBai Yingying secretly delivered the USB drive, containing the video with its beginning and end trimmed off, to the middle-aged man's sister's home. His sister went to the police station to file a report that very day, and a few days later, the local police's official Weibo account also published the news.\n\nThis incident caused quite a stir, with many people denouncing the female student's shamelessness and heartlessness. However, the buzz it generated was nothing compared to when the incident first broke.\n\nMoreover, the people scolding the female student now had probably also called the teacher a \"wolf in sheep's clothing\" back then.\n\nIn any case, several days passed by peacefully. Business remained slow as usual. Bai Yingying became even more engrossed in the internet, progressing at lightning speed. She also started getting into online games, spending long stretches of time just reading dungeon guides.\n\nA classic case of an internet-addicted girl.\n\nAt dusk, he had dinner at Xu Qinglang's place as usual, accompanied by Xu Qinglang's newly developed strawberry juice.\n\nZhou Ze felt that he was gradually starting to be able to taste some flavor in his food.\n\nAfter the meal, Zhou Ze and Xu Qinglang each had a cigarette, as was their custom.\n\nXu Qinglang held his phone, leisurely scrolling through Weibo.\n\nZhou Ze noticed that Xu Qinglang's restaurant had been getting quieter and quieter lately, with fewer and fewer delivery drivers coming and going. Of course, this wasn't due to a business downturn or a decline in the restaurant's reputation; it was simply because the man in front of him was getting lazier and lazier.\n\nBut according to Xu Qinglang, the problem lay with Zhou Ze.\n\nHe himself was busting his ass from dawn till dusk, while the guy next door just sat in his bookstore without moving a muscle. How could he possibly feel balanced about that?\n\nCome on, he was a man with over twenty properties!\n\nWhy was he living less comfortably than the poor devil next door?\n\nSo, he decided he should also live well when he could, enjoy what he could, and rest when he could.\n\nHe's become decadent.\n\nZhou Ze sighed internally.\n\n\"Hey, there have been a lot of strange things happening in the East District recently,\" Xu Qinglang said, exhaling a smoke ring.\n\nThe East District was on the east side of Tongcheng's urban area, a bit far from the city center. The Confucian Temple and the City God Temple were both there. It was usually only bustling during holidays, since many people went there to burn incense.\n\n\"What's happened?\" Zhou Ze asked, flicking his ash.\n\n\"Look at this one. Someone posted on Weibo that they saw some historical costume cosplay enthusiasts while passing the Confucian Temple last night. When they went over to say hello, the people had suddenly vanished.\"\n\n\"Here's another one. It says that while taking a post-dinner walk with their parents in the woods behind Confucian Temple Street, they saw people reciting poetry and composing couplets.\"\n\n\"And another one, a post from a driver, who said that as he drove past the Confucian Temple area, he heard many people crying by the roadside.\"\n\nThe Confucian Temple?\n\nZhou Ze frowned slightly. This matter seemed to have something to do with him.\n\n\"But these incidents have actually made the Confucian Temple popular again. They say it's become more spiritually potent recently,\" Xu Qinglang remarked.\n\n\"Heh.\" Zhou Ze mulled over his own business.\n\n\"Logically, that shouldn't happen. The Confucian Temple is where the Confucian sages reside. There shouldn't be any wandering ghosts causing trouble there,\" said Xu Qinglang.\n\n\"There probably were, but someone was likely managing them before,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"What about now? What happened to the person managing them?\"\n\n\"I killed him.\"\n\n\"...\" Xu Qinglang.\n\n------\n\nLeft with no choice, Zhou Ze and Bai Yingying went to the Confucian Temple after nightfall.\n\nLast time, Zhou Ze had beaten the dwarfish old man here until his soul scattered, then brushed off his sleeves and left without a care in the world.\n\nBut considering the recent events, it was clear: without the dwarfish old man's control, the scholar spirits who had previously served as his honor guard were becoming restless and starting to let themselves go.\n\nZhou Ze was a Ghoul Attendant, so this matter fell under his jurisdiction. Moreover, since he was the one who got rid of the dwarfish old man, it was indeed his mess to clean up.\n\n\"Boss, these spirits can't really cause any major trouble. In a couple of months, they'll just dissipate into thin air. They were only sustained by the Confucian Temple's system before. As long as they didn't cause trouble, the Ghoul Attendants would turn a blind eye and not bother with them.\n\n\"Now that they're free from their restraints, once they've bounced around for a few days and vented their grievances, those who are fated to have their souls scattered will scatter, and those who deserve to go to Hell will go to Hell.\"\n\nHaving been personally taught by Madam Bai, Bai Yingying's understanding of these ghostly matters was actually clearer than Zhou Ze's.\n\n\"I can't rest easy without checking the situation here. It's better to collect them all if I can.\" Zhou Ze tilted his head slightly, searching for any lingering scholar spirits nearby.\n\nThose scholars from past dynasties who failed to pass the imperial examinations and took their own lives in frustration—many of their resentful souls gathered near the Confucian Temple, drawn by its aura, and became the temple's \"honor guard.\"\n\nOf course, there were surely others mixed in to pad the numbers; they couldn't all have been so-called scholars. After all, when the forest is large, it will have all kinds of birds.\n\nThose scholars did little more than recite poetry, compose couplets, and weep sorrowfully. As Li Baojia wrote in the sixth chapter of his Qing Dynasty novel, *A Brief History of Civilization*:\n\n\"A scholar's rebellion won't succeed in three years. Regardless of whether they are actually doing it or not, they can be ignored.\"\n\nBut Zhou Ze was worried that if some *other things* had also been \"freed,\" they might stir up trouble. If something did happen, he would definitely have to bear some of the responsibility when it was traced back.\n\nBut tonight, it was eerily quiet. Zhou Ze had already smoked half a pack of cigarettes, and Bai Yingying was lying on the grass with her eyes half-closed, yet not a single ghost was to be seen.\n\nGetting a little impatient, Zhou Ze reached out and slapped Bai Yingying on her ample, firm rear, watching the flesh jiggle.\n\nHe said:\n\n\"Yell a bit. Lure those ghosts out.\"\n\nBai Yingying rolled her eyes at Zhou Ze, clearly ignoring his suggestion. Having spent a lot of time with him, she had figured out some of his personality and habits, and dared to be a little cheeky in a way that wouldn't actually annoy him.\n\n\"Life is but a dream; let me offer a cup to the river moon. A spiritual journey to my old homeland... things have truly changed, and the people are gone.\"\n\nA man's voice came from behind a tree.\n\nImmediately after, a man in long boots and an official's robe walked out. He had a long beard, a symbol of dignity, a square face, and a straight posture. At a glance, he was an official.\n\nNo, correction. At a glance, he was someone who *had been* an official when he was alive.\n\nMoreover, he had a long queue hanging down his back.\n\nBai Yingying slowly stood up, looking at the man before her, then said in surprise:\n\n\"Boss, I see now why we couldn't find any of those scholar spirits tonight. It turns out he swallowed them all!\"\n\nZhou Ze could see it too. The man appeared dignified, but within his belly, one could see many small points of light, which were surely the scholar spirits he had swallowed.\n\n\"Heh heh. A prime minister's belly is big enough to pole a boat.¹ I was not a prime minister, but I did once hold the rank of a high minister. It's no problem for this stomach of mine to accommodate these failed scholars from past dynasties.\"\n\n\"Alright, you'll do. Down you go.\"\n\nZhou Ze prepared to open the Gates of Hell and drag the fellow down.\n\nThe man had swallowed a good number of scholar spirits and indeed seemed to be in high spirits, much better than the usual ghosts who frequented his bookstore.\n\nBut he hadn't quite reached a level that would make Zhou Ze wary.\n\nThey were all ghosts, but having a physical body or not made a world of difference.\n\nBesides, he still had his fingernails.\n\n\"Are you the local Ghoul Attendant?\" the man asked Zhou Ze, speaking with reserve. \"You are at least qualified to sit with me as an equal.\"\n\n\"My, what big talk. Has the Qing Dynasty fallen?\"²\n\nBai Yingying taunted.\n\n\"When men are speaking, is it your place as a woman to interrupt? Stand down,\" the man reprimanded with great authority.\n\nBai Yingying cracked her knuckles, producing a series of sharp sounds.\n\nThe man looked at Zhou Ze, who was on the other side preparing to open the Gates of Hell, and said:\n\n\"Attendant, I hold an official rank and once led a whole ministry. Even if I am to be sent down, should it be done so casually?\n\n\"Furthermore, when I was alive, I met a judge from the Yin Division. That judge said I would die on the nineteenth day of the third month of the Jia-Shen year.\n\n\"I was terrified, living in constant dread, and finally made it to that day. But after that day passed, I did not die.\n\n\"This is sufficient proof that I am blessed with great fortune, and that even the rules of the Yin Division do not apply to me. Therefore, I advise you not to waste your effort.\n\n\"After I have finished touring my old homeland, if I wish to go down, I will go down of my own accord. Perhaps after I descend, I can secure a position as a supervisor in the Yin Division. If we meet in the future, you would have to kneel before me, bow, and respectfully call me 'Your Excellency.'\"\n\n\"You really are asking for a beating, aren't you?\" Bai Yingying said with a smile.\n\n\"No,\" Zhou Ze replied. \"This just shows that the customs in his hometown are simple and honest. Otherwise, he would have been beaten to death before he ever grew up.\"\n\n\"How absurd! Hmph, I have no desire to engage in this war of words with you. I am not speaking empty words. If you intend to forcibly escort me to Hell, then be prepared to make an enemy of me.\n\n\"Even a Yin Division judge couldn't accurately predict my death date, let alone a lowly Ghoul Attendant like you.\"\n\nZhou Ze was no longer in a hurry to open the Gates of Hell. He found the man before him rather interesting. And honestly, modern ghosts were nothing special, but ancient ghosts...\n\n...were truly rare.\n\nPeople often say that precious artifacts are records of history. The man before him was a true living recording of history.\n\n\"You have a queue down your back, but you're not wearing the official robes of the Qing Dynasty,\" Zhou Ze said after a moment of careful observation. \"It should be a Ming Dynasty official's robe.\n\n\"No, you also said you once held the rank of a high minister, but this Ming robe isn't for that rank. It's the attire of a low-ranking official.\"\n\nUpon hearing this, the man said proudly, \"I served as an official in two dynasties. An imperial censor in the former dynasty, and a high minister in the latter. I brought fortune to the people, and my reputation as an official was outstanding.\n\n\"As for what clothes I wear, what right do you have to comment?\"\n\nZhou Ze took out his phone, typed \"nineteenth day of the third month of the Jia-Shen year\" and searched. Then he smiled.\n\n\"That judge wasn't wrong. You really should have died on the nineteenth day of the third month of the Jia-Shen year.\"\n\n\"Utter nonsense! I did not die on that day. I eventually died of old age and was granted a beautiful posthumous title!\" the man said scornfully.\n\n\"You were supposed to die that day. Really,\" Zhou Ze repeated, a mocking smile spreading across his face. \"But you were shameless enough not to.\"\n\n\"Preposterous ramblings!\" The man flicked his sleeve. \"Utterly senseless!\"\n\n\"Think again about what day the nineteenth of the third month of the Jia-Shen year was, and whether or not you should have died!\"\n\nZhou Ze's tone hardened as he shouted.\n\nThe man frowned slightly, seeming to ponder and recall.\n\nFinally,\n\nsuddenly,\n\nhis body trembled, and a look of shock appeared on his face.\n\nThen he glanced back at the Confucian Temple behind him.\n\nIn that moment,\n\nhe finally understood why, after he died and his soul returned to his homeland, he was imprisoned within this Confucian Temple, spending hundreds of years in a daze alongside those he called \"examination failures\"!\n\n\"This... this... this...\"\n\nThe man collapsed to the ground, utterly crestfallen.\n\nThe nineteenth day of the third month of the Jia-Shen year,\n\nwas the very day the Ming Dynasty fell, the day the Chongzhen Emperor hanged himself on Meishan, the day the officials of the Ming court were expected to follow their sovereign in death.\n\n---\n**Footnotes:**\n\n1.  **A prime minister's belly is big enough to pole a boat:** A Chinese idiom meaning a person of great stature is magnanimous and tolerant.

    "content": "The man was silent, lost in thought for a moment.\n\nZhou Ze had originally thought the man would turn into a vengeful ghost, just like the souls of the victims who had been burned to death by the delivery boy's arson in his own bookstore.\n\nFor a ghost, once it becomes vengeful, its obsession completely solidifies, severing the path to reincarnation. Its only end is to vanish without a trace.\n\nIt's a bit like someone taking a hundred times the normal dose of stimulants in a short period. Of course, they'd be high as a kite; and of course, after the high is over, you can get ready to collect the corpse.\n\nHowever, the man before him seemed rather calm.\n\nVery lost, very adrift, very helpless, and also very conflicted.\n\nHe turned to look back at the Temple of Literature behind him and sighed, \"So, as someone who grew up reading the books of sages and saints, in their eyes, am I actually the same as those down-and-out scholars who failed the imperial examinations?\"\n\nHe had originally thought he was one of a kind, that he was blessed by fate, that even a Ghost Judge couldn't determine his destiny. Who knew, in the end, it was nothing more than his own overestimation of himself.\n\nIn truth, he should have realized this long ago. Otherwise, he wouldn't have been detained here for hundreds of years, muddled and adrift day after day, unable to even maintain self-awareness, only able to follow one generation of night watchmen after another, circling the Temple of Literature.\n\nThe man looked at Zhou Ze. \"Do you think I deserved to die?\"\n\nZhou Ze did not answer.\n\n\"I had a good friend, surnamed Liu. After learning that the late emperor had hanged himself at Meishan, he led his entire family, young and old, to commit suicide in their mansion to follow the emperor in death.\"\n\nThe man recounted the story softly.\n\n\"The day before it happened, his granddaughter, who was only thirteen, secretly ran to my residence, hoping to seek my protection. Her mother was a concubine and wanted to find a chance for her to live.\n\nThen, my old friend came to my door in person and took his granddaughter back.\n\nIn the end, the entire Liu household, more than twenty people, hanged themselves to die for their country. That little granddaughter, however, was stabbed to death with a precious sword. She didn't want to die, but she died anyway.\"\n\nThe man smiled. \"Do you think that was the right thing to do?\"\n\nThis time, Zhou Ze didn't remain silent. He said, \"She shouldn't have died.\"\n\n\"Yes, she shouldn't have died. So I believe that when it comes to life and death, everyone has their own calculations. I knew my relatives didn't want to die, and my children didn't want to die either. So, I had to grit my teeth and live, to keep on living.\n\nI wasn't just living for myself; I had to live for this whole family.\n\nFurthermore, during my tenure in the subsequent dynasty, I saved countless lives and reduced a great deal of slaughter.\n\nIt's like how Li Shimin, after the Xuanwu Gate Incident, knew he was destined to have an indelible stain on his name in history, so he exhausted himself to be a wise and good emperor.\n\nAt the time, I had the same mentality.\n\nI always felt that if I did more good deeds, saved more people, then even if I failed to die for my country, at least I had put my life to good use, doing things beneficial to the nation and its people. It could be considered, in another way, as making up for my transgressions.\"\n\nThe man said a great deal. Clearly, he was not convinced of his own guilt.\n\nScholars in ancient times called themselves disciples of the sages because they read the sages' books and studied their principles. But now, it was obvious that the various sages in the Temple of Literature had branded him an unworthy disciple.\n\nHe had been one of the Nine Ministers, a man of noble birth, yet his treatment after death was the same as those who had committed suicide in the Temple of Literature after failing the imperial examinations.\n\nThis, in itself, already revealed the attitude of the sages.\n\nZhou Ze slowly squatted down, looked at the man before him, thought for a moment, and then said, \"What you just said sounds a bit familiar. Less than a hundred years ago, someone said something quite similar to what you just did.\n\nHis name was Wang Jixin.[^1]\n\nAt a time of national crisis, he became a traitor, aiding the enemy, all under the beautiful name of the Doctrine of Circuitous National Salvation.\"\n\nThe man's mouth fell slightly open. He wanted to say something, but didn't know where to begin.\n\n\"You went from being an Imperial Censor of the former dynasty to one of the Nine Ministers of the succeeding one. You can stop making excuses for yourself.\n\nThe most fundamental reason is actually very simple.\n\nThe water was too cold.\"[^2]\n\nUpon hearing this, an expression of shame and anger appeared on the man's face as he glared at Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze spread his hands, his nails grew long, and then he drew forth the symbol on his right palm, tracing a circle. The Gate of Hell opened.\n\n\"Please. What you want, isn't it just a bit of dignity? Walk in yourself.\n\nIf I have to grab you myself, then you won't even have that last bit of dignity.\"\n\nThe man stood up and walked forward step by step. Before crossing into the gate, he gave Zhou Ze one last look with a profound gaze:\n\n\"Do you think the water is cold?\"\n\n\"As long as one has a clear conscience.\"\n\nThe man showed a pensive expression, then shook his head. It was unclear if he had finally figured it out or not, but in the end, he took that step and walked through the gate.\n\nWith a wave of Zhou Ze's hand, the gate dissipated. Everything here was concluded.\n\nIt seemed he also had to thank that old official for swallowing all the nearby scholar ghosts, which saved Zhou Ze a lot of trouble.\n\n\"Boss, is it over already?\" the female corpse said, very disappointed. \"I thought you were going to give him a beating.\"\n\n\"Beating him or not, it's meaningless.\" Zhou Ze gave the nearby Temple of Literature a deep look and said, \"Besides, the sages in the Temple of Literature have already detained him here for several hundred years. The punishment has been served.\"\n\nBai Yingying pouted. \"Looks like these clay statues in the Temple of Literature are somewhat useful after all, not completely blind.\"\n\n\"Yeah. They detained the soul of that former Imperial Censor because they felt he wasn't their disciple, that he'd done something shameless and lost them face, so he needed to be punished.\n\nThey punished him.\n\nAnd then, the dynasties changed. The Ming became the Qing. A lot of things changed, but the Temple of Literature was still the Temple of Literature. And this bunch of old sage-statue masters continued to enjoy the incense offerings of the new dynasty.\"\n\n\"...\" said Bai Yingying.\n\n\"Boss, you're getting more and more philosophical these days. So are the clay statues in the temple good things or bad things?\"\n\nBai Yingying still remembered the last time she had helped someone snatch the first incense offering and entered the Temple of Literature, only to get an uncomfortable feeling of being \"watched.\"\n\n\"They're just... things, I guess.\"\n\n---\n\nHe took a cab, and by the time he got back to the bookstore, it was already ten at night. But this was usually when Zhou Ze's real business hours began.\n\nProbably because there were fewer ghosts during the day, and they were more active at night.\n\nHe had earned a bit of hell money these past few days, but after giving away that video last time, Zhou Ze had burned a lot of it to avoid trouble.\n\nThat video, of course, couldn't be used as direct evidence. But as long as it made the relevant authorities aware of the truth of the matter, it wouldn't be too difficult for them to investigate seriously and bring the truth to light.\n\nThe video was merely a lead; it couldn't be used as actual evidence.\n\nZhou Ze didn't read a book. Instead, he wore headphones and listened to music, casually browsing some news. Bai Yingying sat behind him on her phone, playing a game.\n\nThe master and servant, each to their own amusement. In the eyes of the man next door, who was more beautiful than any woman, this was a sign of depravity!\n\nLate at night, the bookstore door was pushed open. A girl walked in, leading a Corgi.\n\nA familiar girl, a familiar Corgi.\n\nZhou Ze stood up and poured her a glass of water. As his first VIP customer, she naturally deserved this service.\n\nZhou Ze also leaned in for a closer look.\n\nThe person was alive.\n\nThe dog was also alive.\n\nIt was just that in the dead of night, the probability of a living person entering his bookstore was indeed quite low.\n\n\"Boss, I found my doggy.\"\n\n\"Congratulations,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nThe Corgi excitedly circled Zhou Ze twice, then happily trotted over to Bai Yingying.\n\nBai Yingying was playing *Honor of Kings* and was startled by the dog. She immediately shot it a glare, and the Corgi froze in terror.\n\nAs the saying goes, a dog's eyes look down on people, but in reality, dogs can see things people can't.\n\nInstantly, the dog collapsed onto the floor, and its piss and shit came out all at once.\n\n\"Sorry, sorry, I'm so sorry, Boss,\" the girl said, immediately standing up to clean it.\n\n\"It's fine.\" Zhou Ze gestured for the girl to relax, then said to Bai Yingying, \"Clean it up.\"\n\nBai Yingying put down her phone and went to the bathroom to get a mop and rag, a look of grievance on her face.\n\n\"Boss, your bookstore's business has never been that great, has it?\" The girl pulled her dog back and made it sit by her feet, not allowing it to run around anymore.\n\nOf course, the poor thing didn't dare run around anymore. It barely dared to breathe.\n\n\"Just getting by,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Last time, thanks so much for telling me where my dog was. I was able to find the person who took him and pay to get him back.\"\n\n\"How much did it cost?\"\n\n\"Over ten thousand. They didn't want to return him, said she was the one raising him. But after we agreed on a price, she gave the dog back to me.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"Boss, I think you could add some more things to your bookstore. For example, these chairs are really uncomfortable. You could switch them out for sofas.\"\n\n*If I had the money, I'd want to switch them too.*\n\n\"How about I invest? You could fix this place up nicely,\" the girl said to Zhou Ze, stroking her dog's head.\n\nZhou Ze knew she just wanted to repay him and didn't mind losing a little money, but he couldn't agree.\n\nHe couldn't very well ask her, \"Do you mind receiving dividends in hell money?\"\n\n*\"The kind of hell money that builds up yin-virtue when you burn it, you know?\"*\n\nWhen that Daoist priest had said that to him back then, Zhou Ze had thought the man was an idiot.\n\nWell,\n\nZhou Ze didn't want the girl in front of him to think he was an idiot, too.\n\nJust then, a loud laugh erupted from the noodle shop next door. Immediately after, Xu Qinglang, dressed in alluring pajamas, ran out. He came into the bookstore and yelled at Zhou Ze and Bai Yingying, who was wiping up dog poop:\n\n\"I won! The lottery, I won! A hundred thousand!\"\n\nXu Qinglang was overjoyed. When people are happy, they always want to share. The only place nearby where he could find living people was the bookstore next door.\n\nAlthough, it seemed the two in the bookstore next door weren't exactly alive either...\n\n\"Congratulations, congratulations,\" Zhou Ze offered.\n\n\"Tsk tsk, buy me a purse, Boss Xu,\" Bai Yingying said, taking the opportunity to get a little gift.\n\n\"A small matter, a small matter.\" Xu Qinglang began to act demure. Then he saw that there was also a young, beautiful girl nearby and immediately became even more demure.\n\n\"It's only a hundred thousand yuan. After taxes, it's just eighty thousand. It's just a little windfall for good luck. For a man like me, with over twenty resettlement apartments in Shiqiao District, it's just a drop in the bucket. It has no real impact on my life.\"\n\n\"Shiqiao District?\" the girl asked.\n\n\"That's right,\" Xu Qinglang replied.\n\nShiqiao District was close to the city center, and property prices there were higher than in other areas. Naturally, one could be more smug—no, more *subtle*—about it.\n\n\"Oh, that's probably my family's residential complex then.\"\n\n\"You live there too?\" Xu Qinglang's smile grew even wider. \"Maybe we can get coffee together sometime?\"\n\n\"I don't live there.\"\n\n\"Then what do you mean?\"\n\n\"I mean, the company that demolished your home and compensated you with those resettlement apartments... that should be my family's company.\"\n\n\"...\" said Xu Qinglang.\n\n---\n[^1]: Wang Jixin is a name used here for Wang Jingwei (1883-1944), a high-ranking official in the Kuomintang who, during the Second Sino-Japanese War, defected to the Japanese side and became the head of a collaborationist government, claiming his actions were a \"circuitous\" way to save China. He is widely considered a traitor in modern Chinese history.\n[^2]: \"The water was too cold\" is a famous quote attributed to Qian Qianyi (1582-1664), a late-Ming dynasty official. When the Qing dynasty conquered the capital, his concubine encouraged him to commit suicide by drowning in a lake to show his loyalty to the fallen Ming. After dipping his hand in the water, he allegedly declared, \"The water is too cold,\" and refused. He later surrendered and served the new Qing dynasty. The phrase has since become a famous euphemism for cowardice and finding a flimsy excuse to avoid a difficult duty.",

    "content": "This was perhaps the most deeply Xu Qinglang had ever been hurt;\n\nMen like to show off in front of the opposite sex, to brag and preen, much like a gorilla beating its chest during a mating ritual, constantly letting out cries of:\n\n\"Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh!\"\n\nIn Zhou Ze's eyes, the coquettish look on Xu Qinglang's face seemed to be the first time he'd ever seen him attempt to release that kind of mating signal.\n\nUnfortunately, the girl's words—\"Your apartment is a resettlement unit from my family's company\"—\n\n\"Snap!\"\n\nIt was as if something had shattered.\n\nXu Qinglang looked like he wanted to clutch his chest and fall to his knees.\n\nPain.\n\nSo much pain.\n\nA heart-wrenching pain.\n\nThe girl slowly stood up and said to Zhou Ze, \"Boss, let's add each other on WeChat. If you're considering a partnership in the future, you can contact me.\"\n\n\"Alright.\" Zhou Ze, of course, wouldn't refuse.\n\nAfter adding him on WeChat, the girl left with her corgi.\n\nXu Qinglang let out a long sigh, waved his hand, and slowly turned to leave the bookstore.\n\nHe needed some time to nurse his wounds.\n\nA smile touched the corners of Zhou Ze's mouth. It seemed that, for the near future at least, the words \"twenty-something apartments\" wouldn't be coming out of Xu Qinglang's mouth again.\n\nTurning back, Zhou Ze saw Bai Yingying sitting on a plastic stool, staring into space. No, not staring into space—to be precise, she was reading a copy of *Those Happenings of the Ming Dynasty*.\n\n\"Boss, what did you mean by 'the water is too cold' when you were talking to that ghost?\"\n\nThe female corpse's memories were largely inherited from Madam Bai. In that era, the variety of books women read was quite limited; it was naturally impossible for them to be as \"learned as five cartloads of books\" as the men who studied for the imperial examinations.\n\nAs for the gathering of talented women in *Dream of the Red Chamber*, that could probably only happen in a book.\n\n\"He was a leader of the literary world in the late Ming Dynasty, and I believe he also served as Minister of Rites. When the Qing soldiers broke through the pass and the Ming Dynasty was on the brink of collapse, he prepared to die for his country. His beloved concubine, Liu Rushi, was ready to die with him. In the end, his concubine jumped, but he never dared to. He just said, 'The water is too cold.' Then he surrendered to the Manchus.\"\n\n\"So that man was a real piece of work. Boss, were you using that to mock the ghost?\" Bai Yingying asked.\n\n\"Actually, although Qian Qianyi did surrender to the Qing in the end, he secretly funded anti-Qing forces and passed information to their armies. He was even called to account by the Qing court for it.\"\n\n\"That...\" Bai Yingying didn't know how to judge the man.\n\nShe was very simple, like the elderly or children who, when watching a TV show, like to ask bluntly, \"Is that person a good guy? Is that person a bad guy?\"\n\nFor many people, the world is either black or white. As for the gray areas, they are too complicated, too difficult to understand, so they simply pretend not to see them.\n\n\"The one I just threw into Hell was, in essence, quite similar to Qian Qianyi.\" Zhou Ze smiled, picked up his teacup, and sat down on the chair behind the counter.\n\n\"Then why did you still send him to Hell?\" Bai Yingying asked, a little confused. \"At the very least, you could have turned a blind eye and let him linger in the mortal world for a while longer, right?\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. \"Are you starting to feel sorry for him?\"\n\n\"The water was too cold—it's only human nature.\" Bai Yingying pouted. \"I'm dead now, a jiangshi. If I were still alive, I think choosing not to die with my sovereign and the court should be my own decision. Dying would certainly be praised, but not dying should also be understandable.\"\n\n\"The Ghost Adjudicator was right to say he should have died on that day.\" Zhou Ze put down his cup. \"I was originally dead myself, then came back by possessing a corpse. I'm essentially struggling to survive, so I really shouldn't have the right to ask someone else whether they ought to die. Don't you think so too?\"\n\nBai Yingying nodded.\n\n\"You have to consider everything within its specific context. To think about the ancients and their ways, you must place yourself in their era, within the context of their culture, customs, and so on.\n\n\"From a modern perspective, of course, we have a situation of ethnic harmony, where all are one big family of the Chinese nation.\n\n\"But if you place yourself in the late Ming Dynasty, everyone would have had their own stance.\n\n\"Your way of thinking is like an ancient farmer assuming the emperor eats ten youtiao and ten big meat buns for breakfast every day. It's fundamentally wrong and inappropriate for us to project our own small-fry perspectives onto major historical figures.\n\n\"Yes, Qian Qianyi did do many things to help the anti-Qing armies after surrendering, and he even mocked the Qing Dynasty in the documents he compiled. But for him, that wasn't nearly enough.\"\n\n\"Not enough? Did he really have to die?\" Bai Yingying asked, confused.\n\n\"He had to die,\" Zhou Ze answered very seriously. \"And that includes the ghost I just threw down there. He had to die too!\"\n\nAfter saying this, Zhou Ze took a deep breath.\n\n\"He could have also chosen not to die. He could have left freely, become a wealthy gentleman, and vanished completely from the world, forsaking glory and riches to live in obscurity from then on. That would have been acceptable too.\"\n\n\"On what grounds?\" Bai Yingying clearly disagreed. \"Everyone's life should be in their own hands.\"\n\n\"When Dodo's army entered Nanjing, Qian Qianyi was the highest-ranking official in the city. He led the officials to kneel and welcome the Qing army, surrendering to the Manchus.\n\n\"He could not surrender. He had no right to surrender.\n\n\"His reputation, his identity, his authority, his status, his luxuries, his exceptional treatment—all of it was given to him by the imperial court. You could also say it was given to him by the state.\n\n\"However many benefits you receive, you should rightfully bear that much responsibility.\n\n\"You received so much from the state, reaching the pinnacle of officialdom. Even when you were so old your back could barely move, you still pursued Liu Rushi, acting out the poem 'a pear blossom pressing upon a crabapple'¹ with carefree abandon.\n\n\"So when the state needed him, he naturally and rightfully had an obligation to fulfill his duty.\n\n\"It's a kind of... social contract.\n\n\"'When the nation is in peril, every man has a duty.' In reality, even if the common folk just looked up at the sky, no one would blame them.\n\n\"But those officials of old who fed on government stipends and feasted on the fat of the land, they had an obligation, when the ship of state was sinking, to do everything in their power to keep it afloat, or even to go down with the ship.\n\n\"It's hard to be a hero, but easy to be a villain. We should applaud heroes, not put ourselves in the shoes of villains to make excuses for them. The logic isn't 'I can't be a hero, so being a villain is understandable.' It has never been that way.\"\n\nBai Yingying listened and nodded, as if she partly understood.\n\n\"Take that ghost from the Temple of Confucius, for example. During the Ming Dynasty, he was a Censor, similar to a modern-day prosecutor—not even a chief prosecutor. But later he became one of the Nine Ministers, which is like a cabinet minister today.\n\n\"After surrendering, he still managed to do so well for himself, getting promotion after promotion. Tell me, should he have died or not?\n\n\"There was a high official in the Ming Dynasty who once declared, 'The state has nurtured its scholars for one hundred and fifty years. The day to die for righteousness and uphold our integrity is today.' He was talking about this very principle.\"\n\n\"My head is spinning,\" Bai Yingying said, shaking her head.\n\n\"This is a bookstore. Even though it's mostly fiction, you can read other books too.\" Zhou Ze twisted his neck. \"It's not like you have anything else to do.\"\n\nBai Yingying shot Zhou Ze a glance, her expression clearly saying, *And you say that like you have anything better to do.*\n\nZhou Ze got up and went to the bathroom to wash his face. When he came out, he saw Bai Yingying refilling his teacup. She asked again,\n\n\"Oh, right, Boss, what happened to that high official who declared 'The state has nurtured its scholars for one hundred and fifty years'?\"\n\n\"Oh, the emperor had the Jinyiwei beat him severely with clubs in front of the Zuo Shun Gate.\"\n\nZhou Ze sniffled.\n\n\"And then there was no 'and then'.\"\n\n\"...\" Bai Yingying was speechless.\n\nThe master and servant had a rare intellectual moment, discussing history and worldviews;\n\nOf course, this pleasant atmosphere didn't last long, as the female corpse immediately dropped her book, picked up her phone, and started playing *Honor of Kings*.\n\nJust then, another customer came into the shop. He was a middle-aged man, about forty-something, wearing a black down jacket. His face was a bit rough, his clothes somewhat worn, and he had an honest, simple look about him.\n\n\"Boss, could I put up a notice here?\" the man asked Zhou Ze humbly.\n\n\"What kind of notice?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"A missing person notice,\" the man answered honestly.\n\n\"Go ahead.\" Zhou Ze stood up and walked to the shop's entrance, watching the man post the notice on the wall.\n\n\"No photo?\" Zhou Ze saw that the notice only had text, no picture.\n\n\"She was only a few months old when she was taken, too young for photos.\" The man rubbed his hands together and offered Zhou Ze a cigarette. \"Don't mind the brand.\"\n\nZhou Ze took the cigarette and asked, \"Was she abducted?\"\n\n\"No, she was given up for adoption. We already had her older sister, and the two-child policy wasn't in effect back then. I couldn't afford the fine, and I was afraid of losing my job, so we had to give her away.\n\n\"All these years, we've thought about her day and night, hoping to see her again. But we haven't had any contact. After all, she was given to another family to raise. As long as they treated her well, that was enough. It wouldn't have been right for us to disturb her, and it wouldn't have been good for her either.\"\n\n\"I see.\" Zhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"This time, it's because her younger brother has had some bad luck. He has leukemia. I only know that the family who adopted her lived around here over a decade ago, so this is the only place I can look.\n\n\"Her older sister wasn't a match, so now her brother's life depends on her. And it will be a good chance for our family to be reunited.\"\n\n\"Her younger brother?\" Zhou Ze frowned and asked, \"How old is she now?\"\n\n\"Seventeen.\"\n\n\"And how old is her brother?\"\n\n\"Sixteen.\"\n\n\"Pathetic,\" Zhou Ze sighed.\n\n\"I know, right? How could a fine young kid get a disease like this? Boss, please keep an eye out for me. I'm going to keep posting these up ahead. I've already contacted the media, so there might be an interview tomorrow.\n\n\"I'm sure we'll find her soon. Then our family can be reunited, and her brother can be saved.\"\n\nThe middle-aged man gave a very simple, honest-looking smile and then headed on his way.\n\nAfter he had walked some distance and his figure had disappeared into the night,\n\nZhou Ze looked at the missing person notice on the wall by the entrance and said softly:\n\n\"Pathetic.\"\n\nThen,\n\nZhou Ze reached out,\n\nand tore the freshly posted notice right off the wall.\n***\n**Footnotes:**\n¹ A line from a poem by Su Shi, jokingly describing an 80-year-old man taking an 18-year-old concubine.

    "content": "The second daughter is seventeen this year, the youngest son is sixteen.\n\nIn other words, after that simple and honest-looking middle-aged man gave away his second daughter, he immediately, with a heart full of incomparable guilt and endless longing, had another child with his wife.\n\nSo, all that talk about violating the family planning policy, the fines, and what not, was all fake.\n\nHe just wanted a son. His first child was a daughter, his second was also a daughter, so he simply gave her away and then, without stopping to catch his breath, conceived a new life.\n\nEven after giving her away, they didn't even know the adoptive family's address or have any contact information. It was clearly a sign they intended to have nothing more to do with her.\n\nLuckily, the next child was a son. Otherwise, they would have given away a third daughter, a fourth daughter...\n\nNow, because their son has leukemia and needs a matching donor, and because the eldest daughter wasn't a match, they finally thought:\n\n\"Oh, it seems we have another girl we gave away, eh?\"\n\nAnd so, to save their son, they began to search.\n\nThey mobilized the media and posted missing person flyers.\n\nTo move others, you must first move yourself. Humans are just that kind of emotional and complex creature.\n\nIn the decade-plus since their daughter was given away, they might have felt a sliver of guilt, but they never regretted it. If they had regretted it, they would have started searching long ago. Besides, it would have been far easier to find her in the first few years after she was given away than it is now, over ten years later.\n\nIf you do something wrong that causes you pain, you will spend the following days constantly using psychological suggestion to alleviate or even erase that pain.\n\nThat middle-aged man was very successful at it. He wove together many excuses. After telling the lie a hundred times, he came to believe it himself.\n\nHe felt that he still loved and missed his second daughter. He felt that giving her away back then was due to circumstances beyond his control, an act of absolute necessity, a heart-wrenching, unavoidable sacrifice, just like in *The Orphan of Zhao*.[^1]\n\nThey wouldn't stop to think that the daughter they gave away is now seventeen years old;\n\nThat she should already be in high school, with her own circle of friends, living a life no different from her peers;\n\nThat her adoptive parents might have never even told her she was adopted, and that she believes they are her real parents.\n\nHer life should be very peaceful.\n\nBut soon, she will be struck by a bolt from the blue!\n\n\"Child, let me tell you something wonderful, we've found your birth parents!\"\n\n\"Child, let me tell you something thrilling, the parents you've had until now aren't your real mom and dad!\"\n\n\"Child, let me tell you something joyous, you have an older sister and a younger brother!\"\n\n\"Child, let me tell you something heroic, you can save your sick little brother!\"\n\nAren't you surprised?\n\nAren't you delighted?\n\nAren't you moved?\n\n\"Boss, what's wrong?\" Bai Yingying asked, seeing Zhou Ze standing dazedly at the door.\n\n\"There's one thing that, every time I think about it, makes my skin crawl,\" said Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Do you have to be so dramatic, Boss? You've even been down to Hell. What could possibly scare you like this?\" Bai Yingying looked at Zhou Ze curiously.\n\n\"It's that for many jobs, many professions, many positions you apply for, you need to be certified, you need to pass tests. It's like getting a driver's license—you have to be confirmed to have the skills, to be familiar with traffic laws, and they even make you drive on the road to see if you can handle the test.\n\n\"Otherwise, letting someone with substandard driving skills and mentality get a license is actually irresponsible to the other pedestrians and drivers on the road.\"\n\n\"And?\" Bai Yingying pressed.\n\n\"But to be a parent, you don't need a license.\"\n\n***\n\nThe night passed without incident. The next morning, Zhou Ze woke up and, out of habit, was about to go next door for a meal, but the door was closed.\n\nThis made Zhou Ze a little worried. Could Xu Qinglang have been hit too hard last night and just given up completely?\n\nZhou Ze didn't care if he gave up, but he couldn't live without those juices of his.\n\nHe called him, and Xu Qinglang answered quickly. It turned out he had gone to claim his lottery prize and said he would buy everyone a small gift later to show his appreciation.\n\nWith no other choice, Zhou Ze ordered some takeout and wolfed it down with some plum juice he still had at home.\n\nThe shop's door was still closed. Although it wasn't locked, it clearly broadcasted an attitude of being too lazy to do business. Zhou Ze had long since learned to go with the flow.\n\nHowever, when he sat down in the chair behind the counter and opened the drawer, Zhou Ze was surprised to find a thick stack of hell money inside.\n\nAt first, Zhou Ze thought Bai Yingying had deliberately bought some hell money to surprise him, but then he figured she probably wasn't that childish.\n\nHe took the hell money in his hand and flicked it. It was real.\n\nIsn't it funny...\n\nNowadays, with the convenience of mobile payments, the scene of people in shops or at the market holding up large banknotes to the light and flicking them to check for authenticity is becoming rarer and rarer.\n\nBut this was real currency.\n\nZhou Ze thought for a moment. It must be his commission from sending that Imperial Censor downstairs yesterday. That man went on to become one of the Nine Ministers during the Qing Dynasty, with a large family and prosperous estate. Of course, the filial piety and incense offerings from his descendants would be substantial.\n\nZhou Ze estimated that if he burned this hell money, he'd probably find several lost wallets at his doorstep, containing at least five thousand yuan in total.\n\nThis time, it seemed he hadn't lost out. He'd made over five thousand in one night, and the only cost was the round-trip taxi fare, which added up to less than a hundred yuan.\n\nZhou Ze wasn't in a hurry to run out and burn the paper money. This hell money was useful to keep for critical moments. It could help you eliminate minor disasters and avoid troublesome interference in certain matters. Sometimes, it was more effective than a few thousand yuan.\n\n\"Xu Le!\"\n\nThe person hadn't entered the room yet, but their voice had already arrived.\n\nZhou Ze looked up and saw his sister-in-law walk in.\n\n\"Here, for you.\"\n\nHis sister-in-law was carrying a shoulder bag today. She took out a wad of cash and placed it on Zhou Ze's counter.\n\n\"Paying you back.\"\n\nZhou Ze smiled. \"You could have just transferred it to me on your phone.\"\n\n\"No way. It feels better to slap down a stack of cash when you're paying someone back,\" his sister-in-law pouted.\n\nAfter the last incident, his sister-in-law's opinion of Zhou Ze had improved somewhat. Of course, that was also because the old Xu Le was too much of a wimp. He couldn't even handle his own wife, so of course his sister-in-law looked down on him even more.\n\nBut now that Zhou Ze treated her with a certain sternness, adopting the air of an elder, she actually started to take him seriously.\n\n\"Xu Le, your business is really terrible,\" his sister-in-law said with her hands in her pockets.\n\n\"No class today?\"\n\n\"It's the weekend,\" his sister-in-law pouted, displeased. \"But I'm going to a bar later. I told my sister I was coming here to read and do my homework, so don't you dare blow my cover.\"\n\n*Your sister hasn't contacted me in half a month.*\n\nZhou Ze felt a bit wistful. He had originally thought that Doctor Lin actively embracing him after his confession was a very good start, but perhaps that was just a moment of courage on her part.\n\nOnce a person calms down, their thoughts slowly become more complicated. Doctor Lin probably hadn't escaped that vicious cycle and mental block yet.\n\nHer unloved, legal husband was dead.\n\nThen the man she liked had possessed her legal husband's body via soul transference.\n\nIt seemed like a win-win situation,\n\nyet it was separated by an insurmountable moral chasm.\n\nFortunately, after the incident with the Faceless Woman, Zhou Ze wasn't in a hurry about this anymore.\n\nAt least the thought, \"She won't sleep with me anyway,\" hadn't appeared in his mind for a long time.\n\nIt might also be because Bai Yingying had been sleeping with him every night recently.\n\nAlthough Bai Yingying was for looking, not for touching,\n\njust being able to look was good enough.\n\n\"You should go to places like bars less often,\" Zhou Ze reminded her. \"It's not too late to relax and do what you like after you get into university.\"\n\n\"Alright, alright, you sound just like my parents and my sister. You're a university graduate yourself, so how did you end up in this state?\"\n\nThis way of talking, his sister-in-law's...\n\nto put it nicely, was being frank and outspoken.\n\nTo put it badly, was being tactless.\n\nZhou Ze believed that when the wimp Xu Le had made up his mind to hire someone to kill him, this sister-in-law's constant boosting of his \"rage meter\" must have played an assisting role.\n\nIt seemed his sister-in-law didn't know about what happened with her female classmate, probably out of consideration for protecting a minor.\n\n\"I'm back!\"\n\nXu Qinglang returned, carrying a pile of things.\n\n\"I'm exhausted. What rotten luck today. I couldn't hail a single taxi. I don't know if my luck is just terrible today or if all the taxi drivers went to their annual company meeting.\"\n\nXu Qinglang put the things down and wiped his sweat.\n\nBai Yingying walked over just then, and her eyes lit up when she saw the things on the floor.\n\nThey were computer components.\n\n\"I'll set it up in my shop. You can come play whenever you want,\" Xu Qinglang said to Bai Yingying.\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\nThen, Xu Qinglang took out a bag for Bai Yingying and tossed a fancy lighter to Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Here, let the blessings be shared by all!\"\n\n\"What's this?\"\n\nThe sister-in-law wasn't interested in the gifts; she was interested in the plastic fan tucked into the back of Xu Qinglang's collar.\n\nWinter wasn't over yet. Carrying a fan was interesting.\n\n\"A group of people were doing a promotion at the mall and just shoved it at me,\" Xu Qinglang replied.\n\nThe sister-in-law took the fan in her hand. It was a very ordinary plastic fan with \"GG\" printed on it. After looking at it, she couldn't help but burst out laughing with a \"Pfft.\"\n\n\"What's so funny?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"It has 'Where Are We Going, Dad?' printed on it,\" his sister-in-law answered.\n\n\"What's so funny about that? You have such a low bar for humor?\" Xu Qinglang reached out to take the fan, then his eyes widened.\n\n\"Perfect. You can go with my brother-in-law,\" the sister-in-law said, sweeping a mischievous glance over Xu Qinglang and Zhou Ze.\n\n\"'Where Are We Going, Dad?'s GG?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nXu Qinglang's expression was a mix of cloudy and clear, but he still tossed the fan to Zhou Ze. \"See for yourself.\"\n\nZhou Ze picked up the fan and glanced at it.\n\nThe background was a hospital building.\n\nAt the very top was a line of large characters: \"Where Are We Going, Dad?\"\n\nAnd below it were two lines in a cartoonish font:\n\n\"Let's take our sons to get circum...\n\ncised!\nSecond one half price!\"\n\n---\n[^1]: *The Orphan of Zhao* is a famous Chinese play. The story revolves around a doctor who sacrifices his own son to save the last heir of a persecuted noble family.

    "content": "\"Speaking of which, it's really weird today. You really can't see any taxis.\"\n\nTossing the fan aside, Xu Qinglang stacked the things back up, preparing to go home and assemble his computer.\n\n\"Just bad luck, I guess.\" Zhou Ze didn't make a big deal out of it. Instead, he walked to the storefront and lit a cigarette.\n\nThe late morning sun was still quite pleasant.\n\nBai Yingying didn't like sunbathing, which was perhaps related to her identity and nature, though she wasn't like the vampires in old Hong Kong movies who would turn to dust upon contact with sunlight.\n\nAccording to Xu Qinglang, after being nourished by Lady Bai's soul for two hundred years, Bai Yingying was no longer an ordinary being. Although not as terrifying as a great weapon of destruction like a Hanba,¹ she was long past being some low-level little zombie.\n\nAnd this was indeed the case. If Bai Yingying wanted to, she could completely change her appearance and integrate into urban life under a different identity.\n\nBut her soul blood was in his hands, so she couldn't leave. Besides, it seemed she didn't want to leave, either. Who knew if a random lightning strike might just smite her dead one day? After all, in the eyes of Heaven, she was not exactly a welcome guest.\n\n\"Smoke less. You're smoking way too much now.\"\n\nHis sister-in-law also walked out of the shop, looking like she was heading out to have some fun.\n\nZhou Ze ignored her.\n\nTruthfully, Zhou Ze rather envied her. Having grown up coddled, she was a naive and sweet girl, but that too was a kind of happiness.\n\nSo unlike himself, a child raised in an orphanage, who always carried a congenital sense of insecurity. Anyone who wanted to get ahead would do so with all their might.\n\nLike his childhood friend, Wang Ke, who was so focused on getting ahead day and night that he didn't even know his wife was going out to get her hair done.\n\nPeople...\n\nIt seems you just can't dwell on them, because a red sedan quickly pulled up on the road in front of Zhou Ze's shop.\n\nA familiar person got out: Wang Ke's wife, along with that little loli.\n\n\"Hello, Auntie. Hello, Uncle.\"\n\nThe little loli greeted them乖巧地.\n\nThe sister-in-law couldn't help but crouch down and pinch the little loli's cheek, saying, \"What an adorable little doll.\"\n\nThe woman smiled at Zhou Ze and said, \"I'm going to get my hair done. She'll read here for a bit.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" Zhou Ze agreed.\n\nAfter thanking him, the woman turned and got back into her car to drive away. The sway of her hips was large, showing a kind of impatience.\n\nThe sister-in-law also hailed a cab and left, reminding Zhou Ze once more before she left to cover for her.\n\nAt the shop's entrance, the little loli stood beside Zhou Ze as he crouched there, smoking.\n\n\"You haven't come back, have you?\" Zhou Ze suddenly asked.\n\n\"Uncle, what are you talking about?\" The little loli looked somewhat confused, cute and clueless.\n\n\"Heh heh.\"\n\nZhou Ze reached out and patted the little loli's head.\n\n\"Come on, let's go read.\"\n\nZhou Ze picked out a copy of *Guwen Guanzhi*² for the little loli and handed it to her, then said, \"How are your grades in school?\"\n\n\"My grades are very good,\" the little loli said proudly.\n\n\"Do you have any hobbies?\" Zhou Ze asked again.\n\n\"I can do ballet, and I'm also learning piano,\" the little loli answered.\n\n\"What would you like to drink?\"\n\n\"I want to drink Coke.\" After saying this, the little loli stuck out her tongue. \"Mommy usually doesn't let me drink it.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded and went next door to Xu Qinglang's place to get a can of Coke.\n\n\"Here.\"\n\nThe little loli took the Coke and said sweetly:\n\n\"Thank you, Uncle.\"\n\nAfter a sip of Coke, the little loli turned another page of the book and began reading with relish.\n\n\"You're back.\"\n\nZhou Ze, holding a glass of water, spoke suddenly.\n\nThe cutesy expression on the little loli's face gradually faded, replaced by a deep look, like that of an adult.\n\nShe held up the book in her hand.\n\n\"By the time I realized I shouldn't be reading this book, it was already too late.\"\n\nThe book in the little loli's hand was the *Guwen Guanzhi* Zhou Ze had originally given her, and it wasn't a modern vernacular or youth edition.\n\n\"What did you come to find me for?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nHad the one in Rongcheng been dealt with?\n\nSo, she had returned?\n\n\"I just got back from Hell. I missed you, so I came to see you.\" The little loli stood up, tilted her head slightly, looked at Zhou Ze, and smiled. \"I've discovered you're quite the slacker, and very passive in your work.\"\n\n\"I don't understand what you mean,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"The attendance sheet shows that my performance for this period is at the bottom of this entire region.\" The little loli licked her lips. \"I told you to handle things as you saw fit, but I didn't tell you to be this lazy.\"\n\n\"Attendance sheet?\" When Zhou Ze heard this, his heart stirred.\n\n\"What, is there a problem? You think being a Ghost Messenger doesn't require performance reviews?\" the little loli retorted.\n\n\"Can you... let me see it?\"\n\n\"Why don't you ask why I can't just give it to you?\"\n\nThe little loli moved closer to Zhou Ze. She wanted to meet his gaze, but she was too short, and getting closer only resulted in Zhou Ze looking down on her.\n\nThis made her very uncomfortable.\n\nShe immediately waved her hand.\n\nAnd said angrily:\n\n\"Pick me up.\"\n\nZhou Ze bent down and lifted the little loli so her eyes could be level with his.\n\n\"Don't think I don't know what you're thinking.\" The little loli's cool fingers stroked Zhou Ze's chin for a moment. \"Do you really want to become a permanent employee?\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\nThere was nothing to be ashamed of admitting.\n\n\"I can give you something to look forward to. I'll be going to Rongcheng in a little while. Once I take care of that troublemaker, I might get a chance for a favorable transfer.\n\nWhen that happens, my original position can be handed over to you, as long as you bring my performance stats back up next month.\"\n\nThe little loli dangled a big carrot in front of Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze was starting to understand. The little loli's actions were a bit like someone who worked at a company but outsourced their tasks to someone else while they went off to do freelance work.\n\n\"Perhaps, I can look forward to another possibility,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"What possibility?\"\n\n\"You die in Rongcheng, and the position naturally becomes mine.\"\n\nDeep down, Zhou Ze didn't want anything to happen to that person. After all, she had helped him out in the dream last time.\n\nAs for why he was being so blunt, it was simple. Between them, there was really no need for much beating around the bush.\n\n\"Heh heh...\"\n\nThe little loli didn't get angry, nor was she upset. Instead, she actively jumped down from Zhou Ze's arms, clasped her hands behind her back, and said:\n\n\"You think that person still has a chance? You have no idea how many Ghost Messengers have been dispatched this time.\"\n\n\"You shouldn't be explaining this to me.\" Zhou Ze lit another cigarette, blew out a smoke ring, and said, \"Explaining just proves that you're scared too.\"\n\n\"Don't flatter him, and don't flatter yourself.\" The little loli turned around, her deep eyes staring at Zhou Ze. \"Aren't you a doctor? Why would you wish for my death?\n\nAm I not cute?\"\n\n\"My, what a cute child! Where did you come from?\"\n\nBai Yingying happened to be coming down from the second floor just then. Upon seeing the little loli, she immediately walked over happily, preparing to give the child a hug.\n\n\"Lady Bai?\"\n\nThe little loli frowned slightly.\n\n\"Uh...\"\n\nNo matter how slow Bai Yingying was, she now knew that the person before her was no ordinary neighborhood kid.\n\n\"Oh, my old neighbor has already cultivated enough merit and descended. You are the shell she left behind.\" The little loli glared at Zhou Ze. \"You keep her by your side, no wonder fewer ghosts are actively approaching you!\"\n\n\"You are?\" Bai Yingying asked, a bit timidly.\n\n\"My time is short. I just came to remind you this time. I'm not afraid of you having other ideas. Who doesn't have other ideas?\"\n\nThe little loli lifted her chin and walked to the bookshelf.\n\n\"I will be back in a month. Whether you can take over my position, I don't know. Whether I can secure a favorable transfer, I also don't know.\n\nBut if you fail to raise my performance stats next month...\n\nThen there's no need for you to remain in the mortal world. Go back to your Hell and wait to drink Meng Po's soup.\"\n\nAfter saying this, the little loli's head tilted to one side, and she fainted. Immediately after, a black light suddenly shot up.\n\nBiu!\n\nIt shot straight into the ground!\n\n\"Boss, who is she? A Judge?\" Bai Yingying asked Zhou Ze.\n\n\"A Ghost Messenger. I'm a temp, she has a permanent post,\" Zhou Ze said as he picked up the sleeping little loli, carried her to the boss's chair behind his counter, and covered her with a blanket.\n\n\"She's just a Ghost Messenger. Feels like even a Judge wouldn't put on such airs.\"\n\n\"Have you ever seen a Judge?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"After your lady descended, what status will she have?\"\n\n\"I'm not sure, but she should be able to receive an official title from Hell.\"\n\nJust then, a middle-aged man in a police uniform pushed open the bookstore door and walked in.\n\nThe moment he entered,\n\nit felt as if the temperature in the bookstore had risen slightly, and both Zhou Ze and Bai Yingying simultaneously felt a sense of discomfort.\n\nIt was like having thorns on their backs.\n\nZhou Ze turned to look at him. The man wore a police cap, and the national emblem on it shone brilliantly under the reflection of the sunlight from outside.\n\nHe had a square face, thick lips, and a large frame, exuding an air of authority.\n\n\"Boss, recommend a few good books for me to read. I'm heading out on a business trip soon, need something to pass the time on the road,\" the police officer said, taking off his hat and scratching his scalp.\n\n\"Oh, okay.\"\n\nZhou Ze smiled faintly, observed the man carefully for a moment, and confirmed he was not a ghost.\n\nOnly then did he turn to the bookshelf, find a few books, and hand them to him.\n\nThe police officer took the stack of books. When he saw the first one, he was taken aback. It was actually *Basic Knowledge of Public Security*.\n\nFlipping to the second book,\n\nThe police officer was taken aback again. It was *The People's Police Law of the People's Republic of China*.\n\nThere were two more underneath, respectively: *The Theory and Practice of Dispute Resolution* and *An Explanation of Grappling and Combat Techniques*.\n\nThe police officer took a deep breath, seemingly contemplating how to phrase his words, then put the books down.\n\n\"I misspoke just now. I'm taking my son on a trip, and I'm afraid he'll be bored on the way. I want to buy him some books to pass the time. He prefers to read horror.\"\n\n\"Oh, got it.\"\n\nZhou Ze took out two books from a box below and handed them to the man.\n\nThey were: *Thriller Webnovel* and *Thriller Broadcast*.\n\nOnly then did the police officer nod in satisfaction:\n\n\"These are good.\"\n\n---\n**Footnotes:**\n\n1.  **Hanba:** In Chinese mythology, a powerful type of zombie or drought demon.\n2.  ***Guwen Guanzhi***: An influential anthology of classical Chinese prose compiled in the 17th century, considered advanced reading.",

    "content": "The police officer sat there, flipping through a book and checking the time on his phone every now and then.\n\nTo be honest,\n\nhis presence in the shop was a mountain of pressure for both Zhou Ze and Bai Yingying.\n\nIt was like having thorns at their backs.\n\nThis was a good policeman. He had an aura of righteousness, and coupled with the uniform he wore, it was enough to make all evil spirits retreat.\n\nBut Zhou Ze couldn't retreat. This was his shop, after all.\n\nFortunately, Zhou Ze and Bai Yingying weren't low-level wandering ghosts or mountain spirits. While they felt some discomfort, there was no substantial harm.\n\nOn the contrary, Zhou Ze felt a deep, heartfelt respect for this man.\n\nIt’s true that you can never know a person's heart,\n\nbut as ghosts, they were far more sensitive to this kind of feeling.\n\nThat's why the first batch of books Zhou Ze brought him wasn't an attempt to tease him. Rather, Zhou Ze had jumped to the conclusion that a policeman who could cultivate such a noble, upright aura would naturally enjoy reading serious, valuable books.\n\nBut Zhou Ze later discovered that police officers were people too.\n\nAnd being people, they had their own interests and hobbies. Take the officer before him, for example, who was sitting there completely engrossed in a novel.\n\n\"Uncle, have some tea.\"\n\nBai Yingying timidly brought a cup of tea over.\n\n\"Oh, thank you.\" The officer took the cup and looked at Bai Yingying. \"Aren't you in school?\"\n\n\"It's a holiday today.\"\n\nBai Yingying didn't dare say she wasn't in school and was just loafing around, lest it lead to more trouble.\n\nShe was afraid of the man before her, even more so than Zhou Ze was.\n\nZhou Ze was a modern man and could understand this kind of mindset. While his instincts made him fear the officer, from another perspective, it also meant the man was worthy of respect.\n\nBai Yingying, however, just felt her heart pounding. After handing him the tea, she immediately ran upstairs, not wanting to come down again.\n\n\"Boss, how much is it?\" the police officer asked, looking at Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Just pay whatever you see fit,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"That won't do. Never mind, I'll settle up when I leave. They should be here to pick me up in about half an hour.\" The officer sat back down, patted his pocket, and paused.\n\nAs a seasoned smoker himself, Zhou Ze understood. He handed over a cigarette.\n\n\"Thanks.\"\n\nThe officer thanked Zhou Ze for lighting it for him, and the two of them smoked together.\n\nCigarettes really are a bridge for men's social interactions. They went from strangers to smoke buddies, making it easier to shoot the breeze.\n\n\"Business here can't be too good, can it?\" the officer asked.\n\n\"Just scraping by,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\n\"Hey, I remember who you are.\" The officer tapped his own head. \"During that fire last time, you were the one who acted heroically and rushed into the blaze to save people, right?\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"Look at my memory. Right, the bureau wanted to give you a silk banner for it. Why didn't you go accept it?\"\n\n\"It was just my duty. I didn't want the publicity,\" Zhou Ze answered.\n\nThe officer nodded, a bit helplessly. \"True. In the end, nobody expected that the arsonist would turn out to be one of the heroes who rushed into the fire to save people.\"\n\n\"Dammit, have all the taxis just vanished? It's impossible to get a ride-share at this hour, and I can't hail a cab either. Old Zhou, looks like we really have to move. You can't even get a damn taxi in this godforsaken place.\"\n\n\"I'm missing a cable, so I have to go back and buy another one, otherwise I can't finish assembling the computer.\"\n\nXu Qinglang walked in, complaining, then saw the police officer sitting in the bookstore.\n\n\"Hey, Chief Zhao!\"\n\nXu Qinglang clearly knew the officer. A smile immediately spread across his face as he said warmly:\n\n\"Chief Zhao, you still seem to be in great shape. Hiss, I remember seeing some news about you a while back. What was it about again? I forgot, but I think it was about you earning another commendation and a medal. Yes, that must be it. Congratulations, congratulations!\"\n\n\"You little thing, you're getting better and better looking.\" The officer chuckled and stood up, patting Xu Qinglang's shoulder with great familiarity. \"Are you still up to your old pilfering tricks?\"\n\n\"How would I dare? My family home was demolished and we got over twenty apartments in compensation. I'm a law-abiding, tax-paying citizen now,\" Xu Qinglang replied.\n\n\"You...\" Chief Zhao pointed at Xu Qinglang. \"I guess you could say your hard times are finally over.\"\n\n\"Chief Zhao, your son must be getting married soon, right? How about I give you an apartment as a wedding gift for him?\"\n\n\"You little rascal, if you dare say such outrageous things in front of me again, believe it or not, I'll throw you back in the station,\" Chief Zhao chided sternly.\n\n\"Hey, I just run a noodle shop, I'm not trying to bribe you. If it weren't for you back then, I probably wouldn't have lasted until our old house and land were demolished. Giving you an apartment is the least I can do to show my respect.\"\n\n\"Just live your life well, that's enough.\"\n\n\"You two know each other?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nChief Zhao nodded. \"Know him? More than just know him. This kid started stealing on the streets before he was even ten, picking people's pockets. I caught him many, many times.\"\n\n\"The first time I caught him, I told my officers I'd caught a little girl thief. Who knew he was actually a boy!\"\n\n\"I was young and dumb back then, no need to bring it up,\" Xu Qinglang said, not wanting Zhou Ze to hear about his disgraceful past.\n\n\"No, I have to bring it up. You've done a lot of stupid things, kid. You can't forget those mistakes. You have to keep them in your heart as a reminder not to repeat them. These good times didn't come easy.\"\n\n\"I understand, Chief Zhao,\" Xu Qinglang nodded.\n\n\"Right, I sent you to be an apprentice under Master Sun back then. How is Master Sun's health these days?\" Chief Zhao asked.\n\n\"He's alright, but he passed the shop down to his son, so I struck out on my own.\"\n\nSo that was part of the reason Xu Qinglang opened a noodle shop. A change in his family circumstances had almost turned him into a street hoodlum. He was caught and lectured several times by Chief Zhao, who was the precinct chief at the time. In the end, Chief Zhao arranged for him to be an apprentice at a noodle shop, which finally set him on the right path.\n\nOtherwise, the current Xu Qinglang might have one more \"house\" to his name—a jail cell.\n\n\"Chief Zhao, what brings you here?\" After speaking, Xu Qinglang added in a low voice, \"I'm telling you, you should come here less often. The feng shui isn't good.\"\n\nThe implication was that more dead people than living people came to read books at Zhou Ze's bookstore.\n\nZhou Ze raised an eyebrow from the side.\n\n*What's that supposed to mean?*\n\n\"You little rascal, you still haven't kicked that superstitious habit. I was born under the red flag, grew up under the red flag. I don't believe in any of that heretical nonsense.\"\n\n\"Besides, if you walk a straight path and have a clear conscience, you don't fear ghosts knocking at your door.\"\n\n\"Even if there really are ghosts in this world, they'd be afraid of me, not the other way around!\"\n\nZhou Ze rubbed his nose. *You're not wrong about that.*\n\n\"Chief Zhao, let me go whip up a few dishes. It's been years since we last met. How about a couple of drinks tonight?\"\n\n\"Can't. Someone's coming to pick me up soon. I'm heading out of province for a business trip. I was just afraid of getting bored on the road, so I came to buy a couple of novels to read.\"\n\n\"You're already a Chief, and you're still so busy,\" Xu Qinglang said with some regret.\n\n\"Being busy is good. I'm a police officer. If the police slack off, the common people can't rest easy.\"\n\nChief Zhao scratched his head, put his police cap back on, then took out his phone to check the time again.\n\n\"It's about time. They should be here to pick me up. I'm heading out.\"\n\n\"Take care.\"\n\n*Finally sending this radiant deity on his way,* Zhou Ze thought.\n\nAs Chief Zhao reached the door, he seemed to remember something and reached into his pocket, looking for his wallet.\n\n\"Look at my memory. I took the books and drank the tea, but I almost forgot to pay.\"\n\n\"Don't be a stranger, I've already paid,\" Xu Qinglang immediately stepped forward and said. \"The owner here grew up eating my food. He's one of us.\"\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze.\n\n\"That won't do. Why should you pay for the books I bought?\" Chief Zhao disagreed.\n\n\"Alright, how about this? I'll personally visit you in a few days to let you pay me back for the books, and I'll get a free meal out of it. How's that?\" Xu Qinglang pleaded. \"You have to give me a reason to drop by, right?\"\n\n\"Fine. Your aunt is a pretty good cook. I might not be home then, but I'll have your aunt cook you a meal. You should learn a thing or two from her, tell her I said so. Try to turn this noodle shop into a hotel someday.\"\n\n\"A person needs to have some ambition. Don't just lie on top of those apartments waiting to die. That's no way to live.\"\n\n\"Heh, what's the point of me going if you're not home,\" Xu Qinglang chuckled.\n\n\"Alright, I'm off. See you!\" Chief Zhao waved to Zhou Ze and Xu Qinglang, pushed open the bookstore door, and left.\n\n\"Boss, there are so many cars outside,\" Bai Yingying, who had been upstairs, called out as she came down the stairs.\n\n\"What cars?\" Xu Qinglang asked. \"A wedding procession?\"\n\n\"How can a wedding convoy be more impressive than an eight-bearer sedan chair?\" Zhou Ze teased Xu Qinglang.\n\n\"It's not a wedding convoy. It's taxis. So many taxis. The entire street is full of them,\" Bai Yingying said. She had a clear view from the upstairs window.\n\n\"Taxis?\" Xu Qinglang was stunned for a moment. \"Damn. No wonder it was so hard to get a cab today. Not a single one in sight. Are they organizing a strike or a protest?\"\n\nSuddenly, Xu Qinglang froze.\n\nHe seemed to have remembered something. He quickly took out his phone and started searching. Finally, he found it.\n\nIt was a news article from half a month ago.\n\nThe article's main photo was a large picture of Chief Zhao. The text below described how a car-theft ring that had been operating across several provinces was apprehended in Tongcheng. They were discovered by a deputy police chief on his way home from work. During the ensuing struggle, the deputy chief tragically died in the line of duty.\n\nThree days later, the police rounded up the entire criminal gang, leaving no one behind. This car-theft ring primarily stole taxis and was also responsible for the deaths of two taxi drivers.\n\nChief Zhao had sacrificed his life long ago.\n\n\"He's already dead... I remember reading this news. I was so sad for a long time. But just now, when I saw him standing right in front of me, I subconsciously thought he was still alive. I completely forgot about that news report.\"\n\nAfter speaking, Xu Qinglang looked at Zhou Ze angrily.\n\n\"He was a ghost! He wasn't a living person! Why didn't you remind me just now? I still had so much I wanted to say to him!\"\n\nZhou Ze was also completely stunned. \"He's a ghost?\"\n\n\"You didn't notice? You're a Ghost Emissary, and you didn't notice?\"\n\n\"I observed him carefully when he came in. He was human.\"\n\n\"How could he be human!\" Xu Qinglang practically roared.\n\nHe could have said a proper goodbye to him earlier, but he had been too busy just making small talk!\n\n\"Why would I lie to you? I observed him carefully. I really didn't notice he was a ghost.\"\n\n\"I didn't notice either,\" Bai Yingying added as she walked over.\n\nAt that moment, on the road outside the shop,\n\nrows of taxis formed two columns, moving forward slowly. The procession was long, so long it seemed to stretch to the horizon.\n\nXu Qinglang pushed open the bookstore door and walked out. Zhou Ze and Bai Yingying followed him.\n\nNearly a thousand taxis had spontaneously organized into a convoy. The taxi drivers, male and female, had abandoned their usual habits of speeding and constantly overtaking.\n\nThis time,\n\nthey drove very, very slowly.\n\nAt the rear of the convoy,\n\nthere was a hearse. A dirge played from within.\n\nAt the same time, a large black-and-white photograph hung above the hearse. It was a funeral portrait of Chief Zhao.\n\n\"Is today his funeral?\" Xu Qinglang said, crestfallen. \"So when he said he was going on a business trip and that someone was coming to pick him up, he meant this funeral procession?\"\n\n\"But how could I not have seen that he was a ghost? And you couldn't see it either.\"\n\n\"Some people are alive, but they are already dead;\n\nsome people are dead, but they are still alive.\n\nPerhaps that's the reason why,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Sigh.\" Hearing this, Xu Qinglang nodded. He turned to the long procession of cars and waved. He was saying goodbye.\n\nAt the same time, he felt a sense of relief. No wonder it was so hard to get a taxi in Tongcheng today.\n\nZhou Ze watched the car with the funeral portrait slowly drive past.\n\nIn his heart, he said:\n\n\"May you have a safe journey.\"\n\n------\n\nThis story is based on a true event.",

    "content": "Xu Qinglang had originally planned to perform a ritual for Director Zhao, hoping to help him pass on more peacefully and as a way of showing his own respect.\n\nBut on second thought, Director Zhao had actually passed very peacefully. He was even afraid the road to the underworld would be too boring, so he specifically brought two books to read along the way.\n\nBesides, the procession of over a thousand taxis and many other citizens' cars, all spontaneously organized to see him off, was more than enough to see Director Zhao safely on his way. There was no need for him to add something unnecessary.\n\n\"Old Zhou, he was a really good person.\"\n\nXu Qinglang smoked his cigarette, the corners of his eyes a little red. It was a pitiable sight.\n\n\"He left with a clear conscience.\"\n\nEven though he had been a doctor in his past life and had saved and helped many people, Zhou Ze didn't consider himself particularly great. His profession was a doctor; saving the dying and healing the injured was simply his duty.\n\nIn fact, those ordinary yet great people in society are also just doing their jobs. But the radiance they possess isn't confined to just their work.\n\nThere are always some things that can move you, that can move many people.\n\nPeople often wonder if the eyes of the masses are truly discerning.\n\nBut those nearly one thousand cabbies, men and women, who formed a procession to clear the way—their hearts were crystal clear.\n\n\"I'm going to get some rest.\"\n\nXu Qinglang pulled out a tissue, wiped the tears from the corners of his eyes, and turned back to his noodle shop. He was going to have a drink, then get a good night's sleep. Strong people don't like to show their vulnerable side to others.\n\nAfter finishing his cigarette, Zhou Ze also walked back to the bookstore. The little loli had told him to improve sales, but Zhou Ze was as sluggish as ever.\n\nHe simply lacked the motivation. Besides, Zhou Ze was waiting for a result. The one in Rongcheng—what would their final outcome be?\n\nAlthough Zhou Ze himself felt the other party's chances of turning the tables were slim—the little loli had personally returned to Hell and even released the Faceless Woman to help, not to mention teaming up with many other Ghost Emissaries.\n\nBut,\n\nWhat if?\n\nWhat if?\n\nYes, what if!\n\nZhou Ze even genuinely considered and looked forward to the possibility that if the one in Rongcheng managed to kill the little loli, wouldn't her position naturally fall to him?\n\nA man has to have a dream.\n\nHe took out his phone and dialed a number. It was the Old Daoist's.\n\nThey hadn't been in contact since Zhou Ze had treated him to a meal last time.\n\nNo one answered on the other end. Zhou Ze put his phone down, but soon, the other party called back:\n\n\"Hey, big brother, I'm not in Tongcheng right now, I'm in Xucheng. What's up? Something you need?\"\n\n\"Oh.\"\n\nZhou Ze had originally wanted to have the Old Daoist remind that person to be careful, but on second thought, he didn't bother wasting his breath. He didn't even make small talk and just hung up the phone.\n\nThe Old Daoist on the other end was probably bewildered.\n\nIn that dream, the young man had clearly known he was being targeted. So, his reminder now would be superfluous.\n\nThe man already knew what was what.\n\nStretching, Zhou Ze saw that the little loli had woken up, returning to her dazed and cute state. Then her mother, having finished at the salon, returned to pick her up.\n\nIt was clear her mother's hairdo was a success. It still looked pretty much the same, but her whole complexion was rosier and more radiant, like dewdrops sprinkled on a flower pistil on an early summer morning, making her appear all the more mature and tender.\n\nWhen she got out of the car, her legs were parted wider as she walked.\n\nThe day's events should have ended there. Zhou Ze had been planning to take a shower and then prepare for the evening's business.\n\nThe little loli had said that keeping the Jiangshi, Bai Yingying, by his side was like putting a lampshade on an incandescent bulb—it would affect his chances of encountering ghosts. But Zhou Ze currently had no intention of sending Bai Yingying away.\n\nSleeping with a freezer was certainly not as comfortable as sleeping with Bai Yingying.\n\nBesides, Zhou Ze was getting tired of ghosts constantly coming to the bookstore. This was with Bai Yingying around; if she weren't, he'd probably have to deal with a whole horde of lost souls every night.\n\nZhou Ze felt he had become decadent. In his past life, he was so driven, so motivated.\n\nIn this life, he just wanted to drift by. But this lazy, aimless feeling, a life of doing nothing but reading and sprawling on the couch¹...\n\nIt felt so good.\n\nJust as Zhou Ze asked Bai Yingying to get him a change of clothes for a shower,\n\nSomeone pushed open the shop door. Zhou Ze turned around, slightly surprised by this person's arrival, because his daughter and wife had just left the store not long ago.\n\n\"I've come for a follow-up, to see how you've been doing lately.\"\n\nWang Ke naturally pulled out a plastic stool and sat down, gesturing for Zhou Ze to sit opposite him.\n\nHe had his own psychiatric hospital, and his fees were very high. So, for him to proactively make a follow-up visit to check on Zhou Ze for free was, in his and others' eyes, giving Zhou Ze a great deal of face.\n\nOf course, half of this 'face' was for the real Zhou Ze, and the other half was because Zhou Ze had saved his daughter.\n\nZhou Ze sat down across from Wang Ke,\n\ntrying his best to lower his gaze and not look at Wang Ke's head.\n\nBecause atop Wang Ke's head, the green light was intense, as if ten thousand horses were stampeding within.\n\nThe bookstore's computer was connected to a small Bluetooth speaker, randomly playing pop music. At that moment, it switched to Stefanie Sun's \"Green Light.\"\n\nEven the shuffle play was being cheeky these days.\n\n\"So, tell me, how have you been feeling lately?\" Wang Ke asked.\n\n\"I think I'm fine. The problem isn't that big anymore,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\n\"I can tell. You're very calm, and you seem to have things well in hand,\" Wang Ke nodded.\n\nHowever, a silence fell between them.\n\nZhou Ze found it strange. It seemed that the man hadn't specifically come for a follow-up on his condition; that was just a pretext.\n\n\"There's something I'd like to ask you to help with,\" Wang Ke said, speaking again.\n\n\"Go ahead.\"\n\nSetting aside their relationship in their past lives, just based on the advice and analysis he had given when treating him recently, Zhou Ze owed him a favor.\n\n\"I have a client with dissociative identity disorder. Her problem is rather complex and difficult to handle, so I need your help to assess and analyze the situation.\"\n\n\"That shouldn't be difficult for you, should it?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"It is,\" Wang Ke said with a wry smile. \"Her father is an important business partner of mine. My psychiatric hospital was opened with his investment.\n\nIf it were just a matter of helping the primary personality eliminate the secondary one, or vice versa, I have ways and means to attempt it.\n\nBut what complicates the problem is,\n\nfor my partner, his daughter's primary personality is, of course, his daughter herself. But the secondary personality is very similar to his wife.\"\n\n\"So... mother and daughter are living in one body?\"\n\n\"Yes. His wife passed away from an illness last year. He was heartbroken. His daughter is only sixteen this year. My analysis is that the girl, on a subconscious level, couldn't accept the fact that her mother was gone.\n\nSo, in her own consciousness, she slowly 'recreated' an image of her mother to accompany her.\n\nIf this problem had been discovered earlier, it would have been fine. But by the time it was truly discovered and taken seriously, it was already too late. The secondary personality had already taken shape and was very mature.\n\nDuring the day, she's the daughter. At night, she's the mother.\n\nDuring the day, she goes to school, plays computer games, and watches TV shows in her room.\n\nAt night, she wants to sleep in her father's bedroom. If my friend doesn't open the door, she'll cry outside, saying he has another woman and doesn't want to touch her anymore.\"\n\n\"Sounds interesting,\" Zhou Ze said with a smile.\n\nWang Ke's expression was a bit awkward. Zhou Ze's comment made him uncomfortable; joking about a patient was a very disrespectful thing to do.\n\n\"My apologies.\" Zhou Ze raised a hand to signal he had misspoken, but still said, \"So, how does your partner want to solve this problem?\"\n\nMake his \"wife\" die a second time,\n\nOr, let his daughter become his wife?\n\nA choice between two kinds of happiness.\n\nZhou Ze had also been a doctor in his past life. Logically, he shouldn't be thinking about this with such a teasing attitude, but in reality, Zhou Ze couldn't bring himself to be completely serious, especially since he had already deduced the father's thoughts from Wang Ke's description.\n\nThere were only three ways to solve the problem: keep the daughter, keep the \"wife,\" or keep both.\n\nOf course, there was another extreme method: get rid of both, but that was tantamount to murder, so it was out of the question.\n\nAs a doctor, you should only be responsible for your patient.\n\nIn his previous life, when Zhou Ze was saving people in the hospital, he often encountered external obstacles. For example, a pregnant woman had acute inflammation, but her family actually blocked the doctors from giving her an X-ray, afraid it would affect the child's health. But at the time, the situation was that both mother and child could very well die from the inflammation.\n\nIn this case, the so-called \"wife\" was merely a virtual personality, a sickness the daughter developed from missing her deceased mother.\n\nTherefore, helping the daughter move on and break free from the influence of the so-called secondary personality was the correct course of treatment.\n\nBut Wang Ke was hesitating. This meant the father had chosen the third option. He also loved his wife, also missed his wife, so he hoped that in his daughter, he could both see his daughter and feel that his wife was still alive.\n\n\"He loves his wife very much,\" Wang Ke said.\n\n\"But a lot of the time, love is just a disguise for selfishness.\"\n\n\"So, you're not willing to help?\"\n\n\"I don't know how I can help you.\"\n\n\"You are the most perfect case of a successful secondary personality takeover I have ever seen. I think you might be able to communicate with the mother's personality. Ensure they can continue to coexist harmoniously in one body. The problem now is that the two personalities are already showing signs of instability.\n\nThey will slowly start to intersect and become chaotic.\n\nAnd then, they'll turn into another, unfamiliar person.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, I can't do that.\" Zhou Ze looked at Wang Ke. \"Mr. Wang, I remember when my good friend Zhou Ze was alive, he told me you were a very upright and principled man.\"\n\nWang Ke frowned slightly but quickly relaxed, saying:\n\n\"People change. Without that investor's help, I wouldn't be where I am today.\"\n\nWang Ke stood up, apparently intending to leave. Since he couldn't persuade Zhou Ze, he had no reason to linger.\n\n\"I think I bought a lottery ticket and forgot to check the results,\" Zhou Ze said suddenly. \"Maybe I won five million. I should check now.\"\n\n\"The odds are too low,\" Wang Ke said with a small smile.\n\n\"Scratching lottery tickets... it's like looking at a paternity test. Everyone knows in their heart that the thing is probably useless, but you still can't help but take a look.\"\n\nAfter saying this, Zhou Ze smiled at Wang Ke and continued:\n\n\"Right?\"\n\n***\n¹ *Ge You-tang*, or \"Ge You-slouch,\" is a Chinese internet meme referring to a picture of actor Ge You slouched on a couch, representing a lazy, unmotivated lifestyle.",

    "content": "Three days had passed since he'd last turned down Wang Ke, and Zhou Ze had all but forgotten about it. For the past few days, Bai Yingying, with nothing better to do, had been going over to Xu Qinglang's restaurant to play computer games, while Xu Qinglang, in turn, came over to the bookstore to chat with Zhou Ze and read the paper.\n\nGranted, Chief Zhao had told Xu Qinglang before he left that it's best not to waste one's life coasting on property ownership, and Xu Qinglang had agreed.\n\nYes,\nslacking off certainly won't lead to success.\nBut,\nslacking off sure is comfortable.\n\nXu Qinglang had relapsed. For three days, aside from when Zhou Ze ate or he himself ate, the stove in his restaurant hadn't been lit once. He hadn't even opened his food delivery app; it was permanently set to \"Closed for Business.\"\n\nAround noon, just as Zhou Ze was taking a walk outside the bookstore after washing down his lunch with some strawberry juice, he saw that familiar red sedan driving over.\n\nThis left Zhou Ze a bit speechless. Only three days, and this woman needed her hair done again? Doing it so often could really damage the hair.\n\nSoon, the woman parked the car, but then, Wang Ke also got out.\n\nWang Ke jogged up to Zhou Ze, looked at him, and said:\n\n\"Help me.\"\n\nIt was simple.\nAnd direct.\nJust those two words.\n\nThere was no preamble, which meant those two words were a direct continuation of their last conversation—about the patient with the mother-daughter personas.\n\n\"Things have gotten worse. Her personalities are becoming chaotic,\" Wang Ke said urgently. \"You have to help me.\"\n\nZhou Ze shrugged.\nThe meaning was simple.\n*Sorry, but I still don't want to get involved in this.*\n\nWhat had been a simple one-plus-one-equals-two problem had been delayed into a much more serious illness. This was a man-made disaster, not a natural one.\n\nAnd in all of this, Wang Ke, by prioritizing his investor's interests, had abandoned his professional ethics and duties as a doctor.\n\n\"I don't have time.\" Zhou Ze pointed at his bookstore. \"I have to watch the shop.\"\n\n*Any excuse to refuse will do,* he thought. *It doesn't matter how flimsy it is.*\n\n\"What's your daily revenue? I'll pay you ten times that.\"\n\nWang Ke stated flatly,\n\"Come with me just this once. I think you can help. She almost succeeded in killing herself last night. If she hadn't been found early, she'd be a corpse by now!\"\n\nZhou Ze was in agony.\nHis neighbor was richer than him.\nHis wife¹ was richer than him.\nHis maid was also richer than him.\nAnd now his childhood friend was throwing out lines like \"What's your daily revenue? I'll give you ten times that.\"\n\nIt was soul-crushing.\nSo soul-crushing that Zhou Ze wanted to ask the \"little loli\" next time he saw her to go down below and check for him—was he just fated to be a poor bastard? How could he be so broke in both of his lives?\n\n\"This is a matter of principle. It can't be measured in money,\" Zhou Ze said, genuinely unwilling to go. He was a surgeon. To be honest, he only knew the barest rudiments of psychology.\n\n\"Come with me, just this once. Help me out!\"\nWang Ke grabbed Zhou Ze's hand.\n\nThe gesture made Zhou Ze uncomfortable.\nNot even Xu Qinglang, a man prettier than any woman, had ever done something like that to him. He immediately took a step back and tried to pull his hand away, but Wang Ke held on tightly.\n\nZhou Ze's brow furrowed slightly.\n*Was he really going to force him?*\n\nJust as Zhou Ze was about to get angry,\nWang Ke suddenly lowered his voice and said:\n\"A'Ze, help me!\"\n\nZhou Ze's eyes flew wide open, his gaze locked on Wang Ke.\n*What did he just call him?*\n\nWang Ke was taking one deep breath after another. \"If this isn't resolved, my career is finished. I won't lie to you; I was the one who advised my investor to opt for preserving both personalities. I told him I had the ability to handle the treatment and arrangements properly.\nNow, I'm panicking. I'm at my wit's end. You're the only one I can rely on.\"\n\n\"What did you just call me?\" Zhou Ze also lowered his voice.\n\nJust then, Xu Qinglang stepped out of his restaurant for a smoke. He saw the two men outside, holding hands, whispering intimately with their heads together.²\nHe sucked in a sharp breath, feeling a sudden ache in his teeth, and sighed,\n\"Such a public scandal, a scandal indeed.\"\n\nWang Ke's wife and Bai Yingying stood to the side, finding it hard to comprehend why their respective men were being so intimate and secretive.\n\n\"A'Ze, help me,\"\nWang Ke repeated.\n\nHe could see it.\nHe'd seen it long ago.\nBut he had been playing dumb.\nOr rather, he wasn't sure, and the discovery, the deduction, was too outrageous. But at this moment, he could only count on Zhou Ze's help.\n\nZhou Ze bit his lip, looked up, and then nodded.\nHe had agreed.\nHe had no choice but to agree.\n\nJust as he had gone to Wang Ke's house and used the name \"Zhou Ze,\" and Wang Ke had immediately dropped his most important work to help him, now it was reversed.\nWang Ke had called him by his name. In front of him, he was no longer Xu Le, but Zhou Ze, and so, there was no room left for refusal.\n\nAs childhood friends who had grown up together in an orphanage, even though they had mostly lost contact after finishing their studies and starting their careers, each battling away in their own fields, the memories of growing up together, of encouraging and supporting each other, were still real.\n\n\"Let's go. Get in the car.\"\nWang Ke impatiently opened the car door for Zhou Ze, who got in.\nWang Ke sat in the back with Zhou Ze, while the woman drove.\n\nInside the car, no one spoke for a long time.\nThe silence felt oppressive to the woman driving, but she didn't ask any questions.\nZhou Ze opened the window to let some air in, then said:\n\"How did you figure it out?\"\n\n\"We grew up together. Habits, little movements, details.\" As he spoke, Wang Ke tapped his own head with a finger. \"Besides, this is my profession.\"\n\nZhou Ze's lips curved into a smile, and he said no more.\n\nWang Ke continued, \"Help me sort this out, and I won't try to reminisce with you. I won't contact you again, and I won't bother you again. I don't have any other curiosity.\nYou can trust your big brother on that.\"\n\n\"Are you still... the you from before?\" Zhou Ze asked in return.\n\n\"Last time, a man named Xu Le knocked on my door in the middle of the night, saying he was referred by Zhou Ze. How did I respond?\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\nAfter a moment, Zhou Ze added, \"I'm a surgeon.\"\nThe implication was: *there's no point in bringing me here, I'm not a psychiatrist.*\nUnless the girl tried to kill herself again, he could certainly help with emergency treatment, but for anything else, he was truly powerless.\n\n\"I suspected for a while that it wasn't just dissociative identity disorder,\" Wang Ke said, glancing at his wife who was driving and lowering his voice.\n\n\"Oh?\" Zhou Ze paused,\nthen understood.\nWhat was so similar to \"dissociative identity disorder\"?\nDemonic possession!\n\n*No wonder Wang Ke came to me last time, saying my second personality could communicate with her second personality.*\n*Damn it.*\n*What he really meant was:*\n*You ghosts can talk to each other!*\n*Fuck!*\n\n***\n\nThis was Tongcheng's most high-end residential area, nestled at the foot of Wolf Mountain. It was a community of luxury villas. As their car drove in, several security guards at the gate saluted them.\nIt couldn't help but remind Zhou Ze of the complex he lived in during his past life, where the old gatekeeper in the guardhouse was usually skipping his shift and sleeping at night.\n\nOf course, Wang Ke had no idea that Zhou Ze was currently suffering the torment of the wealth gap; he just assumed Zhou Ze was feeling down because his identity had been exposed.\nThe car pulled up to the villa's entrance, and a young man, the butler, walked over.\n\"Dr. Wang, Mr. Zheng is already furious,\" the butler advised.\n\n\"Did something happen to Miss Zheng again?\" Wang Ke's face grew stern.\n\n\"No... it's just that...\" The young butler struggled for words, finally managing, \"There's no danger to her life. It wasn't a suicide attempt this time.\"\n\nWang Ke and Zhou Ze got out of the car and went straight up the stairs to the second floor. Wang Ke's wife didn't follow.\nThe second floor had many rooms, all connected by a red-carpeted hallway. The villa was huge, but the decor was neither gaudy nor ostentatious, showing that the owner was not some nouveau riche upstart. On the contrary, he seemed to be a man of refined taste.\n\nAfter turning a corner, Zhou Ze saw a middle-aged man with salt-and-pepper hair standing in front of a bedroom door. He held a cigar in his hand, a worried look on his face.\nWhen he saw Wang Ke and Zhou Ze approach, a flash of anger appeared in his eyes, but it was fleeting. It was quickly replaced by a warm yet helpless smile.\n\"Dr. Wang, Pingping is at it again...\"\n\n\"What happened, Mr. Zheng?\" Wang Ke asked, sounding anxious himself.\nHe was the physician responsible for Zheng Pingping's treatment. Now that things had gotten to this point, he couldn't escape the blame. He knew that the wealthy businessman before him was surely furious with him, but was restraining himself, knowing that losing his temper now would be pointless.\n\n\"See for yourself.\"\nMr. Zheng signaled for two young men at the door to open it. Wang Ke and Zhou Ze walked inside.\nTwo maids were inside looking on. In the center of the room, a young girl in a dress, her arms wrapped in cloth strips, was dancing gracefully. She was singing an aria from a classical opera in a stylized tone.\n\nWang Ke was stunned.\n\"How could this be?\"\n\nZhou Ze noticed the bandages on the girl's wrists; she must have just attempted to slash them but hadn't succeeded.\nAs she danced, the girl seemed to notice the two men who had entered. She immediately raised her voice, flicked a cloth strip, and pointed at Wang Ke, singing:\n\n\"A life fated to solitude, a jinx upon his forebears;\nA lifetime of bitter toil, for another's gains to bear.\nTo end with family scattered, abandoned and alone,\nIn sorrow and in misery, to suffer and to moan!\"\n\nAs she sang, the girl covered her face with her sleeve as if weeping in sorrow.\nWang Ke was baffled, having no idea what performance this was.\nBut Zhou Ze understood.\nThe girl then waved her sleeve toward Zhou Ze and sang:\n\n\"Alone and orphaned from his youth, in fear and misery;\nJust as he climbed the ladder high, a fall to hell did see.\nAn early death, a broken path, to the netherworld's dark shore,\na tragic tale to weep and wail...\"\n\nAs she sang,\nwailing and wailing,\nthe girl suddenly stopped short,\nas if an old tape recorder had just gotten stuck.\nThen, looking bewildered, she waved her long sleeve again and sang a new verse:\n\n\"Born with a handsome face, I see, but witless through and through!\nA man of pride should never kneel, a rule that's lost on you!\nTo end a life of nothingness, a journey all for...\"\n\nThis time,\nthe girl got stuck again.\nThen she let out a piercing scream.\nShe collapsed onto the floor in fright, a large wet patch spreading beneath her pants.\nPointing a trembling finger at Zhou Ze, her face a mask of terror, she shrieked:\n\"A ghost... a ghost...\nA GHOST!\"\n\n---\n¹The original text uses 媳婦兒 (xífùr), a term for wife that can sometimes be used more endearingly or informally for a serious partner.\n²The original uses two idioms: 耳鬢廝磨 (ěrbìnsīmó), implying romantic intimacy, and 交頭接耳 (jiāotóujiēěr), meaning whispering with heads close together.",

    "content": "The girl pointed at Zhou Ze and screamed at the top of her lungs, but fortunately, she was already frantic and delusional, unable to distinguish between her personalities. So for Zhou Ze, this so-called \"accusation\" had no effect whatsoever.\n\nNo one would believe the words of someone mentally unstable.\n\nBesides, even if a sane person said it, they'd be seen as mentally unstable.\n\nBut the words the girl had sung earlier, borrowing the cadence of \"Child's Play Opera,\"¹ might have seemed strange and nonsensical to others—nothing but wild talk. To Zhou Ze's ears, however, they held an unusual significance.\n\nWhat she was singing,\n\nwere judgments!\n\nThe so-called judgments are poetic verses that summarize a person's entire life, determining their past and also their future.\n\nFor example, in *Dream of the Red Chamber*, the line \"First compliance, then commands, then a man of wood; weeping toward Jinling, her sorrows compound\" is the judgment for Wang Xifeng.\n\n*A life of solitude, fated to outlive his parents;*\n\n*A lifetime of bitter toil, only to pave the way for others,*\n\n*Ultimately ending with his wife and child lost, abandoned by all, in sorrow, bitterness, and misery!*\n\nThis was about Wang Ke. Wang Ke, like him, had grown up in an orphanage. The meaning here was that Wang Ke was responsible for the death of his parents. After becoming an adult, he was too busy with his career to care for anything else. As for the last line, it was easy to understand: his wife would leave him and his child would be lost to him.\n\nZhou Ze suspected Wang Ke might have realized his wife was seeing someone else, but he hadn't confronted her. Also, his daughter had been chosen by a netherworld emissary to serve as a vessel.\n\nAnd then there was the judgment the girl sang about him:\n\n*Orphaned and alone since youth, adrift and in constant dread;*\n\n*Just as he began to climb the ladder to success, he met an early demise, plunging into the netherworld, a truly lamentable fate...*\n\nThis was referring to himself. An orphan, he had relied on his own abilities to become a department director before the age of thirty. Just as his career was taking off, he had died suddenly in a car accident.\n\nAs for \"blessed with a fine exterior, but a coarse rogue within,\" that referred to Xu Le being like gilded trash—all surface, no substance. He was decent-looking; otherwise, the Lin family's parents wouldn't have chosen him as a live-in son-in-law.\n\nHere, \"coarse rogue\" didn't mean a murderous bandit, but rather that aside from being handsome, Xu Le was essentially an empty-headed fool.\n\nThe original line, \"Though blessed with a fine exterior, he was a coarse rogue within,\" is from *Dream of the Red Chamber* and is a description of Jia Baoyu.\n\nActually, Zhou Ze felt the judgment's description of Xu Le was quite fitting. The Lin family was rich, truly rich. As a live-in son-in-law, it shouldn't have been difficult for Xu Le to start a business or enterprise. But the guy acted like a die-hard artsy type and opened a bookstore that only lost money.\n\nOf course, the girl's final stutter and terror were because she had actually seen two lives within him.\n\nOne was the physical body,\n\nthe other was the soul.\n\nIn that instant,\n\nshe understood: she had seen a ghost.\n\nThis made Zhou Ze smile faintly. In that case, the girl before him probably wasn't possessed by a ghost.\n\nHe wasn't so formidable as to scare a ghost into wetting itself, like he'd done to his sister-in-law.\n\nThe two nannies immediately rushed over to hold the girl down, constantly trying to soothe her.\n\nWang Ke also went over, attempting to calm her with words.\n\nZhou Ze, however, scanned his surroundings. This must have been the girl's original bedroom. With its pink theme and princess bed, it was very warm and lovely, but it was a pity its mistress was now in such a frantic state.\n\nWhat Zhou Ze found strange was, if this girl wasn't a ghost, then where did her \"Child's Play Opera\" and such precise judgments come from?\n\n\"Child's Play Opera\" was a local Tongcheng art form that only some elderly people listened to anymore. Most young people had probably never even heard of it, yet this girl had just performed it very professionally.\n\nCould it be that the chaotic fusion of her two personalities had created a new one, and this personality possessed such a special ability?\n\nDon't people often say that geniuses and madmen are separated by only a fine line?\n\nBut on second thought, that didn't seem right, though he couldn't put his finger on why.\n\n\"Where is my husband?\"\n\nJust then, the girl spoke in a very composed voice. She pushed away the nannies beside her and stood up.\n\n\"Has my husband returned home yet?\"\n\nWang Ke froze on the spot.\n\nZhou Ze's mouth also fell slightly agape.\n\nDid she just switch roles?\n\nHad she changed to her matriarch personality?\n\n\"Ah Qiu, I'm here.\" Mr. Zheng walked over at that moment, then gestured for everyone else to leave first. He needed to comfort his \"wife.\"\n\nStepping out onto the balcony, Zhou Ze lit a cigarette.\n\n\"What's going on?\" Wang Ke asked, standing beside Zhou Ze. His hopes now rested entirely on him.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. \"It's not ghost possession.\"\n\n\"Is it really a mental problem, then?\" Wang Ke licked his chapped lips. He was now in a bind he couldn't get out of.\n\nIn fact, if he had insisted on his principles as a doctor and provided psychological treatment to the girl from the start, things might never have developed to this point.\n\nBut it was too late to say any of that now.\n\nHowever, this wasn't entirely Wang Ke's fault. He wanted to secure the support of his investor, so naturally, he would go to great lengths to please him.\n\nBesides, the way Mr. Zheng had immediately come in after hearing his daughter switch to his wife's personality, and the tone in which he called out \"Ah Qiu,\" showed that more than half of the problem stemmed from the man himself.\n\n\"What's this room for?\" Zhou Ze asked, pointing to the room next to the bedroom. It was draped in white gauze, and its floor-to-ceiling windows were covered tightly.\n\nFor some reason, Zhou Ze felt that there was something inside that made him uncomfortable.\n\n\"That is the young miss's art studio,\" the young butler standing nearby said.\n\n\"Oh, may I go in and take a look?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"This...\" The butler looked hesitant, then glanced at Wang Ke.\n\n\"Let him take a look,\" Wang Ke nodded. \"Learning more about the young miss's situation will help with the treatment.\"\n\n\"Very well.\"\n\nThe butler immediately went to get the key, unlocked the door, and then stood outside while Zhou Ze and Wang Ke walked in.\n\n\"You loved to draw when you were little. I remember you once told me you wanted to be an artist,\" Wang Ke said, a hint of nostalgia in his voice.\n\n\"The orphanage didn't have the means for that back then,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nFor Zhou Ze in his situation at the time, studying art was truly unrealistic. That was why, after his college entrance exams, he chose medical school to make it easier to find a job and support himself.\n\n\"Don't worry. No matter how this turns out, I won't bother you again,\" Wang Ke said with a bitter smile. \"To be honest, I'm scared too. The last time I came looking for you, my nerves were completely frayed.\"\n\n*Your daughter is a netherworld emissary. If you knew that, you'd probably faint on the spot.*\n\nJust then, the butler called from the doorway, \"Dr. Wang, Mr. Zheng is looking for you.\"\n\n\"I'll go see what's up. I'll take you with me when I leave later,\" Wang Ke said, leaving the studio and leaving Zhou Ze alone.\n\nZhou Ze wandered around the art studio by himself, looking at the paintings on the floor and walls, somewhat lost in thought. To be honest, although these works were clearly by a young artist, each one seemed to possess a unique spiritual quality, showcasing the artist's inherent talent.\n\nFinally, Zhou Ze stopped in front of an easel draped in a black cloth. Without the slightest hesitation, he reached out and yanked the cloth away. Instantly, Zhou Ze's pupils contracted sharply.\n\nThe painting on the easel was of a human skull.\n\nIt didn't seem particularly special, as such skull portraits could easily be found online.\n\nBut this skull gave Zhou Ze a heart-stopping feeling, and even his breathing seemed to slow to a halt.\n\nIt was a peculiar sensation, an unusual resonance.\n\nAfter taking several deep breaths to calm himself, Zhou Ze was able to examine the painting more closely. He then noticed that the skull in the painting had a three-dimensional quality, especially on the far left, where there was a spatial fold.\n\nIt was like the difference between a flat drawing of a book cover and a 3D rendering of it.\n\nThis was a copy. The girl's previous works had been in a gentle, idyllic style, but this one was completely different from her previous style!\n\nJudging from the painting,\n\nshe must have been copying a book, or maybe a small booklet?\n\nAnd the cover of that book or booklet was this very skull.\n\nZhou Ze began to search the room. The girl must have placed the object in front of her to copy it, so it was highly likely that the object was here in the studio.\n\nSoon, Zhou Ze discovered a small, unlocked cabinet in the corner of the studio. He opened it and found some illustration albums and drawing books inside. After flipping through them, Zhou Ze finally found what he was looking for: a booklet, only the size of his palm, that looked a bit like a driver's license.\n\nHe held it up in front of him. The front was the same skull, identical to the one in the painting.\n\nThere was no doubt. What the girl had been copying was this.\n\nZhou Ze subconsciously opened the booklet, but the moment it was opened,\n\nthe girl, who had just fallen asleep in the adjacent bedroom, suddenly snapped her eyes open. A flash of crimson appeared in them, and she leaped straight off the bed. If not for the quick reflexes of the several nannies beside her who grabbed her, she might have charged out of the bedroom.\n\n\"Uungh... uunnggh...\"\n\nThe girl struggled frantically, her nails scratching several bloody lines across the nannies' faces.\n\n\"What is it now!\"\n\nMr. Zheng ran back into the bedroom again, his heart aching as he looked at his daughter's state.\n\nAnd just a wall away, Zhou Ze remained frozen, holding the booklet open.\n\nHowever, in Zhou Ze's mind, a succession of men and women, old and young, appeared in a flash. They appeared quickly and vanished just as fast, but with each one, several lines of black, brush-written characters would materialize beside them, inscribed with their life judgments.\n\nFor a moment, the terrifying amount of information made Zhou Ze's head spin.\n\n\"Hiss...\"\n\nSuddenly, Zhou Ze threw his head back and sucked in a sharp breath, simultaneously snapping the booklet shut.\n\nThis was no ordinary skull-themed trinket.\n\nIt recorded countless departed souls and the summaries of their lives.\n\nIt was something Zhou Ze had never seen before.\n\nIt was then that Zhou Ze noticed a scorched mark in the center of the skull on the booklet's cover.\n\nZhou Ze subconsciously touched the mark with his fingernail.\n\nAt that very moment, Zhou Ze's black fingernail seemed to grow uncontrollably. A black aura from the nail coiled into the booklet, and the entire booklet became unbearably hot. Yet he couldn't drop it; it felt as if it had been branded into his flesh.\n\nIn the next room, the girl who had been struggling wildly suddenly fell silent, as if finally granted release, and collapsed into a deep sleep.\n\nThe painful sensation didn't last long, but it was enough to leave Zhou Ze drenched in sweat, as if he had just been subjected to torture by a hot iron!\n\n*Thud...*\n\nThe booklet fell from Zhou Ze's hand.\n\nZhou Ze hung his head, beads of sweat dripping continuously to the floor.\n\nBut he saw that on the back of the previously plain black cover, two lines of distinct, blood-red words had appeared:\n\n\"The Netherworld has its order,\n\nThe Yellow Springs can be crossed.\"\n\n***\n\n**Footnotes:**\n\n1.  **Child's Play Opera (童子戲 Tóngzǐ Xì):** A real, though now obscure, form of local folk opera from the Tongcheng region of Anhui province, known for its unique singing style.",

    "content": "Picking up the booklet, this time, Zhou Ze didn't feel it was scalding hot. Instead, it had a gentle, cool sensation, as if he were holding a piece of ancient jade.\n\nA strange connection seemed to have formed between himself and the booklet.\n\nZhou Ze had read some fantasy cultivation novels before, but the feeling he had now wasn't like the trope of a magical artifact recognizing its master.\n\nThe booklet was still the booklet,\n\nHe was still he,\n\nBut inexplicably, Zhou Ze felt a sense of intimacy toward this thing from the bottom of his heart, like a thirty-year-old man holding a photograph of himself from when he was three or five.\n\nUnfamiliar, yet incredibly familiar.\n\nFlipping to the first page, that torrential flood of images washed over him again. Zhou Ze closed his eyes, and then, all the chaotic things vanished.\n\nLast time, he had been passively indoctrinated.\n\nThis time, it seemed he could control the flow.\n\nFinally, the first page was open. On it was a handprint. Zhou Ze wasn't sure if it was his own or someone else's, and he had no way of making a detailed fingerprint comparison now. But in truth, this handprint was exceedingly strange; Zhou Ze even felt that no one in the world could possibly have such a handprint.\n\nThe lines of the handprint were so harmonious you couldn't find the slightest flaw, and it was impeccably neat. Every detail achieved a very pleasing effect.\n\nBelow it were two lines.\n\nFirst line: Name: Zhou Ze.\n\nSecond line: Position: Temporary Ghost Emissary.\n\nActually, Zhou Ze had already had an inkling. This was likely a so-called Ghost Emissary ID—or, to be precise, an Underworld ID. After all, the Underworld was its own little society; the sparrow may be small, but it has all its vital organs. Ghost Emissaries were just one of the many positions within it.\n\nBack then, Zhou Ze had discussed his current situation with Xu Qinglang. It was very clear that his status as a temp worker was precarious; he could be used as a scapegoat at any moment, and he had absolutely no security or status to speak of.\n\nWhen the little loli had returned last time, she had directly admitted this point when he questioned her.\n\nAt the same time, she had casually offered him a grand, empty promise, not caring in the least whether he was willing to take it.\n\nThe root cause of it all was that he was missing this very ID!\n\nWith this ID in hand, he wouldn't be off the books.\n\nMost importantly, this ID meant he had obtained a so-called \"performance review\" system. Just like the creation and development of the imperial examination system in ancient times, it opened up a channel for promotion from the bottom to the top.\n\nDuring the few months he had been running the bookstore, Zhou Ze had been very lazy. It wasn't that he was lazy by nature, but that given his previous awkward status, doing more could easily lead to more mistakes, while doing nothing had no major consequences.\n\nIt was a mindset similar to those money-losing, state-owned enterprises from a decade or two ago.\n\nNow, at least he could set a small goal for himself.\n\nA hundred million was out of the question,\n\nBut there was hope that through his own efforts, he could raise his rank a little.\n\nEven a female ghost like Lady Bai, who had protected her hometown for two hundred years, could accumulate enough merit to return to Hell and secure a position. His own starting point, in truth, was much better than Lady Bai's.\n\nHowever, what made Zhou Ze a little uncomfortable was, why was his current position still just \"Temporary Ghost Emissary\"?\n\nZhou Ze knew this definitely wasn't some ID that heaven had—\n*biu*\n—sent him on account of his \"diligence,\" \"devotion to duty,\" \"utmost effort,\" and \"service until death.\"\n\nZhou Ze was also well aware that with his previous work ethic—working one day and slacking off for two, just drinking tea, reading novels, and sleeping with Bai Yingying at night—the heavens not smiting a malevolent creature like him to bits with a lightning bolt was already showing immense mercy. How could they possibly reward him at a time like this?\n\nThis was someone else's Underworld ID,\n\nBut he just happened to have picked it up.\n\nNo, to be precise, Zheng Pingping had picked it up. But Zheng Pingping was a living person, an ordinary person. She was completely unable to command this thing. On the contrary, she was afflicted by it, her mind thrown into chaos.\n\nCoupled with the shock of her mother's passing, it led to Zheng Pingping's behavior becoming abnormal.\n\nShe had lost her sense of self, because this booklet contained the verdicts of who knows how many departed souls. It was like making you read the lives of thousands upon thousands of people all at once.\n\n*Zhuangzi dreaming he was a butterfly*, or *the woodcutter who returned to his village to find centuries had passed*¹—these basically described the situation.\n\nYou lose yourself, ignoring all the changes around you. You were a grain of sand, and then a great river washes over you. Forget about others; could you even find yourself anymore?\n\nHowever, now that he had \"stolen\" this thing, it should also mean that the connection between Zheng Pingping and the ID had been severed. Her psychological condition should recover quickly.\n\nBut the crux of the problem was, Zhou Ze didn't believe the previous owner of this thing was also a \"Temporary Ghost Emissary.\"\n\nA temporary ghost emissary's performance record was this exaggerated?\n\nWas everyone in Hell a model worker, a paragon of the era?\n\nWere they all damn workaholics?\n\nLooking at that lazy little loli, she was actually quite similar to him. Otherwise, she wouldn't have dumped her workload on him to go earn some extra cash on the side.\n\nLooking closely, Zhou Ze noticed a faint white smudge over the spots where his name and \"Temporary Ghost Emissary\" were written. It looked a bit like it had been covered with correction fluid.\n\nZhou Ze reached out and rubbed it, even scraped it with his fingernail, but nothing came off. The white smudge remained a white smudge.\n\nThis was starting to trigger his obsessive-compulsive side. The truth lay right beneath that white smudge.\n\nThe original owner's information must have been written there, but that original owner had likely already croaked. He had inherited the ID, and the official title and other information on it had thus been \"refreshed.\"\n\nZhou Ze even considered asking Bai Yingying to try scrubbing it with Tide laundry detergent when he got back to the bookstore.\n\nThe booklet had several pages. When Zhou Ze turned to the second page, he saw a very simple line of text:\n\n\"Eight Percent\"\n\n\"Is this an experience bar?\" Zhou Ze subconsciously reached up and touched his nose.\n\nActually, ancient China had long had expressions for \"fractions.\" Of course, not in the way people use Arabic numerals with a numerator, denominator, and a line, but described directly in this manner.\n\nThe *Records of the Grand Historian: The Book of Celestial Offices* contains writings like \"...three parts two... nine parts eight...\" \"Three parts two\" meant \"two-thirds,\" and \"nine parts eight\" meant \"eight-ninths.\"\n\nThe \"Eight Percent\" here meant eight percent.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head, a little ashamed. Before, he hadn't cared much about the little loli's anger over his laziness and slacking, thinking she was making a big deal out of nothing.\n\nBut looking at it now, in the past two months, he had only completed eight percent of the tasks required of a Temporary Ghost Emissary.\n\nHe really had been lazy.\n\nAt the same time, Zhou Ze wondered if this meant that if he completed the other ninety-two percent to make it a hundred, his \"Temporary Ghost Emissary\" status would become official?\n\nGoing from a contract worker to a tenured employee?\n\nZhou Ze hadn't cared much about this before. In his past life, he'd even been disdainful of those who desperately tried to worm their way into the system. Some of his classmates' families had spent hundreds of thousands to get them in, only for them to earn two or three thousand a month, yet they still felt superior and smug, thinking that their other classmates still struggling to build careers in Beijing, Shanghai, or Guangzhou were just migrant workers.\n\nBut now, Zhou Ze felt a deep sense of urgency about getting rid of the word \"Temporary\" and entering the Hell establishment!\n\nIt meant a sense of security. It meant being able to sleep soundly at night without worrying about not seeing the next day's sun.\n\nPerhaps those classmates of his from before were also seeking this kind of security. After all, of the three hundred and sixty trades, none was more stable than the \"iron rice bowl.\"\n\nZhou Ze tried to turn to the next page, but found that the pages below were stuck together. No matter how he tried, he couldn't separate them.\n\nPerhaps,\n\nit was because of his current rank, he wasn't qualified to view the information on the subsequent pages?\n\nPutting away the ID, Zhou Ze stretched.\n\nWang Ke was still in the adjacent bedroom. Zheng Pingping had regained consciousness and was slowly coming to her senses. Wang Ke was thrilled and excited. As a veteran psychologist, he could keenly perceive that Zheng Pingping's condition was rapidly improving!\n\nHe didn't know what had caused it, but he was subconsciously putting on a show of \"working hard.\"\n\nZhou Ze walked out of the art studio, lit another cigarette, and thought about how he was going to strive hard when he got back to the bookstore. When he had nothing else to do, he'd set up a stall at the entrance with some incense and cold food to attract some wandering ghosts.\n\nWhen the time came, regardless of the circumstances, he would send them all to Hell for reincarnation.\n\nFor instance, that mother from last time who wanted to stay until her son finished his college entrance exams—if Zhou Ze ran into her again, he would definitely not just casually wave his hand and let her leave on her own.\n\nYou could say it was a bit callous, but the primitive accumulation of capital is just this bloody.\n\nTo get his official status sooner,\n\nZhou Ze would really do whatever it took.\n\nJust then, Zhou Ze saw Wang Ke's wife and the young butler standing by the stairwell, talking about something. Zhou Ze didn't get too close, but his ears caught words like \"when to get her hair done again.\"\n\nAnd frankly, seeing the slightly coy, forced-calm expression on Wang Ke's wife's face, everything was self-evident.\n\nModern butlers were different from those of the past. It was a new, high-paying profession, generally only found in upscale residential areas like this one. They were high-level service personnel, with a prestige no less than that of \"flight attendants\" in people's eyes a decade or so ago.\n\nOf course, Zhou Ze wasn't going to run over and start shouting, denouncing the \"adulterous pair.\" Wang Ke had probably figured something out, but since he, the person involved, was deliberately not exposing it, Zhou Ze, as an outsider, had no reason to help.\n\nBut as his childhood friend, seeing Wang Ke being cheated on naturally made Zhou Ze feel a little uncomfortable.\n\nMr. Zheng was standing on the balcony, smoking a cigar. His expression had relaxed slightly, because Wang Ke had just told him that his daughter's condition had greatly improved.\n\n\"Where are you employed, Mr. Xu?\" Mr. Zheng was finally in the mood to chat with Zhou Ze.\n\n\"I run a small bookstore,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\nHe had no choice. Facing a rich tycoon like this, he could only try to act cultured.\n\n\"Oh, very good, very good. I'll have to pay a visit when I have the chance,\" Mr. Zheng said politely.\n\nZhou Ze took the opportunity to ask, \"Was Miss Zheng incontinent just now? I'm no expert, but I do know some formulas for regulating the mind and body, and reinforcing one's foundation.\"\n\nHearing this, Mr. Zheng's face suddenly darkened. As a wealthy businessman, he certainly didn't lack good traditional Chinese medicine doctors. What angered him was that Zhou Ze had just said his daughter was incontinent right to his face!\n\nShe was only incontinent of urine once,\n\nand there was no poop!\n\n\"Thank you for your kind offer, sir, but my daughter is just a bit mentally fatigued. There's nothing wrong with her physically.\"\n\nOne doesn't hit a smiling face. Since Zhou Ze was offering to help with a prescription, Mr. Zheng couldn't very well get angry with him.\n\nA look of obvious surprise appeared on Zhou Ze's face. He said,\n\n\"Oh, no? But the butler was just over there talking to someone about it, saying the young miss's pants were full of...\"\n\nAt this point,\n\nZhou Ze realized it was perhaps improper and inappropriate to say such a thing. He immediately laughed it off.\n\n\"It's good that the young miss is fine. It's good that she's fine.\"\n\n---\n¹ *Zhuangzi dreaming he was a butterfly* and *the woodcutter who returned to his village to find centuries had passed* (the legend of Wang Zhi, or \"Lan Ke Ren\") are famous classical Chinese stories about the blurring of reality, identity, and the passage of time.",

    "content": "Mr. Zheng asked the two of them to stay for dinner, but Zhou Ze declined, and so did Wang Ke, who put on the air of a hero hiding his deeds and identity. Zhou Ze didn't call him out on it; he knew his childhood friend needed this favor from the investor, so he let him have his way.\n\nOn the way back, Zhou Ze didn't see the young butler. However, Zhou Ze knew that after he had \"unintentionally\" let it slip, Mr. Zheng had said a few words to his two attendants, and then the butler had disappeared.\n\nWang Ke's wife was driving, looking somewhat distracted as she glanced at her phone from time to time.\n\nWang Ke himself was immersed in the emotional aftermath of \"surviving a disaster.\" With Miss Zheng's condition rapidly improving, the pressure on him was lifted.\n\nZhou Ze didn't tell Wang Ke about the butler or how he'd deliberately badmouthed him in front of Mr. Zheng. It was just something he'd done on a whim, and he wasn't about to go asking for credit.\n\nThe key issue was that Zhou Ze didn't know which way Wang Ke's loyalties leaned. Although they were childhood friends, many years had passed. Everyone has their own experiences and, naturally, their own changes.\n\nWhat if, after he told him, Wang Ke thought:\n\n\"I treat you like a brother, but you want to take off the green hat on my head!\"¹\n\nDespicable,\n\nInsolent,\n\nUnforgivable!\n\nWhat then?\n\nLooking again at Wang Ke's wife driving, his sister-in-law,² Zhou Ze gave a slight smirk.\n\nTruly,\n\nA wife's heart is like a knife.\n\nHis phone rang. Zhou Ze answered it. It was his sister-in-law.\n\n\"Hello.\"\n\n\"Hey, Xu Le, my sister has started going back to work,\" his sister-in-law said.\n\n\"Oh,\" Zhou Ze replied unhurriedly.\n\n\"She hasn't been feeling well recently. You should go see her. Don't let her get too tired,\" his sister-in-law added.\n\n\"Oh.\"\n\n\"I say, what's with you? This young lady is tipping you off, and not only are you not grateful, you're not showing the slightest bit of excitement.\n\nOh, oh, oh, my ass!\n\nLet me tell you, you still haven't explained that Maserati business!\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. His sister-in-law was genuinely trying to help him. The reason was simple: lately, when she went out to have fun, her excuse was that she was at his bookstore studying.\n\nHer own sister was too busy with work, and while her brother-in-law was a good-for-nothing, at least this good-for-nothing was a college graduate and could help with her homework.\n\nIt was a good reason, and a good excuse.\n\nEven the Lin parents, who had never approved of Xu Le, tacitly accepted their younger daughter going to the bookstore for tutoring.\n\nSometimes Zhou Ze really had to resist the urge to go to the Lin family home, point at the Lin parents' noses, and tell them that forget a college graduate,\n\neven if you asked a current sophomore or junior to tutor a high school student, how many of them do you think could actually do it?\n\nBut his sister-in-law did have some conscience. That silly girl, judging from recent events, besides being a bit foolish, was an alright person.\n\nAnd now, here she was, making a special call to tip him off.\n\n\"Alright, thanks a lot,\" Zhou Ze said perfunctorily.\n\n\"Hmph. By the way, I'm coming over to read at your place again tonight,\" his sister-in-law added.\n\nAfter hanging up, Zhou Ze stretched, only to realize with a start that the car was just passing the west gate of the People's Hospital.\n\nWhat a coincidence.\n\nHe had no intention of going.\n\nOf course, Zhou Ze didn't ask Wang Ke's wife to stop. He just pretended he hadn't seen it, not wanting to press his luck.\n\nDr. Lin was back at work, which meant she had gotten over some of it. But Zhou Ze had just gotten his credentials and was preparing to go all out to secure a permanent position as soon as possible. For the time being, he didn't have the energy for other distractions.\n\nHowever, Wang Ke's wife took the initiative to turn the car into the hospital.\n\n\"My father-in-law was recently hospitalized. I'm just stopping by to see him. It'll be quick,\" Wang Ke said apologetically to Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Forget it, I'll just get going.\"\n\nZhou Ze pushed the door open and got out of the car.\n\nWang Ke got out as well. His wife drove the car into the hospital's underground parking garage.\n\n\"You'll take a taxi back?\" Wang Ke asked.\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"Alright then. Brother, take care.\" Wang Ke reached out and clapped Zhou Ze on the shoulder. \"I won't come looking for you on my own initiative again. But if you need anything, you can come find me.\"\n\n\"You're too kind,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nAfter speaking, Wang Ke took another long, hard look at Zhou Ze, then turned and walked toward the inpatient building.\n\nZhou Ze silently lit a cigarette. People really do change.\n\nWang Ke was a few years older than him and had entered the workforce earlier. The Wang-ge, Erdan-ge³ of his past now seemed somewhat unfamiliar to Zhou Ze.\n\nAt his wits' end, he didn't hesitate to consult ghosts and gods.\n\nSigh.\n\nZhou Ze blew out a smoke ring. After a moment's thought, he still walked into the emergency building ahead.\n\nIf he hadn't heard his sister-in-law's tip-off, he could have avoided coming.\n\nWhen the car passed the hospital, he could have pretended not to see.\n\nBut now that he was physically at the hospital, not going to see his own wife seemed a bit hard to justify.\n\n*Before, I had an obsession, but she wouldn't sleep with me.*\n\n*Hasn't that obsession disappeared now?*\n\n*No, wait, it seems like after that obsession disappeared, some other strange problem has appeared.*\n\n\"You can't even get it up, what's the use of thinking so much? Get lost!\"\n\nA woman's cold voice came from behind Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze took a deep breath and turned, feeling the urge for his fingernails to grow out.\n\n\"Hey, honey, didn't the doctor say there's nothing wrong with me? Maybe it's because you don't dress sexy enough, and you're not proactive enough in bed. You can't find my G-spot.\"\n\n\"Get lost! I'm not willing to serve you. You can't handle things in bed yourself and you need my help? Are you even a man?\"\n\nThe man and woman had probably just come from the urology department and were in the middle of an argument.\n\nZhou Ze's expression was a bit pained.\n\nAt this moment,\n\nIt was as if that diligent crow had appeared again, flying over his head,\n\nletting out a \"Caw... caw... caw...\"\n\nOn the ground, a fallen leaf just happened to appear, blown by the wind, tumbling over Zhou Ze's foot.\n\nZhou Ze no longer wanted to go to the emergency building.\n\nHe felt he should give Dr. Lin more time to think, to accept, to adapt, and he shouldn't be stimulating her at a time like this.\n\nYes,\n\nHe should be more considerate of her, give her more time and space. He couldn't force her.\n\nZhou Ze nodded, feeling that he had convinced himself, and prepared to leave.\n\nBut just then, an ambulance drove into the hospital. Then Zhou Ze saw several doctors and nurses run out of the emergency building, among them a familiar figure.\n\nDr. Lin also saw Zhou Ze and froze for a moment. Zhou Ze gave her a slight smile, walked over, and said gently:\n\n\"I was just about to come up and see you.\"\n\nDr. Lin suddenly clutched her lower abdomen and sat down on the steps.\n\n\"What's wrong? Are you not feeling well?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nDr. Lin shook her head. \"It's nothing.\"\n\n\"What's actually wrong with your body?\" Zhou Ze asked in detail. He remembered his sister-in-law telling him that Dr. Lin had been unwell these past few days.\n\n\"It's a woman's thing,\" Dr. Lin said, lowering her head.\n\nThe ice queen, at this moment, showed a hint of shyness.\n\n*She's on her period?*\n\nZhou Ze was speechless. Perhaps, for a silly girl like his sister-in-law, getting her period was the most painful thing in the world.\n\n\"Dr. Lin, the patient's condition is a bit serious. It's a pregnant woman.\"\n\nA young male doctor came rushing over with a stretcher. He seemed a little nervous. Then, when he saw Zhou Ze, his expression changed, and he immediately said:\n\n\"You're here too?\"\n\nThe last time Zhou Ze had come to the hospital, he had performed a rescue surgery and incidentally confessed to Dr. Lin. This young man was the intern who had been at a complete loss that day.\n\n\"Let's go inside first. I'll take a look.\"\n\nDr. Lin forced herself to stand, preparing to check the patient's condition.\n\nZhou Ze had no choice but to follow them inside.\n\nAfter they entered the emergency building, the young girl accompanying the pregnant woman kept asking the male intern questions. The intern couldn't quite handle it and was in a panic.\n\n\"Do you even know how to treat patients? Hurry up! Can't you see how much pain my sister is in? How is the baby? My brother is already thirty, it wasn't easy for them to have this child, do you know how hard it was!\"\n\n\"I... you wait... let me check again...\" The male intern started to get nervous, even dropping his clipboard.\n\n\"You what? Hey, are there no other doctors here? You can't just be so reckless with people's lives!\" the young woman continued to shout.\n\n\"I'll go take a look.\" Dr. Lin, from behind, quickened her pace to check on the situation, but after a few steps, she grimaced in pain again.\n\n\"Your problem is a bit serious,\" Zhou Ze said. \"Your diet has been irregular lately, and it's weakened your body.\"\n\nDr. Lin didn't say anything, but continued to walk toward the patient.\n\n\"Forget it, I'll go have a look.\" Zhou Ze reached out and patted Dr. Lin on the lower back.\n\n\"You...\" Dr. Lin felt this was somewhat inappropriate.\n\n\"You don't trust my medical skills?\" Zhou Ze smiled. \"After all, I'm the one who trained you.\"\n\n*It's just that, back then, I never expected you'd become this beautiful. It's my fault for being blind.*\n\nZhou Ze took the initiative to walk over to the patient, preparing to examine her.\n\nThe young woman immediately shouted, \"Who are you? Hey, what are you doing!\"\n\nZhou Ze wasn't wearing a white coat.\n\n\"Doctor, please come take a look,\" the intern said, as if he had found his savior.\n\nZhou Ze glanced at the young woman and said, \"I was about to go home. If you don't want me to look, I'll leave.\"\n\nThe young woman immediately put on a fawning smile. \"I'm sorry, I was wrong. Please take a look at my sister. It's not her due date yet.\"\n\nZhou Ze took the gloves from the intern's hand, then performed an examination and asked:\n\n\"How far along is the pregnancy?\"\n\n\"28 weeks,\" the young girl answered for her sister.\n\nThe intern looked at Zhou Ze, assisting from the side.\n\n\"Premature rupture of membranes, cervix fully dilated, and severe contamination of the amniotic fluid,\" Zhou Ze said as he took off his gloves.\n\n\"This... this means... it's...\" The young girl was terrified.\n\n\"Premature birth,\" Zhou Ze uttered the two words, then said to the intern, \"Notify obstetrics to prepare for surgery.\"\n\n\"Okay.\" The intern immediately took out his phone and made the call.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head with some exasperation. This guy was lucky he hadn't been assigned to him for his internship. Otherwise, given his temper with Dr. Lin back in the day, he might have berated this kid into changing careers. He was just so clumsy.\n\n\"Premature birth?\" Hearing this, the young girl was stunned. She then grabbed Zhou Ze's arm and said, \"Doctor, I'm begging you, please save my sister, save the baby in her belly. It wasn't easy for my brother to have this child, it really wasn't easy.\"\n\nZhou Ze was unmoved. As a doctor, he had seen this kind of thing many times. If he cried every time, all doctors would probably shrivel up into human jerky.\n\n\"Then you should go ask your brother what's going on. It wasn't easy to have a child, so how did it end up like this?\"\n\n\"Doctor, what on earth happened?\" The young woman couldn't quite understand.\n\n\"This was caused by unhygienic and overly vigorous sex during pregnancy, with a large amount of internal ejaculation.\"\n\nZhou Ze looked at the woman on the hospital bed and asked:\n\n\"A man's a beast when he gets worked up, but couldn't you have tried to reason with him for the sake of the child in your belly?\"\n\nShe was almost thirty weeks pregnant. Couldn't they hold back for that long?\n\nThe pregnant woman on the bed didn't speak, looking very nervous and frightened.\n\nBut the young girl who came with her exploded, shouting:\n\n\"That's impossible! My brother went to Beijing to work before the New Year to earn money for baby formula. He hasn't been back in six months!\"\n\n\"I fell in love with a wild horse, but my home has no grasslands...\"⁴\n\nThe male intern's phone rang. He immediately answered it, then said to Zhou Ze:\n\n\"Obstetrics says the operating room is ready.\"\n\n***\n**Footnotes:**\n\n¹ A \"green hat\" is a common Chinese expression for being cuckolded.

Otherwise, you're being irresponsible.\"\n\n\"I can handle it.\" Dr. Lin shook her head, still a bit stubborn.\n\n\"My point is, in your physical condition, you're being irresponsible *to your patients*.\"\n\n\"...\" Dr. Lin was speechless.\n\n\"Heh.\" Zhou Ze licked his lips and said apologetically, \"Sorry, I unconsciously slipped back into my old self.\"\n\n\"It's fine,\" Dr. Lin said softly.\n\n\"Go home and rest. Come back to work after you've recovered. A doctor's job is important, sure, but it's not like society will stop functioning if there's one less doctor on duty for a while.\"\n\nDr. Lin nodded.\n\nJust then, Zhou Ze's phone rang. He checked the caller ID; it was Xu Qinglang.\n\nHe stood up, walked out to the hallway entrance, and answered the phone.\n\n\"Hello, what's up?\"\n\n\"Business is good at your place today. You should hurry back and take a look,\" Xu Qinglang said, yawning.\n\n\"Business is good?\" Zhou Ze was pleased. He had just gotten his license, and his performance quota was already walking in the door?\n\n\"Alright, I'll be right back.\"\n\nZhou Ze decided that this time, no matter how many stories more tragic than the *Injustice to Dou E*¹ the lost souls in the bookstore told, he would be impartial as iron and send the lot of them to hell.\n\nThey were lost souls.\n\nSending them to hell was their proper path. Being impartial as iron, there was no psychological burden.\n\n\"If you have something to do, go ahead.\" Dr. Lin pointed to her office. \"I'll go home by myself later.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded and said no more. Right now, nothing was more important than officially ending his probationary period. As for his relationship with Dr. Lin, that could develop slowly.\n\nThe elevators in the emergency building were packed even at night, so Zhou Ze simply chose to take the stairs. When he reached the third floor, he suddenly stopped.\n\nFor some reason, he had a feeling someone was following him.\n\nCould it be Dr. Lin, wanting to look at him a bit longer but too embarrassed, secretly following him from behind?\n\nOkay, while that was a possibility, Zhou Ze wasn't narcissistic enough to actually believe it. He quickly descended another floor, then abruptly turned around at the corner and headed back up.\n\n*Whoosh...*\n\nA gust of wind blew past from above.\n\nZhou Ze snapped his head up and started running upstairs, but he still found nothing.\n\nFinding nothing proved that something was definitely strange.\n\nZhou Ze bent down, his black index fingernail extended, and lightly tapped the tiled floor.\n\nThe next moment, a black footprint appeared on the tile. Zhou Ze silently clenched his fist, hiding his index finger, then slowly stood up and followed the direction of the black footprints that were now continuously appearing below.\n\nFrom his fingernail, smoke invisible to the naked eye of ordinary people was continuously emitting, relentlessly tracing the marks below.\n\nDue to its special nature, a hospital is rarely ever completely clean. But it wasn't the dead of night yet, so for a \"filthy thing\" to dare to walk around so brazenly was highly unusual.\n\nFollowing the tracks, Zhou Ze arrived on the fourth floor. The footprints led on, then turned into a patient room.\n\nThere were patients in the room. Given the current severe shortage of medical resources, finding an empty patient room was a rare event. For example, even now, some patients could only rest or receive IV drips on simple beds set up in the hallways.\n\nZhou Ze reached out and pushed the door open.\n\nInside were three beds.\n\nOld women lay on the two side beds, while a young woman lay in the middle one. Each bed also had a caregiver beside it.\n\nAfter Zhou Ze walked in, everyone in the room, except for one sleeping old woman, looked at him.\n\n\"Hello, sorry to bother you. Did anyone just come in here?\"\n\nZhou Ze asked, getting straight to the point.\n\n\"No,\" a middle-aged female caregiver replied.\n\nThe others also shook their heads.\n\nZhou Ze nodded, indicating he understood, then turned to leave the room.\n\nAt this point, Zhou Ze decided to leave.\n\nYou couldn't blame him for lacking a sense of public duty, not even catching a ghost he encountered. You have to remember, Xu Qinglang had just called to say that \"business was good\" at his shop. Zhou Ze was worried that if he returned late and the \"customers\" had all left, the loss would be significant.\n\nAs for the filthy thing running around outside, if he ran into it and could deal with it, he would. If it was difficult to handle or wanted to play hide-and-seek, Zhou Ze really wasn't willing to spend too much energy on it.\n\nHe was a ghost emissary—and one with the prefix \"temporary\" at that—not Zhang Daoling.²\n\nHowever, as Zhou Ze grabbed the doorknob to close the door, his fingernail accidentally touched it.\n\nIn that instant, Zhou Ze felt something like a static shock. Immediately after, the lights in the room went out, then came back on again.\n\nThe three beds in the room were instantly empty. The patients and their caregivers had all vanished.\n\nZhou Ze stumbled back two steps. Only then did he see the sign on the door of the room he was facing: \"Storage Closet.\" This wasn't a patient room!\n\n*Whoosh...*\n\nAnother gust of wind blew by, very fast, as if it realized its illusion had failed and was trying to flee in a panic.\n\nZhou Ze reached out and grabbed, feeling like he'd caught something cold and fleshy. But it was immediately followed by a sharp snap, and the thing escaped his grasp.\n\nThe wind dispersed.\n\nZhou Ze looked at his palm. There was a tuft of black hair, long and very curly, like the hair from that other dense region he saw besides the hair on his head when he showered every day.\n\nAs if by professional habit, Zhou Ze brought his palm to his nose and sniffed.\n\nA thick, rank, fishy smell assaulted him.\n\nIt was utterly nauseating.\n\nLike a salted fish left in a stuffy warehouse for a month.\n\n\"Hiss...\"\n\nZhou Ze suppressed the urge to gag. He crouched down again, tapped the tile with his fingernail, and another clear series of black footprints appeared.\n\nHe dusted off his hands, cracked his neck, and then directly followed the footprints once more.\n\nThe nature of the matter had changed again. If the other party were merely like the old woman he'd met in the affiliated hospital's morgue, lingering over family property issues, Zhou Ze wouldn't have pursued it relentlessly. Such ghosts, bound to the mortal realm by earthly attachments, were far too common, and they generally had neither the inclination nor the ability to cause harm.\n\nBut the one he had just encountered not only followed him proactively but could also create an illusion so realistic it almost fooled him. Furthermore, judging by the body hair he'd pulled from it, the thing had a physical form.\n\nThis meant the other party was already capable of causing trouble, and it was doing so in the hospital where his \"wife\" worked. For Zhou Ze to stand by idly with a clear conscience now was a bit difficult to justify to himself.\n\nIn the end,\n\nhe was just a glutton for punishment!\n\nZhou Ze had read many novels in the bookstore over the past few months, and he most hated the \"saintly\" protagonists. He couldn't relate to them at all. But when it was his turn, he found he still couldn't completely let it go.\n\nOf course, there was another extremely important reason: he had just become a ghost emissary. Based on what he could glean from his past conversations with the little loli, if a filthy thing caused trouble in a ghost emissary's territory, that emissary would also face the consequences.\n\nThe footprints went upstairs. Zhou Ze followed them all the way to the eighth floor, the surgery floor. After reaching the top of the stairs, it didn't take him much effort to find his target.\n\nA figure in a white lab coat was leaning against the wall by the operating room. With one ear pressed against the wall, it was thrusting one hand up and down below, doing something many shut-ins do at home.\n\nWhen Zhou Ze approached, the figure didn't turn around. But Zhou Ze saw its body tremble slightly and the speed of its hand's friction-inducing movements quicken, as if his arrival had somehow enhanced its pleasure.\n\n\"You are a ghost emissary. I do not wish to offend you, but why must you pursue me so relentlessly? We can mind our own business.\"\n\nIts voice was a bit hoarse, like an old man's, but the intonation was strange, often pronouncing several syllables with extreme speed.\n\n\"What are you doing?\" Zhou Ze gestured at it.\n\n\"I am waiting for my woman to come out,\" it replied. \"Lord Emissary, you should go back. Tearing away all pretense does neither of us any good. I can promise you I won't do anything heinous that would make things difficult for you. With the Heavenly Dao above, I too dare not act recklessly.\"\n\n\"Your woman? Who are you waiting for?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nCould this be another tale of a love between a human and a ghost?\n\nBut just then, from the other end of the operating room hallway, the young girl who had accompanied her sister-in-law ran out holding various receipts, likely on her way to pay the fees.\n\nInside...\n\nlay the pregnant woman who was about to miscarry!\n\n\"You're not her husband,\" Zhou Ze snapped.\n\n\"A woman I've taken a fancy to is my woman. Besides, she and I have a thread of ill-fated love to continue. This is something even Old Man Heaven has tacitly approved of,\" the creature said, its tone highly impatient.\n\nZhou Ze had been the one to do the initial examination of the pregnant woman. At first, he thought he had stumbled into another cuckolding incident. He had lamented before that he himself had encountered a similar problem, his childhood friend was currently going through such a problem, and now he was even encountering this kind of problem just by visiting a patient in the hospital.\n\nIt seemed that wherever he went recently, he would run into this \"environmentally friendly color.\"³\n\nHe even had the urge to rename his bookstore the \"Green Bookstore,\" in response to the nation's call to protect the environment.\n\nFortunately, this time it wasn't just a simple, cliché \"eco-friendly color\" story. But it seemed to be even more troublesome than a simple \"eco-friendly color\" story.\n\n\"One body, two lives,\" Zhou Ze reminded it, taking two steps forward at the same time. \"If her surgery is unsuccessful, it will be one body, two lives. And you still say you're not doing anything heinous?\"\n\n\"You ghost emissary, have you eaten a bear's heart and a leopard's gall?!\"⁴\n\nThe creature seemed unable to contain its rage.\n\nIt spun around directly.\n\nIt was wearing a doctor's white coat. From the back, nothing seemed amiss, but when it turned to face him, its terrifying and savage form was immediately revealed.\n\nIt was a monkey.\n\nA monkey that could stand upright like a human.\n\nMost of its body was horribly decayed. Even its skull was partially missing, empty inside. But the thing below was swinging back and forth like a bull's pizzle, looking utterly disgusting.\n\n\"You're nothing but a lowly ghost emissary from the bottom rung of the Underworld. Don't push your luck!\"\n\n\"And you, what the hell are you?\" Zhou Ze retorted, taking a few more steps forward.\n\n\"Screech screech screech!\"\n\nThe monkey bared its teeth, letting out a low growl. Then, the black tail on its back suddenly shot up and stabbed violently into the tiled floor.\n\nThe next instant,\n\nall around where Zhou Ze stood, small black holes appeared on the ceiling, tiles, and walls.\n\nFrom these holes, long tails emerged one by one and began to swarm toward him.\n\nThese tails carried an extremely foul, fishy stench, and sticky fluid dripped from them. For Zhou Ze, who had always been a neat freak, it felt like he was standing in the most pungent section of a seafood market.\n\nMost importantly,\n\nthis scene...\n\nhe had seen it in many movies before.\n\nImmediately,\n\nZhou Ze spread his hands. His black fingernails grew out completely, and a black light swirled in the depths of his eyes.\n\nTo be honest, aside from that time he'd whipped Bai Yingying, he had never really been in a proper fight.\n\nTo Zhou Ze's surprise, the booklet in his pocket began to grow faintly hot at this moment, as if it too was getting impatient.\n\nA little excited,\n\nand a little expectant.\n\nHe had just gotten his license. It was like someone who'd just passed their driving test and was itching to take a car for a spin.\n\nZhou Ze really wanted a fight right now.\n\nHowever, a scene that took Zhou Ze by surprise occurred. Just as his credentials began to grow warm,\n\nthe monkey, which an moment ago had been insufferably arrogant and scornful of him for being a mere lowly ghost emissary of the Underworld, suddenly dropped to its knees. It kowtowed repeatedly, slamming its head on the ground, and shouted:\n\n\"Prefect, spare my life! Prefect, spare my life! This vile beast knows its mistake, this vile beast knows its mistake!\"\n\nFor a moment,\n\nZhou Ze, who had been full of anticipation, was left hanging, neither up nor down.\n\nIt was like a guy who had done all the foreplay, applied the delay spray, taken Viagra, put on the chocolate-flavored Smurf,⁵ cued up the dirty movie, and poured the red wine,\n\nonly to have the beauty in bed pull back the covers and reveal that it was fucking Xu Qinglang!\n\n---\n¹ A famous 13th-century Chinese play about a young widow who is wrongfully convicted and executed. Her name has become synonymous with tragic injustice.\n² Zhang Daoling was an Eastern Han dynasty Taoist master who founded the Way of the Celestial Masters school of Taoism. He is revered as a powerful figure who subdued ghosts and demons.\n³ In modern Chinese culture, the color green is associated with being cuckolded. \"Wearing a green hat\" means one's spouse is cheating.\n⁴ An idiom meaning to be audacious or fearlessly bold.\n⁵ *Lanjingling* (藍精靈), literally \"Blue Elf\" or \"Smurf,\" is a slang term for a particular brand of condom in China.",

    "content": "Fujun?\n\nThat definitely wasn't a form of address for him. The first line on Zhou Ze's ID card clearly stated his name, and the second line unmistakably stated his position: \"Temporary Ghost Emissary.\"\n\nMoreover, it couldn't be a respectful epithet, like back in the Republic era when common folk would see any soldier and call him \"Chief.\" If even a temporary ghost emissary could be called \"Fujun,\" wouldn't such a title of respect be overly common and worthless in Hell?\n\nTherefore,\n\nThe problem must lie with this little booklet he had just obtained.\n\nThis ID had a previous owner. Even though it had now been \"refreshed\" for Zhou Ze, it must still retain some residual information from its former owner.\n\nAll in all,\n\nHe had picked up the relic of someone truly remarkable, and had done so effortlessly.\n\nOf course, at this moment, Zhou Ze had no time to gloat or indulge in the luxury of opening a bottle of red wine to celebrate. Instead, he felt a small pang of disappointment, for he hadn't been able to fight this uglified version of Monkey Bro.¹\n\nBut since his opponent had chickened out, Zhou Ze certainly wasn't going to be shameless enough to squat down and encourage his opponent, \"Quick, find your confidence again! Stand up and hit me! Hit me!\n\nHit me!\"\n\nSince this was a beautiful misunderstanding, well, let the misunderstanding continue.\n\nZhou Ze silently walked toward the monkey, one hand clasped behind his back. He was also subconsciously imitating the little loli's cool pose, hoping to prolong the other's misunderstanding.\n\nHe reached the creature. The monkey was still kowtowing nonstop. Its skull looked like it had been pried open; it was hollow inside. In fact, its entire body, aside from that perfectly intact \"bull's pizzle,\" was decayed and damaged in every other part.\n\nZhou Ze reached out one hand, his fingernail touching the spot between the creature's brows.\n\n\"Hand over your Soul Blood to me,\" Zhou Ze said faintly.\n\n\"I humbly obey the Fujun's decree.\"\n\nThe monkey, its face a mask of fear, was completely submissive. At the spot between its brows, a black earthworm appeared.\n\nZhou Ze pinched the earthworm with his fingernail and began to pull it out. The earthworm grew longer and thicker.\n\nXu Qinglang had once advised Zhou Ze to take Bai Yingying's Soul Blood, as it would be equivalent to grasping her very life in his hands. Zhou Ze now planned to use the same method to gain complete control over this monkey while it was scared out of its wits.\n\nHowever, this monkey's Soul Blood was surprisingly thick, which was also a testament to how terrifying the creature was.\n\nWhy had this monkey suddenly appeared in the middle of the city?\n\nJust then, the Soul Blood suddenly got stuck. Zhou Ze pulled hard, but it wouldn't budge.\n\nAnd the monkey, which had been completely reverent, froze. Its gaze suddenly became incredibly clear!\n\nA lofty Fujun wants to draw out my Soul Blood; this is my honor, a decree I cannot resist. But why would a lofty Fujun have such difficulty drawing out my Soul Blood?\n\nAbruptly, the monkey's mouth split open, letting out a sharp screech as its claws swiped directly at Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze felt as if he'd been hit by a large truck. But just as he was sent flying, his fingernails snapped with force, directly severing the creature's Soul Blood.\n\n*Crash...*\n\nZhou Ze shattered the glass behind him and collapsed into a pile of glass shards. He lifted his head, his chest heaved, and blood trickled from the corner of his mouth. His entire body ached with excruciating pain.\n\n\"Damn you, you're not the Fujun!\n\nYou bastard, how dare you impersonate the Fujun!\"\n\nThe monkey went berserk. Although its Soul Blood hadn't been completely extracted, the fact that Zhou Ze had severed it was enough to destroy the foundation of its cultivation, even if it couldn't kill it instantly.\n\nZhou Ze forced himself to climb up, his body covered in cuts from the glass shards. He looked utterly wretched.\n\nHowever, the monkey, now like a crazed beast, lunged directly at Zhou Ze.\n\n*Thump!*\n\nMan and monkey crashed into each other. Only this time, the monkey's strength was much less than before. The two of them became entangled, tumbling across the floor and rolling over several times.\n\n\"This is my destiny, and my karma! The Heavenly Dao permits it. A debt must be paid; it is the law of heaven and earth!\n\nYou are but a lowly ghost emissary, why must you interfere? Do you really think you're one of the Ten Yama Kings?\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't answer. Instead, he viciously stabbed his fingernails into the monkey's body. Pus continuously evaporated from the monkey's body, releasing a stench so bad a gas mask would probably be useless.\n\nFinally, after a round of grappling, the monkey's body limply lost its strength and slumped to one side. Zhou Ze staggered to his feet, his ten fingernails mostly corroded away.\n\nHe was a man who took great care of his nails. Even in his past life, when not wielding a scalpel, he had often trimmed them. Needless to say, in this life where his nails were even more important, he naturally cherished them all the more.\n\nBut now was not the time to worry about such things. A lingering fear crept into Zhou Ze's heart. If the ID in his hand hadn't deceived the creature, allowing him to get the first move and sever its Soul Blood, the one lying on the ground after this exchange would probably have been him.\n\nThis wasn't a ghost.\n\nThis was a yao, a demon.\n\nZhou Ze cursed himself many times over in his head.\n\nWhy did I have to follow it? I nearly got myself killed.\n\nHumans are just this sort of complex animal. They can be driven by a momentary impulse of righteousness and so-called conscience to do things without considering the consequences, but then often end up regretting it endlessly,\n\nfeeling like a complete idiot.\n\nZhou Ze decided that the next time he encountered something like this, he should just call the police and let them handle it. That way, he could leave with a clear conscience.\n\nDidn't the little loli turn a blind eye to Lady Bai staying in Tongcheng for two hundred years?\n\nShaking his head, he cast aside the miscellaneous thoughts cluttering his mind and looked at the monkey beside him.\n\nIts mouth hung open, its gaze growing turbid. Its body, like a leaking balloon, began to slowly shrivel. But it wasn't dead yet, because it could still speak.\n\n\"I cultivated for three sixty-year cycles, received a fortuitous opportunity, created good karma, became a spirit, and glimpsed the Great Dao... As a non-human, achieving the Dao in the mortal world is truly difficult.\"\n\nIt seems everyone likes to reminisce about their past before they die, to make their life sound as incredible and arduous as possible. This monkey's mentality wasn't much different from a human's.\n\n\"Cultivated for all those years, and still couldn't control that thing between your legs,\" Zhou Ze spat out a mouthful of blood, his teeth stained crimson.\n\n\"A new body every sixty years, a reincarnation and rebirth every sixty years,\" the monkey's voice grew faint, but it still carried a powerful, resonant tone.\n\n\"Every sixty years I would reform a physical body and begin my cultivation anew. From the very beginning. In the mountains, I rescued travelers lost in the wilderness, gathered and delivered medicinal herbs to the villagers at the foot of the mountain, and drove away nearby mountain monsters and evil spirits.\n\nThough I had no temple, I performed the duties of a mountain god, protecting the people of the mountain region for generation after generation. Even today, there is a stone carving of me in that small town, and the local story of the divine monkey who helped people is still told.\"\n\nZhou Ze wiped his fingernails on his clothes. Looking at their ruined state, he felt a deep sense of regret. As for what the monkey was saying, Zhou Ze merely let out a cold sneer.\n\nA divine monkey?\n\nA mountain god protecting the mountain folk?\n\nFinding joy in helping others?\n\nYour \"helping others\" went a bit too far, didn't it? The husband goes off to work, and you \"help\" him by comforting his lonely wife in her boudoir?\n\nAnd, thinking back to the image of this thing jerking off against the wall when he first came upstairs, it was really hard to associate it with a \"divine monkey.\"\n\n\"Don't put on a play for yourself, telling only the parts that sound good,\" Zhou Ze raised his hand again, preparing to put an end to this monkey.\n\n\"It was them! During my fourth cycle of cultivation and reincarnation, they captured my newly reincarnated body. At that time, I was just a little monkey. Her husband was a logger in the mountain forest. He was injured in a fall into a canyon. It was I who brought him fruits and dew. It was I who went to their camp and led his fellow workers to rescue him.\n\nBut when he was saved, he bound me with the rope he used for logging, and said to his coworkers:\n\n'Surviving a great disaster must bring good fortune. I have heard that monkey brain is a great delicacy; I will take it for my wife to try. It is said to have a miraculous effect on infertility!'\"\n\nThe last part was spoken by the monkey in a classical, archaic tongue. This conveyed its fury, and also showed that it was on the verge of death, its consciousness already fading, subconsciously speaking in the manner most familiar to it.\n\n\"They split my head, took my marrow, carved my flesh, and shared it among the crowd to eat, saying it was a great restorative!\"\n\nAs the monkey spoke, its body, which had already shrunk to the size of a normal monkey, began to tremble. This was a teeth-gritting rage, a fury that penetrated to the bone!\n\nHe had cultivated for one hundred and eighty years, performed good deeds and accumulated virtue, protected a region, only to have it all destroyed on the verge of great success. Not by his own enemies, but at the hands of someone he had saved.\n\nAnyone in his place would feel a towering hatred.\n\n\"My body is destroyed, my path to the Dao is obliterated!\n\nYesterday's cause is today's effect!\n\nI am already dead, my path wiped out. I am willing to enter reincarnation and be reborn in the animal realm, but the resentment in my heart cannot be dispelled. My spirit cannot enter Hell, so I had no choice but to come down from the mountain to seek revenge and resolve this karma. Only then can I be completely liberated.\"\n\n\"Is that your reason for violating his wife?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"You are human, I am a beast. For you, it is the law of heaven and earth that humans eat beasts! But for a beast to repay a human with vengeance is unacceptable to the Heavenly Dao, is it not?\"\n\nZhou Ze hesitated for a moment, then nodded. \"It is.\"\n\nHe was unwilling to deny it, nor did he want to.\n\nOf course, eating monkey brain was illegal and wrong. But from the standpoint of Zhou Ze's own feelings, he still couldn't accept this monkey coming down from the mountains for revenge, nearly causing the death of a mother and her unborn child.\n\nFor example, if you see people in a restaurant eating braised pork, you might think, \"Oh, that looks delicious.\"\n\nBut if you saw a group of pigs in a restaurant gnawing on human flesh, what would you, as a human, think?\n\nIt was a very selfish stance, a very warped point of view, but the principle was just that. Everyone's position is different, so naturally their perspective on things is different.\n\nBesides, Zhou Ze felt that no matter what, the child in the pregnant woman's belly was innocent.\n\n\"You're in great pain, aren't you? Let me put you out of your misery. Then I'll see if I can send your soul to Hell.\"\n\n\"Thank...\" the monkey uttered its last word.\n\nZhou Ze's fingernails stabbed into the monkey's body again.\n\nThe monkey's body trembled,\n\nand then all signs of life vanished completely.\n\nBut Zhou Ze searched for a long time, and waited for a long time, yet he couldn't find the monkey's departed soul.\n\nThis probably meant the monkey's soul had shattered and scattered. Because it had failed to complete its revenge, its soul was not allowed to enter Hell.\n\nStanding up, Zhou Ze noticed a faint black mist dissipating around him. It had been like a barrier, preventing what happened here from being perceived by the outside world. Otherwise, with the commotion he and the monkey had made, they would have attracted a crowd long ago.\n\nZhou Ze hoisted the monkey's corpse onto his shoulder and, leaning on the stairwell railing, slowly made his way down.\n\nAt the same time, he admonished himself in his heart to remember today's lesson. He was just a ghost emissary, in charge of ghosts. Mountain spirits and monsters of this kind were outside his jurisdiction.\n\nUnder the cover of night, in a park outside the hospital, Zhou Ze found a shovel left by the gardener's shed and dug a hole for the monkey, burying its corpse inside.\n\nThen he tended to his own wounds as best he could. After all this was done, Zhou Ze, completely drained, leaned against a large tree and sat down.\n\nHe took out his phone, its screen shattered but still usable, and sent a message to Dr. Lin:\n\n\"Did the pregnant woman and her baby make it?\"\n\nFive minutes later, Dr. Lin replied:\n\n\"They did. Mother and child are safe and sound.\"\n\nZhou Ze lit a cigarette and took a deep drag, which was immediately followed by a sharp pain in his lungs, sending him into a violent coughing fit.\n\nBut soon, Dr. Lin sent another photo and a line of text.\n\n\"However, the child is deformed. It has three legs.\"\n\nZhou Ze stared at the photo on his phone.\n\nThe tiny, premature infant lay there quietly, its breathing even.\n\nBut its lower body had three legs.\n\nThat extra leg...\n\n...looked like a monkey's... tail.\n\n***\n\n¹Monkey Bro (猴哥) is an affectionate nickname for Sun Wukong, the Monkey King from *Journey to the West*.",

    "content": "His body was a little tired, his mind a little lost. Tossing the cigarette butt away, he slung his jacket over his shoulder and, guided by the streetlights, Zhou Ze walked along the dimly lit path.\n\nHis shadow was stretched long.\n\nAt the park's exit stood an old man with white hair. The old man was dressed in a crisp suit, standing ramrod straight and impeccably neat, like an old poplar tree holding fast in the desert.\n\nJust a glance was enough to know the old man was the kind of person who was extremely, almost pathologically, particular about his appearance.\n\nZhou Ze didn't look at him, simply continuing on his way.\n\nThe air was filled with the scent of watermelon slush, a little sweet and a little cloying. The smell made Zhou Ze uncomfortable, because watermelon flesh was red, and that would make Zhou Ze think of many unpleasant images.\n\n\"Sir, are you feeling down?\"\n\nThe old man began to follow Zhou Ze's pace, keeping half a step behind him, a perfectly measured distance.\n\n\"A little,\" Zhou Ze answered.\n\nThe two continued to walk forward, in lockstep, creating a peculiar symmetry.\n\n\"Sir, is it because of that monkey?\n\nOr is it for that tainted infant?\" the old man asked.\n\nZhou Ze didn't answer, continuing to walk slowly forward.\n\nWhen he reached the traffic light at the intersection, Zhou Ze stopped to wait for the green light.\n\nThe old man also halted his steps.\n\n\"There is no right or wrong in this matter,\" Zhou Ze answered.\n\n\"No right or wrong?\" the old man repeated, then asked, \"But everything has a positive and a negative side, so naturally one can distinguish between right and wrong.\n\nThe monkey was a good monkey. It did more good deeds than most of those in the human crowd who call themselves benevolent.\n\nYou admit this point as well, don't you, sir?\"\n\n\"So, what you're trying to say is?\" Zhou Ze pulled out another cigarette, shielded the flame with his hand, and lit it. \"That I was wrong?\"\n\n\"After shedding its mortal form several times, after so much painful cultivation, only to have it all come to naught because of the very person it saved—if that were you, sir, how would you feel?\" the old man asked.\n\n\"I'd be furious,\" Zhou Ze answered curtly. That required no thought at all.\n\n\"And after the fury?\"\n\n\"If I had the chance, I'd go kill his whole family,\" Zhou Ze said, blowing a smoke ring.\n\n\"Sir, your logic is very sound,\" the old man commented. \"But you stopped it from taking revenge. Even after you learned the whole story and the truth from its own mouth, you still ended its life with your own hands.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Do you think what you did was right?\" the old man asked again.\n\n\"I've said it before, there is no right or wrong in this matter,\" Zhou Ze said, flicking his ash. \"Taking a huge step back, the child was innocent.\"\n\n\"According to your logic, if the monkey had chosen to only take revenge on the husband, you would have understood;\nYou very likely wouldn't have stopped it, is that right, sir?\"\n\nZhou Ze fell silent.\n\n\"But the reason the husband killed the monkey to take its brain was in hopes that his wife could eat it to cure her infertility,\" the old man reminded him. \"So, while the cause and effect seem to rest on the monkey and the husband, the true origin lies with the monkey and that infant.\"\n\n\"Can cause and effect be calculated that way?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Is there no reason in my calculations?\" the old man retorted.\n\n\"By your calculations, you could trace it back to the meteorite that hit the Earth, wiped out the dinosaurs, allowing new species to emerge, leading to hominids, then to humans and monkeys, and finally to this tragedy.\nSo, the cause and effect should be blamed on the meteorite.\"\n\n\"That is sophistry, sir.\" The old man's tone seemed unchanged, perfectly placid, as if he were purely discussing a problem with you.\n\n\"I am human.\" Zhou Ze pointed to his own head. \"I stand on the side of humans. I don't think I could possibly allow a non-human entity to harm humans in a hospital.\"\n\n\"You are not human. You are a ghost,\" the old man reminded him again.\n\n\"Now it's your turn to use sophistry.\"\n\n\"Heh heh.\" The old man chuckled.\n\nThe light turned green.\n\nZhou Ze strode forward, and the old man continued to follow.\n\nA young man in tattered clothes,\nAn old man in meticulous attire.\n\nOn the ground, the two of them cast only a single shadow.\n\n\"In the end, something still went wrong with the child,\" the old man continued, his voice calm enough to make one want to stab him. \"It seems that at this moment, one can sigh and say: Heaven's cycle is just; see who it has ever spared.\"\n\n\"I have never believed that a child in swaddling clothes needs to bear joint responsibility for the mistakes of adults.\"\n\n\"In ancient times, there were laws of collective punishment. This means it had its reasons for existing,\" the old man said.\n\n\"It has since been abolished. This means its non-existence is better than its existence.\"\n\n\"Sir, you pity that child, but who, then, pities the monkey?\"\n\n\"You can go to Flower-Fruit Mountain¹ and ask its ancestors.\"\n\n\"So, in the final analysis, it's still a theory of speciesism above all else. It's nothing more than regional or racial discrimination with an extra layer of protective coloring.\"\n\n\"I have a piece of bread in my hand; this is my dinner for today.\" Zhou Ze held out a hand, showing that he was holding a piece of bread.\n\n\"And then?\"\n\n\"And then, just as I was about to eat this bread, I suddenly remembered that in some impoverished regions on Earth, there are still people who don't have enough to eat, who are starving and emaciated.\nSo I can't bear to eat this bread. I'm willing to starve with them, and even starve to death.\"\n\n\"Sir, I don't think your sarcasm is very appropriate,\" the old man said, shaking his head. \"Can you consider the monkey a mere beast? Its actions over the past three sixty-year cycles have made it more human than most so-called humans.\"\n\n\"Alright, let's try another example.\nI have a luxury car next to me, and fine red wine and caviar in front of me. I think again of the people on Earth who are starving. I can't bear to eat, and I still decide to starve with them, to starve to death with them.\nIf you ate such fine things, if you drove such a fine car, someone would point their finger at you and curse you, curse you for not donating the money you use for enjoyment to the people in impoverished regions.\"\n\nThe old man stopped walking, as if in thought.\n\nZhou Ze didn't stop, continuing to walk forward.\n\nFinally, the old man caught up.\n\n\"I am still very curious as to why you stopped it.\"\n\n\"What do you think I should have done?\"\n\n\"Acted as if you didn't see it,\" the old man answered. \"You are an Underworld Emissary, a guardian of the Underworld's rules in the mortal realm. A referee is respected because of his neutrality. Once he becomes both referee and player, the game collapses.\"\n\n\"I don't understand what you mean by that.\" Zhou Ze stopped and looked at the old man, this meticulously dressed old thing that made him want to go up and wrinkle his suit.\n\n\"The meaning is simple. The two examples you just gave were merely to illustrate that you were just making the choice you wanted to make in that moment, and all the questions I just came up to ask were just the noise of an outsider.\"\n\n\"I thought you didn't understand.\"\n\n\"I understood. You are a good person.\" The old man repeated himself. \"A good 'human'.\"\n\nFrom a 'human' perspective, that was indeed the case.\n\n\"So, you deliberately came up to me just to define me?\" Zhou Ze looked at the old man, his ten fingers still burning with pain. \"I didn't know trouble would come so quickly after picking up that thing.\"\n\nThe little loli had said he was like an incandescent bulb in the dark of night; now Zhou Ze felt like an incendiary bomb in the dark.\n\nThe old man shook his head and said, \"I am not your trouble. In fact, I am the servant left behind by the master, and you, sir, have just inherited the master's identity token.\nBecause of this, my seal was broken. I have awakened, and I found you. And, incidentally, I observed you for a while.\"\n\n\"Find a treasure, get an old grandpa as a bonus?\"\n\nA smile touched the corner of Zhou Ze's mouth.\n\n\"Should I also say:\n'Thirty years the river flows east, thirty years the river flows west; do not bully the young and poor'?²\nAnd while I'm at it, exclaim 'So terrifyingly powerful'?³\nThat seems more fitting for the occasion.\"\n\n\"I do not understand, sir,\" the old man stated frankly.\n\n\"You should read more,\" Zhou Ze advised.\n\n\"Very well.\" The old man nodded solemnly. \"I have been taught.\"\n\nAhead, they came to another red light, and the two stopped once more.\n\n\"Sir, you have inherited my master's identity token, so you have naturally become my new master,\" the old man began, and at the same time, he bent at the waist, bowing respectfully to Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze stood where he was, watching the old man.\n\nToday had been a truly eventful day.\n\nHe'd found an ID card, killed a monkey, and even had an old grandpa pop up, saying he wanted to acknowledge him as master.\n\nZhou Ze felt no joy, only a sense of trouble. He couldn't see through this old man who had suddenly appeared, couldn't fathom his true purpose.\n\n\"The master had one matter he instructed me to tell his successor,\" the old man said again. \"Of course, this message is for you, and at the same time, it is for me, his servant.\"\n\n\"Speak.\"\n\n\"If his successor is a good person, then...\"\n\n*Thwump!*\n\nThe sound of a sharp object piercing flesh rang out.\n\nZhou Ze looked down, somewhat stunned.\n\nHe saw the old man's hand plunged directly into his chest.\n\nSo clean.\n\nSo abrupt.\n\nHe didn't even have the slightest mental preparation.\n\nSlowly, Zhou Ze's feet left the ground. The old man raised his arm, and Zhou Ze was lifted up with it.\n\nUnder the dim yellow streetlights, Zhou Ze could clearly see the blood from his body flowing down the old man's arm, dyeing half of the old man's suit red.\n\n\"The master said, if his successor is a good person, then kill him and wait for the next one.\"\n\nThe old man spoke these words with the same placid tone.\n\nHe wasn't killing a person.\n\nIt was as if he were throwing out the trash.\n\nLike a picky chef selecting his ingredients, tossing aside anything slightly unsatisfactory and getting a new one.\n\nAnd Zhou Ze was this piece of trash, inexplicably thrown away.\n\nBlood flowed ceaselessly. The broken nails on Zhou Ze's ten fingers grew out, but before Zhou Ze could make his next move, the old man's hand that had pierced him suddenly exerted force.\n\nIn an instant,\n\nZhou Ze felt immense pain radiate through his entire body. His body convulsed, completely powerless to fight back.\n\n\"My apologies, sir. A minute ago, you might have thought today was your lucky day, because you had obtained something you very much wanted.\n\nI don't know if you, sir, noticed the faint white smudges under the 'Name' and 'Position' columns on the ID card.\n\nYou probably thought that hidden beneath the white smudges were the master's name and position;\n\nAnd in fact, that is true.\n\nBut that is not all.\n\nThere are also the names and positions of the eight successors before you.\"\n\nThe old man continued to speak calmly.\n\n\"They... th...ey... were... all... good people?\"\n\nZhou Ze opened his mouth, blood continuously spilling from the corners. He felt like a piece of salted fish, hung on a tree branch,\n\nslowly, waiting to be air-dried.\n\n\"No, sir. Of the nine, you were the only good person,\" the old man replied.\n\n\"Then... why... did... they... also... die...\"\n\n\"Because when I asked them if they were a good person, they all thought it would be more advantageous to answer 'yes'.\"\n\nThe old man tilted his head slightly, revealing a hint of helplessness.\n\n\"And then,\n\nthey all died.\"\n\n***\n\n**Footnotes:**\n\n1.  **Flower-Fruit Mountain (花果山):** The mythical birthplace and home of Sun Wukong, the Monkey King, from the classic Chinese novel *Journey to the West*. Zhou Ze is being sarcastic, essentially telling the old man to take his complaint to the monkey's legendary, powerful ancestor.\n2.  **\"Thirty years the river flows east, thirty years the river flows west; do not bully the young and poor\" (三十年河東三十年河西，莫欺少年窮):** A famous line that became a massive trope/meme in Chinese web novels, particularly in the *xianxia* (immortal heroes) and *xuanhuan* (fantasy) genres. It signifies a reversal of fortunes and is often spoken by or about a down-and-out protagonist who will later become powerful. Zhou Ze is sarcastically pointing out how his situation resembles a cliché plot setup.\n3.  **\"So terrifyingly powerful\" (恐怖如斯):** Another popular, often overused phrase from the same genre of web novels to describe a character or attack of immense power. By using these two phrases, Zhou Ze is mocking the absurdity of his situation by comparing it to cheap fiction.",

    "content": "What death felt like, Zhou Ze remembered with perfect clarity. In his previous life, he had been pushed into the incinerator of a crematorium and enjoyed the privilege of being burned to ashes.\n\nAnd beforehand, a crematorium worker had even used a steel hook to pierce his stomach to prevent his body from swelling and exploding during cremation.\n\nThat feeling was very similar to having his chest pierced through right now.\n\nPainful?\n\nOf course it was painful.\n\nBut when the pain becomes too intense, you instead feel numb, much like undergoing surgery in a hospital after receiving a half-body anesthetic. Separated by the curtain blocking your vision, you can probably only feel something fiddling around on your belly.\n\nZhou Ze still wanted to resist, but his body sank into a deathly spasm, and even his eyelids felt exceptionally heavy.\n\nNo matter how unwilling, no matter how much he fought,\n\nhis eyelids,\n\nstill, fell shut.\n\n…………\n\nSlowly, he opened his eyes. All around was a dim light. Before him was a long marble table, its patterns chaotic yet possessing a kind of exquisite feeling.\n\nLowering his head, Zhou Ze found himself sitting in a chair—a Grand Preceptor's chair.¹ He was leaning back against it. Below his neck, he wore a white neckerchief, though it looked more like a bib tied on during a meal to prevent soup from staining one’s clothes.\n\nHis hands held a silver knife and fork, respectively.\n\nAnd in front of him sat a pristine white plate, on which rested a piece of roasted meat, giving off puffs of steam, garnished with lemon and cauliflower.\n\n\"Sir, I seared the cauliflower with a blowtorch. It should have a grilled flavor to it. I hope you will like it.\"\n\nThe old man’s voice came from across the table. He was dressed in the same manner, currently cutting a piece of steak and placing it in his mouth to chew.\n\n\"What is the meaning of this?\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't rush to eat, asking the question directly.\n\nDidn't he say he was going to kill him?\n\n\"There was a slight mishap.\" The old man picked up the wine glass beside him and took a small sip.\n\n*Swoosh!*\n\nThe old man placed a hand on the table and pushed the ID card toward Zhou Ze.\n\n\"I hadn't expected the identity token to be this damaged,\" the old man said, then continued to cut another piece of meat and place it in his mouth, savoring it carefully.\n\n\"So?\"\n\n\"So, I apologize, but you won't be dying after all.\" A faint smile appeared on the old man's lips. \"Sir, your luck is truly quite good.\"\n\n\"You're not going to kill me?\"\n\n\"That is correct, sir. Because the identity token left behind by my master can no longer withstand another master-recognition refresh. Otherwise, it will shatter completely and lose all function.\"\n\nThe old man shook his head, raised his wine glass, and gave Zhou Ze a small nod.\n\n\"So, congratulations, sir. It seems my earlier words were mistaken. Today is indeed your lucky day.\"\n\nZhou Ze picked up his wine glass, looking at the clear red color of the wine within. He didn't rush to drink, but instead asked:\n\n\"There's no strange poison in this wine, is there?\"\n\n\"You must be joking, sir.\"\n\nJoking?\n\nJust before, you said you were my new master.\n\nAnd then?\n\nYou plunged a hand right through my chest!\n\nWho exactly is joking?\n\n\"Sir, please try my cooking. When my old master was alive, I was responsible for all of his daily meals. Though many years have passed, I don't believe my skills have deteriorated too much.\"\n\n\"No poison in the meat?\" Zhou Ze asked with a smile.\n\n\"Sir, you're overthinking things. For me, killing or torturing you would not require such troublesome methods.\"\n\n*You make a good point. I really can't refute that.*\n\nZhou Ze used his knife to cut off a piece of meat, brought it to his mouth with his fork, and chewed. He instinctively wanted to vomit, but was surprised to find that the meat melted in his mouth and had an excellent texture.\n\nMost importantly, he didn't feel the slightest bit of nausea.\n\n\"Is it delicious?\" the old man asked.\n\n\"It's alright,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\n\"If it's delicious, then please have more. As a chef, it is a great joy to have one's dishes liked and eaten heartily.\"\n\nThe old man ate half the meat on his plate, put down his knife and fork, and took out a hot towel to wipe his hands.\n\nZhou Ze ate a few more pieces of meat, then asked:\n\n\"What happens now?\"\n\n\"Sir, you're joking again.\" The kindly smile returned to the old man's face. \"After your meal, you are free to leave, sir. I will not restrict your freedom.\"\n\n\"It's just over like that?\" Zhou Ze found it somewhat absurd.\n\n\"Yes, it's over,\" the old man confirmed.\n\n\"But I remember you said that Prefect wanted a bad person, right?\"\n\n\"Yes, that is indeed true.\"\n\n\"And just because the identity token is damaged, I get an exception?\"\n\n*Really, just because of good luck?*\n\n\"No. The Prefect's will cannot be compromised in the slightest.\"\n\n\"I don't understand.\"\n\n\"The answer lies within your own heart,\" the old man prompted.\n\n\"I really hate that riddling way of talking monks use,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\nThe old man reached out and patted his own chest. \"Sir, on that point, I feel the same.\"\n\nZhou Ze's expression suddenly darkened, as if he'd thought of something. He immediately lowered his head, lifted the neckerchief, and exposed the left side of his chest.\n\nIt was empty.\n\n\"I have applied the best ointment to the wound for you. It will heal in a few days without leaving the slightest scar. I even took the liberty of treating the other wounds on your body.\n\nYou don't need to thank me, nor do you need to be polite.\"\n\n*Thank you, my ass!*\n\n\"Where's my heart? Where's my heart!\" Zhou Ze demanded.\n\nThe old man pointed at the plate in front of Zhou Ze and said amiably:\n\n\"You said it tasted good.\"\n\n*Clang!*\n\nZhou Ze slammed his knife and fork down on the table.\n\nThe old man picked up a cup of tea, rinsed his mouth, spat it out, and then slowly stood up.\n\n\"Without a heart, you'll have fewer troubles. You'll be able to live more comfortably.\n\nA good man, once he's lost his conscience, can't be all that good anymore. Wouldn't you agree?\"\n\nZhou Ze's hands gripped the tablecloth tightly. He looked up and stared at the old man.\n\n\"You'd better kill me right now.\"\n\nThe old man smiled faintly. \"So, sir, are you going to say it again: 'Don't bully a youth for being poor'?\"²\n\nThen, the old man lightly patted his own chest and sucked in a breath, feigning shock.\n\n\"How truly terrifying.\"\n\n\"...\" Zhou Ze was speechless.\n\n\"Sir, you will not have the chance to take revenge on me. My lifespan ran out long ago. When you leave this room, I, too, will dissipate.\"\n\n\"Will you go to hell?\"\n\n\"There is no place for me in hell,\" the old man replied. \"This is the final end.\"\n\nThen, the old man once again pointed at the plate in front of Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Sir, would you like me to pack that up for you?\"\n\nZhou Ze stood up. He felt an emptiness in his chest, and the gaping hole in the wound was shocking to behold, yet he wasn't dead. To be precise, Xu Le's body hadn't died. He didn't even feel the slightest bit of pain.\n\n*The wound will heal in a few days?*\n\nPicking up the identity token from the table, Zhou Ze walked toward the door, but stopped halfway and asked:\n\n\"I'm very curious. Who exactly was that Prefect?\"\n\n\"Ever since the Prefect was tricked by that Bodhisattva who ran down to hell, he has been unwilling to mention his own name.\"\n\nHe didn't get an answer, but Zhou Ze had no desire to linger here any longer. Pushing open the door before him, he walked out. When he turned back, he found that the door he had just come through was gone.\n\nBehind him was a field of desolate graves.\n\n…………\n\nInside the house, the old man quietly cleared the dishes and cleaned the room once more.\n\nThen, he spread his hand open and patted the table.\n\n\"Come on out.\"\n\nA small golden monkey scurried out from some corner, leaping onto the table. It scratched its ears and cheeks at the old man, looking quite adorable.\n\nHowever, the monkey's body was somewhat translucent, clearly not a real entity.\n\n\"Although it's said that every wrong has its cause and every debt its debtor, what you did this time went too far. Even if the final consequence was borne by that infant, it should not have been the target of your revenge.\n\nEverything is about pursuing and submitting to cause and effect. If everyone acted according to that principle, you little beast, what need would there be for you to pursue the Great Dao?\n\nEating, drinking, being born, growing old, getting sick, and dying—isn't that the truest submission to cause and effect?\"\n\nThe golden monkey shook its head, then nodded.\n\n\"Don't blame me for pulling over the soul you had attached to that infant. Consider your 180 years of merit as compensation for the child. Even though he's disabled, he'll be able to live a smooth life from now on, and he may even become a normal person after surgery in the future.\n\nDon't feel you got a bad deal. Let this matter end here. In a moment, I will give you a new body. You may leave on your own. Whether you choose to resume your cultivation or simply frolic in the mountains and forests, do not repeat what you did today.\n\nEven humans face the five ailments and three deficiencies in their cultivation, let alone a little beast like you. Just consider this a tribulation on your path of cultivation.\"\n\nWith that said,\n\nthe old man pushed open the door to the inner room.\n\nThere was no other furniture in this small room, only an ink wash painting hanging on the wall.\n\nIn the painting,\n\nthere was a majestic mountain.\n\n*Nature's creation gathers all its divine beauty; the northern and southern slopes divide dusk from dawn!*³\n\nA man wearing a purple crown and a yellow robe stood on the mountain's peak.\n\nThe painting had already yellowed,\n\nthe person in it had long since passed away,\n\nonly the majestic mountain in the painting still stood there, making all other mountains look small.\n\n\"Prefect, this old slave has completed the task you assigned.\"\n\nThe old man prostrated himself before the scroll.\n\nThe scene of their parting long ago resurfaced in his mind:\n\n…………\n\n\"You old codger, die a little later, hold on a bit longer. Help me keep an eye on whose hands this identity token ends up in. If it's a good person, slaughter him for me and find someone else!\n\nI put my faith in the nonsense of those monks, in their crap about 'vowing not to achieve Buddhahood until Hell is empty.' My whole life's reputation was ruined!\n\nThe person who holds my identity token must absolutely not be a good person again, or I will not be able to rest in peace!\"\n\n\"Master, what is a good person, and what is a bad person?\n\nA good person might do bad things, and a bad person might do good things.\n\nThis old slave is dull-witted. I fear I will fail to carry out the Prefect's instructions regarding the distinction between good and bad.\"\n\n\"Goddamn it, why all the convoluted, miscellaneous bullshit? If you think he isn't a bad person, just kill him.\"\n\n\"Yes, this old slave will respectfully obey your decree.\"\n\n…………\n\n\"Is he a good person?\"\n\nIn the inner room, the prostrated old man slowly raised his head, murmuring at the scroll:\n\n\"He is indeed a 'good' person.\n\nBut in my eyes,\n\nhe is a 'bad' person.\"\n\nAs the old man spoke, his face began to darken. Yellow fur started to grow on his face and hands.\n\nHis features twisted, becoming a furry face with a thunder god's beak!⁴\n\nThis was an old ape!\n\nBorn in the wilds of Mount Tai, his life's ambition was to shoulder that very mountain.\n\nIn ancient terms, he was called a Mountain-moving Ape!\n\n\"My disciple's descendant cultivated for 180 years, was happy to help others, and was diligent in his practice. He suffered such a calamity, such an injustice!\n\nRelying on his human standpoint, he acted without any regard and just went up and killed it!\n\nOn what grounds!\n\nOn what grounds!\n\nJust because he is human, because he was human in his past life!\n\nSo, any non-human that poses a threat to humans, regardless of right or wrong, regardless of the truth,\n\ndeserves to be killed? Deserves to die?\"\n\nThe old man knelt in a seated position.\n\nHe murmured one last time:\n\n\"From a human standpoint, he is a good person.\n\nFrom this old slave's monkey-clan standpoint, he is a bad person.\n\nHehe,\n\nIn the end,\n\nthat very fact is what saved him from death.\n\nPrefect,\n\nis this what you intended?\n\nPrefect,\n\nthis old slave is coming to follow you. All these years without this old slave by your side to cook for you, you surely must not have been used to it, right?\"\n\nThe life faded from the old man.\n\nThe ape's body just sat there.\n\nThe golden monkey in its soul state ran out, first kowtowing to the old man's remains, then burrowed into the old man's skin.\n\nA moment later,\n\nfrom beneath the old man's clothes,\n\nwriggled out a tiny monkey, only about the size of a palm.\n\n\"Squeak squeak squeak...\"\n\nThe little monkey chittered a few times, then ran out.\n\n---\n**Footnotes:**\n\n¹ **Grand Preceptor's chair (太師椅):** A type of traditional, formal Chinese armchair, often ornate and imposing, symbolizing status.\n\n² **\"Don't bully a youth for being poor\" (莫欺少年窮):** A famous line from a classic story, which has become a common trope in Chinese fiction.

    "content": "By the time he got back to the bookstore in a taxi, it was already midnight. The bookstore door was still open, and there were quite a few people inside.\n\nZhou Ze remembered Xu Qinglang had called him earlier to say business was good tonight. It looked like that was indeed the case; there were still customers at this hour.\n\nPushing open the glass door, to Zhou Ze's slight disappointment, the dozen or so people sitting in the shop were all living people.\n\nChief Zhao's case last time was an exception. This time, it couldn't be that over ten people were all exceptions, could it?\n\nEven back in the time of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors, the social customs—oh no, the *ghostly* customs—weren't this wholesome.\n\nThey were sitting in a circle with one person standing in the middle, telling a story. Everyone else was listening intently. It seemed to be a suspenseful horror story, and the storyteller used dramatic intonation and body language, doing his best to create an atmosphere.\n\nBai Yingying was sitting behind the counter, playing on her phone.\n\nWhen Zhou Ze returned, Bai Yingying stood up and poured him a glass of water.\n\nZhou Ze sat down and subconsciously reached up to cover his chest. Although his clothes covered it, as far as he could tell now, that area was empty.\n\n\"Boss, what's wrong?\" Bai Yingying asked, finding it a bit strange.\n\n\"Hm?\" Zhou Ze looked at Bai Yingying.\n\n\"I just feel like something about you is different. You weren't like this when you left this afternoon.\"\n\nOne had to admit, the female corpse was quite perceptive.\n\n\"It's nothing.\" Zhou Ze didn't feel like talking right now.\n\n\"Since you're back, can I go next door to play games?\" Bai Yingying pleaded.\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"The boss is the best.\"\n\nBai Yingying went to the noodle shop next door. Soon after, Xu Qinglang walked out of the noodle shop and into the bookstore. He came up to the counter, handed Zhou Ze a cigarette, and asked:\n\n\"What's this, a tea party?\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head, indicating he didn't know.\n\n\"Hey, sounds like they're telling ghost stories.\" Xu Qinglang's interest was piqued, and he actually found a plastic stool and sat down with them.\n\nThe person in the middle of the circle was telling a story about a vengeful ghost infant. It was full of suspense and genuinely well-plotted, and the people around him were listening, completely engrossed.\n\nSlowly, Zhou Ze began to understand. This was probably a \"club,\" an organization similar to a book club or a cycling club, brought together by a common interest.\n\nAfter the last story ended, a man who seemed to be the leader took out a large sheet of white paper with some things drawn on it, then pulled out several pens.\n\nZhou Ze was a bit too far away to see clearly. Xu Qinglang turned his head and mouthed to Zhou Ze:\n\n\"Pen Immortal.\"¹\n\nThe Pen Immortal is a type of spirit-summoning game, shrouded in mystery. It's said that playing this game can easily lead to misfortune and invite possession by wandering souls.\n\nThe group was very excited. They all reached out their hands to hold the long pen together. A man in a yellow woolen coat, who seemed to be their leader, waited until everyone was ready and piously began to chant:\n\n\"Pen Immortal, Pen Immortal, where are you? Pen Immortal, Pen Immortal, where are you?\"\n\nThe pen still didn't move, but the bookstore fell silent.\n\nThe man in the black-rimmed glasses continued:\n\n\"Pen Immortal, Pen Immortal, will we meet a ghost tonight?\"\n\nTen seconds after he finished speaking, the long pen held by the group began to move slowly.\n\nEveryone held their breath.\n\nIn truth, when many people hold a single pen, if the tip is smooth enough, it's very easy for it to slide on its own. It's even simpler if one person gives it a slight nudge.\n\n\"*Shua!*\"\n\nThe tip of the pen suddenly jerked and pointed directly toward where Zhou Ze was sitting.\n\nXu Qinglang's mouth fell slightly open. Dumb luck?\n\nZhou Ze remained seated steadily behind the counter, watching the scene with half-lidded eyes.\n\nBecause of the pen's movement, most of them turned their gazes toward Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Yes!\" the man in the black-rimmed glasses said, pointing to the area where the pen tip was.\n\nThere were two areas, \"Yes\" and \"No,\" and the pen tip was currently in the \"Yes\" area.\n\n\"Alright, pack it up. We'll head out together in a bit. Remember, the operation is half an hour. Everyone's phone is charged, right? Later, everyone must record video for at least twenty minutes.\"\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\n\"Understood.\"\n\n\"Mm-hmm.\"\n\nThe others packed their things and left the bookstore, while the man in the black-rimmed glasses walked up to Zhou Ze's counter and said apologetically:\n\n\"Excuse me, boss. We're from the Horror Story Enthusiasts Association. We just explore paranormal sites for fun. We didn't scare you, did we?\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head.\n\n\"Wow, you're really brave, boss. When I asked that young lady earlier if we could play with the Pen Immortal here, she approved. I was actually worried you'd be upset with us when you came back. This is for the tea. Please accept it, boss.\"\n\nThe man handed him six hundred yuan.\n\nZhou Ze took the money and asked, \"Where are you guys going next?\"\n\n\"The building right above your shop. There are no businesses left there, right? And there was an arson case a while back, a few people burned to death. We plan to try our luck there tonight.\"\n\n\"You want to see a ghost that badly?\"\n\n\"I don't know, but people are always curious about the unknown, right? Honestly, everyone just got together for the thrill of it. In our usual social circles, it's hard to find people with similar interests. Our club provides a chance for us to connect. Besides, I've already made arrangements for tonight. I had someone set things up during the day in the movie theater that was set on fire. Tonight, Mr. Chen from our club is going to confess his feelings to Miss Liu.\"\n\n\"Confess his feelings?\"\n\n\"That's right. Actually, the rest of us all know about tonight's plan; only Miss Liu is in the dark. Our club has been around for five years, and we're all good friends, so everyone is happy to help.\"\n\n\"Are you Japanese?\" Zhou Ze asked, looking at the man in the black-rimmed glasses.\n\n\"Yes, I'm a Japanese national of Chinese descent. I returned to China five years ago. Clubs for hobbies like this are very common in Japan. After coming back, I found that everyone here is too introverted, so I'm usually the one who organizes activities like book clubs or haunted house explorations.\"\n\nThe man slapped his forehead and handed over his business card.\n\n\"My Chinese name is Cui Yilang. A pleasure to meet you.\"\n\nZhou Ze took the business card from his hand.\n\n\"Well, we'll go get our activity started then. Thanks again for your hospitality, boss.\"\n\nCui Yilang walked out of the bookstore. Xu Qinglang, who had been standing by the side without a word, clutched his stomach and burst out laughing:\n\n\"Hahaha, I was trying so hard not to laugh! This time, they're *really* going to see a ghost.\"\n\nAs he laughed, Xu Qinglang noticed Zhou Ze wasn't laughing. He gave Zhou Ze a light punch on the chest and asked:\n\n\"Isn't it funny?\"\n\nZhou Ze immediately doubled over, one hand clutching the spot on his chest that had just been hit.\n\n\"Hey… you okay? I barely used any force.\"\n\nI was just tapping your chest with my little fist.²\n\n\"It's not that.\" Zhou Ze held up a hand, motioning for Xu Qinglang to stay back, and said, \"I just laughed so hard my heart hurts.\"\n\n\"That dramatic?\" Xu Qinglang pouted. \"Are you hungry? I can go make you... a bowl of egg fried rice?\"\n\n\"Not hungry. I've eaten.\"\n\n\"You ate out?\" Xu Qinglang asked curiously. \"Don't you usually hate eating out?\"\n\n\"That thing... was delicious.\"\n\n\"What kind of dish was it? If you can stomach it, I'll go buy some tomorrow and cook it for you.\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head.\n\nA person only has one heart.\n\nZhou Ze couldn't just produce a whole basket of them for Xu Qinglang to \"fry, deep-fry, boil, and steam.\"\n\n\"So what have you been craving lately?\" Xu Qinglang asked.\n\n\"Water spinach, I guess.\"³ Zhou Ze looked at Xu Qinglang and said very seriously, \"I've suddenly been craving it.\"\n\n\"Alright, I'll go get some tomorrow.\"\n\nJust then, the lights in the bookstore suddenly went out.\n\n\"AHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!! It's the final circle! The god circle!⁴ This old lady was about to get her chicken dinner! My little Groza, level three gear, a 15x scope!\"\n\nBai Yingying rushed out of the noodle shop and stood outside, wailing at the top of her lungs.\n\nZhou Ze felt that even back when she was drowned in a pig cage, her screams probably weren't as intense as they were now.\n\nThe power was out.\n\nZhou Ze and Xu Qinglang also walked outside.\n\nXu Qinglang made a call, then put down his phone, saying helplessly:\n\n\"Son of a bitch. They said someone won't be here to check on it until tomorrow. Old Zhou, this area is really going down the drain. The power goes out and they can't even be bothered to come take a look right away. Now it's become a haunted house exploration spot for hobbyists.\"\n\nXu Qinglang pointed to the windows of the tall building above them. \"What were they thinking, confessing their love in a movie theater where people died?\"\n\n\"It's very romantic. In a terrifying environment, you add the suddenness of love. For people who are into that sort of thing, that kind of contrast is intoxicating enough.\"\n\n\"Why do you sound so strange today?\" Xu Qinglang looked at Zhou Ze.\n\n\"You really look like you've been hollowed out. Did you… take that step with your wife today?\" Xu Qinglang asked cautiously.\n\n\"You're overthinking it.\"\n\nBut the phrase \"hollowed out\" made Zhou Ze's eyelid twitch slightly, a detail that Xu Qinglang caught.\n\nZhou Ze raised his head and looked up.\n\n\"Hey, staring at the sky won't help. Are you feeling guilty? Did I actually hit the nail on the head?\"\n\nSeeing that Zhou Ze didn't answer, Xu Qinglang also raised his head and looked at the sky.\n\nAnd then, they both saw what looked like a person in white clothes standing by a glass window on the fifth floor.\n\nBecause of the power outage, there were no lights around, but the moon was very bright tonight, and the color of the person's clothes was easy to make out in the dark.\n\n\"Don't tell me they also hired someone to pretend to be a ghost to build the atmosphere?\" Xu Qinglang blew a smoke ring. \"They're really taking this to the extre—\"\n\nXu Qinglang stopped talking, because he saw the white figure from above fall.\n\nIt came down fast, crashing less than ten meters away from him and Zhou Ze.\n\n\"*Thud!*\"\n\nA heavy, muffled sound echoed.\n\nA person landed face-up on the ground, motionless. Blood slowly began to spread out from under her.\n\nZhou Ze felt something cold on his face.\n\nA few drops of blood had spattered onto his cheek.\n\nXu Qinglang immediately ran over to check on the fallen person.\n\nBut Zhou Ze simply reached into his pocket, took out a napkin, and prepared to wipe the bloodstains from his face first.\n\n*Someone's dead... I should save them... I should go check the situation...*\n\nA flicker of struggle appeared in Zhou Ze's eyes, but his hand still trembled as it pulled out the napkin, slowly and meticulously wiping away the few drops of blood.\n\n\"Hey, get over here and see if there's any chance of saving her!\" Xu Qinglang shouted, looking up at Zhou Ze. Then, when he saw Zhou Ze just standing there without moving a single step, wiping his face, he roared:\n\n\"Do you have any conscience at all, wiping your face at a time like this!\"\n\nZhou Ze froze for a moment.\n\nRight.\n\nHis heart...\n\nit was gone...\n***\n**Footnotes:**\n\n1.  **Pen Immortal (筆仙):** A Chinese divination game similar to a Ouija board, where spirits are supposedly channeled through a pen held by participants to write answers to questions.\n2.  **\"I was just tapping your chest with my little fist.\" (人家只是用小拳拳捶你胸口的啊):** This is a direct translation of a Chinese internet meme phrase.

    "content": "\"Alright, the statement is complete. You may go.\"\n\nA young police officer closed his notebook and gave Zhou Ze a slight smile.\n\nZhou Ze nodded, stood up, and prepared to leave.\n\nJust then, the middle-aged police officer who had been sitting next to the young policeman during the statement suddenly spoke up.\n\n\"Mr. Xu, your bookstore is located over there, isn't it? Is business any good?\"\n\n\"Not great,\" Zhou Ze answered honestly.\n\nMany people had asked him this question, and they were asking about business with the living. Naturally, Zhou Ze answered in terms of business with the living.\n\n\"Then why do you choose to keep the shop open there?\" the middle-aged officer asked.\n\n\"I'm a live-in son-in-law. My wife's family is very rich, so I'm not short on cash. It's just something to pass the time.\"\n\nThe middle-aged officer paused for a moment, then nodded and gestured with his hand. \"You may leave. If we need to consult you about any other developments, we will notify you.\"\n\n\"I'd be happy to oblige.\"\n\nZhou Ze left the interrogation room.\n\nThe young officer twirled the pen in his hand and said, \"Captain Sun, that guy's pretty interesting.\"\n\nIndeed. To so frankly admit to marrying into a wealthy family and living off his wife required a great deal of courage.\n\n\"Go check on the other interrogations.\" The middle-aged officer stood up and glanced once more at Zhou Ze's departing back. He couldn't shake the feeling that the young man who had just been sitting before him had made him feel as if he had thorns at his back.\n\nDuring an interrogation, the police were supposed to be the cobras, and the person being interrogated was the prey. The cobra had to break through the opponent's defenses in the fastest, most precise, and ruthless way possible to get to the truth.\n\nBut just now, he'd had the strange feeling that to his opponent, he, the cobra, was nothing more than a dancing ornament in an Indian street performer's bamboo basket, swaying to the sound of a flute.\n\nIt was as if the man simply didn't care at all.\n\n…………\n\n\"You're out?\" Xu Qinglang had also just finished his statement and walked out. \"What rotten luck. Having to make a trip to the police station in the middle of the night to give a statement.\"\n\n\"And that young cop was so annoying. He asked me my gender three times. Is there something wrong with his brain? Can't he tell what my gender is?\"\n\nZhou Ze glanced at Xu Qinglang.\n\nHe thought to himself: *Do you have no goddamn clue what you look like?*\n\nZhou Ze and Xu Qinglang were both shop owners, and they had witnessed the fall firsthand, so they were required to give statements. But that was basically it. The other members of the Horror Story Enthusiasts Association were being treated as primary suspects by the police, which was only to be expected.\n\n\"By the way, who do you think the killer is?\" Xu Qinglang asked, smoking a cigarette.\n\nThe sun was about to rise; it was already morning.\n\n\"That's not our problem to worry about. The police will investigate and solve the case,\" Zhou Ze said very calmly.\n\n\"Hey, don't be so negative, okay? Didn't you ever read Sherlock Holmes or watch Detective Conan when you were a kid?\"\n\nEveryone, deep down, probably has a bit of a detective dream, a fondness for mysteries.\n\nThe thrill of peeling back layers of fog to find the truth, and then, like the magician Lu Chen, theatrically spreading your arms and mysteriously announcing, \"And now, it's time to witness a miracle,\"—that definitely hits the G-spot for a lot of people.\n\n\"I'm not interested in people.\"\n\n\"Still all about ghosts, huh,\" Xu Qinglang said sarcastically.\n\n\"Right, ghosts.\" Zhou Ze took out his phone to hail a ride. At the same time, he said, \"Do you remember what color clothes the female victim was wearing when she jumped?\"\n\n\"White.\"\n\n\"And after she landed?\"\n\n\"Red.\" Xu Qinglang shrugged. \"Looked like it was dyed red with blood. Sigh, so pitiful.\"\n\n\"The dress she was wearing after she landed was red to begin with,\" Zhou Ze reminded him. \"Don't numb yourself with the 'dyed red with blood' cliché.\"\n\nXu Qinglang nodded silently, then reached up to touch the tip of his nose. \"You're saying there's some secret behind this? That it wasn't just an accident or a murder?\"\n\n\"I don't know, but I really hope that's the reason. The ghosts I've run into before were considered formidable if they could give someone a cold. If I can actually find one that can cause an accident and kill someone, it would be a huge harvest.\"\n\nA ghost like that must be worth dozens of others, right?\n\nThe merit for sending it to hell would be worth ten, or even more, right?\n\n\"Aren't you overthinking this? Oh, speaking of which, I forgot to tell the police that the dress was white at first.\" Xu Qinglang clapped his hands. \"Maybe the key to solving the case lies in the change of color. The murderer must have designed some extremely clever...\"\n\n\"Are you possessed by Agatha Christie or Conan Doyle?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"No.\" Xu Qinglang looked at Zhou Ze resentfully. \"Old Zhou, I've noticed you're getting more and more boring. You used to at least play along a little.\"\n\n\"Not in the mood.\"\n\n\"So are we just going back now?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Back to catch ghosts?\"\n\n\"To play the Pen Immortal game.\"\n\n\"Why are you so childish?\"\n\n\"Have you ever heard of... entrapment?\"¹\n\n………………\n\nThe bookstore hadn't been sealed off, but the area around it was cordoned off with a lot of police tape, and several officers were combing the vicinity for clues.\n\nThis made the already quiet bookstore, which had little business from the living to begin with, seem even more silent.\n\nZhou Ze had Bai Yingying buy a Pen Immortal game set. She just searched for sellers in Tongcheng on Taobao and then took a taxi directly to pick up the goods.\n\nA sheet of paper was spread out, with a large pile of who-knows-if-it's-useful stuff placed to one side.\n\nXu Qinglang squatted nearby, watching Zhou Ze busy himself. He said with some resignation, \"I actually have a few methods for summoning souls that I feel are more effective than this game.\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. \"It's not the same.\"\n\n\"How is it not the same?\"\n\n\"Last night, I didn't sense anything coming.\" Zhou Ze looked at Xu Qinglang. \"Did you?\"\n\n\"Did something come last night?\"\n\nAn image flashed through Xu Qinglang's mind: the long pen sliding toward Zhou Ze as that group played the Pen Immortal game.\n\n\"That was probably just a coincidence. Didn't that overseas Chinese guy say their activity last night was just a setup for a confession? So, someone must have deliberately pushed it toward your back, toward that building. It wasn't actually pointing at you.\"\n\n\"A very good analysis.\" Zhou Ze reached out, lifted the paper on the floor, and then ran his fingernail over the ceramic tile. \"Was this also deliberate?\"\n\nXu Qinglang's eyes widened instantly.\n\nOn the tile floor, there was a groove less than half a meter long. You probably wouldn't even notice it if you were standing up.\n\nZhou Ze picked up a pen, placed its tip in the groove, and let it slide along the path. He and Xu Qinglang slowly turned to follow its direction.\n\nThen, the tip of the pen pointed to...\n\n...Bai Yingying, who was sitting behind the counter playing *Honor of Kings*. That was where Zhou Ze had been sitting last night.\n\nZhou Ze tossed the pen aside and looked at Xu Qinglang.\n\nCarving a small groove into a ceramic tile was no small feat.\n\nXu Qinglang said in disbelief, \"No way. Did something really get summoned last night? How come neither of us saw it?\"\n\n\"When Bureau Chief Zhao came last time, did we realize he was already dead?\"\n\"When the Faceless Woman came in disguise last time, did we see through her true identity?\"\n\n\"This...\" Xu Qinglang trailed off.\n\nZhou Ze silently spread the paper out again and picked up the pen. \"Do you think I'd be able to summon a Pen Immortal, given my identity?\"\n\nZhou Ze was, strictly speaking, a bailiff of Hell. He was different from the people from the Horror Story Enthusiasts Association last night.\n\n\"I don't know, but what I want to know is, did you already sense something was wrong last night when you were sitting there watching the show?\" Xu Qinglang asked, pointing at Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"Although I didn't feel any particular fluctuations and didn't see anything I shouldn't have, when they pushed that pen in my direction, I felt a stirring in my heart, like I was being watched by something.\"\n\n\"Then why didn't you tell them beforehand!\"\n\nXu Qinglang grabbed Zhou Ze by the collar.\n\n\"You felt something was wrong, something that could even make *you* feel a stirring! When they said they were going to that building behind us to play that damned exploration game or confession game, why didn't you stop them and warn them!\"\n\nZhou Ze raised a hand, not to push away Xu Qinglang's grip, but to wipe away the spittle that had landed on his face when Xu Qinglang shouted at him. Then, he looked at Xu Qinglang.\n\n\"What's it got to do with me?\"\n\nYes.\n\nWhat's it got to do with me?\n\nLetting go of Zhou Ze, Xu Qinglang stumbled back two steps. He suddenly felt that the man before him was a stranger.\n\n\"They were customers in my shop. According to business regulations, I naturally have a duty to ensure their safety while they are reading books or having a tea party in my store. But since they had already left my store, what happened next, what's it got to do with me?\"\n\n\"You weren't like this before,\" Xu Qinglang murmured.\n\n\"What we need to do now is not to lament the past, nor to sigh over how things have changed. We need to find that hidden thing and send it to hell.\"\n\n\"You're that passionate about this?\"\n\n\"It's for my performance record. Weren't you always mocking me for having no goals in life?\"\n\n\"You...\" Xu Qinglang licked his lips. \"Fine. You can investigate slowly by yourself. I'm not waiting on you anymore.\"\n\nXu Qinglang waved his hand dismissively and stormed out of the bookstore.\n\nBai Yingying came out at that moment holding a cup of tea, looking somewhat surprised.\n\n\"Boss, did you have a fight with Beauty Xu?\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't answer. He just squatted down silently and continued to stare at the groove, at the Pen Immortal chart before him.\n\n\"Boss, I'm going back to my game then.\" Bai Yingying placed the tea next to Zhou Ze, stuck out her tongue, and ran to the shop next door.\n\nShe didn't notice that Zhou Ze, squatting on the ground and staring at the Pen Immortal chart, had beads of sweat constantly forming on his forehead, while one hand was clutching tightly at his left chest.\n\n*Damn it.*\n\n*I have to find that thing as soon as possible.*\n\n*Or else more people will die.*\n\n*Damn it.*\n\n*Why does it hurt so much!*\n\nWhen Bai Yingying entered the noodle shop, Xu Qinglang was sitting there smoking. Seeing her come in, Xu Qinglang said directly:\n\n\"Is there something wrong with your boss these past two days?\"\n\n\"I actually think he's become more normal,\" Bai Yingying said as she sat down and turned on the computer.\n\n\"More normal?\" Xu Qinglang chuckled twice. \"You didn't see someone fall to their death right in front of us yesterday, and he just stood there wiping his face with a tissue!\"\n\n\"The person died instantly on impact, right? Would not wiping his face have saved them?\" Bai Yingying entered her game with a disdainful look. \"He was an experienced doctor in his past life. He can tell with one glance if someone can be saved. Instead of running over and shouting and making a useless scene, it's better to clean his own face first.\"\n\n\"Hey, are you taking his side? Are you two even human?!\"\n\n\"The two of us really aren't human.\"\n\n*Thump!*\n\nJust then, the computer screen flickered and went black.\n\nThe power had gone out again.\n\n\"Smack smack smack smack smack!\"\n\nBai Yingying pounded her keyboard. \"I just landed and got a 98K, for crying out loud!\"\n\nXu Qinglang, who had been sitting there smoking, immediately ran out of the shop.\n\nHe looked up.\n\nAt the sky.\n\nAt that moment, by a fifth-floor window, stood a man dressed in white.\n\nMany police officers nearby were frantically making calls and shouting into their walkie-talkies for their colleagues inside the building to stop him, while a middle-aged police chief roared:\n\n\"How did you let someone get up to the crime scene? What the hell are you all paid for!\"\n\n*SPLAT!*\n\nA dull and familiar thud.\n\nXu Qinglang stood rooted to the spot, staring blankly as the person fell from the sky.\n\nEverything was as if it were a repeat of last night.\n\nHe subconsciously closed his eyes.\n\nAt this moment, human lives were like dumplings being dropped into a pot, one after another, cheap and worthless.\n\n***\n\n¹ A literal translation of the term `釣魚執法` (diàoyú zhífǎ) is \"fishing law enforcement.\" It refers to the practice of entrapment, luring someone into committing a crime.",

    "content": "Hearing the clamor from the crowd outside, Zhou Ze, who had been squatting, sank dejectedly to the floor. The tiles were cold, but his heart was colder still.\n\nOh, right.\n\nHe'd forgotten.\n\nHe didn't have a heart anymore.\n\nLifting his shirt, Zhou Ze saw that the place where he had been hollowed out had already healed. It had healed completely in just one night.\n\nThis made Zhou Ze wonder if he had fallen for the other party's illusion, and that in reality, his heart was still there.\n\nBecause he could sense a heartbeat. This body of his was still full of vitality; there was nothing wrong with it.\n\nBut it seemed a certain emotion had been extracted.\n\nSome of his instinctual reactions had also been stamped with a prohibition sign, as if an invisible wall had been erected, trapping him inside.\n\nLast night, he should have rushed to the deceased's side just like Xu Qinglang. Even if his first instinct told him the person was definitely dead, the old him would have reacted that way.\n\nLike just now, when Xu Qinglang berated him, he had retorted, \"What does it have to do with me?\"\n\nIn truth, given his state last night—first fighting that monkey, then being dragged to a dinner table by that inexplicable old man to sample a one-of-a-kind meal—he was already in a daze.\n\nEven when that group was playing the Pen Immortal game and he sensed something, it was impossible for him to have had a clear reaction.\n\nThe Zhou Ze of last night had been a bundle of nerves, jumpy at every shadow; any so-called \"palpitation\" was ambiguous at best.\n\nOf course, these were all excuses. Zhou Ze now clearly felt as if he were getting \"braces.\" He could still eat and drink, but he was always under some sort of restriction, and it just felt uncomfortable.\n\nThat's how people are. No matter how great the misfortune and pressure you encounter, as long as there's still hope before you, you can always clutch it tightly and keep moving forward.\n\nThe Zhou Ze in the orphanage was like that. The Zhou Ze in the hospital was like that.\n\nEven the him of now was like that.\n\nTo put it nicely, you could call it resilience. To put it bluntly, it was just the belief that a bad life is better than a good death.\n\nHe propped himself up with both hands,\n\nlifted his head,\n\nand let out a long breath.\n\nHe hadn't been fast enough.\n\nHe had kept telling himself he had to find that thing early, catch it, throw it into Hell, and earn merit. This was definitely a lucrative piece of merit.\n\nBut hadn't he also known full well that for every day that thing wasn't found, once one person died, a second and a third would surely follow?\n\nOnce a ghost truly started killing, it would only become more and more frenzied. For a ghost, to repent is to vanish into thin air.\n\nAnd because of that, people would continue to inexplicably end their own lives in this manner.\n\nBut Zhou Ze couldn't think like that, couldn't let that be his goal and become anxious, or the twisting pain in his chest would become unbearable.\n\nJust as that old man had said at the dinner table: once a person loses their conscience, there's a limit to how good they can be.\n\nJust then, his gaze fixed blankly upward. He saw what looked like a faint black line on the ceiling.\n\nSuddenly,\n\nZhou Ze's body trembled.\n\nHe'd found it.\n\nHe'd found that thing.\n\nIt had never come inside. It wasn't in the bookstore last night.\n\nIt was above.\n\nIts gaze was looking down,\n\nwatching everything here!\n\nIt had even extended its hand, influencing the tip of the pen, and in this way, bit by bit, joined the game.\n\nThis was an inconceivable method, a method that transcended Zhou Ze's understanding.\n\n\"Now people can finally stop dying!\"\n\n\"Hiss... That hurts...\"\n\nZhou Ze, who had just stood up, was forced to bend over and squat down again.\n\n\"Now I can finally make my quota.\"\n\nThere, the pain was gone.\n\nFuck!\n\n...\n\n\"The deceased is Chen Yinong,\" Xu Qinglang said to Zhou Ze, who had just walked out, while chewing on a betel nut.\n\n\"The guy who was going to confess his love last night?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Yeah, that's him. I just sidled up to the police and overheard some things. He had probably just finished giving his statement. Who knew he'd show up here right after leaving the police station, and then jump.\"\n\nThe police hadn't identified a specific suspect, so after Zhou Ze and Xu Qinglang gave their statements, the others were also allowed to leave after the investigation. The only restriction was that they weren't allowed to leave Tongcheng for the time being.\n\n\"So he came back from the police station and jumped for love?\" Zhou Ze remarked. \"That's one hell of a wedding.\"\n\n\"Hey, can't you be a little more respectful? The guy's dead,\" Xu Qinglang said to Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Respectful? Do you need to be respectful? I still have some spirit money back at my place. You can go burn some if you need to.\" Zhou Ze shrugged.\n\n\"I have no idea who invented the idiotic method of accumulating virtue by burning spirit money. You think burning spirit money will earn you virtue and solve all your problems?\"\n\n\"That sounds like saying money is the root of all evil. Then why don't you sell your twenty-some properties and donate them to the Hope Project?\"\n\n\"...\" Xu Qinglang was speechless.\n\n\"Come with me to a place,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Where?\"\n\nZhou Ze pointed to the tall building to the west. \"There.\"\n\n...\n\nThere were several tall buildings in this commercial center, all connected by walkways. Of course, with the commercial center having fallen into disuse, the businesses in these buildings had long since moved out.\n\nThis was one of the signs of overdevelopment in a city. When the construction of skyscrapers exceeds the daily needs of the people, you often end up with these massive ghost buildings, which is also a waste of resources.\n\nThe elevators were out of service, so Zhou Ze and Xu Qinglang had to take the stairs.\n\n\"Hey, those two jumped from the building opposite us,\" Xu Qinglang reminded him. \"It was opposite us, directly above your shop and mine. What are you doing over here?\"\n\nThe two were now in a position west of Zhou Ze's and Xu Qinglang's shops, nearly a hundred meters away from where the successive suicides had taken place.\n\n\"You're a mystic practitioner yourself, so what makes you, an insider, think that a ghost has to kill like a living person, by standing in front of them and stabbing them with a knife?\" Zhou Ze retorted.\n\n\"Then on what basis did you determine that thing would be here?\"\n\n\"The grooves on the tiles.\"\n\nThe two had already reached the fourth floor. Zhou Ze chose a spot that offered the shortest, most direct line of sight to his shop, then extended his index finger and swiped it gently in front of him.\n\n\"What's that supposed to mean?\" Xu Qinglang asked.\n\n\"If you're just going to be a curious little baby standing next to me asking 'why,' I suggest you go act in a suspense drama. Because they always need some moronic assistant standing next to the protagonist, constantly asking 'why' to set the stage for him to look cool.\"\n\n\"Damn, you're getting more and more cynical,\" Xu Qinglang said, displeased.\n\n\"Because I've always treated you like a brother, not a woman.\" Zhou Ze reached out and patted Xu Qinglang's shoulder.\n\n\"You don't seem particularly gentle with Bai Yingying either.\"\n\nZhou Ze made the finger-swiping motion again, then said, \"Actually, this should be a parallel line. Can you understand that?\"\n\n\"You mean when that group was playing the Pen Immortal game last night, they really did summon something, but that thing didn't get close? Instead, it was standing around where we are now.\n\nAnd then, with its finger, it controlled the movement of the pen tip, pointing it at you?\"\n\n\"You got it,\" Zhou Ze said, a smile gracing the corners of his mouth. \"So, that one is very bold. The question those enthusiasts from the association asked last night was whether they could successfully see a ghost tonight, and the pen tip was manipulated to point at me.\n\nIt didn't mind offending me, and it didn't even mind killing someone right next to me.\"\n\n\"That brazen?\"\n\n\"No. In my eyes, this means it's more valuable, and the merit gained from sending it in will be more substantial. This is a big fish, a big fish that doesn't even give a damn about a Hell Emissary.\"\n\n\"Then isn't it very dangerous?\" Xu Qinglang muttered.\n\n\"That's why I called you along.\" Zhou Ze looked at Xu Qinglang. \"I told you I see you as a brother, so if the opponent is terrifying, we'll die together. Isn't that romantic?\"\n\n\"...\" Xu Qinglang was speechless.\n\n\"Romantic my ass, you sicko!\"\n\n\"It's fine. Worst case, we go to Hell. I've been there, I know the way.\"\n\nZhou Ze gestured again, then took out his phone to look at the photo of the line, continuing to estimate the angle in his head. He then pointed to the roof and said, \"It's on the fifth floor. Shouldn't be too far off.\"\n\n\"Hey, you could have at least told me earlier so I could bring some magical artifacts!\" Xu Qinglang complained as he followed Zhou Ze up the stairs.\n\n\"Remember the night we subdued Bai Yingying? It wouldn't have made much of a difference whether you had magical artifacts or not.\"\n\nXu Qinglang was at a loss for words for a moment, then cursed, \"You heartless bastard.\"\n\nZhou Ze's steps paused, and he smiled.\n\nThen,\n\nthe two of them walked to the easternmost window on the fifth floor.\n\nThis place was supposed to have been an amusement park, but it was now covered in dust. Some machines and facilities that hadn't been moved were still there, exuding an extremely desolate atmosphere.\n\nXu Qinglang was a little nervous, but Zhou Ze continued walking forward at a leisurely pace.\n\nIt should be right around here.\n\nSuddenly, Zhou Ze stopped in front of an inflatable bouncy castle.\n\n\"Well, well, long time no see!\"\n\nA familiar voice came from behind the inflatable castle.\n\nZhou Ze looked up,\n\nand saw an old man in a filthy, stained Daoist robe jump down from it.\n\n\"Big brother, long time no see! I've really missed you! Come, come, we'll drink tonight, my treat, to repay you for last time!\"\n\nThe old Daoist walked over to greet Zhou Ze.\n\nBut just then,\n\nXu Qinglang instinctively formed a hand seal:\n\n\"Boundless Heaven and Earth, Mystic Heart's Righteous Law!\"\n\nHe bit his own index finger and pressed it onto the center of the old Daoist's forehead.\n\nHe was fast, without a hint of hesitation.\n\nBut what happened next stunned Xu Qinglang. The old Daoist, as if nothing had happened, glanced at Xu Qinglang twice and grumbled:\n\n\"Is there something wrong with this lady friend of yours? Or is this a custom in your family, to greet people by smearing blood on their face? Damn, that's cooler than the Dai people's Water-Splashing Festival!\n\nCome, come, let this poor Daoist teach you the customs of my hometown too.\"\n\nWith that, the old Daoist reached down and scratched his crotch, as if to return the favor to Xu Qinglang.\n\nBut at that exact moment, Zhou Ze's hand shot out, his nails extending, and clamped down directly on the old Daoist's neck.\n\nAnd in the old Daoist's hand that had just been rummaging in his pants, a bright yellow talisman had appeared out of nowhere. He looked at Zhou Ze with an expression of astonishment:\n\n\"Damn it... you're... faster... than me...\"\n\nZhou Ze's gaze swept over the talisman. Then, he applied pressure with his nails. The old Daoist's entire body convulsed as if electrocuted. Finally, with a light push from Zhou Ze, the old Daoist fell to the ground and rolled several times.\n\nIgnoring the unconscious old Daoist on the ground, Zhou Ze jumped directly over the inflatable castle.\n\nBehind the inflatable castle,\n\nlay a person,\n\ncovered in wounds.\n\nFound him.\n\nHe really was here.",

    "content": "This was a woman, her body covered by a white dress. But beneath the white fabric, her body was a mass of scars. It seemed as if every inch bore a different kind of wound, a truly shocking sight.\n\nFrom Zhou Ze's professional perspective, it was a miracle that this woman wasn't dead yet.\n\nIn typical action movies, a tragic character, after being shot multiple times, can still muster a final burst of energy for a long and drawn-out flashback, followed by several rounds of \"You have to go!\" \"I won't go!\" \"If you don't go, I won't go either!\", and then finally pick up a gun to mow down a few more enemies. In reality, that's basically impossible.\n\nHumans, in truth, are fragile.\n\nThe reason this woman before him wasn't dead yet—still breathing, her chest rising and falling faintly—was due to her own unique nature.\n\nZhou Ze walked straight over, then touched his fingernail to his palm, preparing to open the Gates of Hell.\n\n\"So direct?\" Xu Qinglang asked from behind. \"Not even going to ask?\"\n\n\"Nothing to ask.\"\n\nWhile she was still unconscious, he would snatch her soul from her body and send it to Hell. Perfect.\n\nHowever, just then, the old Taoist priest whom Zhou Ze had thrown aside scrambled to his feet again and charged at Zhou Ze.\n\nXu Qinglang took a step forward, extending a hand to block the old priest, then flung him to the side. The old priest's body was still weak from being \"zapped\" by Zhou Ze's fingernails earlier, so he was naturally no match for Xu Qinglang.\n\n\"Don't... don't do this. Spare her, I'm begging you, spare her.\"\n\nLying on his side, the old priest began to plead.\n\nBut Zhou Ze was unmoved. A thread resembling black syrup was pulled out and drawn into a circle.\n\nImmediately after, Zhou Ze reached out, intending to pull her soul from her body. Although the soul was currently very weak, Zhou Ze could already sense the formidable level of her spirit.\n\nThis was a big fish, a much juicier prize than the small fry he'd caught before!\n\n*Buzz!*\n\nAt that moment, a fountain pen suddenly floated up and shot directly at Zhou Ze.\n\nWith quick eyes and nimble hands, Zhou Ze leaned back slightly, dodging the pen. But the pen's true target wasn't Zhou Ze, but Xu Qinglang. Its nib came to a stop right at Xu Qinglang's throat.\n\nAlthough Xu Qinglang's Adam's apple was not very prominent, he now stood with his hands spread, not daring to move a muscle.\n\nThe woman on the floor still had her eyes closed. She was still in a coma, but she was the one controlling all of this.\n\n\"Old Zhou, don't be hasty, don't be hasty!\" Xu Qinglang yelled. He was terrified that Zhou Ze would disregard his life. He was, at this very moment, hanging by a thread—no different from having a pistol pointed at his temple.\n\nHowever, Zhou Ze truly did disregard his life, his fingers reaching for the woman's forehead.\n\nAt the same instant, the pen's nib pierced Xu Qinglang's neck, creating a small cut from which fresh blood began to flow.\n\n\"Urk...\" Sensing the pain in his neck, Xu Qinglang didn't dare reach for the pen. He had a premonition that if he made the slightest rash move, the pen would instantly pierce through his neck.\n\nThe woman didn't wake, but to Zhou Ze, this was a silent threat.\n\nShe couldn't do anything to Zhou Ze, but she could threaten him with the lives of those around him.\n\n\"Those two who jumped to their deaths were very pitiful,\" Zhou Ze said suddenly.\n\nXu Qinglang was stunned. He had no idea what Zhou Ze meant by suddenly bringing this up.\n\n\"During the day, you were scolding me for not warning them last night. You even said I'd changed,\" Zhou Ze continued.\n\n\"Huh?\" said Xu Qinglang.\n\n\"So, I think you should be willing to sacrifice yourself to get revenge for them, right?\"\n\n\"...\" said Xu Qinglang.\n\nZhou Ze suddenly clutched his chest with one hand and pressed the other to the ground. Cold sweat beaded on his face, and he made no other move.\n\nAnd the fountain pen fell listlessly to the floor. Xu Qinglang clutched the small wound on his neck, gasping for breath and mumbling what sounded like curses, though the words were unclear.\n\nThe old priest hurried to the woman's side to check on her condition, looking anxious and a bit lost.\n\nZhou Ze shot a resentful glare at Xu Qinglang. If he'd known, he wouldn't have brought him along. He had only been thinking that an extra person could help him find his target faster; who would have thought Xu Qinglang would become leverage for the other party to use against him.\n\nOriginally, Zhou Ze should have ignored Xu Qinglang's life and death to complete his quota. But he had forcibly changed his mind, and in that instant, a sharp pain wrung his chest, making him feel like he was dying.\n\n*Dammit.*\n\n*This is a transaction, isn't it?*\n\n*This is also considered having a conscience?*\n\n*This makes me hurt too?*\n\n*Besides, if he dies, who's going to make me sour plum juice?*\n\n*I'm just thinking of myself!*\n\nThe old priest fumbled in his crotch again and took out a paper talisman. This guy's supply of talismans was truly inexhaustible, and he seemed to have a particular fondness for hiding them in *that* spot. Who knew if there was some special significance to it.\n\n\"Big brother, I'm sorry, but I must protect this person. She barely escaped from Rongcheng, I can't let her fall into your hands.\"\n\nThe old priest said to Zhou Ze, holding the talisman, and finished with an apologetic tone:\n\n\"My apologies.\"\n\nWith that, the old priest was about to slap the talisman onto Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze's head snapped up, a black glint flashing in his eyes. However, before Zhou Ze could make a move, two figures appeared directly behind the old priest.\n\nXu Qinglang was still holding his neck, but the syllables coming from his mouth were becoming clearer.\n\nThe old priest was lifted off his feet. He twisted his head only to find that a man and a woman had appeared behind him at some point—two empty human skins, yet possessing a strength no less than that of an ordinary person.\n\n*Thump!*\n\n\"Ow!\"\n\nThe old priest was thrown out once again, crashing onto the tiled floor.\n\nWriggling his body and clutching his back with one hand, the old priest wailed:\n\n\"Agh, my back...\"\n\nZhou Ze slowly calmed the searing pain in his chest and raised his hand again. He knew the woman before him was extremely weak; the earlier resistance and standoff were the absolute last of her limits.\n\n\"Big brother, I'm beggin' ya, spare her, let us go.\"\n\n\"Let you go?\" Xu Qinglang clutched his neck with one hand while using the other to direct the two puppet skins to slowly approach the old priest. \"Then who's going to answer for the two people who jumped to their deaths?\"\n\n\"We didn't kill those two! We didn't touch 'em, we even wanted to save 'em! They wanted to die themselves!\" the old priest explained.\n\n\"You think we'd believe that?\" Xu Qinglang snorted.\n\nSeeing Xu Qinglang's \"Bringer of Light\" act, the old priest ignored him and looked toward Zhou Ze, pleading:\n\n\"Big brother, she's also from our Netherworld Store. She's a friend of our boss. She got injured trying to help him.\"\n\nThe old priest remembered from his first meeting with Zhou Ze that Zhou Ze had been very interested in his boss's affairs. At this point, he could only try to bring up the boss.\n\nZhou Ze's hand had just been placed on the woman's forehead. Before he could exert any force, he heard the old priest's words and immediately paused.\n\nA companion of that man?\n\nThe man who sat behind the counter of the Netherworld Store in the old priest's livestream, struggling to drink porridge?\n\nThe man who, in his dream by the pond, had warned him about the faceless woman's scheme?\n\nHe owed him a favor.\n\n*Hiss...*\n\nHis chest began to hurt again.\n\nZhou Ze took several deep breaths, then took two steps back, staggering to his feet.\n\nFortunately, the pain didn't last long, but it always reminded him whenever he made a choice that violated his profit-first principle and became burdened by personal connections.\n\nIt was like having a venomous scorpion hidden in his chest.\n\nThere's a famous experiment with monkeys, a cage, and electric shocks.\n\nPerhaps this was the price and purpose of having no conscience: to make you develop a conditioned fear and slowly correct your old \"bad\" habits.\n\n\"You don't actually believe him, do you?\" Xu Qinglang looked at Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze waved his hand dismissively.\n\n\"Hey, who would be stupid enough to jump to their death one after another? Didn't you say before...\"\n\n\"I believe that guy.\" Zhou Ze glanced at Xu Qinglang, then looked at the old priest. \"You can take her away. Don't appear before me again.\"\n\nA person's reputation precedes them. Zhou Ze no longer believed this woman was responsible for the couple who had jumped to their deaths on consecutive days. This woman might have participated in the Pen Spirit game, and she might have acted in it, but she certainly wasn't killing people.\n\nThe little loli had said that the man in Rongcheng had played with fire, acting as a judge and executing his so-called righteous judgments outside the laws of the mortal realm, which was what led to his suppression by the Underworld.\n\nTherefore, a friend of such a person couldn't possibly be a malevolent ghost who killed indiscriminately. Otherwise, given that guy's personality, he would have been the first one to kill the woman.\n\nThis deduction was truly more credible than any so-called evidence, because even when the little loli spoke of that man, she only mocked him for his arrogance, but she never said a single bad thing about his personal character.\n\nThe old priest immediately stood up, clutching his back and thanking him profusely. But when he got to the woman's side, his face fell again.\n\n\"Big brother, we have nowhere to go. She told me to bring her here before, thinkin' that by stayin' close to you, we'd be hidin' in plain sight, and those huntin' her wouldn't notice this place.\n\nIf I take her and leave now, wouldn't that be like a sheep walkin' into a tiger's mouth?\"\n\n\"You're... being hunted?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Uh, that's about the gist of it. Anyway, those guys are ghosts, poppin' up everywhere. From mirrors, crowds, even from the grass or underground, they can just appear. It was pure luck that we made it here alive.\"\n\n\"It's pointless anyway. Her injuries have already worsened severely. She won't last much longer,\" Zhou Ze said, rubbing his fingers. \"Once this physical body is destroyed and she's left as a pure soul, she'll either be discovered quickly or fall directly into Hell.\"\n\n\"We went to a hospital before to try and treat her injuries, but as soon as we entered the room, a doctor who looked perfectly normal suddenly stripped off his clothes and turned into a hideous thing tryin' to kill us.\"\n\nThe old priest looked deeply troubled.\n\n\"It's only been these past two days livin' near you that we've had some peace.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid I can't help,\" Zhou Ze shrugged.\n\nHis admiration for the man from Rongcheng was one thing, and the favor he owed him was now repaid by turning a blind eye this time. He was unwilling to get involved any further, or else next time it would be the little loli leading a troop of bailiffs to storm his bookstore.\n\nAt this moment, the fountain pen that had fallen to the ground suddenly stood up. Xu Qinglang's expression changed, and he became vigilant.\n\nBut the pen only wrote a few words on the ground:\n\n\"Save me, give you heart.\"\n\nSeeing these words, Zhou Ze's gaze immediately sharpened.\n\n\"Shameless little bitch!\n\nHow confident is this woman in her looks? Save you and you'll give your heart to someone?\"\n\nXu Qinglang scoffed from the side. \"Even if you were gorgeous before, looking like this now, what kind of idiot would want your heart!\"\n\n\"I would.\"\n\n\"What?\" Xu Qinglang was stunned, staring at Zhou Ze. It was as if, in that moment, Xu Qinglang was seeing Zhou Ze for the first time. Dr. Lin was so beautiful, yet he could walk right past her without a second glance. Turns out *this* was his type.\n\n\"Big brother, didn't you just say there was nothing you could do?\" the old priest asked doubtfully.\n\n\"Oh, I forgot. I just remembered. In my past life, I was the best surgeon in Tongcheng.\"",

    "content": "\"Hey, Zhou Ze, you've changed. Are you even human anymore? You were the one who said she killed those two people, and now you're the one saving her! One minute you're making me go with you to catch the killer, the next you're making me help you carry the killer back.\n\nWhat the hell do you take me for!\"\n\nBack in the bookstore, Xu Qinglang was grumbling directly at Zhou Ze's back.\n\nNo, to be precise, Xu Qinglang hadn't stopped his verbal barrage the entire way down from the high-rise, his incessant nagging reminiscent of a wife berating her deadbeat husband for fooling around outside for several nights, not coming home, and not even providing money for living expenses.\n\nBai Yingying sat behind the counter, playing on her phone. She didn't dare turn on the computer to play games anymore; the occasional power outages were truly unbearable.\n\nZhou Ze hadn't planned on paying Xu Qinglang any mind—he didn't have the energy for it right now—but Xu Qinglang seemed to be getting addicted to his own ranting. Zhou Ze spun around, pointed a finger at the other man's nose, and said directly:\n\n\"What do I take you for? Haven't you ever heard the saying, 'No investigation, no right to speak'?\"\n\nI don't know her, but I know her friend. I owe that person a favor. Let me ask you, is that reason enough?\"\n\n\"What about the two people who died...\"\n\n\"Do I know the two people who died?\" Zhou Ze retorted. \"What does it have to do with me? Am I Joan of Arc or Hai Rui?¹ Have I asked the locals to build a temple for me and burn merit incense in my name?\n\nI'm just an unlucky ghost who was killed by a hitman hired by an idiot, and then by a strange twist of fate, I ended up possessing that idiot's body!\n\nI'm not a person, I'm just a ghost, so please, Mr. Xu, with your twenty-something properties, stop trying to hold me to your set of universal values!\n\nYou need me to be selfless? You need me to pursue truth and justice?\n\nThen you should have shouted 'Fire at me!'² when that pen was pointed at your throat just now!\n\nYou can't even do it yourself, yet you have the nerve to criticize others?\n\nI'm a ghost. For a long time, I didn't even have a legal identity. Under those circumstances, you still expect me to live by 'I for everyone,' but when has 'everyone' ever been for me?\"\n\n\"You...\"\n\n\"You what? Didn't you break the rules yourself by forcibly keeping your parents' spirits here to enjoy some kind of family reunion atmosphere?\n\nWhen you were doing that, why didn't you stop to think about all the other bereaved families in the world who don't get that kind of privilege?\n\nI don't care if she killed anyone or not. The favor I owe that person in Chengdu is enough for me to turn a blind eye!\n\nI don't care if she's the killer or not. She promised to get my heart back, so I'm willing to treat her!\n\nIt's. That. Simple!\n\nSo, please take your arrogance, take your self-righteousness, take your holier-than-thou attitude, and get the hell next door!\"\n\nZhou Ze said all this in one breath and let out a long sigh. To be honest, he had been really frustrated lately, especially after the incident with Monkey. Really, really frustrated.\n\nHe shouldn't have stuck his nose in other people's business. He could have just covered his eyes and pretended he saw nothing. That way, he wouldn't have had to make any choices, and he wouldn't have had his heart taken by that old geezer.\n\nHe could have learned from the ostrich, buried his head in the sand, stuck his ass in the air, waddled around,\n\nand shouted, \"What a beautiful, beautiful, beautiful world this is!\"\n\nHow nice would that be?\n\nHow comfortable.\n\nXu Qinglang swallowed hard. Faced with Zhou Ze's verbal counterattack, he was at a loss.\n\nThe atmosphere turned cold for a moment.\n\nBai Yingying had been watching from the side for a long time, not daring to interject.\n\nXu Qinglang pointed a finger at Zhou Ze. It was a look of utter despair,³ a true case of a crabapple tree battered and disheveled by a fierce wind. Then, with a flick of his sleeve, he turned and walked toward the door. But he paused as he pushed the glass door open and asked:\n\n\"What do you want for lunch?\"\n\n\"Tomato beef over rice with strawberry juice, thank you,\" Zhou Ze replied without hesitation.\n\n\"Alright.\"\n\nXu Qinglang left to go cook.\n\nBai Yingying stuck out her tongue, then covered her nose.\n\nZhou Ze looked at her. \"If you're about to say you smell something sour again, it means the toilet is clogged. Go scrub it three more times.\"\n\nBai Yingying immediately shook her head. \"It's as sweet as can be.\"\n\nJust then, a van pulled up in front of the bookstore.\n\n\"Go move the stuff.\"\n\nAt Zhou Ze's command, Bai Yingying went out and carried two boxes inside. The van left as soon as it dropped off the items.\n\n\"What's in here?\" Bai Yingying asked.\n\n\"Simple surgical instruments.\" Zhou Ze opened one of the boxes and took out a pair of gloves to put on.\n\n\"Boss, how did you get someone to deliver these?\"\n\n\"I was a doctor in my past life.\"\n\n\"Uh, and?\"\n\n\"And so, of course, I know which department head smuggles medical equipment, takes bribes, and pockets the profits. It was a simple matter to give him a call, threaten him a little, and have him send over some inexpensive instruments.\"\n\n\"That's possible?\" Bai Yingying was stunned for a moment and only came to her senses after a good while.\n\n\"Bring the things upstairs,\" Zhou Ze said, heading upstairs himself first.\n\nOn the second floor, the woman was lying on a straw mat. The old Taoist priest was squatting beside her with a cigarette dangling from his lips. When Zhou Ze came over, the old Taoist asked worriedly:\n\n\"Big Brother, are you sure about this?\"\n\n\"You could always take her to a hospital, and then get discovered by that gang of Underworld emissaries.\"\n\nThe old Taoist said no more.\n\nBai Yingying came up carrying one box in each hand as if it were nothing. Sometimes Zhou Ze felt he was getting the short end of the stick; if he ran a construction crew instead of a bookstore, having an employee like Bai Yingying would be a huge boon. He could save on excavators, bulldozers, and the like.\n\nOnce everything was ready and the instruments were sterilized, Zhou Ze began to prepare for the operation.\n\n\"Big Brother, no anesthesia?\" the old Taoist reminded him from the side.\n\n\"She doesn't need it. Her willpower is terrifying.\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head and used scissors to cut open the wounds that had been hastily bandaged after the woman was injured.\n\nThe wounds hadn't been treated poorly, it's just that these injuries were no ordinary ones. Simple bandaging was completely ineffective.\n\n\"That's true. They say she once went half a year without sleeping and still pulled through,\" the old Taoist muttered from the side.\n\nZhou Ze held open a wound on her left arm, then probed inside with a pair of forceps. The woman showed no reaction; she seemed to have fallen into a deep slumber.\n\nNext, Zhou Ze used the forceps to extract a black feather from the wound, dropping it onto the metal tray Bai Yingying was holding.\n\n*Clink...*\n\nThe feather was soft, but it made a crisp sound as it landed.\n\n\"This humble Taoist recalls that this feather should be from a black feather duster. A fellow with a pale face, dressed in black, was chasing us with it.\"\n\n\"Black Impermanence?\"⁴ Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Don't know. Looked a bit like him,\" the old Taoist replied.\n\nZhou Ze remained noncommittal and continued cleaning the wounds.\n\nMy goodness,\n\nwho knew how many strange things were embedded in this woman's body.\n\nIn the time that followed, Zhou Ze successively removed torn talisman paper, throwing darts carved with runes, and drained out silvery mercury water. It was like he'd opened a general store; there was a bit of everything.\n\nBai Yingying and the old Taoist, watching from the side, were dazzled.\n\nDuring the procedure, although the foreign objects were removed from the wounds one by one, for the body, it was nothing short of a secondary trauma. Because of this, Zhou Ze was constantly monitoring the woman's condition.\n\nFinally, as Zhou Ze was removing two pieces of red glass from a wound on the woman's lower abdomen, he saw a faint black mist rise from her body, and a shadow seemed about to float out.\n\nOnly Zhou Ze could see this sight.\n\nThis was a sign that the body was on the verge of collapse and could no longer contain the soul. Interpreted from a scientific perspective, it meant the patient was about to die, resuscitation efforts having failed.\n\nZhou Ze's right fingernails grew long. He then grabbed the black shadow directly and pushed it back into the body.\n\n\"Mmm...\"\n\nA faint, barely audible sound was heard.\n\n\"Just hold on a little longer. There are still a few more wounds to treat. After that, we'll apply some medicine. If you can get through this, your body will slowly recover.\"\n\nThis was the most unusual operation Zhou Ze had ever performed in his medical career. Setting aside the complexity of the patient's injuries, the mere act of treating her while simultaneously pushing her soul—which was about to leave her body—back in would be enough to shock the entire medical world if word got out.\n\nIt was practically a cheat code, like playing an arcade game with an infinite number of coins to keep inserting and continuing your life.\n\nOf course, Zhou Ze also knew this was only possible because the woman's soul was inherently strong. An ordinary person's soul might withstand being manhandled once, but it would likely disintegrate if it happened two or three times.\n\nFrom this perspective, the extent of this woman's tenacity was truly terrifying.\n\nZhou Ze was even a little curious. If a woman associated with him was this tenacious and terrifying, what was the man himself—the one stirring up storms in Chengdu—actually like?\n\nBirds of a feather flock together, after all.\n\nAfter treating the last wound and applying the medicine, Zhou Ze let out a long sigh.\n\nFrom here on, it would be up to her own willpower to hold on until her body slowly recovered. The problem, most likely, was no longer critical.\n\nActually, if that old bastard who'd dug out his heart was still around, getting some medicine from him would have been the best option. The wound on Zhou Ze's own chest had already recovered without leaving so much as a scar.\n\nOf course, Zhou Ze sometimes wondered if the man had truly cut him open and dug out his heart. Or perhaps, he had merely been caught in some kind of illusion. But then, where did that painful sensation come from every time he tried to do something that went against his own self-interest?\n\nThe woman was settled upstairs. The old Taoist went to the restaurant next door to eat, and Bai Yingying ran off to play games, leaving only Zhou Ze to monitor the woman's condition.\n\nAfter a few hours, Zhou Ze, who was sitting to the side reading a book, suddenly noticed the woman's eyelids twitch. Then he saw her open her eyes.\n\nThe woman was looking at him,\n\nand he was looking at the woman.\n\n\"How are you feeling?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nThe woman nodded slightly, indicating that her body was getting better.\n\n\"Heh, what's your name?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nThe woman was silent for a long time. Just as Zhou Ze was wondering if her physical condition prevented her from speaking, the woman opened her mouth and said:\n\n\"Tang... Shi...\"⁵\n\n\"My name is...\" Zhou Ze paused, then asked with some curiosity:\n\n\"Whenever you introduce yourself, do you often run into wiseasses who say their name is Song Ci?\"\n\n***\n\n¹ **Hai Rui:** A famously incorruptible and upright official from the Ming Dynasty, often seen as a symbol of justice.\n\n² **Fire at me! (向我開炮):** A famous, patriotic line from the 1964 Chinese war film *Heroic Sons and Daughters*, spoken by a soldier calling for artillery to strike his own position to wipe out the surrounding enemy. It has become a symbol of ultimate self-sacrifice.\n\n³ **Utter despair (哀莫大於心死):** An idiom from the classic Taoist text *Zhuangzi*, which literally translates to \"There is no greater sorrow than a dead heart.\" It signifies a state of complete hopelessness.\n\n⁴ **Black Impermanence (黑無常):** A deity in Chinese folk religion and mythology, one of two Underworld guards (the other being White Impermanence) responsible for escorting the souls of the dead.\n\n⁵ **Tang Shi / Song Ci:** A cultural pun. The woman's name, Tang Shi (唐詩), is also the term for \"Tang Dynasty Poetry.\" The name Zhou Ze jokes about, Song Ci (宋詞), is the term for \"Song Dynasty Lyrics.\" These are two of the most celebrated forms of classical Chinese literature.",

    "content": "Three days passed, neither hurried nor slow.\n\nIn these three days, Xu Qinglang was busy looking for a new shop. This long-neglected commercial center had already seen two deaths; setting up shop here again would be purely asking for trouble. He had asked for Zhou Ze’s opinion, whether he would be willing to move with him. He could help Zhou Ze find a new storefront at the same time. Zhou Ze’s response to this was noncommittal.\n\nOn the one hand, Zhou Ze wasn't particularly concerned with the presence of living people around his bookstore. But on the other hand, without the sauces Xu Qinglang concocted, eating would once again become a problem.\n\nSomething else happened during these three days: the police found suicide notes in the homes of both Mr. Chen and Miss Liu, along with their wedding photos.\n\nHowever, the wedding photos were in black and white, and the contents of the suicide notes were even more difficult for the average person to comprehend.\n\nThey had made a pact to die for love, to end their lives in a terrifying manner. In their notes, they expressed their apologies for the trouble and investigation they had caused for the other members of the Horror Story Lovers Association, and at the same time explained that *this* was a true horror story.\n\nThey had met through their love of \"horror,\" so naturally, they had to prove their love in the most \"horrifying\" way possible.\n\nThis news also spread online, causing a public uproar and once again stirring up debate. Many influencers once again brandished their whips, criticizing horror and suspense films and novels. Look, they said, this is how you lead the youth astray. This stuff should be banned.\n\nBut in reality, what ought to be banned are ancient love stories like *The Butterfly Lovers*,¹ because these stories glorify the theme of dying for love, leading countless later generations to emulate them.\n\nThat woman named Tang Shi had stayed on the second floor. After her injuries were treated, she had waited for three days. Zhou Ze finally came to her. He had done what he promised; now it was her turn to fulfill her end of the bargain.\n\n\"Those two really did commit suicide, didn't they?\"\n\nTang Shi was still lying there, bandaged in multiple places, looking like a female mummy. There was simply no way to be concerned with aesthetics, because her original injuries were just too severe and too numerous.\n\n\"Mhm,\" Zhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"I sensed it when they were playing the pen spirit game,\" Tang Shi's eyes looked at Zhou Ze. \"I found it very interesting at the time. They wanted to see a ghost, but they never realized that the owner of the very bookstore they were in was a ghost, and a spirit emissary at that.\n\n\"In fact, the first night when that woman was preparing to jump, I controlled the white dress on my body to try and stop her. But her mind was made up, and I was very weak. I couldn't stop her. She still jumped.\"\n\nZhou Ze said nothing.\n\n\"Ignorant men and women always think death is a beautiful thing. But I imagine that right now, they're in Hell, regretting it terribly. Hell is a terrifying place, enough to make most who commit suicide curse their past foolish selves.\"\n\nAfter saying this, Tang Shi paused, then continued, \"You're much luckier than we are. You haven't experienced the true horror of Hell.\"\n\n\"It's time to get to the point,\" Zhou Ze reminded her.\n\n\"Your heart, is it?\" Tang Shi asked.\n\n\"What else?\"\n\n\"Do you think your heart is gone?\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"But it can't be gone. There are many incredible things in this world, but on the whole, there's still a line that maintains balance.\n\n\"For example, the injuries on my body. You've seen them. Those emissaries who escaped from the Underworld, the things they left on me were also things like black feathers, mercury water, and paper talismans. To ordinary people, their image is very mysterious and lofty.\n\n\"But in reality, just as a goddess must eventually use the privy, if you strip away the mysterious veil of them being able to enter and exit Hell, they are actually quite ordinary.\n\n\"So much so that they are far from possessing the mountain-moving, sea-filling abilities of characters described in so-called superhero movies or cultivation and fantasy novels.\n\n\"Of course, I'm not saying no one has this ability, but I'm certain that if such an existence with that ability exists, it cannot leave Hell.\"\n\n\"So, what exactly are you trying to say?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"About you losing your heart. You told me you can't eat, right? Just like us. I've seen you these past few days, forcing food down with extremely sour or sweet drinks.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"But you said that when you ate your own heart, you didn't feel the slightest discomfort. You even thought it was a little... delicious.\"\n\n\"Are you saying what I ate wasn't actually my heart? No... that I wasn't eating anything tangible at all.\"\n\nZhou Ze quickly understood and continued, \"The meal, the table, the knife and fork... were all fake. It was all an illusion.\"\n\nTang Shi nodded slightly. She seemed a little tired, but she still spoke.\n\n\"No matter how mysterious or terrifying an existence is, they don't have the power to make withered bones grow flesh, much less the miraculous ability to dig out a person's heart while keeping the body as active as it was originally.\n\n\"Therefore, you must have been hypnotized. A very profound hypnosis, one from which you can't even extricate yourself.\"\n\n\"Hypnosis?\"\n\n\"Yes, hypnosis. The dining environment, every word the other party said, every action, was all a psychological suggestion for you. Otherwise, why wouldn't he have just gathered some firewood by the roadside and had a barbecue with you?\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded. In fact, what Tang Shi said coincided with his own previous speculations in many ways.\n\nFor example, every time he made a choice that went against his current self-interest, his chest would hurt. But if he just endured it for a while, he could still follow through with his original choice.\n\nBecause he subconsciously believed he no longer had a conscience, after doing anything that stemmed from \"conscience,\" he would always remind himself: *Oh, I shouldn't be doing this,* and then the pain would come.\n\nIt was the same principle as when a person who has suffered childhood trauma and been left with a psychological scar sees a similar event or scene again, and it still causes physical and mental discomfort.\n\n\"So I should find a psychologist?\"\n\n\"I know a very capable psychologist. He can help you solve your problem,\" said Tang Shi.\n\n\"That one?\" Zhou Ze naturally thought of who it was.\n\n\"As long as he can make it back alive, he can solve your problem.\"\n\n\"Who knows where he's fled to now?\"\n\n\"He didn't flee,\" Tang Shi corrected. \"He went to find them.\"\n\nThe conversation ended there. As Zhou Ze was about to go downstairs, Tang Shi spoke again.\n\n\"Could you call that female jiangshi up?\"\n\n\"For what?\"\n\n\"To sleep with me.\"\n\n\"I'll go ask if she's willing.\"\n\nDownstairs, Bai Yingying was sitting behind the counter playing a game on her phone. Zhou Ze ignored her, not bothering to ask for her opinion on behalf of the woman upstairs. He walked straight out of the shop and hailed a taxi.\n\nA psychologist. He did indeed know a very good one.\n\nLast time, Wang Ke had told him that he wouldn't seek Zhou Ze out again, but if Zhou Ze needed anything, he could go find him.\n\nHe had really called it.\n\nIt was already eleven in the morning when the taxi arrived at the gate of Wang Ke's villa. Zhou Ze rang the doorbell.\n\nThe door opened, and Wang Ke, dressed in a set of pajamas, appeared. Seeing it was Zhou Ze, he first froze for a moment, then gestured for Zhou Ze to come in.\n\nThe scent of meat wafted from the house; something was likely stewing in the kitchen.\n\n\"Want to eat together?\" Wang Ke suggested. \"I just bought some big bones, they've been stewing for a long time. I remember when we were kids in the orphanage, it wasn't easy to get a meal with meat.\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. \"I don't have much of an appetite.\"\n\n\"That's fine, then have some soup. By the way, you came to see me for a reason, right?\"\n\n\"I've been hypnotized. The person who hypnotized me told me I have no conscience. Now, I want to get my conscience back,\" Zhou Ze said, getting straight to the point.\n\nWang Ke frowned, looking a little awkward and uneasy. He said, \"I tried last time, but I couldn't hypnotize you. You said you can't fall asleep under normal circumstances, so I can't use the most direct and effective method on you. I can only try a more roundabout approach to see if it has any effect.\"\n\n\"Let's try.\"\n\nThe two went to Wang Ke's study.\n\nWang Ke changed into a formal suit and sat down behind his desk, then handed Zhou Ze a pocket watch.\n\n\"You swing this in front of me and try to hypnotize me. Then the two of us can establish a kind of reverse psychological connection.\"\n\nWithout hesitation, Zhou Ze took the pocket watch and began to swing it in front of Wang Ke.\n\nWang Ke watched it intently. As he watched, he closed his eyes.\n\nAt the same time, Zhou Ze also felt a little tired, as if Wang Ke's \"sleep\" at that moment had affected him somewhat.\n\n\"Are you asleep?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nWang Ke did not answer.\n\n\"What is your name?\"\n\n\"Wang Ke.\"\n\nIt was a novel feeling. Zhou Ze didn't have much experience in this area, but at that moment, it seemed no experience was needed.\n\n\"You...\"\n\nSuddenly, Zhou Ze's vision blurred. Vaguely, he seemed to hear a man asking him a question:\n\n\"Do you think you need a conscience?\"\n\nZhou Ze was a bit dazed, but he still replied, \"Doing good deeds can lead to bad outcomes.\"\n\n\"So, deep down, you actually resent the behavior you've always upheld,\" the man's voice came again.\n\nWhat followed was a long conversation. Zhou Ze himself was somewhat bewildered, as if the dialogue and the questions and answers had nothing to do with him.\n\nIn front of him, there was a pot. A soup was simmering in the pot, with large bones boiling inside. The aroma of the soup was rich.\n\n*Clatter!*\n\nThe pocket watch fell from Zhou Ze's hand and hit the floor.\n\nZhou Ze slowly opened his eyes.\n\nBehind the desk, Wang Ke also opened his eyes. His eyes were bloodshot, and he looked extremely exhausted.\n\n\"Was it successful?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nWang Ke nodded, then shook his head, saying apologetically, \"Your problem is a bit complicated. Actually, the one who's truly struggling with whether or not to have a conscience is you. It might be that some recent events have caused your original beliefs to waver, and with an external push, it formed a mental block.\"\n\nHearing this, Zhou Ze nodded, lost in thought.\n\n\"By the way, did you ask me any questions?\" Wang Ke suddenly asked.\n\nThis kind of hypnosis was inherently mutual. In fact, Wang Ke had only performed a superficial hypnosis on Zhou Ze, while Wang Ke had completely bared his soul to Zhou Ze.\n\n\"I didn't ask. All I saw was a pot of meat soup. Are you very hungry?\"\n\n\"Yes, I'm hungry,\" Wang Ke nodded.\n\nImmediately, Wang Ke pulled Zhou Ze into the kitchen and opened the pressure cooker. Inside, pork ribs were stewing.\n\n\"Come on, eat a little with me. Think of it as reliving our childhood.\"\n\nZhou Ze suddenly felt a sense of unreality.\n\nA wealthy expert in psychology, joyfully stewing a pot of pork ribs for himself at home. This scene somehow felt... wrong.\n\nZhou Ze even felt a hint of nausea and revulsion in his chest.\n\n\"I won't eat.\"\n\nZhou Ze subconsciously took a few steps back, retreating from the kitchen.\n\nWang Ke, however, was focused on preparing the dipping sauce. \"Come on, eat a little with your big brother,\" he said.\n\n\"You eat it yourself,\" Zhou Ze refused again, his gaze sweeping from time to time towards the pressure cooker and the large ribs tumbling inside it.\n\n\"Don't be polite. This is meat I hand-picked myself. It's sure to taste great,\" Wang Ke continued to invite him.\n\n\"Where's your wife?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nWang Ke's hand, holding the saucer, trembled slightly. His expression was a little unnatural, but he still said, \"She went to get her hair done.\"\n\n\"Oh.\" Zhou Ze was noncommittal.\n\nThen, Zhou Ze glanced again at the pressure cooker.\n\nThe feeling of revulsion and nausea in his chest seemed to be intensifying.\n\n\"Honey, you're making meat soup again,\" a woman's voice came from the entryway just then.\n\nZhou Ze turned his head and saw her. A feeling like a great weight had been lifted from his heart suddenly washed over him.\n\n*I was overthinking it.*\n\n\"Yeah, it's my only hobby,\" Wang Ke said with a chuckle.\n\nThe woman walked over to Zhou Ze's side and said with some resignation, \"It's incredible, isn't it? A master of psychology whose hobby is to find some free time to stew a pot of meat soup for himself. Even if he can't eat much of it, he still enjoys the sense of satisfaction.\"\n\n\"It's fine,\" Zhou Ze pursed his lips. \"Times were tough when we were young. Now that we're grown up, we can fulfill our dreams.\"\n\n\"Here, have a bowl.\"\n\nWang Ke ladled out a bowl of soup, sprinkled it with minced garlic and chopped scallions, added two drops of sesame oil, and a dash of white pepper.\n\nZhou Ze took the soup, hesitating whether to force himself to drink some, when he suddenly noticed something.\n\nThe woman standing beside him...\n\n...was walking on her tiptoes.\n\nOne step, two steps, three steps.\n\nShe walked over to the pressure cooker, helped Wang Ke ladle the soup, and at the same time admonished, \"Eat up. Don't let it go to waste.\"\n\n***\n\n¹A famous Chinese folk tale about tragic lovers, often compared to Romeo and Juliet.",

    "content": "This soup. Should he drink it?\n\nZhou Ze frowned slightly, then put the bowl down, looking at Wang Ke, and at Wang Ke's wife.\n\nWang Ke's wife pulled over a chair and sat down, then began rubbing her heel, complaining:\n\n\"Honey, my heel still hasn't healed.\"\n\n\"It's your own fault for being so careless. You're lucky no bones were broken.\"\n\nWang Ke carefully observed his wife's heel, smiled, and said:\n\n\"Why don't you go back to the room and rest? Don't run around outside so much for a while. It must be exhausting for you to be walking on your tiptoes all the time, and in high heels, no less.\"\n\n\"Alright, alright. I was just trying to make myself look nice for you to appreciate at home.\"\n\nThe woman rolled her eyes at her husband, then gave Zhou Ze a slight smile. \"You two chat. I'm heading up.\"\n\nAfter the woman left, Wang Ke pointed at the bowl Zhou Ze had just put down, reminding him:\n\n\"The soup is getting cold.\"\n\nZhou Ze, however, took out a cigarette and lit it, showing no regard for being in someone else's home as he started smoking on his own.\n\nAfter a moment, Zhou Ze finally asked:\n\n\"What is the meaning of this?\"\n\n\"On a whim.\" Wang Ke shook his head, then pointed to the pot of meat soup. \"Did you think earlier that what was cooking in this pot of soup was human flesh?\"\n\nZhou Ze didn't speak.\n\nWang Ke also took out a cigarette, lighting it from the flame of the gas stove.\n\n\"This is psychological suggestion. Everyone, in their daily lives, encounters this kind of psychological suggestion to a greater or lesser extent. For example, you've just left your house when you suddenly hear an auntie next to you telling her child to lock the door after someone leaves, or else the house will be burgled.\n\nYou'll subconsciously start to question whether you locked the door or not, then constantly replay it and fret over it, and finally run back to see with your own eyes if the door is actually locked.\n\nThat's a relatively common and simple example. A slightly more advanced one involves using repeated psychological suggestions in behavior and consciousness to continuously work from the periphery, thereby achieving a certain effect.\n\nFor instance, you came to believe that I was actually cooking a pot of human soup in my own kitchen, and you didn't dare to drink it.\"\n\nWang Ke shrugged.\n\n\"Is it absurd? Yes, it's very absurd, but you believed it. That's the most absurd part, and yet, it's the most normal thing in the world.\"\n\nZhou Ze opened his mouth to ask, \"Is this also part of the treatment?\"\n\nWang Ke shook his head. \"No. This isn't an illness. We psychologists rarely refer to psychological issues as 'illnesses.' This is your own mental block.\n\nIt's just like why you would think I'd cook human flesh. This psychological suggestion has actually been going on for a long time. For example, my wife, who always likes to go out to get her hair done but comes back with her hairstyle virtually unchanged.\n\nYou think I have a motive to kill her. What's the reason?\n\nI've been cuckolded. She found another man outside, putting a lovely green hat on my head.\"\n\n\"Lovely...\"\n\n\"Alright, we can ignore the adjective 'lovely' for now. But it's undeniable that this was the biggest suggestion that led you to mistakenly believe I was at home cooking my wife's flesh.\n\nBecause you thought I had known about it for a long time—and in fact, I did know about it for a long time. Then you naturally assumed I would be angry—and alright, I was indeed very angry.\n\nAfter that, you concluded that I had a motive to kill her and eat her flesh, because I would supposedly vent my anger in such a manner.\n\nOf course, there were some auxiliary suggestions in there as well. For example, my identity, and the fact that my greatest hobby is to cook a huge pot of meat soup at home that I could never finish by myself, for the sole reason of making up for the hardship of not having enough meat to eat back in the orphanage.\n\nThis kind of contrast makes it hard for you to accept, so your brain naturally begins to form your own line of reasoning, a line of reasoning that you feel makes sense.\n\nThis is what we often call the 'truth' as you see it. It's just like the many onlookers on the internet, where a very simple incident can often be hyped up and fermented by certain people with ulterior motives, all based on this same principle.\n\nEveryone has a Shakespeare living in their heart, and a Sherlock Holmes too.\"\n\nWang Ke picked up a piece of meat with his chopsticks, dipped it in the sauce dish, then put it in his mouth, chewing with his eyes closed.\n\n\"Are you really not going to have any? It's delicious. I remember back at the orphanage, you used to fight with me for meat.\"\n\n\"In the end, you always saved your chicken leg for me,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Haha, well, you were younger than me, and you called me 'big brother'.\" Wang Ke waved his hand dismissively. \"Actually, back then, I loved eating meat too, but I could never get enough.\n\nNow I have the means, I can eat meat to my heart's content, but every time I get all excited and throw myself into cooking a big pot, I get full after just a few bites.\n\nMy body isn't what it used to be. I'm not a young lad anymore. Plus, my living conditions have slowly improved since I started working.\n\nNow, I actually feel that the most delicious moments were back in the orphanage, watching you eat my share of the chicken leg.\"\n\nWang Ke picked up another piece of meat and put it in his mouth. After finishing it, he let out a sigh.\n\nZhou Ze blew out a smoke ring and said nothing, just silently leaning against the kitchen wall, watching the white steam billowing inside, watching the middle-aged man's world-weariness and sighs.\n\n\"Let's talk about your problem. Actually, the problem still lies with you. To be honest, wasn't it most comfortable back when you were a doctor?\n\nNo matter what problems you encountered at work, no matter the scheming, no matter the ostracism and suppression,\n\nwhen a patient was brought before you, saving a life and healing the sick was never wrong.\n\nIt aligned with the nature of your job, and it aligned with the moral ethics of human society.\n\nThe phrase 'a healer has the heart of a parent' allowed you to ignore the patient's identity, ignore the patient's personality, ignore what the patient had done in the past, whether they were a good person or a bad person, poor or rich.\n\nAs long as he was brought before you, the only thing you had to do, and must do, was to heal him.\n\nBut now, you've run into decision paralysis. In some choices, you need to consider many more factors, and you have to grasp the measure of it yourself. This makes you very uncomfortable, and it troubles you greatly.\n\nYou want to be stubbornly true to yourself, like a character from a martial arts novel, free and unfettered, but you can't help but be shackled by the struggles of your current life.\n\nActually, this is the normal state for most people. Ah Ze, in the past, you were actually a bit too self-centered. You and I, we both grew up in an orphanage. We both suffered childhood misfortunes and endured the pressure and low self-esteem from the lack of a family in our youth.\n\nIn fact, both of us, more or less, have some psychological issues. These are the seeds, and now they have blossomed and borne fruit in you.\n\nYou say your conscience is gone, but it's actually still there. You are instinctively rejecting it, instinctively disgusted by it, but you can't bring yourself to cut it away.\n\nSo your subconscious created this scenario. If your conscience was eaten by you, then you could perfectly ignore it.\"\n\n\"How can I solve it?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Unless a master psychologist who can completely dominate you on a conscious level appears, one who can shatter the shackles in your heart in one fell swoop and make you unable to resist their hypnosis.\n\nOtherwise, you can only rely on yourself to slowly wear it down. Either you wear it down, or it wears you down.\"\n\nWang Ke took another sip of soup. It must have been very delicious, as a look of satisfaction appeared on his face. \"Brother here isn't skilled enough. Or rather, I might have some methods for ordinary people's psychological problems, but you are not an ordinary person.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded. \"So, I can only let things take their course?\"\n\n\"You don't have to resist it. On the contrary, you can accept it. You could even treat it as a person, as another side of you.\" Wang Ke tried to offer his own solution. \"What I'm saying is a bit abstract. It's best if you can understand it, but it doesn't matter if you can't. Letting nature take its course is also fine.\"\n\nPutting down his bowl and chopsticks, Wang Ke walked with Zhou Ze into the living room. Wang Ke brewed a fresh pot of tea.\n\nThe local Tongcheng news was playing on the television. Coincidentally, a face that was somewhat familiar to Zhou Ze appeared on the screen. It was an honest-looking face, and the man was wailing and roaring.\n\nHowever, the news segment was mostly over; this was already the end.\n\nSeeing Zhou Ze watching the news, Wang Ke explained, \"This thing has been hyped up a lot lately. His son has leukemia, and he wanted to find the second daughter he had given away, and he finally found her after mobilizing the media.\n\nBut the second daughter and her adoptive parents refused to donate. He and his wife went to their home to block them, shouting curses at their daughter for being heartless at the entrance of her residential community. Then they even went to her high school to put up big-character posters, listing their second daughter's sins to force her to come out and donate.\"\n\n\"Oh.\"\n\nZhou Ze picked up his tea and took a sip.\n\n\"All sorts of strange things happen these days,\" Wang Ke remarked with a sigh.\n\nZhou Ze looked at Wang Ke and said, \"Actually, they happened in the past too. It's just that there wasn't such a developed information network back then.\"\n\n\"Are you implying something?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Don't look down on me, brother,\" Wang Ke suddenly said, his tone serious.\n\nZhou Ze shook his head.\n\n\"Everyone has their own difficulties. I don't want this either, brother, but I can see past it.\"\n\n\"I'm leaving. Thank you for your diagnosis today.\"\n\n\"Don't mention it. I've said it before, I won't seek you out anymore, but you can come find me anytime if you need anything.\"\n\nWith Wang Ke seeing him off, Zhou Ze walked out of his house. He looked back at the second-floor balcony, but the little loli wasn't there.\n\nThat's right.\n\nThe little loli couldn't possibly be there. She should have already taken the faceless woman and the other ghostly envoys to Rongcheng.\n\nHe hailed a taxi and got in. The driver turned his head. \"Buddy, where to?\"\n\n\"Take me to the most unclean place.\"\n\nZhou Ze felt he should take the initiative to go out and find something to do, to rack up some merit.\n\n\"Yo, are you a writer, brother? Out looking for inspiration?\"\n\n\"I guess so.\"\n\n\"You got it. I actually know just the place.\"\n\nThe driver patted his chest, guaranteeing he'd find a good spot for Zhou Ze. That place was really cursed lately; most people didn't dare to pass by there at night.\n\nAnd then,\n\nThe driver dropped Zhou Ze off at the entrance of the \"Midnight Bookstore.\"\n\nThat damn crow appeared again, \"caw caw caw\"-ing as it slowly flew past overhead. It seemed to have a knack for showing up at the most opportune moments.\n\nA light breeze blew fallen leaves, making them swirl at Zhou Ze's feet with a \"swish swish\" sound.\n\nZhou Ze glanced back at the taxi, which was already driving away,\n\nand suddenly felt that he should have a talk with Xu Qinglang about relocating.\n\n...\n\nPushing open the bedroom door, Wang Ke walked in. His wife was lying on the bed, playing on her phone. Seeing her husband come over, she struck a more graceful pose.\n\n\"He's gone?\"\n\n\"Yeah, he's gone.\" Wang Ke sat down on the edge of the bed with a smile, reaching out to stroke his wife's cheek.\n\n\"You've gotten thinner. Too thin. You're not as tasty anymore.\"\n\n\"You're impossible. You men are all the same. You want your wife to have a good figure to show off when you take her out, but you also want her to have some meat on her bones in bed to make you comfortable.\"\n\n\"I'm getting old. Meat that's too lean gets stuck in my teeth.\"\n\nAs he spoke,\n\nWang Ke stuck a finger into the gap between his teeth and picked out some strands of meat.\n\n\"Stop dieting.\"",

    "content": "Xu Qinglang's shop was currently closed. Not completely—the roller shutter was pulled halfway down, and Bai Yingying was sitting inside, playing a game.\n\nZhou Ze had heard that the game called \"Chicken Dinner\" was apparently full of cheaters, who were known as \"immortals.\" And because the cheating had become a rampant disaster, the game had earned the nickname \"The Battle to Slay Immortals.\"¹\n\nBut watching the already-addicted Bai Yingying, Zhou Ze suddenly felt great pity for the players of this game. Because they probably had no idea that their opponents in this game included not only the cheating \"immortals,\" but also a real zombie!\n\nXu Qinglang must have gone to look for a new shop location. Zhou Ze decided he would look for one too. If he didn't have enough money, he could borrow from Xu Qinglang for the time being. Besides, the girl who had given him her business card last time had also mentioned wanting to invest.\n\nAll in all, if he let go of his so-called lofty principles, money would be quite easy to raise.\n\nThis place was truly becoming unlivable. Perhaps in a little while, it wouldn't just be taxi drivers; maybe Zhou Ze would be sitting in his shop one day and see a tour bus pull up to the door.\n\nA tour guide would lead a crowd of tourists off the bus, waving a small flag and explaining through a megaphone:\n\n\"Esteemed tourists, esteemed tourists, we have now arrived at our next scenic spot.\n\nTongcheng has Wolf Mountain, known as one of the Ten Minor Buddhist Mountains, but Tongcheng also has the 'Midnight Bookstore,' hailed as one of the nation's top ten most haunted tourist destinations.\n\nThis place is very dangerous. People often die here for no reason, and many have seen the deceased reappear here. Please do not get too close; taking photos from the outside as a souvenir is sufficient.\n\nRemember, do not include yourselves in the photos. It's just like not taking a picture with the Terracotta Army at the Mausoleum of the First Qin Emperor. Those are funerary objects, things for the dead. Taking a photo with them is inauspicious!\"\n\nZhou Ze felt that this day was probably not far off. The group from the Horror Story Enthusiasts Association who came here to commit suicide last time had come because they'd heard the rumors about this place. Then, the suicide pact of two of their members had added another special layer to the atmosphere here.\n\nPushing open the bookstore door and walking inside, Zhou Ze saw the old Daoist sitting there, dozing off. The old Daoist hadn't streamed in a long time.\n\nJust as you can never be sure if the person you're gaming with is a trap² or a zombie, you can never be sure if the people watching a livestream are all among the living.\n\nIn fact, among the online viewer counts on major streaming platforms, the number of living people really did only make up a very small fraction.\n\nThe old Daoist had laid low for a long time. Now, he was just a guardian watching over the woman named Tang Shi. He wasn't by her side every single second, but he was already being very responsible.\n\n\"Boss, you're back.\"\n\nThe sound of Zhou Ze's footsteps startled the old Daoist awake. He wiped the drool from the corner of his mouth.\n\nZhou Ze nodded and went directly up to the second floor.\n\nTang Shi was still in her mummy-like state, but her recovery was going very well. When Zhou Ze came up, her eyes were open, as if she were looking at the ceiling. At the same time, there was water and White Rabbit creamy candy placed beside her.\n\nShe didn't need anyone to serve her food or drink; she could manage it herself with a kind of telekinetic ability.\n\nWhen Zhou Ze approached, a White Rabbit candy unwrapped itself and flew to his lips. Zhou Ze opened his mouth and took the candy.\n\nThen, Zhou Ze sat down next to Tang Shi.\n\nThe two of them, neither speaking, with nothing much to say, just sat in silence for half an hour. Zhou Ze stood up, preparing to go downstairs.\n\nTang Shi spoke. \"Did you go see a psychiatrist?\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded.\n\n\"Useless, wasn't it?\"\n\n\"It was somewhat useful,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\nHowever, he was still unwilling to go eat the meat soup at Wang Ke's place.\n\n\"Mm.\" Tang Shi closed her eyes as if tired, but she persisted in speaking. \"Help me call that zombie up here.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded, ready to head down.\n\n\"Are you trying to fool me again?\" Tang Shi asked.\n\n\"You found me out.\" Zhou Ze felt no embarrassment. \"I'm used to my pillow and don't much like lending it to others.\"\n\n\"But not being able to rest has a huge impact on my recovery.\"\n\n\"And what does that have to do with me? I've done what I was supposed to do. If you want more from me, you'll have to offer more of equal value in exchange.\"\n\n\"I can tell you the location of Tongcheng's other Hell's Emissary,\" Tang Shi said, looking at Zhou Ze. \"When the old Daoist was helping me escape, I originally planned to hide with him, but unfortunately, he seemed to have some problems of his own. In the end, I chose to come to your side.\"\n\n\"That doesn't seem to have much value to me,\" Zhou Ze shrugged.\n\n\"Based on common logic, Tongcheng is just a small city. One Hell's Emissary is about right; it's impossible for there to be two. Therefore, the other one must have been replaced. You could go check his place out, maybe claim some of his inheritance.\"\n\nZhou Ze remained unmoved. \"I'm still not interested.\"\n\nIf it could be claimed, wouldn't the little loli have done it herself?\n\nZhou Ze certainly didn't believe the little loli was the sentimental type, especially since the matter of the taxi driver she scared into a fatal car crash was still unresolved.\n\n\"Then I have nothing else to give you.\"\n\n\"Then let's leave it at that for now.\"\n\nZhou Ze went downstairs. He didn't call for Bai Yingying. Just as he'd said, he didn't feel comfortable giving away the pillow he was used to sleeping on for someone else to use.\n\n\"Boss, what's for dinner?\" The old Daoist pointed next door. \"The boss next door doesn't seem to be back yet.\"\n\n\"You figure it out. Can you cook?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then go to his kitchen and find your own ingredients to cook with.\"\n\nWith that, Zhou Ze sat down behind the counter.\n\nThe old Daoist scurried next door to cook, and the bookstore fell quiet.\n\nHowever, it wasn't long before a figure appeared at the bookstore entrance. It was a girl, wearing a black coat and a scarf, wrapped up tightly.\n\nAlthough it had gotten a bit cooler in Tongcheng recently, it wasn't so cold as to warrant dressing like that.\n\nThe girl looked at Zhou Ze through the glass door. Zhou Ze ignored her.\n\nFinally, the girl pushed open the door and walked in. She came before Zhou Ze, stood still, removed her scarf, and pleaded:\n\n\"Help me.\"\n\nZhou Ze picked up his teacup, took a sip of water, and still ignored her.\n\n\"Please, help me.\" The girl knelt down in front of Zhou Ze, placing her hands on his thighs. \"As long as you're willing to help me, I'll do anything you ask.\"\n\nAs she spoke, the girl's nimble, fair hands even attempted to seductively tease the man before her.\n\nZhou Ze reached out, grabbed the girl's wrist, and pushed her back with a bit of force. The girl sat on the floor, somewhat stunned.\n\nPutting down his book, Zhou Ze said with some surprise, \"I thought you'd be in jail.\"\n\nYes, Zhou Ze had originally thought this girl would face some consequences after the matter of her framing her teacher was exposed, but now it seemed that wasn't the case.\n\nAfter a moment's thought, Zhou Ze understood. The girl was a minor, and the teacher had committed suicide. Even if she were charged with false accusation, in the end, the system would sweep it under the rug on account of her being a minor.\n\n\"Have you seen the news? My biological parents found me. It's so they can make me save my so-called little brother.\"\n\nAs the girl said this, a vicious glint flashed in her eyes.\n\nShe was no saint to begin with. Even after her middle school teacher committed suicide because of her false accusation, she continued to live happily.\n\nTherefore, the sudden appearance of so-called biological parents—if they were rich, it would be one thing; if they had a mansion, a villa, a huge inheritance for her, that would be fine—but it turned out they were just an ordinary family, which wasn't very interesting.\n\nWhat's more, her biological parents' purpose in finding her was to get her to donate to save her little brother.\n\nWhat a joke!\n\nAre they out of their minds?\n\n\"You're good friends with Lin Yi. You should know, I'm just a live-in son-in-law, no money, no power, just looking after this money-losing bookstore. I'm afraid I can't help.\"\n\n\"I want to ask you to pay a visit to my biological parents' home, just like you did at my house last time.\"\n\nThe girl bit her lip. As she said these words, the scene from that night seemed to flash through her mind again. She had been terrified, so truly terrified that it took her days to recover.\n\n\"Oh, just that?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Yes, that'll be enough. Make them stop bothering me, stop pestering me,\" the girl said with certainty.\n\n\"To be honest, when I saw the news earlier, I thought that second daughter was so pitiful, truly pitiful. Those biological parents are really despicable.\"\n\n\"Yes, they're wolves, they're beasts, they're bastards!\" the girl seethed through gritted teeth.\n\nZhou Ze lowered his head and looked at the girl still sitting on the floor. \"But when I found out that pitiful girl was actually you, I suddenly felt a great sense of satisfaction.\"\n\n\"...\" said the girl.\n\nBut the girl, after all, had seen her share of storms. She could endure the unbearable and bizarre fetishes of old men in bed; that alone was a testament to her resilience.\n\nIn fact, she was like a flower blooming amidst the weeds outside the window, constantly experiencing the wind and rain and the dew repeatedly moistening its pistil.\n\nShe was indeed far tougher than a pistil in a greenhouse.\n\n\"I can make you feel even more satisfied.\"\n\nThe girl looked at Zhou Ze. \"As long as you help me, just like you did at my house last time.\"\n\n\"Do you think Lin Yi is pretty?\" Zhou Ze suddenly asked.\n\n\"Well... she's very pretty.\"\n\n\"How does she compare to you?\"\n\n\"She's a bit prettier than me,\" the girl answered.\n\n\"Then I can tell you, her older sister is even prettier and more elegant than her, and she gets to wear a white lab coat uniform. And, she's a... a gentle woman. So, please tell me, on what grounds would I take an interest in you?\"\n\nZhou Ze had been about to say Dr. Lin was a virgin, but he suddenly felt that sounded a bit off, so he changed his wording.\n\n\"Help me, or I'll die in your bookstore!\"\n\nA small knife suddenly appeared in the girl's hand, pointed at her own neck.\n\n\"Heh, be my guest. I couldn't ask for more. I'm in need of the busine—\"\n\n*Pfft!*\n\nThe knife plunged directly into the girl's neck.\n\nIt was so abrupt.\n\nSo decisive.\n\nEven too abrupt, and too decisive!\n\nBlood splattered onto Zhou Ze's face, leaving him stunned for a moment.\n\nThe girl's eyes were wide with disbelief, and then her body slowly fell backward.\n\nZhou Ze shot to his feet and roared at the floor above:\n\n\"What the fuck are you doing!\"\n\n---\n¹ **The Battle to Slay Immortals (诛仙之战):** A pun on `诸仙之战` (Battle of All Immortals). The character for \"slay\" (`诛`, zhū) and \"all/various\" (`诸`, zhū) are homophones.\n\n² **Trap (大吊萌妹):** The original text uses a crude internet slang term that literally translates to \"cute girl with a big dick,\" referring to a male gamer playing a cute female character, or a \"trap\" in English internet slang.",

    "content": "\"What the fuck... are you doing!\"\n\nZhou Ze was asking Tang Shi.\n\nIt was obvious.\n\nBefore, when the girl had said, \"Ah, if you don't help me, I'll kill myself for you to see!\" she was really just saying it. It was like when a head teacher always tells their students, \"You're the worst class I've ever taught!\"\n\nIn reality, they say that to every class; you really can't take it seriously.\n\nZhou Ze had never expected her to actually commit suicide. Besides, a woman like her would never kill herself. She cherished herself far too much; how could she possibly commit suicide?\n\nBut just like that, so abruptly—without even a second threat, before she even had time to feign tears—she plunged the small knife into her own neck.\n\nHer shocked expression, in particular, made it even clearer that she herself, the person involved, was in a state of utter confusion.\n\n*Who am I?*\n\n*Where am I?*\n\n*Heavens, I actually committed suicide!*\n\nThere was only one possible explanation left. Someone had controlled her knife, making her \"commit suicide,\" and the person capable of doing this was right upstairs.\n\nPerhaps that murderer was even chewing on a piece of White Rabbit creamy candy at this very moment.\n\n\"What's wrong! What's wrong!\"\n\nHearing Zhou Ze's shout, the old Taoist, who had been cooking next door, immediately ran back. Seeing the girl collapsed on the floor, he jumped in fright.\n\n\"My god, what's wrong with you, little missy!\"\n\nThe old Taoist immediately went over, preparing to save her.\n\nZhou Ze, however, went straight upstairs. He saw Tang Shi, still lying on the straw mat.\n\n\"What is the meaning of this?\"\n\n\"Calm down.\" Tang Shi smiled. Her body was still immobile; all she could do now was talk and smile. \"Now, can you let your maid come up and sleep with me?\"\n\n\"Are you trying to get me killed!\" Zhou Ze demanded.\n\nTang Shi was slightly surprised. \"Shouldn't you be thanking me?\"\n\n\"I'll thank you, my ass!\" Zhou Ze kicked over the teacup in front of him. The water spilled all over the floor, and the cup flew against the wall, shattering.\n\n\"I don't believe you didn't see it. Otherwise, how could you not have tried to save her? You're a doctor; saving people should be your instinct!\n\n\"You didn't perform first aid, but instead came up to question me. Are you trying to play dumb and renege on our deal?\" Tang Shi said in a low voice.\n\n\"It's precisely because I fucking saw through it that I couldn't get involved with her! Do you have any idea who gave me the mark on my hand? Do you have any idea whose side that Faceless Woman is on right now!\n\n\"Do you know who led the other Underworld Emissaries to release her and specifically go to Rongcheng to cause trouble for your person?\n\n\"You think you're so capable, don't you? You think you're so smart, don't you?\n\n\"You think you're the only one sober in a world of drunks, don't you!\n\n\"The moment you made a move, didn't you directly tell her you were here with me?\"\n\nTang Shi fell silent. She suddenly felt a sense of shame, and a bit of embarrassment.\n\nLooked at this way, Zhou Ze had actually seen through it long ago. He had been deliberately playing along, and she, in her self-proclaimed cleverness, had meddled, pushing the situation into an unpredictable abyss.\n\n\"Aiyah, Lordy, don't wrap around me, don't wrap around me! I can't breathe!!!\"\n\nThe old Taoist's shouts came from downstairs.\n\nZhou Ze gave Tang Shi, still lying there motionless, a deep look and shook his head.\n\n\"Stupid woman.\"\n\nThen, Zhou Ze descended the stairs. In the bookstore, he saw the old Taoist enveloped in coil after coil of hair, like a big black rice dumpling. The girl who had collapsed was gone without a trace.\n\nZhou Ze's fingernails grew long. He walked over and swiped directly at the hair.\n\n*Swish! Swish!*\n\nThe hair broke at the sound and floated away.\n\nBut the remaining hair on the floor twisted together to form a face, like one from an ink wash painting—very beautiful, very classical. But if you looked closely, you could see that this face had no clearly defined features.\n\n\"Object manipulation. Is this a new ability of yours?\"\n\nA woman's voice echoed from all around the bookstore, hollow and empty, like a chant from hell.\n\n\"Or perhaps, have I made a new discovery? A discovery that is... utterly unexpected?\"\n\nThe Faceless Woman seemed to be talking to herself, but in reality, she was posturing—the kind of posturing one does after catching their enemy with their hand in the cookie jar.\n\nIn truth, Zhou Ze had never been able to figure out why the Faceless Woman hated him so much. Was it merely because he had scratched her with his fingernails in the pools of hell?\n\nOr perhaps, she had other intentions for him, like the hysterical, unwilling roar she let out when he was leaving hell.\n\nBut any normal person would be furious at this kind of behavior, where someone just takes a cheap shot at you out of nowhere.\n\nThis time, Zhou Ze had actually seen through it, because everything, absolutely everything, had gone too smoothly, too naturally.\n\nThe clues all led to this girl in a neat line. She had appeared before him in the most appropriate way with the most appropriate reason, seamlessly connecting with his previous life and trajectory.\n\nThere was nothing abrupt about it, which in itself was the most abrupt thing. She was too much of a perfectionist, too deliberate. With the lesson learned from her previous impersonation of Doctor Lin, it would be difficult to trick Zhou Ze so senselessly again.\n\nOf course, the most important thing was that Zhou Ze didn't believe that girl, after seeing him in his state last time, would dare to appear before him again, dare to strike coquettish poses at him, dare to ask him for help.\n\nLast time, she had actually tried to seduce him but was coldly rejected. Did she think she was Yang Guifei,¹ trying her luck again?\n\nActually, thinking about it calmly, the Faceless Woman had revealed many flaws last time when she pretended to be Doctor Lin. But at that time, Zhou Ze had just learned that Xu Le had hired someone to kill him and was in a state of mental turmoil, which was why she had been able to seize the opportunity.\n\nAll in all, the Faceless Woman was an anomaly formed from the coalesced resentment of countless deceased souls on the Road to the Underworld. She was not human.\n\n*How complex can the schemes of a beast be? They are merely laughable.*²\n\n\"You're finished. I'll let her know what you're doing. Don't forget, your current status was given to you by her.\"\n\nThe Faceless Woman's voice was filled with obvious schadenfreude, like a kindergartener who had found dirt on a classmate and was running to tell the teacher.\n\nJust then, Zhou Ze suddenly noticed the water droplets on the floor floating up and sticking to the glass door frame.\n\n\"This is just her puppet. Keep it here, and what happened won't be known.\"\n\nThis was Tang Shi's reminder. Perhaps it was also her way of paying for her impulsive, self-righteous action just now. In an instant, the surrounding water droplets began to surge, shooting directly at the hair on the floor.\n\nThe Faceless Woman also saw the words. She let out a piercing shriek. The hair gathered together, and a sinister wind swept through, rushing straight for the door.\n\nHowever, the water mist condensed by Tang Shi now acted like a membrane, slowing down the movement of the mass of hair.\n\nAt that moment, Bai Yingying also sensed something was wrong. She ran over from next door and, seeing the scene in the bookstore, her mouth fell slightly agape, not quite understanding what was happening.\n\n\"Trying to stop me?\" the Faceless Woman let out a disdainful cry. \"Let's see how you stop me!\"\n\n*Buzz!*\n\nThe previously gathered hair exploded. In an instant, the bookstore seemed to have turned into a barbershop, with countless strands of hair darting in every direction.\n\nSome tried to reach the air vent, some tried for the second floor, while others tried to enter the sewer through the bathroom.\n\nIf just one strand of hair got out, the news of what was happening here would be transmitted to her main body, and Zhou Ze's crime of hiding a \"wanted fugitive\" would be exposed.\n\nZhou Ze's fingernails danced through the air. Each strand of hair he caught immediately turned to ash and dissipated.\n\nThe old Taoist once again fumbled in his pants and pulled out two paper talismans. He slapped them wildly in the air. Any hair that touched the talismans stuck to them, like a fly trap. It was very effective.\n\nA workbook suddenly burst apart, its pages flying out like scythes, slicing through the air. Strand after strand of hair was cut, withering the moment it hit the ground.\n\nLying on the second floor, Tang Shi coughed, and blood trickled from the corner of her mouth. She was already injured, but she knew that at this moment, she absolutely could not hold back.\n\nBai Yingying was quick-witted and nimble. Her hands shot out repeatedly, pinching a strand of hair each time, grabbing it and immediately snapping it in two.\n\nThe once quiet bookstore, which almost never had customers, was now the scene of a massive, bustling cleanup, as if a leader was about to come for an inspection.\n\nFinally, everything seemed to have settled. The Faceless Woman let out a final, unwilling roar, and not another strand of hair could be seen.\n\nZhou Ze sat down on a plastic stool. The bloodstains on his face had long since disappeared because none of it, apart from the hair, had been real.\n\n\"Boss, we're done. I'm dead tired,\" the old Taoist said, collapsing onto the floor and panting heavily.\n\nBai Yingying poured Zhou Ze a cup of tea. She didn't seem tired. \"Boss, was it that same one from last time?\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded, took the tea, and drank a sip.\n\n\"She's really taken a liking to you, huh? So persistent,\" Bai Yingying said, sticking out her tongue.\n\nZhou Ze didn't say anything, but his heart felt heavy. The Faceless Woman wasn't a huge problem, but she was the kind that left you unable to eat or sleep in peace. No one wanted to be targeted by an adversary like that.\n\nAccording to her, her main body had followed the little girl to Rongcheng, leaving a few strands of hair as a puppet to deal with him.\n\nEven if it failed, it would still serve to disgust him!\n\nAn enemy with such lowbrow tastes was truly maddening.\n\nRight now, Zhou Ze's only thought was that the person in Rongcheng would hopefully take care of the little girl along with the Faceless Woman, and while she was at it, flush all his troubles down the toilet.\n\nAlthough the odds of that were slim, a man had to have a dream.\n\nIn a tiny spot no one had noticed, a single strand of hair secretly moved out from between the pages of a magazine, then fell to the floor, and finally drifted toward the crack under the door.\n\n*Creak!*\n\nThe glass door was pushed open.\n\nThe strand of hair happened to be stepped on by a leather shoe.\n\nXu Qinglang bent down, picked up the strand of hair, and snapped it in two.\n\nFrom the void, it seemed as if a woman's final roar of falling short at the last moment could be heard!\n\nXu Qinglang paused for a moment, as if she had heard someone cursing her.\n\nBut she immediately pointed an angry finger at Zhou Ze, who was sitting inside, and yelled:\n\n\"Well, well! I'm out there running around in this cold weather looking for a new shop location, and look at you! Look at this hair!\n\n\"Did another beautiful female reader come into the shop to chat with you?\"\n\nThe implication being:\n\n*I'm out here running myself ragged for our future,*\n\n*and you're hiding in the shop with the AC on, flirting with some long-haired girl!*\n\n*How could you do this to me!*\n\n***\n\n¹Yang Guifei was one of the Four Beauties of ancient China, a concubine of Emperor Xuanzong of Tang, renowned for her legendary beauty.\n\n²A quote from classical Chinese literature, expressing contempt for an opponent's simplistic or futile schemes.",

    "content": "\"Are you asleep?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Didn't you ask me to come and sleep with you?\"\n\n\"I can't sleep.\"\n\n\"Oh.\"\n\n\"How long have you been alive?\"\n\n\"Two hundred years, but I've spent most of that time lying in a coffin. Actually, if you do the math, the time I've properly lived out in the world is less than twenty years.\"\n\n\"What do you think of your boss?\"\n\n\"Not much. Very petty and small-minded.\"\n\n\"I think so too.\"\n\n\"Did he scold you today?\"\n\n\"It was my fault.\"\n\n\"Oh.\"\n\n\"Actually, I've always been curious. That person you're always talking about... what was he like?\"\n\n\"What was he like?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Let me put it this way. If he and your boss had switched places in yesterday's situation, he wouldn't have waited for me to make a move. He would have killed that puppet himself, and he wouldn't have been afraid of exposing anything, let alone coming up to ask me if I was meddling.\"\n\n\"Oh, so that's how it is.\" Bai Yingying pondered for a moment, then said, \"A person like that... probably doesn't live long, right?\"\n\nTang Shi fell silent.\n\n\"Actually, the boss has a lot of flaws. Sometimes he's not 'man' enough, he's indecisive and worries about the consequences, and even after he acts, he keeps dwelling on it. But all in all, he's actually okay. Everyone has their own way of life, and naturally, everyone has their own personality.\n\nHe likes to be cautious, like a squirrel that enjoys hoarding things in its home, savoring that feeling of accumulation and protecting it. That's because he came from an orphanage. In the beginning, he had nothing at all.\"\n\n\"You can understand him?\"\n\n\"I wouldn't say I understand him, but honestly, I really don't want to become like you are now. I like to play on my phone every day, play games, watch movies, and enjoy my current life, making up for the two hundred years I lost lying in a coffin. In this regard, the boss is willing to indulge me and satisfy me.\"\n\n\"A life with no ambition, no excitement... is that interesting?\"\n\n\"Not everyone yearns for excitement and passion. Everyone should be allowed to have their own lifestyle, as long as they themselves are happy with it.\n\nTo be honest, sometimes I can see the boss holding himself back, and I worry that he won't be able to hold back anymore and will become the same kind of person as you and the man you speak of.\"\n\n\"Afraid?\"\n\n\"Yes, I'm afraid.\"\n\n\"You've already died once. What is there to be afraid of? What is there left to fear? He's not to my taste. He seems peaceful, gentle, and refined, but deep down, his bones are filled with the selfish ideology of a petty man. He only thinks of himself. To put it bluntly, he's selfish.\"\n\n\"The boss is not that bad.\"\n\n\"You disagree?\"\n\n\"I do. I know that when my mistress achieved her merits and descended to hell, she must have told the boss to get rid of me, but he never did.\n\nAnd I also know that because I'm in the shop, far fewer ghosts come to visit, but the boss hasn't driven me away.\"\n\n\"That's because he uses you as a pillow. He wants to sleep soundly at night.\"\n\n\"A person who is willing to sacrifice business for the quality of his sleep... isn't that a good thing?\"\n\nHearing this,\n\nTang Shi was stunned for a moment.\n\nFor some reason,\n\nThe image of that person who liked to carry a chair out to sit and sunbathe in front of the Underworld Shop surfaced in her mind.\n\nThe sunlight sprinkled over him,\n\nmaking him look just like an old grandfather.\n\n...\n\nWhatever the issue with the Faceless Woman was, it had been resolved for now, at least temporarily. All that was left was to wait for the final result from Rongcheng.\n\nOf course, that matter could wait, but moving house could not. Xu Qinglang had found a new location, right near South Avenue in the center of Tongcheng, a place the old-timers of Tongcheng considered the commercial heart of the city, with very high foot traffic.\n\nYesterday, Zhou Ze had received an invitation to attend Miss Liu's memorial service. He wasn't sure why he had been invited and hadn't planned on going, but after Xu Qinglang saw the name on the invitation, he strongly insisted that Zhou Ze must go, because the shop he had his eye on was part of Miss Liu's family property.\n\nDiscussing business with the family at their funeral seemed a bit wrong, but following the principle of \"save a penny where you can,\" Zhou Ze agreed.\n\nHe took a car to the address on the invitation and discovered he wasn't going to a funeral parlor but to a more rural location, a villa built amidst fields.\n\nIt was the season when the rapeseed flowers were in full bloom. The villa, nestled amidst a sea of flowers, gave off a very cool and desolate feeling.\n\nNot many people had come; only four or five cars were parked at the entrance.\n\nWhen Zhou Ze got out of the car and walked in, he saw Cui Yilang and several other members of the Horror Story Enthusiasts Association standing in the courtyard, chatting in low voices.\n\nNo one greeted Zhou Ze, nor did anyone come to collect condolence money. A few scattered groups of people stood around as if they were on a spring outing.\n\nFrom the outside, the house looked no different from the three-story private residences built by villagers around Tongcheng, but upon entering, one discovered the interior was decorated in a style that imitated Western Europe.\n\nFrom the beams above to the coffee table and teacups below, it made one feel as if they had walked onto the set of a British drama.\n\nMusic began to play, not the usual \"Funeral Dirge,\" but Chopin's \"Waltz of Farewell.\" Although it spoke of parting, the melody was much more lighthearted than a domestic dirge.\n\nA few women wearing black veils came down from upstairs. This was the host family.\n\nA man dressed like a priest, holding a Bible, walked to the center.\n\nEveryone gathered around to share in the sorrow.\n\nZhou Ze poured himself a cup of coffee from the self-service counter on the side and sipped it slowly.\n\nDomestic funeral customs had undergone several reforms in modern times, one could even say they had been subverted several times, and most regions had long since banned burials.\n\nFunerals in the countryside were usually held by setting up a marquee in one's own courtyard. In the city, some people held them in their residential communities or simply rented a venue at a funeral home.\n\nThis was the first time Zhou Ze had encountered a funeral of this Western style.\n\nZhou Ze remembered hearing someone say that in some Western countries, there are many family-run \"funeral workshops,\" where the ground floor of their house serves both for normal living and as a rental space for memorial services, while also providing services like body collection and cosmetic restoration.\n\nLooking at this place now, it seemed to be following that style, but in China, most people still couldn't accept it.\n\nThen came the viewing of the remains. Everyone lined up and went past one by one. If you had a close relationship, you could lean on the coffin lid and say a few words. If your relationship was more distant, you could walk past, sigh, and put on a show.\n\nWhen it was Zhou Ze's turn, he glanced into the coffin and saw Miss Liu lying inside, impeccably dressed in a black formal dress, looking as if she were truly just asleep.\n\nWhat surprised Zhou Ze was that Miss Liu had fallen from the building right in front of him. No matter how you might embellish it with words, you couldn't hide the fact that her death had been extremely gruesome. Yet, her remains appeared very exquisite, the restoration incredibly well done.\n\nThis couldn't help but make Zhou Ze think of his own death, and the mortuary makeup artist who had been so impatient while forcefully applying makeup to his face with an eyebrow pencil. He certainly hadn't received this kind of treatment.\n\nThe dead can't leave a bad review. It's truly unfair.\n\nAfter the viewing was over, everyone went to the side hall for a meal. It was a buffet, but there wasn't much to eat—just some pastries, sausages, and the like, merely serving as an afternoon tea to tide one over. It wasn't as if you could gorge yourself and drink heavily here.\n\nZhou Ze poured himself a glass of wine, drank some, and then walked out of the side hall. He planned to find Miss Liu's family to talk about renting the shop.\n\nXu Qinglang had said he would rent it for a year first, and then Zhou Ze could pay him the rent monthly. This was a favor, considering Zhou Ze couldn't produce so much money at once. Zhou Ze had to return the kindness, so if he could help negotiate the price, he would.\n\nBut after searching for a while, Zhou Ze couldn't find the family members in black veils who had appeared earlier. Instead, he saw the priest standing at the top of the stairs, smoking a cigarette.\n\nWhen Zhou Ze walked over, the priest offered him a cigarette as well.\n\nThe two men stood together, smoking.\n\nThe priest was not a foreigner, but Chinese, probably around thirty years old, with a somewhat boyish face.\n\nThey didn't exchange many words. After finishing the cigarette, the priest walked away. Zhou Ze stubbed out his cigarette butt and happened to notice that below the main staircase, there seemed to be another set of stairs leading down.\n\nIt was probably a basement.\n\nOrdinary Chinese families don't usually have basements. Out of curiosity about the place, Zhou Ze walked down and saw an elevator inside. Next to the elevator was a metal door.\n\nThe door was open. He pushed it and walked in, immediately feeling the temperature drop significantly.\n\nIn front of Zhou Ze were two steel tables and a cold storage unit, similar to a hospital morgue, but with some additional equipment.\n\nIt gave one the feeling of being in a slaughterhouse.\n\nWalking over to one of the steel tables, Zhou Ze reached out and touched its surface. This was where the dead lay. Miss Liu must have lain here before, receiving her final beauty treatment.\n\nThis was a beauty salon for the deceased.\n\n\"Sir, this area is not open to the public.\"\n\nA young man in a gray suit stood at the doorway and spoke.\n\nZhou Ze nodded apologetically. He had been intrusive.\n\n\"Have we met somewhere before?\" Zhou Ze asked, as he found the man somewhat familiar.\n\n\"Perhaps. Here is my business card. Of course, we hope you never have the occasion to use the number on it.\"\n\nThe young man handed Zhou Ze a business card.\n\nThe name on the card was \"Chen Zesheng,\" with a note identifying him as the Director of the Tongcheng Western-Style Funeral Home.\n\n\"Is business good?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nFor a long time, it was always others asking Zhou Ze \"is business good?\" Now, Zhou Ze finally had the chance to ask someone else.\n\nOf course, Zhou Ze was well aware that when others asked him \"is business good,\" what they were really thinking was:\n\n*That idiot opened a crappy bookstore in this godforsaken place; it'd be a miracle if business was any good!*\n\n\"It's a bit slow. After all, not many people in China accept this kind of funeral custom,\" Chen Zesheng said with a wry smile.\n\n\"I see.\"\n\nZhou Ze had asked his question and felt satisfied.\n\n\"By the way, the family of the deceased is on the second floor,\" Chen Zesheng reminded him.\n\n\"Alright, thank you.\"\n\nZhou Ze left the basement.\n\nHowever, just as Zhou Ze started up the stairs, the hand holding the business card suddenly trembled. He looked down again at the name on the card:\n\nChen Zesheng.\n\nIt seemed that...\n\nthe man who committed suicide with Miss Liu the next day...\n\nhis surname was also Chen?\n\n...\n\nHe closed the metal door.\n\nThe young man in the suit and leather shoes lay down on the steel table.\n\nHe reached up and gently rubbed his right cheek. The skin had already become wrinkled and cracked, and a green shaping fluid was seeping out from within.\n\nHe shook his head,\n\nand sighed:\n\n\"The moment I die, those two mortuary makeup artists in my family start slacking off.\n\nAt this rate, what's going to happen to the business?\"",

    "content": "Going up to the second floor, Zhou Ze saw Miss Liu’s family. Strangely, he didn’t see any men, only three women.\n\nOne had salt-and-pepper hair and was in her twilight years; one was poised and graceful, in her middle age; the other was about the same age as Miss Liu.\n\nAs Zhou Ze walked in, he noticed the priest was there as well, speaking with the elderly woman as if trying to console her.\n\nThe old woman just listened, and the priest just spoke. It was as if everyone was merely going through the motions, fulfilling their respective duties. To say there was any real atmosphere of grief in the room would be a lie.\n\nOf course, one couldn't blame the living for their indifference toward the dead, because the problem the living had to face was how to keep on living.\n\n\"Hello, are you Ms. Liu Yanhuo?\"\n\nZhou Ze walked up to the middle-aged woman and asked.\n\n\"Hello, I am.\"\n\nMs. Liu took out a handkerchief and dabbed the corner of her eye.\n\nZhou Ze thought it looked more like she was wiping away eye gunk than tears, as he really couldn't tell if she had actually been crying.\n\nThe woman's collarbones were well-defined, and her figure was somewhat gaunt. Her brow bone protruded, giving her a rather unsettling appearance.\n\nIn truth, hers were the features of a husband-curser.\n\nCulture is a vessel, a fundamental unit. In every era, politics, economics, and even such disreputable trades as feng shui and physiognomy are all influenced by culture.\n\nFor instance, the ancient saying about a \"husband-curser\" was a classic example of treating women as appendages of a patriarchal society—a very unfair and erroneous judgment.\n\nZhou Ze hadn't believed in such things, even as a ghost.\n\nBut when he thought about it…\n\nThree generations of one family,\n\nwithout a single male in sight…\n\n…it was actually a little difficult *not* to believe it.\n\nZhou Ze explained his reason for being there. Xu Qinglang had already spoken with her and reached a preliminary agreement, but they hadn't gotten to the specific price yet.\n\n\"Mr. Zhou, for coming to my daughter's funeral, I thank you on her behalf. As for that shop, since you've taken a liking to it, please go back and think of a number for the rent. As long as it's not too outrageous, I won't refuse.\"\n\nSo easy to deal with?\n\nZhou Ze was taken aback for a moment. He had been a doctor in his past life and had never done business, so this was his first time negotiating a price, and he was still a bit green. But this Ms. Liu seemed very magnanimous.\n\nZhou Ze nodded, offered a few more pointless words of consolation, and then tactfully took his leave. All that was left was to discuss a price with Xu Qinglang and send it over, and the matter would be more or less settled.\n\nHe went down the stairs and came to the corner again. Zhou Ze walked up to the metal door once more, reached out to push it, and found it locked.\n\nZhou Ze reached out and knocked.\n\nNo one answered from inside.\n\nIt was very frustrating.\n\nAnd very awkward.\n\nAs a Ghost Emissary,\n\nto be stopped by a mere door, a single wall—it seemed a bit of a disgrace.\n\nUnfortunately, Zhou Ze couldn't be like that little loli.\n\n*Biu*\n\nShe's out.\n\n*Biu*\n\nShe's back in again.\n\nThis door, Zhou Ze really couldn't open it.\n\nHe returned to the main hall. The mourners had mostly left, and the hall was being cleaned up. The coffin had been carried away; as for Miss Liu, she would likely be sent to the crematorium soon.\n\nWhen a person dies, it's like a lamp being extinguished, ending up as nothing but an earthen mound.¹\n\nFunerals always seemed to evoke such somber feelings.\n\nZhou Ze stopped a cleaning lady and asked, \"Excuse me, do you know Chen Zesheng?\"\n\n\"Ah, he was the previous owner here,\" the woman answered, somewhat surprised. \"He's already dead. The funeral was yesterday.\"\n\n\"Oh.\" Zhou Ze nodded, then asked, \"May I ask who the current owner is?\"\n\n\"It's the previous owner's younger brother. He just went down to the basement,\" the woman replied. Then, worried Zhou Ze wouldn't understand, she explained, \"See, over there by the staircase. It's the place where they prepare the bodies of the deceased.\"\n\n\"Thank you.\"\n\n\"You're welcome.\"\n\nZhou Ze walked back to the metal door.\n\nHe had to get in.\n\nHe had to go in and capture that idiot who, for some unknown reason, was still hopping around after death, handing out his business card to a Ghost Emissary.\n\nBut this door…\n\nHow on earth was he supposed to open it?\n\nHe knocked forcefully a few times.\n\nThe door remained still, and no one answered from inside.\n\nThe cleaning lady had just said the current owner went in. Something was clearly not right. Of course, Zhou Ze wasn't concerned about whether the current owner might have met with some accident inside; he wasn't that benevolent.\n\nJust as Zhou Ze was about to look for a tool to try and pry the door open…\n\n…he saw the door being opened.\n\nA young man stood inside, dressed in a black suit with a white flower pinned to his chest.\n\n\"Can I help you?\" the young man asked.\n\nThis wasn't the guy who had just stuffed a business card into his hand. If he wasn't mistaken, this must be the current owner, Chen Zesheng's younger brother.\n\n\"There's something I'd like to talk to you about, concerning your brother,\" Zhou Ze said. He had already decided that if this guy was impossible to talk to, he would just knock him out first and then go in to find Chen Zesheng.\n\n\"Oh, alright. Please, come in.\"\n\nThe man seemed quite agreeable, gesturing for Zhou Ze to enter.\n\nZhou Ze gave the man a long, hard look before walking in.\n\nThe two steel slabs were still in their places, and the refrigerated morgue cabinet was there as well.\n\n\"Where is your brother's body?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"My brother's funeral was held yesterday. Sir, are you a friend of my brother's?\"\n\n\"You could say that,\" Zhou Ze said evasively.\n\n\"My brother's body was already cremated yesterday.\"\n\n*Are you trying to fool a ghost?*\n\nZhou Ze nodded, indicating that he understood, then turned and left.\n\nThe man in the suit watched Zhou Ze's back, a thoughtful look in his eyes.\n\n...\n\nThe evening breeze was cool. Under the moonlight, the canola flower fields surrounding the villa created a desolate atmosphere, like a grand funeral for which everything here was mere decoration and prelude.\n\nThe workers had all gone home. The villa didn't provide lodging, even though it was large and spacious. Of course, the workers didn't want to live here either.\n\nThe man in the black suit placed dishes one by one on the round table in the hall. They were all cold dishes, without a wisp of steam.\n\nThen, he poured wine into the glasses on the table—aged yellow wine.\n\nNext, he walked to the foot of the stairs and called up:\n\n\"Dinner is ready.\"\n\nThree women,\n\nfrom youngest to oldest, descended the stairs in order. They didn't stand on ceremony and sat down directly.\n\nThe priest hadn't left either and stood by the table.\n\nThe man in the suit went back to the basement and wheeled out a gurney covered with a white sheet. Then came a second, a third, and a fourth.\n\nThe hall began to fill with the thick smell of plastic and disinfectant.\n\nThe elderly woman started coughing.\n\nThe middle-aged woman looked displeased.\n\nThe young woman covered her nose and waved her hand.\n\n\"Why are there so many?\" Ms. Liu asked, dissatisfied.\n\n\"Since we agreed to hold a posthumous wedding for my brother and my sister-in-law, it would only be proper to have my father and mother attend as well.\"\n\n\"Your family is truly messed up,\" the elderly woman muttered. \"No wonder your brother instigated my granddaughter to jump off a building with him.\"\n\n\"That's not my brother's fault. My brother was always running the family business; he wouldn't have been willing to die. It's your family that has a tradition of men committing suicide. My sister-in-law, influenced by her upbringing, was the one who took my brother with her.\"\n\n\"Hmph.\" The elderly woman couldn't be bothered to argue the point and urged, \"If you're going to do it, do it quickly. I'm getting sleepy.\"\n\n\"Alright.\"\n\nThe man in the suit first lifted the white sheet from one gurney, revealing the body of Miss Liu.\n\nHe lifted her up and placed her on a chair, then used several plastic ties to secure her so she maintained a dignified sitting posture.\n\nNext, the man in the suit uncovered his brother's white sheet, lifted his brother up, and sat him in the seat beside Miss Liu.\n\nHowever, his brother's posture seemed to hold up quite well on its own, not needing any ties for support.\n\nThe man in the suit was a little surprised but didn't pay it much mind.\n\n\"Those two ill-fated children. Why did they have to do it?\"\n\nThe old woman squeezed out a few tears. It must have been quite an effort.\n\nMs. Liu comforted her mother.\n\nMs. Liu's daughter, in turn, comforted her own mother.\n\nThe three women huddled together, crying, consoling, and confiding.\n\nThe newlywed couple sat coldly in their places,\n\ntheir eyelids shut tight.\n\nThey could not see.\n\nThe feast on this table was prepared for them,\n\nbut the drama at this table had nothing to do with them.\n\nThe man in the suit pinned a red flower to his brother's and sister-in-law's chests. He had hoped it would make them look more festive, but it only added to the chilling picture.\n\n\"Don't open their eyes. Let's not disturb them too much.\"\n\nWhen Ms. Liu saw the man in the suit about to use tape to prop open the corpses' eyelids, she immediately spoke up to stop him.\n\nShe had already overcome a significant psychological barrier just by agreeing to the posthumous wedding. Now, sitting at the same table as two corpses, she felt like she was sitting on pins and needles. If their eyes were opened, she really wouldn't be able to stay seated.\n\nThe man in the suit hesitated for a moment but nodded in agreement.\n\nThen, the man in the suit called out to another gurney:\n\n\"Mom, it's Brother's happy day. Please come and watch.\"\n\nWith that, the man in the suit lifted the white sheet, revealing the body of a middle-aged woman.\n\nShe was dressed in a cheongsam and looked very wealthy and elegant, but she must have been dead for many years. Even the best preservation methods couldn't completely save her appearance.\n\nDeep beneath her skin, a greenish sheen was visible. It was just a shell, a husk that had undergone too many special treatments to preserve her living appearance as much as possible.\n\nHe settled his mother in a chair, placing her next to the old madam.\n\nThe old madam shuddered in fright but said nothing.\n\nMs. Liu glanced at her \"mother-in-law\" and didn't dare to look a second time.\n\nFinally,\n\nthe man in the suit addressed the last gurney:\n\n\"Dad, Brother is getting married today. Wake up...\"\n\n\"Aye.\"\n\nFrom under the white sheet came a response.\n\nThe man in the suit's body trembled, and a look of terror appeared on his face.\n\nThe three women at the table also began to tremble with fear. The young girl nearly screamed but quickly covered her mouth.\n\nEven the priest looked up suspiciously, completely baffled as to what part they were playing in this drama.\n\nThe man in the suit no longer dared to reach out and lift the white sheet.\n\nBut the person inside took the initiative and threw the sheet off.\n\nZhou Ze stretched lazily, cracking his neck with a few crisp sounds. He said, somewhat apologetically:\n\n\"Sorry, my pillow was taken over by a stupid woman today, so I borrowed your freezer for a nap.\n\n\"Not bad, really.\n\n\"It's just that I've been living the good life for too long. Sleeping in a freezer again makes this body feel a little stiff.\"\n\n***\n¹A poetic Chinese term for a grave mound, which resembles a steamed bun (饅頭 mántou).",

    "content": "\"I'm sorry to interrupt your two families' gathering,\" he said. \"I'm just here to take care of my business, then you can carry on.\"\n\nWith that, Zhou Ze got off the gurney, walked over to Chen Zesheng's corpse, and reached out to gently pat his shoulder. A black halo appeared, coalescing into Chen Zesheng's shadow.\n\nThis shadow was visible only to Zhou Ze; ordinary people could not see it.\n\n\"The wedding isn't over yet,\" Chen Zesheng said to Zhou Ze. He himself seemed completely unfazed, not at all surprised by the fact that Zhou Ze was about to take him away.\n\n\"Your wife is waiting for you down below.\"\n\nWith that, Zhou Ze forcibly grabbed him and walked straight out.\n\n\"You! Stop right there!\"\n\nThe older brother said no more, but the younger brother, mustering his courage, pointed a finger at Zhou Ze and yelled:\n\n\"What in the world are you doing?!\"\n\n\"I've already done what I came to do. Now, you can carry on.\"\n\nAfter speaking, Zhou Ze glanced deliberately at the silent priest standing beside the three women and gave him a smile.\n\nThe priest smiled back at Zhou Ze, bowing his head even lower.\n\nZhou Ze recalled the little loli's evaluation of him once: he \"knew his place.\"¹\n\nIt seemed this priest knew it even better than he did.\n\nWithout another word, Zhou Ze turned and left. The younger brother kept pointing at him but didn't dare to follow. He was keenly aware of one thing: he himself had pushed the gurney out of the cold storage freezer, which meant this man before him had actually been lying in that freezer for a very long time.\n\nHe felt the world must have gone mad, truly mad.\n\nDragging Chen Zesheng along, he emerged onto the road, flanked by lush fields of rapeseed flowers.\n\nChen Zesheng then spoke up. \"Sir, I came looking for your help.\"\n\n\"Then why didn't you say so earlier?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Because I noticed you didn't seem inclined to help,\" Chen Zesheng said with a smile. \"My younger brother has some mental issues, and I can't help but worry about him. The family business is already doing poorly, barely scraping by. Once I'm gone, he might not be able to handle it all by himself.\"\n\n\"I've seen for myself that your brother has mental issues.\"\n\nYeah, for someone who could orchestrate a scene where the whole family, even the dead, had to be \"together and tidy,\" it'd be stranger if he *were* mentally sound.\n\n\"But you say you're worried your brother can't handle it alone—weren't you the one who jumped off a building?\" Zhou Ze retorted.\n\n\"Heh, to be honest, I chickened out. We'd agreed to jump together, but after she went, I got scared,\" Chen Zesheng said with brutal honesty.\n\n\"And then?\"\n\n\"Then I felt I had wronged her. The next day, after giving my statement at the police station, I jumped too.\n\nI thought I'd be able to find her on the Yellow Springs Road, but inexplicably, I found myself back at home.\n\nPerhaps it was because my brother restored my corpse too well. Although those two morticians had some issues with quality control, at least on the surface, they made me look uncannily lifelike.\"\n\nAfter speaking, Chen Zesheng squatted down, took out a cigarette for himself, and lit it.\n\nThis was a spirit cigarette; ordinary people couldn't smell the smoke.\n\nZhou Ze took out a cigarette too. Truth be told, Zhou Ze had taken a liking to this fellow. He was decisive in his actions and straightforward in his speech.\n\nWhat a pity that a guy like this was already dead. Otherwise, being friends with him would have been quite pleasant.\n\n\"Are you captivated by my personal charm?\" Chen Zesheng fluttered his eyelashes at Zhou Ze. \"People who know how to appreciate life and perceive beauty are rarely too bad.\"\n\n\"It's a little disgusting when you say that about yourself.\"\n\n\"Heh, my father started taking me along with him when I was ten. My brother wasn't willing—he was scared of corpses—so I was the only one who could inherit the trade.\n\nI was afraid of corpses at first, too. But later, I discovered their beauty, a kind of tranquil beauty. It's a beauty that can immerse you in a certain mood, like listening to a lovely piano piece.\n\nI tended to their final appearances, and they tended to my emotions. I gave them their last dignity, and they gave me a moment of peace.\n\nHonestly, I still didn't want to die. If she hadn't been so set on dying, and if I didn't truly love her, I really wouldn't have wanted to die.\"\n\n\"I also find it regrettable. When I died, you weren't my mortician.\"\n\nThis was from the bottom of Zhou Ze's heart. The woman who did his makeup last time had poked him so painfully.\n\n\"Heh, Sir, let me ask you one more question. If I go down now, can I still find her on the Yellow Springs Road? I'm a day late. I'm afraid I won't be able to find her once I'm down there.\"\n\n\"Probably not. The Yellow Springs Road is very crowded.\"\n\nThere was something he left unsaid: on the Yellow Springs Road, with few exceptions, the souls are all numbly shuffling forward on their tiptoes, like formless, walking corpses.\n\n\"Well, that's a real shame,\" Chen Zesheng said, shaking his head. \"I'll try my best to look.\"\n\nZhou Ze dug his fingernails into his palm, then pulled out a rectangle. A black halo swirled within the shape, and an aura from Hell slowly seeped out.\n\n\"Go on in. Go where you're supposed to go.\"\n\n\"Thank you.\"\n\nChen Zesheng walked up to the rectangle, and his form was sucked inside.\n\nAshes to ashes, dust to dust. The underworld has its order, the Yellow Springs can be crossed. This was probably the smoothest time Zhou Ze had ever sent someone to Hell.\n\nSilently finishing his cigarette, Zhou Ze turned back for another look at the villa nestled among the rapeseed flowers, thinking of the three women's expressions and the bizarre scene at the dinner table, with the living and the dead sitting together.\n\nEven as a dead man, as a ghost emissary, Zhou Ze found the two families' behavior chilling enough to make his scalp tingle.\n\nA dead man like Chen Zesheng could depart with such nonchalant grace, while the living were like heavily made-up clowns in a stage play, constantly preening and posturing.\n\nThe world, it seemed, had always been like this, and had never changed.\n\n...\n\n“Ahahahahahaha!!!!!!”\n\nAt high noon, Xu Qinglang's laughter rang out. He was laughing outrageously, as if he'd just found over a hundred thousand yuan. In fact, that was more or less the case.\n\nZhou Ze had gotten back late last night and gone to bed late, so he'd only managed a short nap on Bai Yingying's lap in the morning. He hadn't been asleep long before Xu Qinglang's laughter woke him up.\n\n\"Old Zhou, you've really got the magic touch! The Liu family just called me. They're renting us that shop space for fifty thousand a year! Fifty thousand a year, on South Street! That's practically giving it away!\"\n\n\"Oh.\" Zhou Ze wasn't too surprised. He had gone to catch a ghost last night, slept over by chance, and stumbled upon the two families conducting a ghost marriage. This must be his hush money.\n\n\"Come on, let's go check out the shop.\"\n\nAnd just like that, Zhou Ze was dragged by Xu Qinglang into a taxi to South Street. The shop was across the street from the Wenfeng Grand World and the department store.\n\nThe shop was over a hundred square meters and used to be a clothing store.\n\n\"Are you still planning to open a noodle shop?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Of course. My noodles are delicious.\"² Xu Qinglang replied.\n\n\"Then you should see if their noodles are any good.\"\n\nWith that, Zhou Ze pointed to the shops on either side of theirs.\n\nXu Qinglang looked over, his face twitching. To the left of the shop were a \"Chongqing Noodles\" and a \"Qishan Minced Pork Noodles.\" To the right were a \"Lanzhou Lamian\" and a \"Wonton Noodle House.\"\n\n\"You didn't notice this when you first looked at the shop?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\nXu Qinglang shook his head, looking as if he'd lost all will to live.\n\n\"We'll see when the time comes. You can move your bookstore over first. If it really doesn't work out, I'll just make coffee and sell some pastries in the bookstore,\" Xu Qinglang said.\n\n\"That was your plan all along, wasn't it?\" Zhou Ze wasn't so easily fooled.\n\n\"As a man who owns over twenty properties, to let my hands and skin continue to be ravaged by oil and smoke—that would be a crime!\"\n\n\"So whose sign do we hang up?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Let's use your 'Midnight Bookstore.'\"\n\n\"That works.\"\n\n\"Are you hungry?\" Xu Qinglang asked Zhou Ze, pulling a thermos from his pocket. \"Let's go get a bowl of noodles. I want to see if the noodles here are any good first. If they're terrible, I might reconsider setting up a challenge.\"\n\nThe thermos was filled with plum juice.\n\nZhou Ze didn't refuse. He hadn't eaten since waking up, so he followed Xu Qinglang into the Wonton Noodle House. They ordered two bowls of noodles and sat at a small table, waiting for them to arrive.\n\n\"Ah, just thinking about moving the business to this bustling area gets me pretty excited,\" Xu Qinglang said, looking eager.\n\nThen he noticed Zhou Ze wasn't really listening to him, but was looking slightly upward.\n\nThere was a ceiling fan directly overhead, spinning rapidly.\n\nThe temperature had risen noticeably lately, and the sun was strong. Plus, since the noodle shop's kitchen was in the main dining area with no partition, charcoal fire and steam lingered in the air. Without the fan, it would have been unbearably stuffy.\n\n\"What's so interesting about that?\" Xu Qinglang asked Zhou Ze.\n\n\"When I was a kid in school, I'd often sit in the classroom in the summer and stare up at the ceiling fans, terrified one would fall and hit me,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Hey, what a coincidence. I used to worry about that as a kid, too.\"\n\n\"By the way, do you know feng shui?\" Zhou Ze asked.\n\n\"Half-baked at best,\" Xu Qinglang admitted freely, then continued, \"It's actually very simple. If you don't feel particularly comfortable living here, it means the feng shui is pretty good.\"\n\nZhou Ze mulled it over and realized what Xu Qinglang said made perfect sense. He couldn't find any reason to refute it.\n\nTheir noodles arrived.\n\nXu Qinglang picked up a single strand and ate it slowly.\n\nZhou Ze opened his thermos, took a sip of plum juice, and then slurped down a big mouthful of noodles.\n\nLooking at his own ravenous gulping, then at Xu Qinglang's one-strand-at-a-time posture, Zhou Ze shook his head and said:\n\n\"So pretentious.\"\n\n\"What do you know? I'm carefully savoring the flavor of my competition.\"\n\nHearing this, Zhou Ze pushed his bowl of noodles away. He'd lost his appetite.\n\n\"...\" Xu Qinglang.\n\nJust then, a young man at the next table answered a call and said into his phone:\n\n\"I'm at the Wonton Noodle House. I got here early. Have you arrived yet?\"\n\nThe young man looked like a college student, very fresh-faced.\n\nAt that moment, a girl with a shoulder bag ran to the entrance of the shop. She stood there holding what looked like a notification slip and shouted excitedly to the young man:\n\n\"I passed! I passed!\"\n\nThen the girl ran straight toward the young man, arms wide open, asking for a hug.\n\n\"I really envy the college student life,\" Xu Qinglang said wistfully.\n\nThe girl ran to the young man and leaped into his arms. He caught her out of habit and lifted her up. This was likely a customary passionate gesture between the young couple.\n\nThis was the taste of youth, the beauty of being young.\n\nHowever,\n\nthe ceiling fan was very low,\n\nand after the boy habitually lifted the girl up,\n\nthe girl's head slammed right into it.\n\n*Thump...*\n\nA head landed on the table in front of Zhou Ze and Xu Qinglang.\n***\n¹The original term, 逼数 (bī shù), is a vulgar slang term that means having an accurate understanding of oneself and the situation, or \"knowing one's place.\"\n\n²In Chinese, \"我下面很好吃\" (wǒ xiàmiàn hěn hǎochī) is a pun. It can mean \"The noodles I make are delicious\" or, literally, \"The thing below me is delicious.\"",

    "content": "The police arrived, and so did the ambulance.\n\nOf course, whether the ambulance came or not no longer mattered.\n\nZhou Ze and Xu Qinglang squatted across the street, surrounded by a crowd of onlookers.\n\nXu Qinglang still hadn't recovered from the scene just now. His hands were still trembling. He wasn't afraid of ghosts and saw them often, but many things couldn't be measured by simple fear. It was more about whether the imagery of the moment had truly gotten to you.\n\nFor Xu Qinglang, who moments before had been savoring the taste of a competitor, the sudden shift in tone was... truly stimulating.\n\n\"That was terrifying.\"\n\nA moment later, Xu Qinglang finally came to his senses. He lit a cigarette and asked,\n\n\"Can a ceiling fan really cut someone's head off?\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. \"Theoretically, it's impossible. At most, it would cause a deep cut.\"\n\n\"So this time it went beyond the realm of theory?\"\n\n\"You could say that. When I was a doctor, I treated patients injured by falling ceiling fans, but I never heard of anyone actually getting their head cut off by one.\n\nIn fact, even ancient executioners had to practice extensively to be able to sever a condemned prisoner's head with one swing. It was common for the blade to get stuck in the neck without the head falling off, making it impossible to pull out.\"\n\n\"Alright then. Looks like the feng shui of this place really is no good.\"\n\n\"It's great,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Heh heh.\" Xu Qinglang rolled his eyes.\n\n\"Actually, danger is everywhere in life. For now, this just looks like a case of bad luck.\n\nFor example, if you're unlucky, you could get a big gash just by rubbing a book page against your lips. Or take tomatoes, for instance—the tomatine in them is a toxin called an alkaloid.\"\n\n\"Then how come I eat tomatoes all the time and I'm not dead?\"\n\n\"If you ate four tons, the dose would be lethal.\"\n\n\"...\" Xu Qinglang was speechless.\n\n\"You'd die from eating four tons of anything!\" Xu Qinglang hissed in a low voice.\n\n\"Alright, we've seen the shop, it's time to go. If we don't leave, the police will want to take our statements again.\n\nWe already did it once for the jumper a while back. If we do it again and run into someone we know, they'll really start thinking we're Conan.\"\n\n\"What a rotten day. I came here all fired up, and who knew this would happen.\" Xu Qinglang dropped his cigarette butt and stamped it out with his foot.\n\n\"I thought you'd be a little happy about having one less competitor.\"\n\n\"That's going too far. The poor girl just died.\"\n\n\"Oh? Then tell me, can the soul of someone who just died float out right away?\"\n\nZhou Ze pointed to the storefront ahead. Standing there was a girl in a yellow sweater.\n\nShe had a different outfit from the dead girl, but this one had a graceful, slender figure, and her long legs were simply to die for.\n\nOf course, she would have been even more beautiful if she'd had a head.\n\n\"Th-...\" Xu Qinglang was stunned.\n\nEven with the greatest of grievances, a soul would have to wait until the seventh day after death¹ to form into a vengeful ghost. It couldn't happen the moment they died. Besides, it was a matter of luck and probability; out of a thousand people who die, maybe only one soul would linger in the mortal realm.\n\n\"I knew it. How could a fan just slice a head off?\" Zhou Ze stood up and started walking in that direction.\n\nThat girl had died. She deserved justice!\n\n\"Hiss...\"\n\nZhou Ze subconsciously clutched his chest. The pain was back again.\n\n*For the quota, for the quota, I'm doing this for my quota!*\n\n*Yesterday, I reaped Chen Zesheng, and my performance rose from eight percent to ten. Reaping one ghost only gets me one or two points. At this rate, it'll be a cold day in hell before I get made permanent!*\n\n*This one is good. It can kill people. A ghost that can kill...*\n\n*Is valuable!*\n\nWith that shift in perspective, that change in thinking,\n\nthe pain in his chest was gone.\n\nXu Qinglang followed him. But just as he stepped into the crowd, his vision suddenly blurred. He felt dizzy, and the world spun before he fell straight to the ground.\n\n\"Fuck...\"\n\nThe palm of his hand was scraped raw from breaking his fall, the skin broken and beading with blood.\n\nXu Qinglang quickly scrambled up. The area was swarming with onlookers and cordoned off by police tape, but he couldn't find any sign of Zhou Ze or the headless girl.\n\nHe was a bit disoriented.\n\nThe sun suddenly seemed harsher, and the air felt suffocating, making it hard for him to breathe.\n\nHe started to panic, a sense of dread creeping in.\n\nAlthough his spiritual power wasn't high, he wasn't a complete rookie. He shouldn't have been this terrified by a single headless ghost, but he couldn't suppress the frantic anxiety building inside him.\n\nHe started searching, weaving frantically through the crowd. He was looking for Zhou Ze, and he was looking for the headless girl. He felt that if he could just find one of them, he could escape this state of headless, panicked confusion.\n\nSearching... searching... searching...\n\nSearching... searching... searching...\n\nBeads of sweat dripped from Xu Qinglang's forehead. He was breaking out in a cold sweat, and his lips were chapped and dry. Xu Qinglang looked up at the sun and felt like he could barely open his eyes.\n\n\"*Crack...*\"\n\nA crisp sound came from behind him and to the side. Xu Qinglang instinctively pushed through the crowd and stumbled in that direction.\n\nHe arrived at the entrance of a noodle shop.\n\nAnd then he saw Zhou Ze, sitting inside.\n\n\"There you are! I've been looking for you for so long!\"\n\nXu Qinglang was almost crying with joy. The confusion and despair he had just experienced were hard to describe in words, like being exiled into his own nightmare.\n\nYou couldn't perceive the beginning,\n\nand you couldn't sense the end.\n\nXu Qinglang ran toward Zhou Ze. He was excited, very, very excited.\n\nIn truth, he wasn't gay. His orientation had always been perfectly normal. It was just that heaven had given him the wrong kind of body, and sometimes he'd make jokes about it to suit the situation, never really taking them to heart.\n\nBut there was no denying that in this moment, upon seeing Zhou Ze,\n\nhis joy was bursting from within!\n\nLike seeing an oasis in the desert, like a starving man seeing a piece of bread.\n\nHe lunged forward, he ran, he opened his arms.\n\nHe saw Zhou Ze stand up,\n\nand then he saw the ceiling fan above Zhou Ze's head.\n\nThe fan was spinning,\n\nspinning very fast.\n\nA look of terror appeared on Xu Qinglang's face. He wanted to scream for Zhou Ze to get out of the way, wanted to shout \"no,\"\n\nbut his body's momentum kept him running forward.\n\nHe felt as if he had foreseen his own end.\n\nZhou Ze would catch him,\n\nthen lift him up,\n\nand then his own head,\n\n*Crack...*\n\nLike a cucumber being snapped in two.\n\nHowever, he didn't see open arms.\n\nHe saw Zhou Ze lift his leg.\n\n\"*Thud!*\"\n\nA foot,\n\nplanted firmly in his stomach.\n\nXu Qinglang fell to the ground, only to find himself lying by the side of the road. A small car had just sped past him.\n\nAnd Zhou Ze was standing on the curb.\n\nHis body was already soaked in a cold sweat. Xu Qinglang touched his forehead.\n\n\"I fell for its trick, didn't I?\"\n\n\"You nearly ran out and got hit by a car,\" Zhou Ze said unhurriedly, as if he were remarking, \"Hey, the weather's not bad today.\"\n\n\"That thing is that powerful?\" Xu Qinglang said, his heart still pounding with fear.\n\n\"She must have sensed we were tracking her, so she struck first. This doesn't seem like a pure ghost. Killing is as easy as drinking water for it. If I hadn't stopped you, you'd have been sent flying.\"\n\n\"If it's not a ghost, what is it?\"\n\n\"Have you ever seen the Great Sage, Equal to Heaven, masturbating?\"\n\nXu Qinglang shook his head.\n\n\"I have,\" Zhou Ze sighed. \"It crossed the road and went into the mall over there. You should stay here. I'll go after it alone.\"\n\n\"Are you kidding? It nearly killed me! How could I let it get away!\"\n\nXu Qinglang climbed up from the ground and dusted himself off.\n\n\"I'll go home and start dinner. You kill it. I'll wait for you to come back and eat.\"\n\nZhou Ze nodded. Last night, he'd thought that priest had a good head on his shoulders. Now he realized his neighbor did, too.\n\nThe light turned green.\n\nZhou Ze gave a wave, walked across the crosswalk, and entered the mall on the other side. Once inside, Zhou Ze began his search again.\n\nTo be honest, Zhou Ze sometimes felt frustrated. His powers seemed formidable—he could beat Bai Yingying until she screamed—\n\nbut at other times, they felt pretty useless.\n\nHe was a licensed professional now, but his abilities weren't always suited for catching ghosts. Like right now. After that headless woman entered the mall, he completely lost her in this crowd.\n\nAnd there was another reason Zhou Ze felt this wasn't an ordinary ghost: the creature's malevolent aura wasn't that strong. Yet it could kill in broad daylight and use illusions in a crowd to almost make Xu Qinglang get himself run over.\n\nAn ordinary ghost truly didn't have that kind of power.\n\nJust then, Zhou Ze suddenly noticed a woman in a yellow sweater emerging from the side. But she had a head, with a few freckles on her face.\n\nZhou Ze subconsciously started toward her, but then he saw another woman in a yellow sweater in a different direction. And then, he saw several more.\n\nZhou Ze finally realized that the yellow sweater was the themed uniform for the mall's employees today.\n\nHow was he supposed to find it now!\n\nZhou Ze walked over to a refrigerated case, opened it, took out a bottle of mineral water, twisted off the cap, and started drinking directly from it.\n\n\"Sir, you have to pay for items here before you can open and consume them,\" a saleswoman in a yellow sweater said, walking up to remind him.\n\nShe was very young, likely a student working part-time.\n\n\"My apologies.\" Zhou Ze took out a ten-yuan bill and handed it to her. \"Could you pay for this for me?\"\n\nThen, Zhou Ze reached out and pinched her cheek.\n\nThere was a physical sensation.\n\n*It should be a real head, right?*\n\nBut the girl, flushed with shame and anger, pointed at Zhou Ze and yelled, \"What do you think you're doing!\"\n\nTaking ten yuan—for a two-yuan bottle of water, which meant taking eight yuan—\n\nand he thought he could do whatever he wanted!\n\nLeaving aside the fact that this girl isn't that kind of person,\n\nto grope someone for just eight yuan... that's just too much!\n\n\"Sorry,\" Zhou Ze said with a wave of his hand, and squatted down on the floor.\n\nThe girl had been about to shout for someone to catch the pervert, but seeing Zhou Ze's action, she held her tongue. Fuming, she took the money and prepared to go to the checkout counter.\n\nZhou Ze extended his finger. A black nail grew out, and he pressed it to the floor.\n\n*I refuse to believe I can't find you!*\n\nA puff of black energy seeped from Zhou Ze's fingertip into the ground.\n\nAnd then,\n\nZhou Ze saw black footprints appear beside him.\n\nThe footprints began to extend outwards,\n\nall the way to the back of the young woman who was taking his ten-yuan bill to the checkout counter.\n***\n**Footnotes:**\n¹ In Chinese tradition, the seventh day after a person's death (头七, *tóu qī*) is when the soul is believed to return home for a final visit before moving on.

    "content": "Zhou Ze stood up, preparing to call out to the girl.\n\nBut at that moment, he was stunned to discover that the mall was covered in black footprints. It wasn't just the girl from before; the other customers, the salespeople—it was as if the soles of everyone's shoes had been coated in a layer of black grease, leaving a clear print with every step.\n\nThis was a situation Zhou Ze hadn't anticipated. Could it be that everyone in this mall was a ghost?\n\nEven a Ghost Market wouldn't be this exaggerated.\n\nThe last time Zhou Ze and Xu Qinglang had witnessed Lady Bai's banquet, it was just a few tables of people messing around, nowhere near as grand as this. And Lady Bai had cultivated for two hundred years, even having her own temple at one point.\n\nA dizzying, world-spinning sensation suddenly washed over him.\n\nZhou Ze felt as if he were on a carousel at an amusement park.\n\nEverything around him felt so unreal, so bizarre and fantastical.\n\nYou couldn't tell what was fake, nor could you figure out what was real.\n\nYou could only look around in a daze.\n\nHe remembered Xu Qinglang seeming to have the same experience not long ago. He had suddenly rushed into the road. If Zhou Ze hadn't kicked him, he might have been sent flying by a car.\n\nAnd now, that same feeling was assailing him.\n\nWas that thing…\n\n…planning to make a move on him?\n\nAs a ghost official, to be counter-attacked by the very ghost he was hunting… it seemed a bit absurd. The deadliest part was, Zhou Ze had no idea how to fight back.\n\nHis ghost-catching experience had been limited to the ingrained belief that his fingernails were all-powerful. But this time, it seemed his nails couldn't help him.\n\nStaggering, he sat down on the floor. Zhou Ze thought he saw someone in front of him hand him some change, and he vaguely heard someone say, \"Here's your eight yuan in change.\"\n\nThen,\n\nthe head of the girl in front of him began to blur. Everything in his vision seemed to be coated in a layer of paste, making him nauseous and dizzy.\n\nIt was as if he were back on the Road to the Underworld, numbly walking forward on his tiptoes with the masses.\n\nThe Buddha spoke of the myriad forms of all living beings,\n\nbut on the Road to the Underworld, there is only one form.\n\nZhou Ze felt he couldn't even draw a breath. He subconsciously clutched his own neck. He lowered his head, coughing hard, wanting to scream but unable to make a sound.\n\nIt was a feeling that made each day feel like a year, a form of torture inflicted upon the mind. Xu Qinglang had easily broken down in it before, and now, Zhou Ze was also trapped within.\n\nZhou Ze felt he should do something, but at this moment, besides passively enduring it all, there seemed to be nothing he could do.\n\nPain.\n\nOppression.\n\nSuffocation.\n\nA torrent of torment, endlessly lashing your soul.\n\n***\n\n\"Sir? Sir, what's wrong?\"\n\nThe girl handed the change to Zhou Ze, but suddenly noticed the man's eyes had glazed over, and he looked like he was in great pain.\n\nThe girl's first reaction was that the man was trying to pull a scam,¹ drinking the water sold at her supermarket and then immediately acting sick.\n\nBut after watching for a moment, she thought otherwise. The man seemed to be in genuine pain.\n\n\"Sir, should I call 120 for you?\" the girl asked.\n\nWho would have known that the man in front of her would instead reach out, push her to the ground, and then stagger to his feet, running all the way outside.\n\nThe girl had considered calling the police or 120, because she felt the man's state was very unstable, but in the end, with the mindset of \"the less trouble, the better,\" she didn't take out her phone.\n\n***\n\nEverything around him was like a mirror made of water, refracting all sorts of brilliant colors. The few rays of light that shone in offered no warmth, instead adding to an inner agitation.\n\nZhou Ze didn't know where he was going, nor what he was doing. He was even mentally prepared that, like Xu Qinglang before him, he had already walked into the road and was now waiting for a car to send him flying.\n\nHe could only offer passive resistance. He didn't know where he was or where he was going now, but he kept resisting the self-destructive impulse welling up inside him.\n\n\"Clang…\"\n\nA noise sounded.\n\nZhou Ze had knocked over a trash can and fallen into a pile of garbage. The pungent, sour smell couldn't wake him. In his vision, lush green grass was everywhere, like a paradise.\n\nAlthough the surrounding scenery was beautiful, and the light was vibrant,\n\nit didn't give the slightest feeling of comfort.\n\nIt was more like a cage, making one instinctively reject it, want to escape it.\n\nLaughter and cheerful chatter drifted from all around. Nearby, it seemed a flock of graceful women was dancing. In the distance, incense smoke curled, as if countless people were making offerings at an altar.\n\nAll sorts of images appeared in Zhou Ze's mind, squeezing his nerves bit by bit. Any one of them could be the last straw that broke the camel's back.\n\nFinally, the image froze.\n\nZhou Ze found himself standing at the gate of a familiar courtyard.\n\nHanging above it was the sign for the orphanage.\n\nAnd in front of him, a couple was leaving a baby stroller there. They seemed to be preparing to leave.\n\nWhen Zhou Ze grew up, he had asked the director about his birth. In fact, the director never hid such things from the children after they grew up. He told Zhou Ze that he had been intentionally abandoned by his parents.\n\nFrom then on, Zhou Ze never again thought about finding his birth parents. He just considered his mother and father to be dead. He no longer needed them in his life.\n\nBut at this moment,\n\nZhou Ze suddenly had a premonition.\n\nThe couple up ahead had to be his parents.\n\nAnd the baby in the stroller,\n\nhad to be him.\n\nHe subconsciously lifted his foot,\n\nwanting to run over,\n\nto see what his parents' faces looked like, maybe even to question them about why they had abandoned him.\n\nBut his foot only lifted.\n\nIt did not come down.\n\nA look of struggle appeared on Zhou Ze's face.\n\nHe instinctively sensed something. If this foot landed, it would be the abyss!\n\nAll the beautiful things had finally settled into this scene. This was a poisoned pie,² a trap set by a hunter, just waiting for the prey to take that step.\n\n***\n\nOn the edge of the skyscraper's rooftop, Zhou Ze, already standing on the parapet, swayed precariously. He repeatedly tilted forward as if about to fall, only to adjust his center of gravity back again each time.\n\nHe was struggling.\n\nHe was resisting.\n\nAnd his life was hanging by a thread.\n\nOn one side of the rooftop stood a headless woman.\n\nThe woman was no longer wearing the yellow sweater, but a long, cyan robe. The style was somewhat old-fashioned, and it was damaged in several places, but the woman just stood there coldly, facing Zhou Ze, who looked like he could fall at any moment.\n\nAnd on the rooftop, there was a third person: a priest.\n\nIt was a pity Zhou Ze couldn't open his eyes to see, or he would have definitely recognized this priest whom he had only just met recently.\n\nAt Miss Liu's funeral, this priest, from beginning to end, had said nothing other than offering him a cigarette.\n\nEven when facing the strange, cold banquet between the two families, the priest had just stood to the side, watching quietly, as if admiring a ukiyo-e scroll.\n\nThe priest looked from Zhou Ze to the headless woman, then back again.\n\nHe shook his head and spoke to the headless woman:\n\n\"Lady in Cyan, he is a ghost official.\"\n\nThis was a warning.\n\nA warning to the headless woman before him of the man's identity.\n\nBut this warning was undoubtedly like pouring oil on a fire.\n\nThe priest, seemingly unaware he was fanning the flames, continued, \"If you kill him, it will provoke a reaction from Hell.\"\n\nThe headless woman suddenly turned to face the priest.\n\nThe priest gave a nonchalant smile and immediately changed his tune:\n\n\"But he's just a temporary ghost official, a low-ranking one at that. Even if he's gone, he's gone.\n\nAt a time like this, anyone who dares to disturb Your Ladyship's mood deserves a bad end.\n\nBesides, Your Ladyship has done nothing wrong.\"\n\nThe headless woman turned back to face Zhou Ze, seemingly sparing the somewhat meddlesome priest.\n\nThe priest stood there, continuing to play the part of a spectator. This seemed to be his favorite role.\n\nHe knew this headless woman's identity. It was strange, in fact, that this ghost official, whom he had met once before, hadn't been able to discern the woman's identity right away.\n\nJust how incompetent was this ghost official at his job?\n\nShe isn't a ghost.\n\nShe isn't an existence under your jurisdiction at all.\n\nYet you stared at her, chased her,\n\nand in the end,\n\nyou angered her.\n\nWomen can hold a grudge.\n\nEspecially this one before him,\n\na woman whose days were numbered.\n\nThe priest glanced behind him. The building was very tall, and the view was excellent. He could see a construction site in the distance where demolition work was underway, dust filling the air.\n\nThe most direct memories an era can leave for people are, in fact, its architecture. And the current urban renewal and upgrades were undoubtedly a process of slowly erasing many imprints of the past.\n\nTurning back,\n\nhe looked at Zhou Ze, who was still standing on the edge, his body swaying back and forth.\n\nThe priest was somewhat surprised himself.\n\nThis temporary ghost official really had some stamina.\n\nEven he himself probably couldn't have held on for so long.\n\nBut just then,\n\nthe priest suddenly saw the nails on Zhou Ze's ten fingers slowly melting. But the melted fluid didn't drip down; it flowed back into his body.\n\nZhou Ze's skin, at this moment, began to take on a bronze luster. This wasn't the kind of bronze from sun and exercise, but a color mixed with\n\ngloom,\n\ncurses,\n\ncoldness,\n\nand many other negative presences.\n\nAt the same time, the priest noticed a green light slowly being released from Zhou Ze's tightly shut eyes, like a ferocious beast that had been dormant,\n\nnow,\n\ngradually stimulated to awaken.\n\nAt the corners of Zhou Ze's mouth, two fangs gradually pushed past his lips.\n\nBai Yingying had always been curious about one thing. She was, after all, a *jiangshi*³ who had slumbered for two hundred years, so why did Zhou Ze's nails thrash her so relentlessly?!\n\nRight now,\n\nthe priest, his face filled with disbelief, provided the answer for her.\n\nHis mouth twitched,\n\nand two words escaped his lips:\n\n\"*Jiangshi*!\"\n\n***\n*¹ \"碰瓷\" (pèngcí), literally \"to touch porcelain,\" is a common scam in China where a person fakes an injury or damages their own property to extort compensation from an innocent party.*\n\n*² A Chinese expression for something that looks appealing but is dangerously deceptive, similar to a \"honey trap\" or \"poisoned bait.\"*\n\n*³ *Jiangshi* (僵屍) are reanimated corpses from Chinese folklore, often depicted as stiff, hopping vampires or zombies.*",

    "content": "On the rooftop,\n\nZhou Ze, standing at the edge, was slowly turning around.\n\nThe priest’s lips parted, revealing a look of astonishment.\n\nThe headless woman still stood there. The rooftop was high and windy, but the hem of her dress remained perfectly still.\n\n“This shouldn’t be possible. As a Hell Guard, his physical body from his past life should be long gone. Most of them can only walk the human world by borrowing someone else’s shell.\n\nHow on earth did he turn into a jiangshi?”\n\nThe priest muttered to himself, his forehead covered in question marks.\n\nAs a qualified spectator, being observant and thoughtful were essential qualities.\n\nBut when Zhou Ze turned completely around, the priest’s previously open lips slowly curved into a smile, and he said with sudden realization:\n\n“*Sō desu ne!*”¹\n\nUnlike Zhou Ze’s arms, which had begun to take on a coppery sheen, the exposed skin on his chest also showed a faint coppery luster, but it was very light and uneven.\n\nAt the same time, the skin in some places had begun to wrinkle and crack, and blood was slowly seeping out, creating a horrifying picture.\n\n“His soul carries a small part of a jiangshi’s legacy, and now, under extreme mental stimulation, the jiangshi part of his soul is manifesting.\n\nBut his body is still that of an ordinary person; it simply can’t bear or inherit this kind of burden, leading to this nondescript situation.\n\nHe is a jiangshi, and yet he is not.”\n\nThe priest spoke to himself, a hint of excitement in his eyes. He slightly opened his hands, hidden beneath his sleeves, and two scalpels appeared in his palms.\n\n“Which part should I cut off to take back and study? Or perhaps… I should take the whole thing back with me?”\n\nLicking his lips, the priest looked somewhat troubled.\n\nThe other party was a Hell Guard. The Lady in Green might not care about his status as a Hell Guard, but he had to. And if he let the Lady in Green kill him completely, then the corpse he brought back would have no research value.\n\n“This is truly vexing.”\n\nThe priest scratched his head, looking very conflicted. But the two scalpels in his hands glinted in the sunlight, instantly drawing the gazes of both the headless woman and Zhou Ze.\n\n“Oh!”\n\nThe priest’s expression froze.\n\nHe immediately dropped the two scalpels on the ground, took a step back,\n\nand bowed slightly.\n\n“My apologies for the interruption,” he said with great sincerity. “Please, continue.”\n\nFor a spectator to get drawn into the battle, only to die an obscure death, was a cardinal sin for spectators.\n\nZhou Ze’s gaze fell upon the headless woman once more. To be honest, the previous Zhou Ze was a real killer… from the back. Now, the blood seeping from his front and his constantly splitting skin truly revealed the terrible state of his body.\n\nRather than calling the current Zhou Ze a jiangshi, it would be more accurate to call him Mr. Zombie A, an extra from a Western zombie movie.\n\nThe only difference was,\n\nZhou Ze’s eyes glowed with a green light.\n\nThis single point made him look a bit more high-class than the extras in Western zombie movies who could be killed with a random axe.\n\nWell, an upgrade from an extra to an extra with fifty-cents’ worth of special effects.\n\n“Ah!”\n\nZhou Ze opened his mouth,\n\nand let out a roar.\n\nIt had none of the earth-shattering volume,\n\nnone of the surging, heroic spirit,\n\nbut was more like the wail of someone with damaged vocal cords.\n\nThe headless woman continued to stand there, motionless.\n\nAnd then,\n\nZhou Ze moved. His movements were exaggerated, like a hundred-meter sprinter, his body lunging with huge strides as he charged directly at the headless woman.\n\nThere was no sound of impact, no dazzling fireworks.\n\nIt was like a drunk man in a drunken frenzy tackling a delicate woman.\n\nThere was no sense of beauty to speak of.\n\n*Crash…*\n\nHaving tackled her to the ground, Zhou Ze pinned the headless woman beneath him and raised his fists, smashing them down.\n\n“Bang!”\n\n“Bang!”\n\n“Bang!”\n\nFist after fist descended,\n\neach one landing on the concrete rooftop.\n\nBloodstains were everywhere,\n\nnot from the Lady in Green, but from Zhou Ze.\n\n“Because in this state, only instinct remains with no room for thought, he’s no longer affected by the Lady in Green’s abilities. Is that it?\n\nAnd because he carries the aura of a jiangshi, he’s able to touch a spiritual body and can actually launch his own attack.”\n\nThe priest opened his mouth and let out an “oh.”\n\n“How did this kind of person become a Hell Guard? Has Hell’s screening process deteriorated to this extent?”\n\nWith each heavy blow, it seemed as if Zhou Ze was just pounding on the concrete slab, but in reality, the Lady in Green’s body was slowly distorting, like the surface of a pond, rippling continuously.\n\nThe surface of the water,\n\nwas no longer calm.\n\n“Looks like the Lady in Green is bound to lose. Although she isn’t classified as a ghost, she doesn’t possess any tangible attack capabilities beyond mental influence.\n\nNow all she can do is take a beating.”\n\nAs he spoke, the priest looked toward the construction site in the distance.\n\n“But it’ll be over soon anyway. Whether she dies by that, or at the hands of the person here, the outcome is the same, isn’t it?”\n\nHowever,\n\njust as he finished gloating,\n\nthe priest’s eyes suddenly turned murky.\n\nThe Lady in Green, pinned beneath Zhou Ze, suddenly flicked her left hand toward the priest.\n\n“I’ve made a mistake. I could have watched from farther away with binoculars, peacefully minding my own business.²\n\nWhy did I have to get so close?\n\nThis time, I’m going to be controlled and used as a hired thug.\n\nWhat rotten luck…”\n\nThe priest lowered his head, then snapped it back up. A green light shone from his eyes. Then, he quickly picked up the scalpels he had just dropped and charged directly at Zhou Ze.\n\n“Swish!\n\nSwish!”\n\nTwo scalpels,\n\nplunged directly into Zhou Ze’s back.\n\n“Ah!”\n\nZhou Ze threw his head back and let out a silent roar.\n\nImmediately after, the priest, holding the scalpels, tried to drag them down along the insertion wounds, but the blades seemed to be caught on Zhou Ze’s bones, unable to move.\n\n“Crack!”\n\nZhou Ze spun around abruptly, his arm sweeping across.\n\nYes,\n\nZhou Ze didn’t know how to fight. He had never studied martial arts, nor had he trained in things like Sanda or Muay Thai. Therefore, in his frenzied state, he could only retaliate based on instinct.\n\nA mosquito is biting me,\n\nso I’ll swat the mosquito.\n\nZhou Ze’s arm slapped directly across the priest’s face.\n\nThe priest’s entire face practically contorted, and his whole body was sent flying backward, landing right on the edge of the rooftop. If he had been just a little bit off, he would have fallen.\n\nThe left side of his face was swollen high. He opened his mouth and spat out several broken teeth,\n\nhis mouth stained with blood.\n\n“Baka!”³\n\nThe priest flicked his hands again, and two paper talismans appeared. These were onmyoji ghost-taming talismans.\n\nWhen he charged at Zhou Ze again, he dodged Zhou Ze’s punch and then slapped both talismans directly onto Zhou Ze’s chest.\n\nFor a moment, the talismans seemed to burst into flames, leaving two scorched marks on Zhou Ze’s chest. The smell of roasting flesh even began to fill the air.\n\nHowever, Zhou Ze simply wrapped his arms around the priest, and holding him tight, slammed him viciously into the rooftop’s parapet wall.\n\n“Bang!”\n\nThe concrete wall cracked, and a large section broke away. The priest spat out a large mouthful of blood.\n\nTwo grown men,\n\non a rooftop,\n\nover a woman,\n\nwere fighting to the death.\n\n…\n\n“Hey, you over there, pay attention! Tear it down now! Get it done before that bunch of old geezers shows up, hurry!”\n\nA construction foreman directed a forklift forward.\n\nAhead was a dilapidated old temple. The deity enshrined within was not some Bodhisattva, nor was it a Daoist figure. In fact, the temple didn’t even have a name plaque.\n\n“Boom!”\n\nThe temple wall was pushed down, and along with it, the statue inside, so damaged that its head had been lost who knows how many years ago, also collapsed.\n\nThe excavator and bulldozer worked in unison, finally razing the temple completely to the ground.\n\n“Hey, what kind of temple was this?”\n\nThe excavator operator got down from his machine. To be honest, this was the kind of situation he feared most during demolitions. Tearing down someone’s temple could damage his spiritual merit, easily bringing misfortune upon himself.\n\nEvery trade, more or less, has similar superstitions.\n\n“A small temple. When I was a kid, people still went to pray there. It’s gone now. My grandpa even took me to pray there once. It was called the Lady in Green, something like the Guanyin Who Grants Sons. People prayed to her for children.”\n\n“Then why’d you have us tear it down?”\n\n“How can the project proceed if we don’t? You have no idea how long the few old folks who used to live here fought with us over this stupid temple. Who still prays to this damn Lady in Green anyway? There are fertility hospitals everywhere. If you can’t have kids, just go see a doctor.\n\nBesides, when I was little, I thought this Lady in Green was some big shot. Later, I grew up and found out there’s no such person in history. Just something passed down from old superstitions and feudal beliefs. You could say we’re eradicating superstition here.”\n\nThe foreman spat a thick wad of phlegm onto the ground and yelled:\n\n“Tell those guys over there to hurry up! I want this whole area torn down before the sun sets!”\n\n…\n\nOn the rooftop,\n\nthe body of the Lady in Green, who had been pinned to the ground by Zhou Ze, slowly began to crumble.\n\nThe priest was right,\n\nshe was not a ghost.\n\nAs the Lady in Green disintegrated,\n\na glimmer of clarity returned to the priest’s eyes. He stood up, clutching his chest, heaven knows how many ribs were broken. When he saw Zhou Ze charging at him again, he was so terrified that he opened the rooftop door and fled into the stairwell without daring to look back.\n\nBut Zhou Ze, halfway through his charge, suddenly faltered. His body swayed precariously, and the green light in his eyes gradually faded.\n\nThe coppery sheen on his body also receded,\n\nleaving only, from top to bottom,\n\na dense network of terrifying wounds.\n\nZhou Ze’s body swayed for a moment, and he finally stumbled to the edge of the rooftop. Unable to control his body,\n\nhe lost his footing,\n\nand fell straight down.\n\nThe back of the building was the garbage disposal area.\n\nBags of household garbage were piled up there like mountains, and many stray cats and dogs foraged for food nearby.\n\n“Thump!”\n\n“Meow meow meow!!!”\n\n“Woof woof woof!!!”\n\nWhen Zhou Ze crashed down here,\n\nthe cats and dogs scattered in a panic.\n\nZhou Ze had already lost most of his consciousness; only his fingers were still twitching instinctively.\n\nTwo bolder stray dogs approached, sniffing at Zhou Ze’s body with their noses.\n\n“Squeak squeak squeak!!!”\n\nJust then, a golden snub-nosed monkey holding a plastic toy hammer hopped up in a few quick steps, waving the plastic hammer to chase the two dogs away.\n\nThen it looked at the man, covered in wounds and with more air going out than coming in.\n\nWhen it saw the man’s face,\n\nthe monkey scratched its head.\n\nFor some reason,\n\nit felt extremely uncomfortable looking at this face.\n\nIt couldn’t remember things from before. It had been living here for a while now, and had even tamed all these stray dogs and cats. Being the king of the garbage heap wasn’t a bad life.\n\nBut this face,\n\nit really ticked the monkey off. It didn’t know where this feeling of annoyance came from, but it was just so annoying!\n\n“Bonk! Bonk! Bonk!”\n\nThe monkey used the plastic toy hammer to hit Zhou Ze on the head several times.\n\n*That’s for looking so annoying to this monkey,*\n\n*That’s for having such an annoying face!*\n\nAfter a few taps,\n\nZhou Ze’s head lolled to the side.\n\nHe had passed out completely.\n\n“Whoa!”\n\nThe monkey was so scared it immediately dropped the plastic toy hammer in its hand.\n\nIt covered its mouth with both hands.\n\nIt was genuinely worried it had just hammered the guy to death.\n\n***\n\n**Footnotes:**\n\n1.  *Sō desu ne* (そうですね): Japanese for \"I see,\" or \"So that's how it is.\"\n2.

    "content": "The small, abandoned work shed barely offered shelter from the sun and rain. The surroundings were a mess, but at least there was no obvious trash. Instead, there were some children's toys, stacked neatly.\n\n  Oh, and there was a person, lying there.\n\n  It was a pity no reporters were passing by at that time. Otherwise, if they could have captured the image of dozens of stray dogs and cats dragging a person along, its publication would absolutely have moved many people to tears.\n\n  The little monkey was kneading a dark, grimy lump of something in its hands. It looked like a clump of mud, but this particular clump of mud appeared very clean.\n\n  Then, it took a little and slowly smeared it onto the wounds of the man beside it.\n\n  The man truly had too many wounds: the two burns on his chest, the puncture wound in his back, and countless gashes all over his body. After the monkey finished applying the mud, nearly half of the man's body was covered in it.\n\n  He looked like a \"Beggar's Chicken\"¹ about to be unearthed.\n\n  The monkey sometimes felt helpless. It really couldn't stand the sight of the man and often felt the urge to strangle him. But after struggling with this frustration each time, it could only subconsciously find ways to keep him alive, to prevent him from dying so senselessly in front of it.\n\n  He really should have been dead. With injuries this severe—even though his final fall from the rooftop had landed in a trash heap, which absorbed most of the force—his original wounds were enough to kill an ordinary person several times over.\n\n  But he didn't die. Sometimes, the monkey would press its ear to the man's chest and hear a strong, powerful heartbeat.\n\n  Judging by the heartbeat, he seemed quite healthy, not weak at all. But looking at him as a whole, the fact that he even had a heartbeat was a miracle.\n\n  It was as if his heart was a separate part, detached from the rest of his body.\n\n  Even as the other organs of his body were failing, his heart continued to beat merrily on, doing as it pleased.\n\n  And so, seven days passed. For all seven days, the man remained unconscious and did not wake. The monkey tried feeding him some mashed-up food.\n\n  The food was all brought by the stray dogs and cats as offerings to it. The monkey mashed it up and fed it to the man, but each time, the unconscious man would quickly spit it out.\n\n  This infuriated the monkey. It gave him the cleanest, most delicious food—its own rations—and he had the nerve to spit it out!\n\n  The monkey felt its lifestyle was a bit low-class. Look, the food it considered fantastic, this man instinctively refused to eat even while unconscious.\n\n  He's looking down on This Great One!²\n\n  In a fit of pique, the monkey found a half-empty jar of \"Lao Gan Ma\" chili sauce in the shed and fed it straight to him. The monkey had tried it once before, and it was so spicy it had it jumping up and down.\n\n  To the monkey's surprise, the guy actually swallowed it. The monkey then fetched some more food, mashed it up, and fed it to him again. He ate that, too.\n\n  The monkey was stunned.\n\n  What the hell kind of extreme palate did this guy have!\n\n  Finally, on the eighth day, Zhou Ze's eyelids began to tremble slightly. He slowly opened his eyes, somewhat baffled as to where he was. It wasn't a hospital, nor was it the bookstore.\n\n  It looked more like a homeless person's simple shelter.\n\n  At the same time, a furry tail was waving back and forth in front of him.\n\n  A little sister's face was right in front of him.\n\n  Oh no,\n\n  a bright red apple was right in front of him.\n\n  That didn't seem right either.\n\n  Finally,\n\n  Zhou Ze saw it clearly.\n\n  It was a monkey's bu...tt, pointed right at him.\n\n  The monkey was kneading mud in its hands and applying it to his wounds. Zhou Ze could even smell the raw, earthy scent of the mud. He grew anxious, wanting to speak up and warn the monkey that this might cause his wounds to get infected and fester, but when he opened his mouth, Zhou Ze could only manage a guttural \"Egh... egh...\"\n\n  His lips were dry and chapped, and his throat was extremely sore. He couldn't make a sound.\n\n  The monkey was startled. It finally turned its \"little sister's face\" away, presenting its own face to Zhou Ze.\n\n  Man and monkey began to stare at each other.\n\n  The monkey suddenly scratched its ears and cheeks. *This guy's awake, but he looks even more punchable with his eyes open!*\n\n  Zhou Ze, for his part, found it all a bit absurd. He had somewhat forgotten the memories from that day on the rooftop, only recalling that he had a good, satisfying fight.\n\n  It felt like he had been fighting a woman, and also a Japanese man. In any case, the fight was a blur, and the ending was a blur too.\n\n  The feeling was like that of a heavy drinker waking up the next day, with fragmented memories of the night before.\n\n  If he couldn't speak, he wouldn't speak. If he couldn't move, he wouldn't move. If there was a monkey by his side, so be it.\n\n  His life as a bookstore owner since being reincarnated in another's body had successfully transformed the once-diligent Dr. Zhou, who had been single-mindedly focused on climbing the ladder, into a handsome man who knew how to be at peace with his circumstances.\n\n  Like an eighty or ninety-year-old, he had learned to let go of what needed letting go. And Zhou Ze, after all, had already died once.\n\n  As was its routine, the monkey applied mud to his wounds every day. Every day, it would feed him Lao Gan Ma, followed by spicy snack strips, Wang Zai Little Mantou, half a chicken leg, and other such foods.\n\n  Then, after taking care of him each day, it would stand before him, take out a plastic toy hammer, and repeatedly tap its own head, looking very displeased.\n\n  Zhou Ze thought the monkey seemed a bit mentally unstable.\n\n  However, this monkey was genuinely smart, not like an ordinary monkey. It could even understand the meaning in your gaze. But for most of the day, after it was done tending to Zhou Ze, it was unwilling to linger by his side for long.\n\n  It would often stick its bu...tt out, aiming its \"little sister's face\" at Zhou Ze, and then stare blankly at the sun or moon, lost in thought.\n\n  This was a monkey with a past, one that even knew how to contemplate life.\n\n  In the first few days after waking up, Zhou Ze didn't find anything particularly unusual. But after four or five days, something occurred to him.\n\n  The Great Sage, Equal to Heaven, being born from a stone was already an extraordinary event.\n\n  For a small city like Tongcheng to have such \"human-like\" monkeys appearing one after another was highly unlikely.\n\n  And he himself seemed to have just met a monkey a few days ago,\n\n  and then,\n\n  he had killed that monkey.\n\n  That incident had ultimately led to a very fucked-up situation where an old codger claiming to be his servant had treated him to a meal and then served up his own conscience as a dish.\n\n  But that monkey—he had definitely killed it. Even though he hadn't been able to find its soul in the end, it should still have lost its physical body.\n\n  One evening, the monkey returned from an outing, holding a rolled-up newspaper. It unrolled the paper, revealing a youtiao³ inside.\n\n  Zhou Ze could now just about swallow on his own. The monkey tore off a piece of the youtiao, dipped it in Lao Gan Ma, and fed a bite to Zhou Ze.\n\n  The man and the monkey had, over this time, developed a certain tacit understanding.\n\n  Halfway through the youtiao, the monkey suddenly froze. It was staring at the newspaper.\n\n  Zhou Ze was surprised. He knew the monkey was smart, but he hadn't expected it to be smart enough to read a newspaper.\n\n  It was like having a pet dog. You'd think it was smart if it could relieve itself in a designated spot and follow your commands to sit and lie down. But if one day you saw your dog sitting on the toilet and then flushing afterward,\n\n  you wouldn't think it was smart; you'd think it was terrifying.\n\n  Fortunately,\n\n  the monkey wasn't actually reading the words.\n\n  It was looking at the cover photo of the newspaper.\n\n  \"Three-Legged Boy's Surgery a Success.\"\n\n  The monkey stared at the picture,\n\n  stunned for a long time.\n\n  Like a person, it sighed, then reached up and wiped its eyes.\n\n  Zhou Ze watched the monkey. At this moment, he felt no fear. Yes, this monkey was the one he had killed. He was certain of it now.\n\n  And right now, this monkey was repaying cruelty with kindness.\n\n  It had saved him. Though he didn't know what was in that mud, it had at least kept his injuries in check.\n\n  Back then, the monkey's spiritual cultivation had been ruined because the lumberjack it saved had captured it, eaten its brain, and consumed its flesh. But it seemed that even if this monkey had lost some of its previous memories, its fundamental nature remained the same.\n\n  The monkey looked melancholic. It then finished sharing the rest of the youtiao with Zhou Ze. The monkey found a rope and tied one end around Zhou Ze's neck.\n\n  Zhou Ze didn't react, letting the monkey do as it pleased until the rope was looped around his neck. The monkey then sat down on the edge of Zhou Ze's makeshift bed.\n\n  It looked at Zhou Ze, and Zhou Ze looked back at it.\n\n  There was a glint of tears in the monkey's eyes, along with anger, hatred, and resentment.\n\n  Just as Zhou Ze had recognized it, it seemed the monkey had now recognized Zhou Ze.\n\n  As for the grudges between them, it was impossible to say who was right and who was wrong. But if either side wanted to bring things to a close, it would seem perfectly reasonable.\n\n  The monkey slowly tightened the rope. It could easily strangle Zhou Ze right now, just as Zhou Ze had killed it in the hospital by piercing its body with his fingernails.\n\n  Zhou Ze lay there, looking completely defenseless.\n\n  Just then, a few stray dogs appeared outside the shed. The animals' instincts told them there might be a big meal soon.\n\n  At their level of intelligence, they naturally didn't understand why their Monkey Bro would save this person only to kill him later. They probably figured you had to fatten a person up before the meat would taste good, right?\n\n  But the monkey suddenly whirled around and bared its teeth at the dogs outside.\n\n  The terrified dogs fled in disarray.\n\n  The monkey looked dejectedly back at Zhou Ze, then reached out and untied the rope from his neck.\n\n  *Smack!*\n\n  The monkey slapped itself across the face—a loud, resounding slap.\n\n  Then it jumped off the bed, rummaged through the trash pile, and found a phone with a cracked screen. It then hopped back in front of Zhou Ze.\n\n  The phone was on. It was something the monkey had brought back yesterday, and Zhou Ze could see a signal indicator on the cracked screen, which meant it had a working SIM card inside.\n\n  The monkey knew what a phone was. It pointed its claw at the keypad, gesturing for Zhou Ze to show it which buttons to press.\n\n  Zhou Ze reached out his hand and took the phone from the monkey.\n\n  The monkey was stunned by the motion of Zhou Ze's hand. It hadn't expected him to be able to move already.\n\n  If his hand could move, then so could his fingernails.\n\n  A moment later,\n\n  Zhou Ze smiled.\n\n  Then the monkey once again picked up its plastic toy hammer.\n\n  This time, it was aimed at Zhou Ze's head:\n\n  \"Bonk, bonk, bonk!!!\"\n\n  That's for pretending!\n\n  That's for pretending!\n\n  That's for pretending!\n\n  After a bit of bonking,\n\n  the monkey dropped the plastic toy hammer,\n\n  sat there,\n\n  and smiled too.\n***\n¹ A Chinese dish where a whole chicken is stuffed, wrapped in leaves and mud/clay, and baked.\n² The original is `本大爺` (běn dàyé), a very arrogant and colloquial way of referring to oneself, akin to \"This Lord\" or \"Your Granddaddy.\" It implies a self-important, tough-guy persona.\n³ A long, deep-fried strip of dough, commonly eaten for breakfast in China.",

    "content": "Holding the phone, Zhou Ze managed to sit up, leaning against the plank wall. The truth was, he could already move a little. He probably couldn't get out of bed and walk around, but in other respects, he really wasn't as weak as he had first appeared.\n\nHe reached out and pointed to a spot under the bed.\n\nThe little monkey turned its head to look and saw a half-full, opened box of Little Su brand cigarettes.\n\nIt hopped down, picked up the cigarettes, and handed them to Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze then mimed the action of using a lighter.\n\nThe little monkey froze for a moment, looking mortified and furious. It wished it could pull out its great staff and smack Zhou Ze with it!\n\n\"Haven't had a smoke in a long time. I'm craving one.\"\n\nThe little monkey hopped off the bed again, rummaged through a pile of junk, and actually managed to find a lighter, which it tossed over.\n\nHe lit the cigarette, took a drag, and blew out a smoke ring. Although his body was still weak, like a canvas covered in countless patches that could fall apart at any moment, this first cigarette in over ten days still gave Zhou Ze a sense of contentment.\n\nHe was deliberately pretending he couldn't move. As for the reason, Zhou Ze couldn't quite say.\n\nGuilt?\n\nA sense of debt?\n\nMaybe, maybe not. Even now, Zhou Ze didn't feel he had made the wrong choice back then.\n\nBut for now, at least, this monkey had indeed saved his life. He owed it a great deal.\n\nHolding his phone, Zhou Ze thought for a moment and realized he didn't remember the numbers for Bai Yingying or Xu Qinglang. It wasn't like the old days when you'd go to a convenience store to use a public phone; very few people bother memorizing phone numbers anymore, simply saving them in their contacts.\n\nWith no other choice, Zhou Ze could only dial \"110.\"\n\nXu Qinglang and the others had indeed filed a missing person report. Zhou Ze told the operator that he was fine and asked them to help contact the person who filed the report to come pick him up, so as not to trouble the police officers.\n\nAbout half an hour later, Xu Qinglang pulled up in a Nissan, with Bai Yingying also in the car.\n\nHolding his nose as he walked into the shack, Xu Qinglang's eyes immediately stung with tears upon seeing Zhou Ze on the bed, but he quickly reined it in.\n\nPerhaps,\n\nthe cruelest thing in this world,\n\nis saying you'll go home to cook,\n\nbut the one you're cooking for never comes back to eat.\n\nBai Yingying lifted Zhou Ze off the bed. She was incredibly strong; carrying him was like child's play for her.\n\nZhou Ze said to Xu Qinglang, who was standing to one side, \"Bring the monkey, too.\"\n\nThe little monkey sat squatting by the bed, watching Zhou Ze being carried away. In its hand, it held its little plastic hammer,\n\nwaving it,\n\nas if saying goodbye.\n\nHowever, when Xu Qinglang approached it, the little monkey leaped onto the plank wall. It clearly didn't want to go.\n\nBeing the local warlord here, with an army of cat soldiers and dog generals under its command and so many underlings bringing it tributes every day—life was good. It had no intention of leaving.\n\nBesides, it still found this guy it had rescued a bit of an eyesore.\n\nXu Qinglang looked at Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze repeated, \"Take it.\"\n\nNo room for discussion.\n\nThe pet I've taken a liking to,\n\nmust be taken.\n\nXu Qinglang tried to catch the monkey, but it was too nimble for him.\n\nBai Yingying put Zhou Ze in the car, then dashed over in a flash. The monkey hadn't expected the woman to be so fast, and it was a step too slow in its jump, getting grabbed right by the tail.\n\n\"Squeak squeak squeak!!!\"\n\nThe monkey bared its fangs at Bai Yingying, its face a mask of fury!\n\n*You damn woman, how dare you grab me!*\n\n\"Roar!\"\n\nBai Yingying opened her mouth wide at the monkey, revealing her zombie fangs.\n\nThe sight of the green-tinged face and sharp fangs,\n\nstunned the monkey into a stupor.\n\n*Keep acting up,*\n\n*and believe me, this lady will eat you!*\n\n\"Be good and come with Aunty.\"\n\nOne hand supporting the monkey's buttocks and the other holding its tail, Bai Yingying put it in the car, then closed the doors and windows.\n\nZhou Ze sat on the back seat, half-reclining.\n\nThe monkey sat right next to Zhou Ze,\n\nits arms crossed, clearly sulking.\n\nIt felt that it had saved Zhou Ze, only for Zhou Ze to turn around and rob it of its freedom. This was not cool!\n\n*I treated you like a patient, and you want to lock me in a room and 'discipline' me!*\n\n\"I'm taking you with me because I'm afraid you'll get hurt by someone else while trying to save them again,\" Zhou Ze explained weakly. \"Let's consider the grievances from our past life settled. In this life, I owe you first. Stay with me for a while. If you still want to leave later, you can go.\"\n\nThe monkey, whether it understood or not, did quiet down a bit.\n\nXu Qinglang tossed a pack of cookies over. The monkey caught it, tore open the package itself, and ate with its hands, not forgetting to pop one into Zhou Ze's mouth.\n\nThe man and monkey had developed this kind of daily rapport.\n\n\"Well, well, looks like I worried for nothing. You two seem to have been living quite the cozy life lately,\" Xu Qinglang teased while driving.\n\n\"Are you jealous of a monkey?\" Bai Yingying suddenly interjected.\n\nXu Qinglang was choked off and fell silent.\n\nThe bookstore hadn't been moved yet. With the boss suddenly disappearing for half a month, who had the heart to relocate? So Xu Qinglang drove back to the old place.\n\nGetting out of the car,\n\nit was once again Bai Yingying who carried Zhou Ze into the bookstore. Zhou Ze just went with the flow. Given the choice between Xu Qinglang and Bai Yingying,\n\nZhou Ze felt that being carried by Bai Yingying was more acceptable.\n\nThe monkey didn't run away, but followed closely behind them into the bookstore.\n\n\"You're back?\"\n\nThe Old Daoist was cleaning the bookstore. Seeing Zhou Ze, he immediately came over to lay on the flattery, saying,\n\n\"Fortune favors the blessed.\"\n\nThen, the Old Daoist saw the monkey behind them and broke into a grin. \"And you brought a pet back?\"\n\nWith that,\n\nthe Old Daoist struck a Monkey King pose and shouted:\n\n\"What use have I for this iron staff!\"\n\nUnexpectedly, the little monkey played along, striking a pose of scratching its ears and cheeks, pointing one finger at the Old Daoist while scratching with the other hand.\n\n\"Heh, this monkey's smart. Just like me.\"\n\nAfter saying it, the Old Daoist felt something wasn't quite right about his statement.\n\nJust as they entered the shop, a woman walked down from the staircase.\n\nThe first thing to appear was a pair of nude-colored stockings, then long, slender legs, an exquisite high school girl's uniform, and finally, a cascade of hair over her shoulders.\n\nTang Shi had mostly recovered and was able to walk again.\n\nWomen all love beauty. The first thing she did after regaining her mobility was to dress herself up.\n\nOn this point, Zhou Ze felt Bai Yingying was much simpler. That silly big girl, aside from her love of video games, didn't pay much attention to her appearance.\n\n\"If you hadn't come back soon, we would have all had to leave,\" Tang Shi said with a smile. \"When the dog's not around, the scent of the kennel fades, and we can't hide anymore.\"\n\n\"I just got back, can't you say something nice?\" Zhou Ze was truly at a loss for words with this woman.\n\n\"Alright, I'll say something nice. The owner of the noodle shop next door told me everything about what happened that day. Do you have any idea what you provoked?\"\n\n\"Something called the Azure Robe Lady, I think,\" Zhou Ze replied.\n\n\"A temple goddess. A temple goddess who was about to be completely overthrown. And you took the initiative to provoke her. Didn't you know her time was almost up, and that she knew it too?\"\n\n\"She was killing people.\"\n\n\"And do you know who she was killing?\"\n\nZhou Ze glanced at the monkey, still roughhousing with the Old Daoist, shook his head, and said,\n\n\"I have no interest in knowing.\"\n\nTang Shi walked up to Zhou Ze, then covered her nose in disgust.\n\n\"You stink.\"\n\n\"That's why they call us stinky men.\"\n\n\"Were you always such a smooth talker?\" Tang Shi didn't get angry.\n\n\"You were lying up there like a mummy before. Who would've been interested in being a smooth talker with you?\" Zhou Ze pointed to the bathroom and said to Bai Yingying, \"Help me take a bath.\"\n\nBai Yingying froze for a second,\n\nbut the silly big girl immediately said, \"Oh, okay.\"\n\nIn his current state, it was impossible for Zhou Ze to bathe himself, but he was covered in layers of mud and felt disgusting.\n\nHave Xu Qinglang help him?\n\nThe mere thought was unbearable.\n\nHave the Old Daoist help him?\n\nHe could just imagine the old man scrubbing his back while belting out some high-pitched folk song, and picturing the Old Daoist's rib-thin body... there was no appeal in that.\n\nAs for Tang Shi, forget it. Asking her for help would probably end with her sending a pen flying with a *swoosh* to give him a quick, clean death.\n\nThat only left the simple and kind-hearted Bai Yingying.\n\nInside the bathroom, Zhou Ze sat on a stool while Bai Yingying helped him take off his clothes. She didn't take off her own, so the scene wasn't as titillating as one might imagine.\n\nHolding the showerhead, she slowly rinsed the mud from Zhou Ze's body. Looking at the scars that covered his entire body, Bai Yingying was so shocked her jaw dropped. She asked,\n\n\"Boss, these injuries are terrifying! That Azure Robe Lady is a real piece of work. I heard her temple was torn down. Serves her right.\"\n\n\"She didn't do it,\" Zhou Ze said. \"Actually, most of these injuries... I did to myself.\"\n\nIt was difficult for Zhou Ze to comprehend that state, and he didn't even know if he could actively enter it again. However, he was certain that if he were to repeat what happened on that rooftop, he would once again end up covered in wounds.\n\nThis body of his, to be frank, was a bit too weak.\n\nBai Yingying began to lather up the shower gel, her hands roaming over Zhou Ze's body.\n\nUnconsciously, a look of intoxication appeared on her face. At the same time, she said,\n\n\"Boss, I don't know why, but when I touch your body, I really like this feeling. It's a very intimate feeling.\"\n\nAs a zombie, Bai Yingying could sense a kindred spirit in Zhou Ze. And although this kindred spirit seemed very weak, the difference in their 'grade' or rank was so vast that it created a pressure, giving her a primal urge to submit.\n\nBai Yingying had already felt this when she was carrying him earlier.\n\n\"Just wash me properly. Don't mess around,\" Zhou Ze reminded her.\n\nJust then, Xu Qinglang coughed from outside the bathroom.\n\nBai Yingying's body stiffened for a moment. Then, her fingertips began to rapidly rub back and forth over the two raised nodules on Zhou Ze's chest.\n\n\"What are you doing?\"\n\n\"Beauty Xu and I made a bet. We want to see if the boss can still get hard.\"\n\nWith that,\n\nBai Yingying even lowered her head,\n\ndeliberately looking down.\n\nThen she suddenly gasped, her mouth wide open in an exclamation:\n\n\"Boss, you're actually...\"",

    "content": "After his bath, Zhou Ze, wearing a white shirt and casual pants, was carried out by Bai Yingying and placed on a straw mat on the second floor. When Bai Yingying came back downstairs, Xu Qinglang immediately sidled up to her and asked:\n\n“So, what's the situation?”\n\nHe was being secretive, cautious. The feeling was rather like the nerve-wracking tension of running an underground casino, as if the police would burst in to bust them at any moment.\n\nBai Yingying looked like she wanted to speak but stopped herself, her face flushed red.\n\nXu Qinglang frowned.\n\n*You're a damn jiangshi, what the hell are you blushing for?*\n\n“So how was it, really?” Xu Qinglang pressed, desperate to know the answer.\n\n“Uh…” Bai Yingying said.\n\n“Spit it out, did he get hard or not?” Xu Qinglang demanded.\n\n“Well…” said Bai Yingying.\n\n“Don't tell me he's got a slit down there?”\n\n“Uh…” said Bai Yingying.\n\n“Or is his not even as big as yours when you take it out?”\n\n“Wha…” said Bai Yingying.\n\n“Hey, stop beating around the bush. Do you want the latest graphics card or not?”\n\n“The Boss said that after the store moves, he’ll get me a new desktop with the latest, highest specs,” Bai Yingying said bashfully.\n\n“You’ve been bought?” Xu Qinglang’s face fell.\n\n“Yep,” Bai Yingying answered honestly.\n\n“That’s not right. At most, he only has a little over ten thousand on him. He still has moving and renovation costs, and I’m covering the rent for now. He doesn’t have that kind of money.”\n\n“The Boss asked me for two jade hairpins, pawned them for five hundred thousand, and said he’d pay me back seven hundred fifty thousand in half a year.”\n\n“He talked you into pawning your burial artifacts?” Xu Qinglang looked at her as if she were an idiot. “Are you stupid or something?!¹ Those were your grave goods.”\n\n“The Boss said he’d get them back for me,” Bai Yingying mumbled.\n\n“You believe anything he says. If he told you he was your jiangshi ancestor, would you believe that too?”\n\n“I would,” Bai Yingying said in a small voice.\n\nBecause she really had felt the aura of a jiangshi on the Boss.\n\n“You’re a lost cause, you silly girl.” Xu Qinglang looked at her with profound disappointment. “By the way, let me ask you something. Do you have any sisters?”\n\n“Huh?”\n\n“I want to find a female jiangshi to be my maid, too. A business venture with a massive payoff, eh?”\n\n“Oh.”\n\nBai Yingying stood up straight.\n\nA frigid aura suddenly emanated from her.\n\nThe silly girl instantly transformed into an ice queen.\n\nXu Qinglang, who was still wallowing in self-pity, suddenly shuddered.\n\nThat familiar, terrifying chill from their first meeting washed over him again. Almost subconsciously, Xu Qinglang turned back into a timid little quail.\n\n“Who did you say,” the female corpse asked, “you were going to take as a maid?”\n\n“Nothing. I said I’m going to buy you a new graphics card this afternoon and install it, so you can play on the highest graphics settings when you play *PUBG*.”\n\n***\n\n“Here, this is the file on the Green-Clad Goddess.”\n\nTang Shi handed a tablet to Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze’s hair was still damp. Leaning against the wall on the straw mat, he looked like one of those broodingly handsome guys from college, fresh out of the shower after a game of basketball.\n\nXu Le had all sorts of flaws and was a good-for-nothing in many ways, but one couldn’t deny that he was indeed very handsome; otherwise, the Lin family’s parents would never have chosen him to be their live-in son-in-law.\n\n“So people pray to her for children?” Zhou Ze asked after glancing at the file on the Green-Clad Goddess.\n\nThe Green-Clad Goddess was a deity of a small, local temple in Tongcheng. She doesn’t appear in any historical records, nor does she have a place in mainstream mythology. Even within Tongcheng, she wasn’t exactly a household name.\n\nHer legend was not widespread, and most of the stories about her were just fabrications by later generations.\n\nIt was much like how many attractions at Slender West Lake in Yangzhou are linked to the Qianlong Emperor’s tours of the south, as if the emperor had done nothing else during his travels but run around having various adventures at the lake just so these spots could be named after them.\n\nThe story of the Green-Clad Goddess was also rather nonsensical. In Tongcheng, there is a town called Lüsi, which, according to legend, was named because the immortal Lü Dongbin had visited it four times. This Green-Clad Goddess was supposedly a widow Lü Dongbin encountered during one of his visits to Tongcheng.\n\nThe widow was childless and never remarried, remaining chaste in honor of her deceased husband. She loved children and was kind-hearted, so she took in many orphans, essentially running an ancient orphanage and nursery. When Lü Dongbin found out about her, he gave her a long, green robe as a gesture of encouragement.\n\nAfter she died, the local people built a temple to commemorate her good deeds, calling her the Green-Clad Goddess.\n\nMost people who came to burn incense at this temple were praying for children to continue their family line, similar in function to the Child-Bestowing Guanyin.\n\nHowever, the file noted at the bottom that due to the redevelopment of the old city district, the Green-Clad Goddess’s temple had been torn down. Rebuilding it would be difficult; for one, she wasn’t as famous as Mazu, and for another, getting approval to build a new temple is genuinely hard. The developers certainly weren’t going to create extra obstacles for themselves. Despite objections from some local elders, the temple was ultimately demolished.\n\nThe file included a photo from a few years prior, showing the temple already in severe disrepair. The head of her statue had fallen off at some unknown point, leaving only a headless sculpture standing there.\n\nThis certainly fit the image of that headless woman.\n\n“A so-called temple deity is a spiritual embryo shaped by faith and incense offerings,” Tang Shi explained. “Just like the faceless woman who came to test you—she was an embodiment of the grievances of the dead on the Road to the Yellow Springs.”\n\n“So she knew her temple was about to be demolished and that she herself would soon disappear, so she came out to kill people and vent her anger?” Zhou Ze asked.\n\n“Temple gods operate by their own code of conduct. Even in a final, crazed state, they wouldn't act without a specific purpose.”\n\n“I know about that. I looked it up,” Xu Qinglang said, coming up the stairs. “The girl whose head was cut off by the ceiling fan—she’d had three abortions. The Green-Clad Goddess was intentionally meting out a final punishment according to her own code of conduct.”\n\n“Punishment?” Zhou Ze retorted. “Who gave her the authority to do that?”\n\nXu Qinglang shrugged. “Everyone’s perspective is different, so their stance is naturally different too. In her eyes, a child is a life. To have an irresponsible abortion for no good reason is, in itself, a blasphemy against life.”\n\n“So, if I hadn’t happened to run into her, she would have continued to find more people of that sort and arrange for their 'accidental' deaths?” Zhou Ze asked.\n\n“That seems to be the case.” Tang Shi nodded. “She’s already gone mad, become obsessed. Anyone, when pushed to the end of their rope, is bound to become crazed—even a temple god.”\n\n“I’ve been wondering about something,” Xu Qinglang said. “Why did she only kill the woman? Hey, Old Zhou, do you remember the girl’s boyfriend from the noodle shop? How come nothing happened to him? Don’t tell me the Green-Clad Goddess is sexist and favors men, too?”\n\n“That’s why the student boyfriend is the most pitiful one,” Zhou Ze supplied the answer.\n\nXu Qinglang froze for a moment, then a look of dawning comprehension spread across his face. “When will my thinking ever be as sharp as yours?”\n\n“In any case, maybe you could be a little less impulsive next time,” Tang Shi advised. “Desperate beings, especially a temple god like this one—don’t get involved with them again. Whatever she does, she has her past merits to offset the karma. It’s not a dereliction of your duty.”\n\n“It’s not a question of whether I want to get involved. I just happened to run into the situation, so…”\n\nAfter a moment’s thought, Zhou Ze recalled the monkey from before and suddenly lost all interest in explaining himself. He just waved a hand dismissively. “Forget it. Let’s not talk about it.”\n\nBut Tang Shi gave a captivating smile. “I originally thought you were different from him,” she said. “Now I’m suddenly realizing that, in essence, the two of you are the same.”\n\n“I have no desire to walk his path. By the way, are your injuries healed?”\n\n“They’re mostly healed.”\n\n“Then what are you still doing here? Aren’t you going to help that friend of yours? I can book a flight to Rongcheng for you.”\n\n“Whether I go or not is meaningless now. The outcome won’t change just because I’m there. Besides, I believe he’ll be able to come back.”\n\nJust then, Xu Qinglang, who was about to leave, suddenly remembered something. “Oh, right, everything with the new shop is sorted out. You can move in whenever you’re ready.”\n\n“Let’s wait until I’ve recovered a bit more,” Zhou Ze said. He had no desire to run the shop from a wheelchair.\n\n“Alright, then. You just focus on recovering. And be careful not to get wet.”\n\nXu Qinglang went downstairs.\n\nTang Shi was still standing there. With a flick of her finger, a White Rabbit creamy candy unwrapped itself and flew into her mouth.\n\nChewing, she asked Zhou Ze, “It seems like something about you has changed.”\n\n“Maybe so.”\n\n“But I must remind you to take good care of this body. For those of us who have returned from Hell, we only get one chance to choose a body. If this one is destroyed, you’ll become a lonely, wandering ghost.”\n\n“No exceptions?” Zhou Ze frowned. He wasn’t particularly fond of this body. Though he’d grown used to it, there were still certain… unspeakable complications.\n\nEspecially when he was with Doctor Lin.\n\nTang Shi thought for a moment. “That one seems to have the ability to change bodies, but he’s a special case. For the rest of us, we only get one single chance.”\n\n“You seem to be in a good mood today.” Zhou Ze noticed Tang Shi was being more talkative than usual.\n\nZhou Ze wasn’t narcissistic enough to think she was talkative because she was overjoyed by his safe return.\n\n“He sent a message. There will be a result at the end of the month.”\n\n“Oh, so the Wife-Waiting Stone² finally got a message and is overjoyed.”\n\nZhou Ze stretched lazily. “I hope he has a major power-up,³ kills all those ghost bailiffs and faceless women, and even self-destructs to take them all down with him. That way, I can go back to living my own peaceful little life.”\n\nThe little loli and the faceless woman were a Sword of Damocles hanging over his head.\n\n“Once things over there are settled, he might come here as well. Who knows, you two might even become neighbors.”\n\n*Heh. Women.*\n\nTo be honest, Zhou Ze didn’t have much confidence that *that one* would make it back from Rongcheng safely. But he also knew that the woman before him was already deaf to any rational arguments.\n\nZhou Ze could only play along. “Oh, that’d be great. We could even form a team. Marvel has *The Avengers*, right? We could have our own thing. The *League of Hell’s Visitors*? Or the *Helliengers*?”\n\n“Too obviously a copycat. It’s tacky.” Tang Shi was clearly unimpressed.\n\n“Heh. You suggest one, then.”\n\n“How about *The League of Anorexics*?”\n***\n**Footnotes:**\n¹ \"Are you stupid or something?!\" is a translation of \"你484傻啊\". \"484\" is Chinese internet slang for the phrase \"是不是\" (shì bú shì), which sounds similar and means \"are you or are you not.\"\n² The \"Wife-Waiting Stone\" (望夫石) is a reference to a Chinese legend about a wife who waited for her husband's return for so long that she turned into a rock.\n³ \"Major power-up\" is a translation of \"小宇宙爆發\", a reference to the anime *Saint Seiya*, where characters \"explode their Cosmo\" to unleash their full power.

    "content": "A week later, both Xu Qinglang's noodle shop and Zhou Ze's bookstore were scheduled to move tomorrow. Nevertheless, Xu Qinglang opened the noodle shop tonight, saying he planned to do one last day of business here.\n\nIt's hard to leave one's homeland. This noodle shop had held a long period of Xu Qinglang's life, and even the last moments he had spent with his parents.\n\nIf not for the little loli's intervention, perhaps Xu Qinglang could still be \"dining\" with his parents every night, enjoying the warmth of having his family together.\n\nZhou Ze's bookstore, on the other hand, was already closed. All the books inside had been packed into boxes, just waiting for the truck to come and haul them away tomorrow.\n\nWith Bai Yingying as a source of labor as strong as an ox, plus Tang Shi the \"object controller,\" the packing had been remarkably efficient. Boss Zhou, whose injuries were mostly but not completely healed, only needed to sit in the noodle shop next door with a teapot, sipping tea, looking for all the world like an old-society landlord.\n\nThe old Taoist and the monkey were playing in the deserted shopping mall out back. The monkey was very close to the old Taoist, and the man and monkey were able to play together just fine.\n\nThere was no forest here, but the empty commercial center behind them was more than enough room for the monkey to gallop and frolic to its heart's content.\n\nSipping his tea, he watched the sun slowly set outside. Xu Qinglang sat there, looking at his phone. There was no discernible sadness, but of course, not much joy either.\n\nFortunately, at that moment, a customer finally arrived.\n\nThis was the first customer of the day.\n\nAnd not surprisingly,\n\nhe would also be the last.\n\nAfter the incident where Zhou Ze told a taxi driver to take him somewhere \"unclean\" and the driver brought him here, what little human presence the place had left completely dried up.\n\nPeople who used to pass by on their way to or from work now chose to take a detour.\n\nThis was also why Zhou Ze had decided to move.\n\nThe newcomer wore a suit, but his hair was disheveled and the suit itself was a bit dirty. He didn't look like an office worker, more like an unemployed vagrant, but the suit itself was clearly expensive.\n\n\"What'll you have?\" Xu Qinglang asked, getting up.\n\n\"Whip up a few of your specialty dishes. And a bottle of Snow Beer, ice-cold.\"\n\n\"Alright.\"\n\nXu Qinglang brought him the beer first, then went to the kitchen to stir-fry the dishes.\n\nThe man sat down opposite Zhou Ze, with an aisle between them.\n\nThe man glanced around the noodle shop and said:\n\n\"Moving, are we?\"\n\n\"You can tell?\" Zhou Ze was a little surprised.\n\n\"Of course I can. It's just been cleaned. Who'd have the energy to clean so meticulously in a godforsaken place like this? It's obvious you're getting ready to leave.\"\n\nThe man took out a cigarette, lit it, and then flicked the ash directly onto the table.\n\nA moment later, Xu Qinglang brought out the first plate. The man looked at the dish, shook his head, and said:\n\n\"Boss, your cooking really isn't as good-looking as you are.\"\n\n\"Just eat your food,\" Xu Qinglang replied coolly.\n\nA man with over twenty properties to his name does business with exactly this kind of attitude.\n\nThe man picked up his chopsticks, took a bite, then spat it out. \"This dish was made without any heart. It's not authentic.\"\n\nXu Qinglang had already gone back to the kitchen to cook the next dish, so he didn't hear the man's muttering.\n\n\"I think his cooking is pretty good,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"'Pretty good?'\" The man lightly tapped the table. \"Dabbling in cooking, making a meal as a hobby—you call that 'pretty good'?\"\n\nWith that, the man bit the beer cap off with his teeth, took a long swig, and said, \"I can taste it. Obvious you're not short on cash, just one of those types who cooks to 'experience life.' There's no sincerity in this food at all.\"\n\n\"It's hard to find any restaurant with sincerity these days.\"\n\n\"Hey now, what's the deal with you two? I say his food sucks, and suddenly you're coming after me?\"\n\nThe man pointed at Zhou Ze, then gestured towards the kitchen and gave a silent laugh.\n\n\"Oho, something's fishy here. Definitely fishy.\"\n\nZhou Ze couldn't be bothered with this guy. The only reason he'd spoken to him in the first place was because he seemed a bit familiar, as if he'd seen him somewhere before.\n\nOf course, that would have been in his past life.\n\n\"Disgusted? You think I'm a disgusting person, don't you? Well, disgusting people live more comfortable lives. I'd say your life definitely isn't all that comfortable. You sit there with your teapot looking all cultured and disciplined, but you're just another meddler. Let me tell you, as long as a person likes to meddle, their life will never be comfortable.\"\n\nThe man took another drink of beer and looked at Zhou Ze with a smile.\n\n\"Right, the bookstore next door, that must be yours, right? Closing down too?\" The man pointed next door. \"When I came over, I saw everything inside the glass door was all packed up.\"\n\n\"That's right, we're moving.\"\n\n\"Have you sued?\" the man asked, squinting.\n\n\"Sue for what?\"\n\n\"Sue the developers here! Sue the management company! I heard there's been one incident after another here. It's clearly the management's negligence!\n\nA fire at the movie theater,\n\nthen people jumping off buildings to commit suicide.\n\nThat's what's made it impossible for you to do business. Sue them! Make them compensate you for your losses!\"\n\n\"Sue for what? Business was already bad before all that.\" Xu Qinglang came out with the last dish, placed a bowl of rice on the table, and said to the man, \"Eighty yuan.\"\n\n\"Tch, you're asking me for eighty yuan when I'm telling you about a huge deal. That cinema fire, you can sue the cinema! Make them compensate you for your losses.\"\n\n\"That was arson. And that arsonist punk is dirt-poor, he couldn't pay a dime,\" Xu Qinglang retorted.\n\n\"Bullshit. Isn't the cinema management responsible for the fire in their theater?\n\nIsn't the management of this place responsible?\n\nSue! Sue them to compensate you for your losses! And those two who jumped, I heard their families are pretty rich. Sue them! They jumped here, affecting your normal business operations. Make them pay for your losses!\"\n\n\"Your theory is certainly novel,\" Zhou Ze said, not knowing whether to laugh or cry.\n\nNever mind that he and Xu Qinglang, due to their special identities, had no interest in seeking compensation here; even if they were normal people, it would probably be hard to think of demanding compensation for something like this.\n\n\"What's so novel about it? If there's a law, use it. You Chinese people just don't like to go to court, but let me tell you, this case can be fought, and you can get compensation.\n\nEven if you only pluck a single hair off that cinema corporation, it'll still be thicker than our waists, right?\n\nI can handle this lawsuit for you. I need the money right now, so no lawyer's fees up front. We split the compensation fifty-fifty. Don't worry, it won't be a small amount. I wouldn't take the case if it was.\"\n\n\"Go on, get out of here. Who has the time to file a lawsuit with you? Besides, their families lost someone, and we're supposed to go demand compensation from them? Is that even decent?\"\n\nXu Qinglang was getting annoyed with this guy.\n\n\"What good is being decent? Does being decent make you money? You were decent, and your business is still failing and you're having to move, aren't you?\"\n\nThe man took another drink. The bottle of beer was almost empty.\n\n\"There's money for the taking and you don't want it. You're both idiots!\"\n\n\"Is your surname Du?\" Zhou Ze suddenly asked.\n\nThe man froze, then looked at Zhou Ze. \"Well, well. You actually recognize me.\"\n\n\"Old Zhou, you know him?\" Xu Qinglang asked Zhou Ze.\n\nZhou Ze nodded. \"A great lawyer.\"\n\n\"Him? A great lawyer?\" Xu Qinglang laughed so hard tears were about to stream down his face. \"He's clearly a shyster.\"\n\n\"He really is a great lawyer,\" Zhou Ze repeated.\n\nZhou Ze remembered that his hospital had been involved in two medical malpractice incidents due to a new drug. The patients sued, and in the end, the hospital hired this great Lawyer Du, who won the cases perfectly.\n\nHe was from Tongcheng, but he used to have his own law firm in Shanghai. He was considered a very famous professional lawyer in the industry, with an extremely high success rate.\n\nBack then, however, his fees were exorbitant. Aside from major tycoons and large corporations, ordinary people simply couldn't afford him.\n\n\"Since you recognize me, you should know how good I am at litigation. Come on, hire me for this case. You'll get money to open a new shop, and I'm broke.\"\n\nThe great Lawyer Du looked at Zhou Ze, his expression clearly saying, *hurry up and beg me*.\n\n\"Sorry, we're not interested,\" Zhou Ze refused again.\n\n\"Not interested in Renminbi? What are you interested in then, Hell Money?¹\"\n\nThe great Lawyer Du clutched his stomach and started laughing.\n\nThen he stood up,\n\npointed a finger at Zhou Ze and Xu Qinglang,\n\n\"Turning down free money. A couple of big dumbasses.\"\n\nWith that, he felt around in his pocket, took out a hundred-yuan bill, and placed it on the table.\n\n\"The food was terrible. Keep the change.\"\n\nThen, holding the remaining half-bottle of beer, he staggered out of the shop.\n\n\"Is that guy nuts or what?\" Xu Qinglang said as he cleared the table. \"Whatever. I'm closing up. From now on, it's just coffee and pastries.\"\n\n\"He was very good. In the past,\" Zhou Ze said.\n\n\"Why do you admire him so much?\"\n\n\"It's not admiration. In any profession, to reach the top tier in a region, especially somewhere like Shanghai, you have to be a truly capable person.\n\nDo you know what his most famous case was?\"\n\n\"Tell me.\"\n\n\"A juvenile home invasion and murder case. Despite the prosecution having a mountain of evidence, the suspect's family spent a fortune to hire him as the defense lawyer.\n\nIn the end, he actually won the case. The suspect was acquitted.\"\n\n\"So, did the kid actually kill someone or not?\" Xu Qinglang asked.\n\nZhou Ze hesitated for a moment, then nodded. \"He probably did.\"\n\n\"How can a mercenary bastard like that survive in the legal profession?\"\n\n\"They don't just survive, they thrive. Because tycoons and big corporations need lawyers who can win cases and protect their interests, not lawyers who only talk about conscience.\"\n\n\"I get that logic.\" Xu Qinglang stretched, then pointed curiously at the receding figure outside, who was drinking and stumbling away like a madman.\n\n\"Then how did that guy end up in such a pathetic state, coming here to try and talk us into a lawsuit?\"\n\nZhou Ze took a sip of tea,\n\nand said slowly:\n\n\"Later, the minor who was acquitted committed another home invasion murder.\n\nBy a twist of fate,\n\nthe house he broke into,\n\nwas our great Lawyer Du's.\n\nHis wife and daughter, on that day,\n\nwere killed.\"\n\n***\n**Footnotes:**\n1.  **Hell Money (冥幣):** Also known as joss paper, this is imitation money burned as an offering for the deceased to use in the afterlife.

    "content": "The new store opened, full of festive cheer.\n\nFor Zhou Ze, the cost of the new store's renovation, rent, and everything else you could think of wasn't actually paid for by him.\n\nXu Qinglang paid for half, and the other half came from the money exchanged for Bai Yingying's burial goods.\n\nOf course, Xu Qinglang was now preparing to \"semi-retire,\" planning only to sell coffee and make small desserts in the bookstore, embracing a life of wellness.\n\nThe task of earning money could only fall to Zhou Ze.\n\nFortunately, no one really doubted Zhou Ze's ability to make money. The new store was located on South Avenue, a spot with heavy foot traffic, so the ghost traffic should be considerable as well.\n\nAs long as Boss Zhou continued to display the dedicated spirit of fearing neither hardship nor late nights, and relentlessly sent these ghosts who came knocking to Hell for re-education and a new start, earning heaps of spirit money shouldn't be a big problem.\n\nWhen the time came, they could all just squat at the bookstore's entrance, burn the paper money, and wait for someone to drop their wallet. It would even save them the service fee at the bank.\n\nThe bookstore's overall color scheme was a soft, dark tone. The bookshelves inside were not placed too densely. Newspapers and magazines, which were updated more frequently, were on a separate rack. Novels had their own row, and other, more serious books were in a separate section.\n\nAs for things like study aids, Zhou Ze didn't stock them again.\n\nThe bookstore had a second floor, which was partitioned into three rooms and a bathroom, serving as everyone's living area.\n\nThe first day of business had no fireworks or firecrackers, no flower baskets or celebratory cannons; everything seemed simple and calm.\n\nThe old Taoist tactfully helped Bai Yingying clean up, while Zhou Ze sat behind the bar, savoring a cocktail Xu Qinglang had just mixed.\n\nHe took a sip and put the glass down. The little monkey picked up the glass, secretly took a sip, and found it so disgusting that it stuck its tongue out repeatedly.\n\nTang Shi was alone in her bedroom upstairs. She was a homebody; if there was nothing to do, she could stay in her room all day without getting bored.\n\nBy the time everything was tidied up and they were truly ready to welcome customers, it was already past dusk, and the sky had grown dim.\n\nBai Yingying carried the signboard with one hand, hung up the \"Midnight Bookstore\" sign, then hopped down. She clapped her hands, and after confirming it was hung perfectly straight, she smiled in satisfaction.\n\nThen, as instructed by the boss, she also hung the two couplet plaques, \"Listen as You Will\" and \"Thus Have I Heard,\" on the left and right sides, securing them firmly.\n\nThese were the signs brought over from the old store.\n\nBai Yingying had asked Zhou Ze what \"Listen as You Will\" and \"Thus Have I Heard\" meant. Zhou Ze explained that it simply meant they were stories he had heard, which he was telling for everyone to hear.\n\nIt didn't represent his own views, and people should just listen for fun and not take it seriously.\n\nThe bookstore was still in the business of the dead; the business of the living was just a little extra. After all, not far from South Avenue was the \"Tongcheng Bookstore,\" a large bookstore specializing in physical books. Trying to compete with it would be incredibly difficult, and more importantly, completely unnecessary.\n\nZhou Ze remembered that in his childhood, \"Tongcheng Bookstore\" was the most influential bookstore in the minds of Tongcheng's people. But in recent years, as the physical book market continued to shrink and decline, Tongcheng Bookstore had also reduced its business area, looking quite shabby compared to its glory days.\n\nOne could only say that the popularization of smartphones and screen reading had slowly made most people forget the habit of reading from fragrant, ink-scented paper.\n\nEverything was done and on the right track. The next step was to wait for business to arrive.\n\nIn fact, business arrived quickly. Since officially opening at 7 p.m., several groups of customers had already come, but they were all living people who had ordered a coffee or another drink to rest their feet and chat.\n\nWhen the living came, Zhou Ze didn't even bother to move. Instead, it was Xu Qinglang who had to constantly greet them and mix drinks, busy as could be.\n\nIt was already 9:30 p.m. by the time these groups of customers were seen off. Xu Qinglang took a sip of water, looked at Zhou Ze swaying back and forth in his rocking chair, and suddenly felt a great sense of injustice!\n\n\"Old Zhou, I think we should hang up a sign: 'No Admittance to the Living.' What do you think?\"\n\n\"And then the Administration for Industry and Commerce will show up at our door the next day,\" Zhou Ze vetoed Xu Qinglang's suggestion without hesitation.\n\n\"But I feel like this is even more tiring than when I ran my noodle shop,\" Xu Qinglang said with a look of despair.\n\nWhen he ran his noodle shop, not many people actually came to eat in the store; most orders came from food delivery apps. Whenever he wanted to rest, he could just turn off the delivery app. But now, when a customer walked in, you couldn't just push them out the door, could you?\n\n\"Look, here comes one now.\"\n\nZhou Ze glanced at the door.\n\nIt seemed it really was due to the location; today's real business was also arriving quickly.\n\nEntering the store was an old woman, leaning on a cane. She was gaunt and slightly withered, her eyes wide open as if she hadn't been able to die in peace.\n\nThe old woman had a faint aura of resentment about her, which meant she still had some lingering obsession, preventing her from going to Hell or entering the cycle of reincarnation.\n\nBut her bit of resentment was far from enough to turn her into a vicious ghost; she still belonged to the \"harmless to humans and animals\" category of ghosts.\n\n\"Prep the dishes,\" Zhou Ze said to Xu Qinglang.\n\nThis time, Xu Qinglang didn't complain about being tired. In fact, prepping dishes for those about to be sent to Hell was his own suggestion.\n\nHe felt that Zhou Ze's previous method of sending ghosts directly to Hell was too simple and crude, with no foreplay at all—too dry and lacking in service quality.\n\nTherefore, he had proposed that before sending someone to Hell, they should serve a meal as a send-off. That way, the person might leave behind a bit more spirit money.\n\nIt was the same principle as a movie theater's main income coming from tickets, but also having a large income from selling coke and popcorn.\n\nThe dishes were simple: a plate of dried radish, a plate of peanuts, a bowl of rice with chopsticks stuck upright in it, and a cup of old rice wine.\n\nThese were all things prepared in advance, just needing to be plated, so it wasn't any trouble.\n\nThe old Taoist set up a small table, prepared a small stool, and even drew a curtain to block the view from outside. Otherwise, if another customer came in and saw this scene, they would probably be scared out of their wits.\n\nThis was a small private room, one specially prepared for ghosts.\n\nZhou Ze walked over, holding his teacup, and said to the old woman, \"Please.\"\n\nThe old woman was a bit hesitant. You could tell she was scared, but she was more afraid of Zhou Ze. As it was, she could only sit down, trembling.\n\nXu Qinglang handed a bottle of cow's tears mixed with talisman water to the old Taoist. The old Taoist dabbed it on his eyes and could also see the old woman.\n\nHonestly, the old Taoist hadn't encountered this kind of open-door ghost business since leaving the Underworld Store. For a moment, he felt a bit wistful and couldn't help but think of the boss who was still in Rongcheng.\n\nBut it would be soon.\n\nThe old Taoist had already sent a notice to his followers in his live-streaming room, which had been inactive for months, that he would resume streaming in the early morning of April 1st, which was to say, shortly after 12:20 a.m. on March 31st.\n\nThat day was the day the boss said he would return.\n\nBai Yingying also brought a small stool and sat down. The old woman was a bit shy. A Chinese zombie, an underworld emissary, a mystic cultivator, plus an old Taoist whose crotch seemed to be steaming…\n\nThe old woman felt immense pressure.\n\nHer tiny bit of resentment was truly insignificant when surrounded by this pack of wolves.\n\n\"Eat up. After you finish, you can be on your way.\"\n\nZhou Ze urged her.\n\nThe old woman smiled, lowered her head, and began to eat.\n\nIt was just like how a tiger is terrifying, but a tiger in a zoo facing its keeper is like a little kitten.\n\nIf this old woman were outside and someone caught a fleeting glimpse of her, it would probably scare them sick or make them faint. But right now, she could only eat obediently.\n\n\"Ma'am, how'd you die?\" the old Taoist began to ask.\n\nThe old Taoist was an active person. Even at his age, the older he got, the more he talked.\n\nHe usually chatted with the little monkey, telling it how he had vanquished demons and suppressed a great, boisterous monkey under Five Finger Mountain five hundred years ago.\n\nThe monkey played along. As long as the old Taoist bought it some snacks, the monkey could sit there and listen to him boast for a whole afternoon, occasionally waving its hand to show its approval:\n\n\"Great story!\"\n\n\"San peng si li.\"\n\nThe old Taoist was baffled. He knew the old woman was speaking in a dialect, so he looked at Zhou Ze.\n\n\"Died of illness,\" Zhou Ze translated.\n\nThe Tongcheng dialect was very different from Mandarin.\n\n\"Ma'am, this won't do. Even if you've become a ghost, you can't forget to study. You have to learn Mandarin properly. Otherwise, when you get to Hell...\n\nThink about it, there are so many people on the Yellow Springs Road. It'll be hard to find someone who can speak the Tongcheng dialect. You won't even have anyone to chat with on the way. How boring would that be?\"\n\nThe old Taoist reminded her kindly.\n\nThe old woman looked a little embarrassed and could only lower her head and eat.\n\n\"Do you have children?\" the old Taoist asked again.\n\n\"Yu guo o tei.\"\n\nThe old Taoist looked at Zhou Ze again, as if to say, *Quick, translate.*\n\n\"I have a daughter,\" Xu Qinglang translated.\n\n\"Then your daughter must have burned a lot of paper money for you, right?\" The old Taoist rubbed his hands together.\n\nHearing this, the old woman paused, then smiled bitterly. \"Our family's finances aren't good.\" (Translated by Xu Qinglang)\n\n\"Finances aren't good?\" The old Taoist wasn't discouraged. He continued, \"It's alright, paper money isn't expensive anyway. As long as your child has you in her heart, you'll get more paper money.\"\n\n\"I was lying on my sickbed, no money for treatment.\" (Translated by Xu Qinglang) As the old woman spoke, she put down her chopsticks and wiped her tears.\n\n\"How pitiful.\" The old Taoist wiped his own tears along with her.\n\nBai Yingying also pouted, feeling a bit upset.\n\n\"My daughter, at my sickbed in the hospital, asked me if we should keep spending money on my treatment. I was lying in bed, unable to speak or move. She cried and said to me, if I didn't want to continue treatment, I should blink once. If I didn't blink, she would keep treating me even if she had to sell the pot and melt the iron.\"\n\n\"That's a good daughter,\" the old Taoist said. \"What did you do?\"\n\n\"I blinked. Then I went home from the hospital, and then I died.\" The old woman continued to wipe her tears.\n\n\"It's not easy. You were thinking of your children, too. Truly noble. It's not easy for anyone. Children have to live their lives, too.\" The old Taoist shared in her sorrow.\n\nIn fact, situations like this were not uncommon in real life, especially when facing terminal illnesses that required constantly pouring money into treatment, a method that many families simply couldn't afford.\n\n\"Ma'am, you're very noble,\" said Bai Yingying.\n\n\"Let me pour you another cup of wine,\" said Xu Qinglang.\n\nOff to the side, watching everyone around him with teary eyes, Zhou Ze didn't know whether to laugh or cry.\n\nHe pointed at the old woman's eyes, which had been wide open ever since she walked in, and asked:\n\n\"How did you blink?\"\n\nHearing this, the old woman,\n\nstopped crying,\n\nand immediately said viciously:\n\n\"She asked me,\n\n'Mom, I'm asking you, if you don't want to continue treatment, just blink. If you don't blink, I'll keep treating you even if I have to sell the pot and melt the iron.'\n\nThen,\n\nafter waiting for five minutes,\n\nI really couldn't hold it anymore,\n\nand I blinked.\n\nShe immediately started wiping her tears and said:\n\n'Okay,\n\nMom,\n\nI know what you mean.\n\nWe'll stop the treatment.'\"",

    "content": "老太婆最後的一段話，經由許清朗翻譯出來後，之前還感動得不得了的眾人一臉懵逼。\n\n\n\n  我擦咧，\n\n\n\n  說好的我為兒女兒女為我、母慈子孝的雞湯故事呢？\n\n\n\n  為什麼要有這種反轉？\n\n\n\n  周澤拍拍手，問道：「吃好了吧。」\n\n\n\n  言外之意，\n\n\n\n  吃好了，就該上路了。\n\n\n\n  老太婆有些靦腆地放下筷子，道：\n\n\n\n  「我也不知道怎麼就跑到這裡來了，我沒想下去，我還想…………」\n\n\n\n  周澤默默地看著她，\n\n\n\n  嘴角出現一抹微笑，\n\n\n\n  顧客至上，\n\n\n\n  顧客的要求必須微笑聆聽。\n\n\n\n  老太婆身體一凜，嚇得一個哆嗦，\n\n\n\n  馬上道：\n\n\n\n  「我覺得我還是早點下去比較好。」\n\n\n\n  周澤覺得自己應該在這個小包間裡整幾個標語：\n\n\n\n  坦白從寬，抗拒從嚴。\n\n\n\n  好像有點太嚴肅了，或者搞一個：\n\n\n\n  認真改造，重新做人。\n\n\n\n  腦海中這些想法也就只能博自己會心一笑，周澤站起身，打開了地獄之門，老太婆還在那裡猶豫，但周澤直接一隻手抓住她的肩膀將其丟入其中。 \n\n\n\n  就這樣，\n\n\n\n  新店第一單完成。\n\n\n\n  接下來，周澤彎腰在小桌底下看了看，看見了一小疊冥鈔。\n\n\n\n  「數數看，比以前有沒有多？」許清朗催促道。\n\n\n\n  「好像是多了一些。」周澤確認道。\n\n\n\n  「那意味著這個辦法可行，我就說嘛，附加服務的利潤空間才是最大的，我們是不是還可以弄一些其他的項目？」\n\n\n\n  哪怕擁有著二十幾套房，許清朗對賺錢的渴望仍然一如既往。\n\n\n\n  沒人會嫌錢多。\n\n\n\n  「弄個按摩？或者spa？」周澤笑道。\n\n\n\n  「這也太過了吧。」許清朗皺了皺眉。\n\n\n\n  「現在一些殯儀館裡有這種服務，給死人做水療按摩的，我以前見過，就在一個玻璃隔間裡，家屬站在外面看著，技師在裡面給屍體沖澡做按摩，順帶修剪指甲一條龍。」\n\n\n\n  「你真噁心。」許清朗一副我受不了你的樣子，轉身開始收拾起桌上的碗筷。\n\n\n\n  其實這些菜一口都沒動，至少看起來一點都沒動，但這些菜還是要丟掉的。\n\n\n\n  如果是家裡祭奠自己先人的供菜或者水果，祭祀完了之後人還是可以吃的，那畢竟是自家祖先吃過的東西，大家一同上桌吃一碗菜沒什麼大不了的。 \n\n\n\n  但許清朗和那位老太婆非親非故，當然不可能吃人家的剩菜。\n\n\n\n  把冥鈔放入柜子里，周澤又重新坐回了靠椅上，\n\n\n\n  往前搖，\n\n\n\n  往後搖，\n\n\n\n  他喜歡這種愜意，也享受這種悠哉。\n\n\n\n  白鶯鶯跑上面去玩電腦了，老道帶著猴子也上去看電視，許清朗也上去休息了，\n\n\n\n  也因此，書店一樓現在也就只剩下周澤這一個老闆。\n\n\n\n  拿著手機，隨手翻了翻，看看新聞什麼的，外面不知不覺開始下起了雨，雨還有點大，從一開始的稀稀落落變成了磅礴。\n\n\n\n  這個季節，真的是隨時都可能下雨。\n\n\n\n  拿起水杯，喝了一口水，等到周澤神了伸懶腰重新抬起頭，卻發現在自己書店門口，密密麻麻地站著一排人。\n\n\n\n  喲，\n\n\n\n  今兒個生意這麼好？\n\n\n\n  這還是新店開張的第一個晚上，若是以後都這個架勢的話，周澤覺得自己不光能很快還清欠自己女僕的錢，還能馬上買一輛好車。\n\n\n\n  嗯，就是徐樂這個廢柴連駕照都沒有，自己還得去考個駕照。\n\n\n\n  走到店門口，周澤愣了一下，外面站著的，居然不是人，而是一排排衣服。 \n\n\n\n  是原本在外面擺攤賣衣服的人因為下雨了把攤位挪到了自己店鋪門口避雨，因為一些先入為主的念頭這才導致周澤剛誤以為外面是鬼影憧憧。\n\n\n\n  打開了店門，\n\n\n\n  門外站著兩個小姑娘，年紀也就二十出頭的樣子，腰間都別著一個錢包，繫著馬尾辮，看起來都很清爽幹練。\n\n\n\n  「老闆，不好意思，擋著你做生意了，等雨小了我們馬上走，不好意思不好意思。」一個女孩對著周澤鞠躬道歉。\n\n\n\n  「老闆，有咖啡麼，我們買兩杯咖啡吧。」另一個女孩心思活躍多了，到人家這裡買兩杯咖啡，人家也就不好意思趕自己走了吧。\n\n\n\n  「沒事，你們等雨停了再走吧。」\n\n\n\n  周澤還沒這麼不近人情，外加他做的生意外面拿一塊鐵板擋著顧客也依舊能夠進來。\n\n\n\n  「謝謝老闆。」\n\n\n\n  「謝謝老闆。」\n\n\n\n  兩個女孩再次對周澤表示感謝。\n\n\n\n  周澤回到了自己吧檯後面，升級後的吧檯這裡比之前的櫃檯確實要高級舒適許多，環繞音響開著，放著輕緩的音樂。\n\n\n\n  過了大概一刻鐘，雨勢依舊沒有減弱，一個女孩推開書店門走了進來，是之前賣衣服的倆小姑娘之中的一位。\n\n\n\n  女孩走到書架前，選了幾本時尚雜誌，然後走到周澤這邊，準備付款。 \n\n\n\n  「四十八。」周澤看了一眼價碼，順口道：「給五十吧，不要找了。」\n\n\n\n  「好。」\n\n\n\n  女孩應了一聲，將一張五十的遞給周澤。\n\n\n\n  周澤收下了錢。\n\n\n\n  少頃，\n\n\n\n  女孩愣了一下，\n\n\n\n  好像，\n\n\n\n  有哪裡不對啊。\n\n\n\n  周澤繼續靠在椅子上，女孩也沒再糾結那兩塊錢的事兒而是拿著書在店裡小沙發上坐了下來。\n\n\n\n  她的一個同伴在外面看著攤位，她則是拿了一個白本子對著雜誌上的衣服進行臨摹。\n\n\n\n  周澤起身，給對方倒了一杯橙汁送到對方面前。\n\n\n\n  「免費的。」周澤說道。\n\n\n\n  「哦，謝謝老闆。」\n\n\n\n  「在學設計？」周澤問道。\n\n\n\n  「嗯，我們是通城大學的學生。」\n\n\n\n  「大學生出來擺攤做生意，挺不錯的。」\n\n\n\n  周澤讚嘆了兩句，他又不是有非分之想的怪叔叔，也就沒再多聊下去，不過剛走到店門口，周澤忽然看見留在外面照看衣服的女孩正在和一名一身黑衣的男子在交流著什麼。\n\n\n\n  黑衣男子身後還站著好幾個人，他們像是有點冷，站在雨中，瑟瑟發抖，但哪怕如此也不知道往裡面靠靠在屋檐下躲躲雨。 \n\n\n\n  周澤推開店鋪門，走了過去。\n\n\n\n  黑衣男子抬頭，看見了周澤，然後又馬上低下。\n\n\n\n  他身後的那幾個人衣衫單薄的人則一下子變得畏畏縮縮的，根本就不敢和周澤目光對視。\n\n\n\n  周澤走到黑衣男子面前，對方戴著帽子，半張臉都隱藏在裡頭，而後，周澤扭過頭，看見拿衣服遞出去的女孩一臉的呆滯，目光混沌，而且，她手裡剛收的錢，也是一疊破舊的冥幣。\n\n\n\n  「過分了吧。」周澤開口道。\n\n\n\n  「我們都是孤魂野鬼，本是趕路回故里，但下雨天，兄弟們身上又沒衣服，實在是冷得很，求上差網開一面。」\n\n\n\n  「孤魂野鬼，就趕緊下地獄去。」\n\n\n\n  周澤這態度很生硬，顯然沒打算商量。\n\n\n\n  笑話，\n\n\n\n  孤魂野鬼也是業績啊！\n\n\n\n  周老闆現在正準備沖業績呢，蚊子腿也是肉，絕不會放過。\n\n\n\n  看來，換店鋪的選擇是對的，瞧著，今晚多熱鬧。\n\n\n\n  黑衣男子慢慢地抬起頭，露出了他的那一張布滿傷疤的臉，沉聲道：\n\n\n\n  「上差這是不打算好好商量了？」\n\n\n\n  「我和你有什麼好商量的？」 \n\n\n\n  周澤伸手，先抓住了女孩的肩膀，把女孩往後拉了拉，然後自己往前一步，站在了黑衣男子面前，\n\n\n\n  伸出手，\n\n\n\n  在黑衣男子胸口位置輕輕地戳了戳，\n\n\n\n  「你們可以嘗試著編一下可憐的故事讓我心軟一下，\n\n\n\n  哦不，\n\n\n\n  不好意思，我忘了，\n\n\n\n  我的良心暫時被自己吃了還沒找回來。」\n\n\n\n  「我帶他們回到故鄉之後，會帶著他們回地獄，這一點，上差你可以放心！」\n\n\n\n  黑衣男子雖然臉上傷痕密布，但說話擲地有聲，儼然這群小鬼的老大架勢。\n\n\n\n  「難道我還得買機票跟你們回家鄉參觀一下？對不起，哥哥我沒空。」\n\n\n\n  周澤十指指甲長了出來，\n\n\n\n  黑色的煙霧慢慢地環繞而出，\n\n\n\n  此時，那位坐在店鋪里的女孩抬頭向外看了一眼，只看見自己的同伴和那位老闆好像在聊著天，其餘的不該她看到的完全沒看見。\n\n\n\n  「我現在不可能把他們交給你，我必須先帶他們回去！」\n\n\n\n  黑衣男子沖向了周澤，氣勢洶洶！\n\n\n\n  但是下一秒，\n\n\n\n  周澤只是輕甩手臂， \n\n\n\n  黑衣男子直接被抽飛了出去，指甲帶去的鋒銳讓他的靈魂都有些不穩。\n\n\n\n  「呵呵。」\n\n\n\n  周澤笑了兩聲。\n\n\n\n  一個普通的鬼，\n\n\n\n  居然敢主動對自己這個鬼差出手。\n\n\n\n  黑衣男子再度沖了過來，但沒有例外，他再一次被周澤抽飛。\n\n\n\n  這一下，原本站在那裡還戰戰兢兢的幾個鬼，立馬有了不穩定的趨勢。\n\n\n\n  周澤原本以為他們會一起上來幫老大打架，這才叫講義氣嘛。\n\n\n\n  或者，\n\n\n\n  這幾個鬼趕忙跪下來對自己求情，\n\n\n\n  雖然求情沒什麼效果。\n\n\n\n  但他們居然直接掉轉身，撲向了因為被周澤連續抽飛了兩次靈魂都開始變得模糊的黑色身影。\n\n\n\n  他們很憤怒，開始吞噬撕咬著這具黑色身影。\n\n\n\n  周澤站在邊上，看著笑話，道：\n\n\n\n  「看來，你的這幫小弟平時被你壓榨得夠狠啊。」\n\n\n\n  黑衣男子哪怕此時正在被撕咬著，卻依舊沒有發出任何的慘叫，同時嚴正地辯駁道：\n\n\n\n  「他們是我追捕的犯人，追捕行動中我的車和他們的車相撞一起出車禍死了。\n\n\n\n  但哪怕是死了，\n\n\n\n  我也會抓著他們去案發地公安局門口歸案！」",

    "content": "周澤伸手，指尖不斷纏繞出黑氣將圍繞著黑衣男子啃食的這幫傢伙給驅散開，但那一縷縷黑氣卻依舊裹挾著那些小鬼，讓他們無法逃脫。\n\n\n\n  自從那次天台一戰之後，周澤發現自己對這種力量的掌握似乎更提高了一個層次。\n\n\n\n  「你是警察？」\n\n\n\n  周澤低下頭，看著躺在地上魂體都近乎破損的黑衣男子。\n\n\n\n  「你覺得呢？」\n\n\n\n  黑衣男子站了起來，靈魂殘破，看起來有些悽慘。\n\n\n\n  但目光堅毅，炯炯有神。\n\n\n\n  「只是沒想到。」\n\n\n\n  周澤記得自己上次見到的那位趙局，出殯的那天進入自己的書店，結果自己和許清朗都沒能分清楚他到底是活人還是死人。\n\n\n\n  想想，\n\n\n\n  又釋然了。\n\n\n\n  趙局那個年紀快退休了，大半輩子都在自己工作崗位上兢兢業業，有點像是先前下地獄的白夫人，功德修滿。\n\n\n\n  那種人，算是特例中的特例吧。\n\n\n\n  就像是學雷鋒做好事，正是因為這個社會上雷鋒是特例，所以才要學習，如果大家都是活雷鋒，還有什麼學習的必要麼。\n\n\n\n  「跟我進來吧。」\n\n\n\n  ………… \n\n\n\n  外面還是下著雨，原本坐在書店裡臨摹雜誌的女生出去看了看自己的同伴，發現她已經靠在衣架邊上睡著了，當下將一件衣服披在她身上，她也不進去了，就在外面陪著她。\n\n\n\n  兩個出來擺攤掙錢的女大學生，像是這個城市裡嬌嫩的野花，倔強且堅強。\n\n\n\n  這對於她們來說，是尋常的一天，出攤，遇到雨天，避雨，\n\n\n\n  她們不可能知道自己所避雨的書店到底做的是什麼生意，也不記得其中一人剛剛差點和一個鬼做成了一筆買賣。\n\n\n\n  而書店裡，周澤又擺了一些花生蘭花豆，黑衣男子坐在自己對面，那些小鬼都站在邊上，瑟瑟發抖。\n\n\n\n  「謝謝款待。」\n\n\n\n  黑衣男子沉聲道。\n\n\n\n  「吃完了，就上路吧。」周澤說道。\n\n\n\n  男子抬起頭，看著周澤，顯然，他不願意。\n\n\n\n  「他們已經死了，你也已經犧牲了，該盡到的責任已經都盡到了，沒必要為了你的那一縷執念強撐著帶著他們一起遠走。\n\n\n\n  萬一中途再出現什麼問題，導致他們的亡魂脫離你的掌控，這個世界上，將再多出幾個孤魂野鬼，說不定，還會釀造出其他的什麼麻煩。」\n\n\n\n  周澤耐心地解釋。\n\n\n\n  其實，中心思想只有一條。 \n\n\n\n  我敬重你，\n\n\n\n  但敬重歸敬重，工作歸工作，\n\n\n\n  你有你的執念，但我也有我的責任。\n\n\n\n  活人，歸你管，\n\n\n\n  死了的人，我管。\n\n\n\n  「那可以拜託您一件事麼？」\n\n\n\n  「你先說。」\n\n\n\n  「幫我調查一下我的死因。」黑衣男子抬起那一張滿是刀疤的臉，此時看起來分外猙獰，「我做的是臥底，有人出賣了我，否則我能活著抓著他們一起歸案。」\n\n\n\n  黑衣男子想到了在車上，其中一個人忽然接了一個電話，然後氣氛頓時就不對了，他提前醒悟出來自己已經身份暴露，雙方在車上開始了搏鬥，最後車子駛入了山溝之下，釀造出了車毀人亡的慘劇。\n\n\n\n  「這好像是刑偵片裡的情節。」\n\n\n\n  周澤聽完對方的講述，發出了一聲感嘆。\n\n\n\n  做臥底，真的很不容易。\n\n\n\n  「來，敬你一杯。」\n\n\n\n  周澤舉起酒杯，和他虛應了一下。\n\n\n\n  然後，放下酒杯。\n\n\n\n  「你是答應了？」對方問道。\n\n\n\n  「不，只是拖延時間好組織一下拒絕的措辭，怕你和我尷尬。」 \n\n\n\n  「…………」黑衣男子。\n\n\n\n  「對不起，我辦不到，我這裡只是一家書店，其實就是一間驛站，送不該逗留在陽間的亡魂去地獄輪迴。\n\n\n\n  陽間活人的事兒，不歸我管，我也不可能去管，我唯一能做的就是做一份匿名信幫你遞送上去，再多的事，\n\n\n\n  我不能做，也不願意做。」\n\n\n\n  黑衣男子有些失望，他還想再說些什麼，卻化作一聲嘆息，然後喝下這杯酒。\n\n\n\n  鬼喝酒只是吸收掉酒氣，其實看起來杯子裡的酒水絲毫沒變，周澤幫他把原本杯子裡的酒水倒掉，又續了一杯。\n\n\n\n  「再喝兩杯，就送你上路了，祝你一路走好。」\n\n\n\n  人之將死，其言也善。\n\n\n\n  更何況眼前的鬼即將被自己送入地獄，這時候，他也沒必要再編故事欺騙自己什麼。\n\n\n\n  這是一個好警察，\n\n\n\n  值得三杯。\n\n\n\n  周澤指了指酒杯，\n\n\n\n  他能做的，只有這麼多。\n\n\n\n  這個世界上，每時每刻都在發生著紛紛擾擾，也有各種各樣的不公平和慘劇在發生，周澤管不了那麼多，也不願意去管。\n\n\n\n  經營好這家書店，讓自己這第二輩子走入正軌才是他現在所想的事情。 \n\n\n\n  「地獄裡，有審判的吧？」\n\n\n\n  黑衣男子問周澤。\n\n\n\n  周澤聞言，愣了一下。\n\n\n\n  他忽然想到了那個戴著高帽子的老師，上面寫著「衣冠禽獸」。\n\n\n\n  那個帽子，周澤曾試圖幫他摘下來，卻根本就沒辦法做到，帽子很鐵，也很堅硬，完全弄不動。\n\n\n\n  這也意味著，地獄的閻羅殿，似乎也不是傳說中明辨是非的地方，那些判官大人們，也並非各個都是火眼金睛、洞察一切。\n\n\n\n  大部分，可能都是稀里糊塗地得過且過，混著日子。\n\n\n\n  人們總是對那些自己不了解的事物充滿著一種莫名的期望，\n\n\n\n  比如天堂，\n\n\n\n  比如地獄，\n\n\n\n  人們總是相信，在自己沒去過的地方，會有更美好的花香。\n\n\n\n  這是一種精神上的麻醉，也是一種自我催眠。\n\n\n\n  至少目前來看，\n\n\n\n  地獄，\n\n\n\n  似乎和陽間，並沒有太大的區別。\n\n\n\n  但周澤還是點點頭，\n\n\n\n  「是的，一切，在地獄裡，都會水落石出。」\n\n\n\n  黑衣男子站起身，看向周澤，道：「我不要你幫我遞匿名信，幫我把屍體找到就好了。如果你把自己當作鬼差，算我求你，如果你把自己當作一個活人，作為公民你有義務配合我們警方的行動。」 \n\n\n\n  男子說出了一個地名，\n\n\n\n  啟明路，黃家鎮段。\n\n\n\n  「你們的屍身還沒被發現麼？」周澤有些意外。\n\n\n\n  「是的，還沒有，所以我還沒能得到證名，除了知道我身份的上線以外，其餘人都認為我已經和這個團伙一起潛逃了。」\n\n\n\n  「我試試看。」\n\n\n\n  周澤伸手揉了揉自己的眉心，\n\n\n\n  麻煩啊，\n\n\n\n  真的好麻煩啊。\n\n\n\n  作為一個新晉宅男，每天只想著開個店做做生意，晚上再躺在白鶯鶯腿上睡個覺吃她剝好的葡萄。\n\n\n\n  這下子要出遠門，確實讓人覺得很煩躁呢。\n\n\n\n  「請你送我們下去吧，把我們一起送下去，黃泉路上，我也要押著他們去見判官，我要親眼見著他們被繩之以法。」\n\n\n\n  周澤點點頭，\n\n\n\n  打開了地獄之門，\n\n\n\n  同時問道：「他們是販、、、、毒的？」\n\n\n\n  黑衣男子搖搖頭。\n\n\n\n  「那是走私的？」\n\n\n\n  「是賭博。」黑衣男子沉聲道。\n\n\n\n  「哦。」周澤有些不明思議，抓賭博用得著這麼大費周章？ \n\n\n\n  「拿人命做賭注的賭博。」\n\n\n\n  黑衣男子看了看周澤，沒繼續說下去，因為他知道周澤對這件事不怎麼感興趣。\n\n\n\n  他抓著那三個小鬼一起走入了地獄之門。\n\n\n\n  少頃，\n\n\n\n  煙消雲散，\n\n\n\n  周澤拍拍手，拿出自己的本本看了一下，業績表那一欄提升到了百分二十。\n\n\n\n  還有百分之八十的完成度，不過按照新店鋪的生意情況來看，也應該花不了多長時間就能轉正了。\n\n\n\n  拿起茶杯，準備走向自己的吧檯，繼續搖搖晃晃當自己的周老爺，卻發現不知道什麼時候，在自己身後竟然站著一個人。\n\n\n\n  是唐詩，\n\n\n\n  她嘴裡依舊咀嚼著大白兔奶糖。\n\n\n\n  「為什麼不答應去調查呢，多有意思？」唐詩開口問道。\n\n\n\n  「我沒那麼閒。」周澤走回吧檯，坐了下來。\n\n\n\n  「拿命做賭注的賭博，聽起來就讓人覺得挺有意思的。」唐詩繼續道，「如果是他在這裡，他會去看看的。」\n\n\n\n  「他是他，我是我。」\n\n\n\n  「哦，今天看來生意錯不，看來確實是樹挪死人挪活。」唐詩走到了門口，看著外面兩個還在避雨的女大學生。 \n\n\n\n  「雨還沒停。」\n\n\n\n  「你不在上面待著，下來就是玩兒傷感風？」周澤有些意外地問道。\n\n\n\n  唐詩搖搖頭，\n\n\n\n  然後她攤開自己的手，\n\n\n\n  一張紙折的千紙鶴翩翩起舞，惟妙惟肖。\n\n\n\n  「周澤，你知道嗎，有時候不是你主動去避讓麻煩，麻煩就不會落到你身上的。」\n\n\n\n  「但至少能讓麻煩少一點。」周澤點了一根煙。\n\n\n\n  「最近兩天沒什麼事情，所以我調查過你。」\n\n\n\n  說得像是你平時有什麼事情做一樣。\n\n\n\n  在周澤看來，如果拋開特殊能力和往生者的身份，唐詩就是一個花瓶，什麼都不會，也什麼都不願意做。\n\n\n\n  除了腿好看，\n\n\n\n  可以玩一年。\n\n\n\n  「你的眼睛，在看哪裡？」\n\n\n\n  周澤櫃檯上放著的那支原子筆飄浮起來，在周澤的眼前晃悠著，似乎隨時可能會戳瞎他。\n\n\n\n  「你穿黑絲比肉絲，好看多了。」\n\n\n\n  周澤點評道。\n\n\n\n  唐詩把手機丟出來，手機飄浮到了周澤的面前，\n\n\n\n  上面是一個新聞截圖， \n\n\n\n  宿北監獄有一家監獄發生了暴動，死了一名囚犯，還有十多名囚犯受傷。\n\n\n\n  「什麼意思？」周澤看著屏幕問道。\n\n\n\n  「你是有多怕麻煩。」唐詩無可奈何地搖搖頭，「連開大貨車把你撞死的人都不認識？」\n\n\n\n  周澤的瞳孔當即一縮。\n\n\n\n  「不是我做的。」周澤說道。\n\n\n\n  「我知道不是你做的。」唐詩說道，「但他死了。」\n\n\n\n  「意外吧，萬一他們也喜歡玩躲貓貓的遊戲呢？」\n\n\n\n  周澤聳了聳肩。\n\n\n\n  就在這時，許清朗走了下來，他拍了拍額頭，對周澤道：\n\n\n\n  「老周，不好意思啊，前幾天忘了一件事，你那個大伯在你失蹤的那幾天找過你，說他兒子也就是你那個堂弟出車禍死了，讓你去參加葬禮來著。\n\n\n\n  我當時尋思著反正你是周澤，徐樂的親戚也和你沒什麼關係，再加上那會兒你又不在，就忘了，這不，剛想起來，就跟你說一下。葬禮應該是半個月前，早結束了。」\n\n\n\n  聞言，\n\n\n\n  周澤的臉色，\n\n\n\n  終於變得嚴肅了起來。\n\n\n\n  莫名地，\n\n\n\n  好像是有一道漩渦，\n\n\n\n  已經在不知不覺間掀了起來。",

    "content": "Zhou Ze hated trouble, he really, *really* hated trouble. But that didn't mean that when something came looking for him by name, he would be foolish enough to cover his eyes and pretend he couldn't see a thing.\n\nWhen Xu Qinglang saw how serious Zhou Ze’s expression had become after he’d finished speaking, he himself was taken aback for a moment and subconsciously asked:\n\n\"Is something wrong?\"\n\nZhou Ze shook his head. \"It's nothing.\"\n\n\"I'll head up, then?\"\n\n\"Mmm.\"\n\nXu Qinglang went upstairs, looking back every few steps. Instinctively, he felt something was wrong, but since Zhou Ze was unwilling to share, he didn't press the matter. Everyone has their own little secrets, and their own calculations.\n\n\"You've gotten serious, haven't you?\"\n\nTang Shi looked at Zhou Ze, a half-smile on her face.\n\nZhou Ze was also looking at Tang Shi. He tapped the ash from his cigarette and said:\n\n\"Why were you investigating me?\"\n\n\"I told you, it was out of curiosity.\" Tang Shi walked over to the bar, closing the distance between herself and Zhou Ze. At the same time, her fingertips slid across the countertop. \"You know, you're different from us. Really different.\"\n\n\"You've said that before. Because I never truly experienced Hell, while you all were tortured by it.\"\n\n\"No, it's not that simple. That other one and I were lucky to escape after experiencing the great horror of Hell. But you, you had only just set foot on the Yellow Springs Road¹ before you managed to escape with your life.\n\nYou know,\none event, one experience,\nis enough to completely change a person.\n\nFor example, whenever that other one and I mention the word 'Hell,' our hearts will subconsciously tremble, because that word and all the images associated with it are a great terror seared into our souls.\n\nEven though we've all been 'reborn,' our personalities and behaviors have been drastically altered because of it.\n\nYou're different. You just went for a stroll through the suburbs of Hell and came right back.\n\nThat's why you can sit at a small table with that police officer and talk about Hell with a smile, shooting the breeze.\"\n\n\"So, what does this all mean? What else did you find out?\"\n\nThe truck driver who had run him over was dead.\nXu Le's cousin, who had previously helped Xu Le hire a killer to murder him, was also dead.\nTwo people, dead within a short period of time.\nAn ordinary person probably wouldn't connect the deaths of these two, but to Zhou Ze, this was highly unusual.\n\nXu Le was dead, his body given to him.\nThe driver was dead.\nThe cousin was dead.\nEveryone who had been involved in that incident was dead.\n\nCould it really be such a coincidence?\n\n\"We're anomalies in this world. We're not even like the ghost emissaries. We're stowaways. And you... you're an anomaly among anomalies.\n\nWe're not the same.\"\n\n\"Get to the point.\" Zhou Ze rapped his knuckles on the \"blackboard\" (the bar counter).\n\n\"Have you never suspected that your death and your rebirth... weren't an accident?\"\n\nTang Shi lowered her voice and asked slowly,\n\n\"Think about it carefully. Are there any details in all of this that you previously overlooked?\"\n\n...\n\n\"They're coming after me, they've found me...\"\nThe old man's fingernails digging into his own arm, and the old man's final, relieved smile.\n\nAt the traffic light, just as his car had started to move forward,\na large truck ran a red light,\nand charged straight toward him.\n\nThe flames of the crematorium and its scorching heat;\nthe numbness and desolation of Hell's Yellow Springs Road.\n\nThe roar and resentment of the faceless woman,\nthe black nails sprouting from his own fingertips.\n\nHimself, staggering dizzily on the roadside,\na man in a hoodie running out of the bookstore,\nwho beat Xu Le to death with a baseball bat,\nand then he entered Xu Le's body.\n\n...\n\nZhou Ze slowly raised his head and opened his eyes.\nThat man who had killed Xu Le,\nafter he had reported him to the police that time, what had ultimately happened to him?\n\nThis was something Zhou Ze had consistently overlooked.\nHe had been so caught up in the bookstore and Doctor Lin, circling back and forth. He had mostly understood Xu Le's death and his own \"cuckoo occupying the magpie's nest\"² as a kind of karmic retribution, what goes around comes around.\nIn another sense, it was justice from heaven.\n\nBut if the old man in the hospital, about to be treated, had deliberately stabbed his own fingernails into his arm,\nand if the truck driver who ran the red light to kill him had done it deliberately,\nif so many people had acted deliberately,\nthen,\nthat man—who he had previously explained away to himself as someone who had gotten a hot-headed idea to rob some money and bludgeoned Xu Le with a baseball bat—\ncould he,\nalso have been acting deliberately?\n\nIf he was deliberate,\nit meant that from his death to his birth,\nthis entire chain of events,\nhad been designed by someone. He was like a toy race car on a toy track; it looked like he was speeding along, but in reality, he was just following a predetermined path.\n\n\"It looks like you've thought of something.\"\nTang Shi popped another White Rabbit creamy candy into her mouth.\n\nZhou Ze picked up the phone. He was going to call the police station. He had reported the case last time and even gone to the station to give a statement. His first meeting with Doctor Lin had also been at the police station.\nThat policewoman had led Doctor Lin to him and said, \"Your wife is here to take you home.\"\nZhou Ze had been in a daze for a good while after that.\n\nHowever, before dialing, Zhou Ze looked at Tang Shi and asked:\n\"How did you find out?\"\n\n\"You know, compared to us,\nit's like...\na cute husky got mixed into a wolf pack.\"\n\n...\n\nThe rain was still falling, showing no signs of letting up. Tongcheng was located in the Yangtze River Delta region, a season naturally abundant with rain.\nThere were no earthquakes here, no tsunamis. The only thing that could be considered a frequent occurrence with some impact was urban flooding.\n\nWearing a raincoat, Zhou Ze walked below an old apartment building. The trash cans were already soaked through by the rain, and some garbage had floated out.\nTang Shi wore rain boots and a black raincoat, her two legs faintly visible in the rainwater. But Zhou Ze was naturally in no mood to appreciate such scenery right now.\n\nHe had called earlier to check on the situation. The man he had turned in to the police station had only been detained for half a month, on the charge of violating public security regulations. After all, although he had come to Zhou Ze's shop to \"commit violence,\" the end result was that he was taken down by Zhou Ze. It was hard to pin a major crime on him.\nBesides, it's not like Zhou Ze could say:\n\"Officer,\nhe's a murderer,\nhe killed me,\nand I am not me,\nI was reanimated in another body!!!\"\n\nIf he said that,\nhe probably wouldn't be the one going to jail;\ninstead, he'd be the one forcibly committed to a psychiatric hospital.\n\nHowever, Zhou Ze did manage to get the man's address from the station. It was in this area.\n\n\"This is the one.\"\nGoing up to the second floor, Zhou Ze stopped in front of a door.\nMost of the apartments in this small complex were rented out to migrant workers who came to Tongcheng. The environment and facilities were actually quite poor, and they even used communal bathrooms.\n\n\"Are you sure?\" Tang Shi asked.\n\"The door number should be correct.\"\n\nZhou Ze tried to peek through the window. It was blocked by a screen and an old curtain, so he couldn't see clearly inside from the outside.\n\n\"I'll go find something to pry the door open...\"\n\n*Click...*\n\nThe lock opened on its own.\nTang Shi made a \"please\" gesture to Zhou Ze.\nZhou Ze paused for a moment,\nsmiled,\nand walked in.\nWhat a waste not to go into thieving with you, he thought.\n\nThe room was basically a single-room apartment.\nOne room,\ncontaining a bed, a wardrobe, and also a small cooking counter with an induction stove.\nThe room was tidied up quite neatly, but dust had already gathered in some places, clearly indicating it had been uninhabited for a long time.\n\n\"How long has he been out?\"\n\"Several months. I sent him to the police station the day after I was reborn, and he was released half a month later.\"\nZhou Ze scanned his surroundings, examining the details.\n\"Did he move?\" Tang Shi said.\nZhou Ze shook his head. \"Not sure.\"\n\nThe guy who had beaten Xu Le to death with a baseball bat,\nhad he disappeared?\n\nZhou Ze suddenly noticed that a section of the wall behind the bed looked different. He stepped onto the bed, reached out to touch that area of the wall, and then said:\n\"This part of the wall looks like it was painted over later.\"\n\n\"Is there something hidden inside?\" Tang Shi asked.\nZhou Ze pressed his ear against the wall and tapped on it with his hand. \"It doesn't sound hollow.\"\n\nIn truth, hollow spots in the walls of this type of house were very common. When decorating a new apartment, the renovation team would first send an experienced master to come over and tap on the walls and floors with a ruler. If they found any problems, they would ask the developer to make corrections before starting the renovation work.\n\n\"We'll know if we open it up,\" Tang Shi said.\nZhou Ze nodded. He was about to say he would go find a tool, but then he glanced at Tang Shi and consciously took a few steps back.\n\nTang Shi's gaze fell on the kitchen knife and other hard objects next to the induction stove. Then, these objects flew out, repeatedly striking and chiseling at that wall, over and over again.\n\nThe thought of opening a construction company popped into Zhou Ze's head again.\nBai Yingying alone was worth a whole construction crew in terms of labor.\nTang Shi could replace a whole fleet of heavy machinery.\nAll he'd have to do is sit there and count the money.\n\nHowever, as the wall continued to crack, Zhou Ze immediately banished these miscellaneous thoughts from his mind.\n\n*Bang!*\nA piece of the wall broke and fell away.\nA human face was revealed.\nThe face was frozen in an expression of horror, as if perfectly preserving the man's final emotional state.\n\nIt was him.\nThe man who'd beaten Xu Le to death with a baseball bat!\n\nIn the air,\na sour smell hung.\nZhou Ze reached out and examined the corpse inside, frowning. He said:\n\"The body has been dead for less than a week.\"\n\"You're not a forensic pathologist, are you?\" Tang Shi reminded him.\n\"It's basic knowledge for a surgeon. You can roughly determine the time of death based on the post-mortem condition of the body,\" Zhou Ze explained.\n\n\"Well, I can tell you that the wall I just broke through was definitely not sealed up less than a week ago. It's been at least three months.\"\nTang Shi unwrapped a piece of creamy candy, put it in her mouth, and continued:\n\"Unless you think he was killed a week ago and then moved into a wall that was sealed three months ago.\"\n\nZhou Ze immediately realized something was wrong.\nObviously, the body couldn't have been \"teleported\" into the wall later, and the wall was perfectly intact before Tang Shi broke it open.\n\nHe sniffed the air.\nThat sour smell,\nhe had previously assumed it was just the stench of the corpse.\nAt this moment,\nZhou Ze abruptly realized something. He pushed aside the hair on the corpse's head,\nand sure enough,\nhe found a small hole. It was an injection mark.\n\n\"Yes, the body has been dead for a long time, but he was injected with formalin, which is why the corpse is so well-preserved.\nBesides,\nthe formalin was probably slowly injected into him while he was still alive,\nbecause using the circulatory system to spread it throughout the body is much more effective.\"\n\n***\n**Footnotes:**\n1.  **Yellow Springs Road (黃泉路):** In Chinese mythology, this is the path the dead must walk to reach the underworld. It is equivalent to the River Styx in Greek mythology.\n2.  **\"Cuckoo occupying the magpie's nest\" (鵲巢鳩占):** A Chinese idiom meaning to wrongfully take over someone else's place or property.",

    "content": "Outside, Zhou Ze was smoking a cigarette. Tang Shi stood beside him, chewing on a milk candy.\n\nInside, the corpse on the wall slumped down limply, the terrifying, horrified expression on its face perfectly clear, as if the murder and concealment had just happened.\n\nThey were all dead.\n\nNot a single one was left.\n\nXu Le was dead.\n\nThe person who killed Xu Le was dead.\n\nThe hit-and-run driver was dead.\n\nThe cousin was dead.\n\nAll the points on the line were dead.\n\nEven Zhou Ze, in reality, was also dead.\n\nJust as Tang Shi had said, sometimes it wasn't a matter of you deliberately avoiding trouble, and trouble then genuinely not coming to find you.\n\nA pocket had been opened long ago, and whether you were willing or not, whether you liked it or not, you were, in fact, inside this pocket.\n\n\"They're all dead, so the trail of clues is broken, right?\"\n\nTang Shi looked at Zhou Ze with a smile playing on her lips. She seemed to thoroughly enjoy seeing Zhou Ze in this state of mind.\n\nIn a pack of wolves where every wolf was bitter, brooding, and scowling all day, a husky suddenly appeared, wanting only to lie there and be adorably cute.\n\nIt really was a vexing thing.\n\nWhy should we all be heavy-hearted,\n\nwhile you alone get to be innocent and carefree?\n\n\"Don't worry about scarcity, worry about uneven distribution.\"¹ This principle wasn't just true for the distribution of money.\n\n\"From the looks of it, that's right.\"\n\nZhou Ze reached up and rubbed the bridge of his nose.\n\n\"And, I have to worry about one more thing, which is whether or not the police investigation will eventually lead to me.\"\n\nThe mastermind, the one who paid, was Xu Le.\n\nThe driver was dead, and the middleman, the cousin, was also dead.\n\nThe reason Zhou Ze had restrained himself from seeking revenge before was this very thing; he didn't want to expose himself, because it would destroy the life he had now.\n\nModern society was very different from ancient times. Even if ancient societies had household registration systems, it wasn't actually that hard for a person without an identity to hide and live in seclusion.\n\nBut in modern society, a person's identity tags and information were extremely important. Of course, Zhou Ze could hide if he wanted to, but the price would be a rapid decline in his quality of life, spending his days hiding and dodging.\n\nRight now, Zhou Ze hadn't been the one to kill them, but he naturally had to bear the potential turmoil that might arise from their deaths.\n\nHe didn't get to enjoy the satisfaction of revenge,\n\nand he still had to take the fall.\n\nSo infuriating!\n\nTaking out his phone, Zhou Ze dialed the local police station.\n\n\"Hello, I want to report a crime.\"\n\nTang Shi didn't accompany Zhou Ze to the police station, instead returning to the bookstore first. Accompanying Zhou Ze to inspect a murder scene on a rainy day, wearing a raincoat and stepping through muddy roads, was the absolute limit of what she could do. She couldn't possibly go with him to face the complicated note-taking and investigative questioning at a police station.\n\nAs for Zhou Ze, he had no choice. He had to do it. After all, he had just called the police station to ask for the deceased's address. If he didn't report the crime now, his suspicion would only grow larger when the body was eventually discovered.\n\nAnd as for secretly disposing of the body, Zhou Ze was unwilling to do so. Until he could figure out who was pulling the strings behind the scenes, Zhou Ze didn't want to act clever and help someone else clean up their mess.\n\nIt was possible that with one misstep, he would just be digging a pit to bury himself.\n\n...\n\nThe investigation and questioning continued until well past eight in the evening. They rotated through several groups of police officers, and it was clear that they were treating Zhou Ze as the murderer.\n\nDon't assume that murderers won't proactively report the crime.\n\nIn fact,\n\naccording to police big data statistics, more than eighty percent of murderers will disguise themselves as onlookers and return to the crime scene for a look.\n\nThe mentality for most murderers is to feign innocence and check for information; a small portion does it with the perverse mindset of, \"I've killed someone, so I must go admire my work of art.\"\n\nIf the deceased went undiscovered for a long time, it would be, for the murderer, like a pearl cast into darkness, like the Mona Lisa's smile covered by a black cloth—an unbearable itch in the heart. So, they might as well report it themselves just to get the veil lifted.\n\nIn the end, it was an old detective with half-gray hair who sat before Zhou Ze, closed his notebook, and said to him:\n\n\"Mr. Zhou, you may leave. But please do not leave Tongcheng for the next month. We may need to contact you for more information.\"\n\n\"Alright.\"\n\nZhou Ze stood up, left the interrogation room, and walked to the entrance of the police station.\n\nHe looked back at the police officers coming and going and the row of police cars parked inside. For some reason, he felt a wave of pressure.\n\nPerhaps, before long, the truth of that manufactured car accident would also surface. At that time, what he would face might be a true storm.\n\nThe victim was actually him, but the real culprit,\n\nwas also him.\n\nZhou Ze prepared to head back to the bookstore. He was a bit tired and wanted to rest first, but his phone rang just then. It was his sister-in-law.\n\n\"Hello, Xu Le, your uncle is here again. He's sitting by the stairwell. I asked him to come in and sit, but he won't. He just said he needs to wait for you to come back.\"\n\nUncle?\n\n\"Just tell him I'm not coming back, and don't tell him the address of my new shop.\" Zhou Ze had no desire to deal with irrelevant people at this moment.\n\n\"Clang!\"\n\nThe sound of a door being slammed came from the other end of the line.\n\nZhou Ze's brow furrowed slightly. \"What's wrong?\" he asked.\n\n\"Um, your uncle is banging on the door. He said... if you don't come back today, he'll make you go to jail.\"\n\nHearing this,\n\nZhou Ze lifted his head, clenched his jaw, and said, \"Tell him, I'll be right back.\"\n\n...\n\nNo one wants to live like a punching bag. No one wants their life to be constrained. Everyone wants to be spontaneous, but such is life.\n\nWhen you're a few months old, you can pee everywhere, you can wet the bed at will, and your elders and relatives will still greet you with a smile and flick your little dinger.\n\nBut when you're in your teens or twenties, if you want to pee wherever you please, if you want to have your dinger flicked again, it's impossible.\n\nIt's hard to imagine a forty-five-year-old elder flicking a twenty-something young man's dinger, saying:\n\n\"You peed again, you naughty boy.\"\n\nThat image is just too much for the eyes.\n\nTherefore, when Zhou Ze appeared before Xu Dachuan,\n\nXu Dachuan's face was grim,\n\nand Zhou Ze's face was just as gloomy.\n\nNo one was happy.\n\nNo one was joyful.\n\nBut they still had to meet.\n\nXu Dachuan hadn't harmed anyone in the house. When Zhou Ze arrived, he was squatting there, smoking a rustic pipe. Seeing Zhou Ze approach, he stood up and patted his trouser leg.\n\n\"Come take a walk with me.\"\n\nThis time, Xu Dachuan hadn't brought any local specialties; he had come empty-handed.\n\nZhou Ze walked out with Xu Dachuan. He didn't bother to greet his sister-in-law or Doctor Lin, who were peeking through the crack of the door.\n\nThe two walked out of the residential complex.\n\nThe sky had already gone completely dark.\n\nUnder the streetlights, there weren't many people.\n\nXu Dachuan walked for a stretch, then squatted down again, taking puffs from his rustic pipe with a \"smack, smack\" sound.\n\nZhou Ze stood still beside him.\n\n\"Little Chuan-zi has already been cremated,\" Xu Dachuan said.\n\nLittle Chuan-zi must have been the cousin's nickname.\n\n\"Yeah,\" Zhou Ze responded. \"I wasn't in Tongcheng at the time.\"\n\n\"It's fine.\"\n\nXu Dachuan tapped his pipe stem and looked up. His face was full of the vicissitudes of life, etched with deep lines. This was an honest, simple old man who had worked hard to support his family. Xu Le, the university student, had actually been put through school by him.\n\n\"Ah Le, you not coming to Little Chuan-zi's funeral, that really wasn't right of you.\"\n\nXu Dachuan's eyes grew moist. Squatting there, he wiped the tears from the corners of his eyes with the back of his chapped hand.\n\n\"I said, I wasn't in Tongcheng at the time.\"\n\nXu Dachuan suddenly shot to his feet, grabbed Zhou Ze by the collar with one hand, and shoved him outward, pinning him against a utility pole.\n\n\"Ah Le, tell your uncle the truth. Little Chuan-zi... did you do him in?!\"\n\nZhou Ze's eyes narrowed slightly. The amount of information in Xu Dachuan's question was immense.\n\nPreviously, Zhou Ze had felt some goodwill toward Xu Dachuan.\n\nRight and wrong, good and bad, it had nothing to do with him. Besides, Xu Dachuan was the first stranger to have shown him genuine concern since his rebirth.\n\nHe could endure the disdain of the Lin family to bring local specialties to see him.\n\nEven in his hospital bed, he would still beam at Doctor Lin, his nephew's wife, brimming with satisfaction.\n\nHe had even said that if being a live-in son-in-law didn't work out, he could always go back and farm with him.\n\nIn Zhou Ze's eyes, he was supposed to be simple, supposed to be kind, supposed to be a patch of pure land.\n\nBut now, it seemed this patch of pure land wasn't as pure as he had imagined.\n\n\"It wasn't me.\"\n\nZhou Ze reached out and gripped Xu Dachuan's wrist.\n\n\"The business between you and Little Chuan-zi, don't think I don't know about it. I also know that Little Chuan-zi has been coming to you for money recently. He's immature, he's a disappointment, he has a thousand faults.\n\n\"But he is your brother, after all!\"\n\nXu Dachuan's eyes began to turn bloodshot; the man seemed on the verge of frenzy.\n\n\"I don't know what you're talking about.\"\n\nZhou Ze suddenly felt a great aversion to the man before him,\n\nthis honest, rustic man.\n\n\"Don't know what I'm talking about?\"\n\nXu Dachuan brought his face close to Zhou Ze's and said, word by word:\n\n\"That driver, isn't he dead? He's from the village next to mine. You think Little Chuan-zi knew anyone? You think he knew whose lips were sealed tight?\n\n\"He's just a kid, what right did he have to negotiate with anyone?\n\n\"That driver... I was the one who went and found him, who negotiated with him.\n\n\"Uncle wanted you to have a good life. Your wife fell for someone else, your life was miserable, so Uncle helped you get that 'other man' killed!\n\n\"Uncle wanted all the kids in our family to live comfortably, not to be bullied, not to be looked down on.\n\n\"But,\n\n\"Ah Le,\n\n\"You can't kill Little Chuan-zi to silence him!\n\n\"Your father died early, it was Uncle who put you through school. Uncle has always treated you like his own son!\n\n\"Speak from your heart and tell Uncle the truth.\n\n\"Little Chuan-zi... did you have someone 'accidentally' run him over, just like last time?\n\n\"Were you trying to silence him?\"\n\nZhou Ze took a deep breath.\n\nXu Dachuan was asking the wrong person.\n\nIn fact,\n\nevery question he asked was tantamount to pouring oil on the fire.\n\nHe needed to remember that standing before him,\n\nwas not his nephew Xu Le,\n\nbut the true victim in that incident, the aggrieved party!\n\n\"Thump!\"\n\nZhou Ze kicked out, knocking Xu Dachuan to the ground.\n\nAt this very moment, Zhou Ze felt an irrepressible urge to just blow everything up.\n\nHe regretted it. He regretted it deeply. If he had known this was how things would turn out, his newly reborn self should have just turned himself in to the police from the start.\n\nXu Le's cousin,\n\nXu Dachuan,\n\nthat driver,\n\nlet them all face the judgment of the law. Even if he, in Xu Le's identity, got implicated along with them, he wouldn't care.\n\nTo use this second life he'd gained to avenge his first life—that would have been a satisfying settlement of grudges.\n\nAt least,\n\nit would have been far, far better than his current predicament, caught between a rock and a hard place.\n\nBut now,\n\nthe cousin and the driver were both dead. The person who killed Xu Le was also dead. They had died so cleanly, leaving Zhou Ze with no way to even begin his revenge.\n\nYou have strength, you have power, but it's always frustrating to land a punch on a bale of cotton.\n\nXu Dachuan, knocked to the ground, immediately scrambled back up and roared at Zhou Ze:\n\n\"Ah Le, you're the one who turned your back on your own family!\n\n\"I'm going to the Public Security Bureau to report you!\n\n\"You're a murderer!\n\n\"A murderer!\n\n\"I want you to be buried with Little Chuan-zi, be buried with him!!!\"\n\nZhou Ze looked at Xu Dachuan,\n\nlooked at this old man who, even now, still appeared weathered and honest.\n\nHis left hand, held behind his back,\n\nslowly began to sprout black nails.\n\nA corner of Zhou Ze's mouth curled up,\n\nas if he were savoring the words:\n\n\"Buried with him?\"\n\n---\n¹ A famous saying from the Analects of Confucius, meaning people are less concerned with having little than with having things distributed unfairly. Here, it's applied to emotional states rather than material wealth.",

    "content": "徐大川大喊大叫著，瘋瘋癲癲，這個男人，在自己兒子死去後的這段日子裡，承受著極大的心裡壓力和心理折磨。\n\n\n\n  他覺得自己很委屈，\n\n\n\n  他覺得自己很痛苦，\n\n\n\n  他覺得自己這輩子很坎坷，很不容易。\n\n\n\n  若是換做另一個人代替周澤站在這裡，興許還會被他激發出一些同情以及憐憫。\n\n\n\n  但很可惜，\n\n\n\n  站在他面前的，是周澤。\n\n\n\n  誰都可能去同情他，\n\n\n\n  但除了周澤。\n\n\n\n  他死了，\n\n\n\n  這個眼前正在哭泣，正在瘋癲，正在歇斯底里的糙漢子，\n\n\n\n  也是殺自己的幫凶之一。\n\n\n\n  為什麼你們都覺得自己可憐，\n\n\n\n  為什麼你們都覺得自己委屈，\n\n\n\n  那我呢？\n\n\n\n  誰來可憐我？\n\n\n\n  誰來替我想一下？\n\n\n\n  周澤自然而然地走到了徐大川的面前，他抬起自己的下顎，在這個時候，他心裡有無數個情緒正在瘋狂地驅動他將面前的男人給殺死。\n\n\n\n  將他撕碎，\n\n \n\n  不光他的身體，\n\n\n\n  還有他的靈魂！\n\n\n\n  要讓他承受最大的痛苦和折磨，才能抵消自己內心的怒火！\n\n\n\n  生活，似乎總是有很多巧合，一輛警車從遠處開了過來。\n\n\n\n  周澤看著警車上端的光彩閃爍，在這一刻，他沒有畏懼，也沒有害怕，甚至有了一種破罐子破摔的輕鬆。\n\n\n\n  如果這一切，真的只是一個口袋。\n\n\n\n  那麼，\n\n\n\n  我也跟著一起瘋了吧。\n\n\n\n  與其讓我一個人承受委屈受苦，\n\n\n\n  不如大家一起，\n\n\n\n  互相傷害！\n\n\n\n  徐大川還在喊，還在跳，警車在旁邊停了下來，下來兩個警察，他們可能是在巡邏，也可能是碰巧經過，但他們還是下車打算了解一下情況。\n\n\n\n  警察走了過來，徐大川忽然安靜了下來，他以怨毒的目光看著周澤，然後又看了看警察。\n\n\n\n  他開始主動地向警察走去。\n\n\n\n  而周澤負於身後的雙手，指甲已經完全長出，那一團團黑氣不停地在十指間環繞。\n\n\n\n  閉上眼，\n\n\n\n  瞳孔深處，\n\n\n\n  似乎有黑色的激流正在流淌。 \n\n\n\n  這一刻，周澤仿佛又漸漸找到了那日在天台上的感覺，仿佛自己已經被整個社會，被生活，完全地拋棄。\n\n\n\n  那種孤獨，那種無奈，\n\n\n\n  不停地將他內心深處積攢的壓抑給釋放出來。\n\n\n\n  我是鬼差，\n\n\n\n  我死過一次，\n\n\n\n  我修身養性，\n\n\n\n  但並不喜歡忍氣吞聲。\n\n\n\n  如果即將來臨的是一場暴風雨，\n\n\n\n  那我就在這暴雨之中，\n\n\n\n  再放縱一把。\n\n\n\n  以前，周澤一直很畏懼，他害怕自己成為和蓉城那位一樣，變成被封殺的例子。\n\n\n\n  但有的時候，你真的很難控制住你自己，\n\n\n\n  當然，更難控制的，是你身邊的漩渦，它會主動推著你，慫恿著你，逼迫著你，\n\n\n\n  一步一步地，\n\n\n\n  邁向深淵。\n\n\n\n  「怎麼回事？」一個警察走到徐大川面前，另一個中年警察則是看著周澤。\n\n\n\n  本能地，中年警察從周澤身上察覺到了一絲危險的氣息，這是他多年從警經驗造就出來的第六感。\n\n\n\n  雖然自己眼前的這個年輕人有些瘦削，看起來也有些弱不經風，而且他還閉著眼，但這位中年警察卻有些嘴唇發乾。 \n\n\n\n  說出來有點丟人，這會兒，他居然覺得有點緊張。\n\n\n\n  嘿，真是見鬼了，\n\n\n\n  我緊張什麼。\n\n\n\n  「沒事兒，我喝了點酒，訓晚輩呢，晚輩不聽話，要和婆姨鬧離婚，得訓他！」\n\n\n\n  徐大川頂著紅通通的眼珠子說道。\n\n\n\n  兩個警察對視了一眼，既然是人家家裡事兒，他們也就不管了，二人當即又回到車裡，警車開出。\n\n\n\n  中年警察再度側過頭看向了身後。\n\n\n\n  「崔哥，看什麼呢？」\n\n\n\n  「沒什麼。」\n\n\n\n  中年警察坐正了身子，搖搖頭。\n\n\n\n  路邊，\n\n\n\n  徐大川扭過頭，再度看向周澤。\n\n\n\n  「喉……呸！」\n\n\n\n  一口濃痰，被他重重地吐在地上。\n\n\n\n  剛剛鬧著要去報警，要去舉報周澤的徐大川沒有對警察舉報。\n\n\n\n  作為一個已經失去兒子的父親，他不至於是擔心自己擔上干係所以不敢去舉報，只能說，在那個關頭，他心軟了。\n\n\n\n  「你最好找人把我也一起弄死，這樣就沒人能知道你以前做過什麼事兒了！」\n\n\n\n  徐大川低吼了一聲， \n\n\n\n  他兒子死了，他不願意把這個侄子也送去刑場，否則他這一家，就得斷根了。\n\n\n\n  他的想法很質樸，\n\n\n\n  真的非常非常的質樸。\n\n\n\n  自家侄子的婆姨在外面有了喜歡的人，\n\n\n\n  就幫著搞死那個傢伙！\n\n\n\n  眼下，自己已經死了兒子，就不能讓他老徐家再絕後。\n\n\n\n  很偉大？\n\n\n\n  對，\n\n\n\n  很偉大。\n\n\n\n  但在周澤看來，\n\n\n\n  卻分外地噁心。\n\n\n\n  徐大川彎下腰準備撿起自己的旱菸杆，他準備離開，他準備回家，他想了很久，也憤怒了很久，但在這個時候，他還是沒有勇氣去真的拉徐樂給自己的兒子陪葬。\n\n\n\n  然而，徐大川的旱菸杆卻被周澤踩在了腳底。\n\n\n\n  徐大川抬起頭，有些發愣。\n\n\n\n  周澤慢慢地彎下腰，撿起旱菸杆。\n\n\n\n  「砰！」\n\n\n\n  旱菸杆重重地抽在了徐大川的身上。\n\n\n\n  徐大川發出了一聲悶哼，一臉不敢置信地看著周澤。\n\n\n\n  「你敢…………」\n\n \n\n  「砰！」\n\n\n\n  又是一記狠狠地抽上去，徐大川被打倒在了地上，他的腿前陣子做過手術，還沒好完全利索，這個時候面對周澤的忽然暴起，他只能蜷曲著倒在地上。\n\n\n\n  警察已經遠走，自然發現不了這時的畫面。\n\n\n\n  「我叫你偉大！」\n\n\n\n  「砰！」\n\n\n\n  一記再度抽上去。\n\n\n\n  「我叫你心軟！」\n\n\n\n  「砰！」\n\n\n\n  又是一記再度抽上去。\n\n\n\n  「我叫你覺得自己很委屈！」\n\n\n\n  「砰！」\n\n\n\n  「我叫你覺得自己很不容易！」\n\n\n\n  「砰！」\n\n\n\n  「我叫你覺得日子艱難！」\n\n\n\n  「砰！」\n\n\n\n  「我叫你覺得可憐！」\n\n\n\n  「砰！」\n\n\n\n  …………\n\n\n\n  忍耐壓抑了許久的周澤像是發了瘋一樣，對著徐大川一陣連續的猛抽，抽得徐大川倒在地上不停地顫抖。\n\n\n\n  最後，\n\n\n\n  丟下了手中的煙杆，\n\n\n\n  周澤踉蹌地後退幾步， \n\n\n\n  靠在了電線桿上。\n\n\n\n  「咳咳…………咳咳…………」\n\n\n\n  重重地咳嗽聲從他嘴裡傳來，\n\n\n\n  他抬起頭，\n\n\n\n  看著暗淡的夜空。\n\n\n\n  心中的怒火被發泄出去了一些，\n\n\n\n  但內心深處，並沒有因此舒暢多少。\n\n\n\n  這幫人，\n\n\n\n  他們父慈子孝，\n\n\n\n  他們兄友弟恭，\n\n\n\n  他們互相幫助，他們互相體貼，\n\n\n\n  但越是這樣，越是讓周澤覺得噁心。\n\n\n\n  轉過身，留下蜷曲在那裡鼻青臉腫的徐大川，周澤一個人慢慢地往前走。\n\n\n\n  點了一根煙，深深地吸了一口，\n\n\n\n  而後用指甲掐滅了火頭，將剩下的菸草揉碎，放入嘴裡，慢慢地咀嚼著。\n\n\n\n  拿出手機，準備打車，但附近卻沒有車。\n\n\n\n  不得已，\n\n\n\n  周澤撥通了許清朗的電話：\n\n\n\n  「喂，老周啊，幹啥呢，今兒個不開門做生意了啊。」\n\n\n\n  「來接我一下。」\n\n\n\n  周澤報出了地址。 \n\n\n\n  「等下，我給老道打個電話，他剛開我車出去給那個女人買糖去了，讓他順路接你回來。」\n\n\n\n  掛斷了電話，\n\n\n\n  周澤將嘴裡的煙渣吐出來，就靠在電線桿上，發呆了許久。\n\n\n\n  徐大川，他沒殺。\n\n\n\n  在這張口袋之下，\n\n\n\n  其實沒有誰是無辜的，\n\n\n\n  但似乎每個人都是提線木偶，在預定的節點做著自己應該做的事情，\n\n\n\n  到最後，\n\n\n\n  用完銷毀。\n\n\n\n  有個人，在引導著這一切的發生，就像是催化劑一樣，加劇了這一切的運轉。\n\n\n\n  那個人，\n\n\n\n  才是真正的推動者，才是害得自己上輩子在一場車禍中身亡的罪魁禍首。\n\n\n\n  過了大概二十分鐘的時間，一輛黑色的尼桑停在了周澤旁邊，車窗搖下，露出了老道的身影。\n\n\n\n  「老闆，找到你了。」\n\n\n\n  老道殷勤地先下車，幫周澤打開了車門。\n\n\n\n  周澤坐了進去，老道又殷勤地從大包裝袋裡取出一塊奶糖，遞給周澤：\n\n\n\n  「老闆，吃。」\n\n\n\n  周澤推開老道的手，示意自己沒心情。 \n\n\n\n  老道訕訕一笑，不以為意。\n\n\n\n  要知道，比起周澤，他上一任開冥店的老闆，其實更難相處。\n\n\n\n  周澤比起上一位，其實平和融洽得多了，當然，也不是說上一位有多脾氣差，但他只要往櫃檯後一坐，老道就自然而然地連說話都不敢太大聲。\n\n\n\n  「不吃糖，抽根煙吧。」\n\n\n\n  老道給周澤遞了一根煙，再幫其點燃，隨後才坐回自己的駕駛位置。\n\n\n\n  車子開動，老道拐了一個彎，往回走。\n\n\n\n  到前面路口，老道右拐，在經過小區門口時，他下意識地降低了車速，同時探頭向小區里看了看。\n\n\n\n  這裡，是林家所住的小區。\n\n\n\n  之前，周澤來到這裡，接走徐大川、倆人散步了一段距離，但也不可能走太遠。\n\n\n\n  「看什麼？」周澤問道。\n\n\n\n  「老闆，就是這裡啊，你不知道？」\n\n\n\n  「什麼？」\n\n\n\n  「之前唐小姐不是和你說過，她受傷時只能選擇燈下黑的地方藏一藏麼，通城也就兩個燈下黑的地方。\n\n\n\n  一個是你的那家書店，\n\n\n\n  還有一個就是這裡的小區。\n\n\n\n  不過唐小姐說這個地方的燈好像出了點問題，所以最後我們還是選擇靠在你那邊躲避追殺。」 \n\n\n\n  老道自顧自地說著，\n\n\n\n  沒有注意到，\n\n\n\n  周澤拿煙的手，\n\n\n\n  微微顫抖……",

    "content": "「喂，徐樂，吃飯啦！」\n\n\n\n  小姨子站在樓梯口對著上面喊道。\n\n\n\n  這一聲喊叫將周澤從剛剛的恍惚之中驚醒過來，\n\n\n\n  臥室還是那間臥室，\n\n\n\n  床還是那張床，\n\n\n\n  牆壁上的結婚照還是一如既往，沒有絲毫的變化。\n\n\n\n  伸手，揉了揉自己的眼睛，周澤轉過身，推開臥室門，走下了樓。\n\n\n\n  客廳餐桌上，擺放著三菜一湯。\n\n\n\n  一份芹菜炒牛肉，一份宮保雞丁，一份白菜炒粉絲，還有一碗青菜豆腐湯。\n\n\n\n  林醫生正站在桌邊盛飯，小姨子已經坐在椅子上迫不及待了。\n\n\n\n  「某些人啊，就是沒良心，老婆在廚房做飯，自己居然在上面悠哉悠哉。」\n\n\n\n  小姨子一邊吃著一邊搖晃著身體。\n\n\n\n  周澤也坐了下來，林醫生將筷子遞送到周澤的手裡。\n\n\n\n  「以後，回家吃飯吧。」\n\n\n\n  林醫生忽然說道。\n\n\n\n  像是一個溫婉的妻子，在對丈夫囑託，好像，一切如常，也一切正常，春風化雨。\n\n\n\n  「嗯？」小姨子瞪大了眼睛，\n\n\n\n  徐樂要回來了？ \n\n\n\n  還是自己姐姐親自要求的？\n\n\n\n  周澤沒回答。\n\n\n\n  小姨子按捺不住，在飯桌下伸腳踹了一下周澤，\n\n\n\n  你這傻瓜，怎麼還不接話呢？\n\n\n\n  我姐姐都叫你回來吃飯了！\n\n\n\n  她願意下面給你吃，\n\n\n\n  你還不主動一點？\n\n\n\n  「再說吧。」周澤敷衍了一聲。\n\n\n\n  「去那個小區住，可以麼？」\n\n\n\n  林醫生又開口道。\n\n\n\n  那個小區，當然指的是周澤上輩子住的小區。\n\n\n\n  很顯然，林醫生也清楚周澤住在自己家，和自己父母相處很不愉快，所以，她願意和周澤去那個家裡去，\n\n\n\n  一個，\n\n\n\n  只有她和他兩個人的地方。\n\n\n\n  周澤手中的筷子微微一顫，他能感受出來，其實這個女人還沒完全克服之前所說的心理障礙，但她在努力地讓自己往前看。\n\n\n\n  生活已然稀里糊塗，那就稀里糊塗地繼續過吧，而且過得更好一點。\n\n\n\n  很多人對自己的人生一直充滿著精緻的渴望，然而真正精緻的人生並不存在，正如一些星光燦爛的女星年輕時可能也在哪個酒吧坐檯過。 \n\n\n\n  細究下來，任何完美的事物，總會在某個時間段有著它的瑕疵。\n\n\n\n  把握住當下，才是生活的真諦。\n\n\n\n  這一刻，周澤猶豫了。\n\n\n\n  一些問題，他沒有去問，因為林醫生是讓小姨子來喊自己下來，而不是她親自上來，但不可否認的是，周澤自己其實也有些害怕問那個問題。\n\n\n\n  一旦徹底撕破臉皮，\n\n\n\n  原本在自己看來是上天補償給自己的禮物，\n\n\n\n  撤掉了一切的偽裝，\n\n\n\n  可能會變得讓自己有些不忍直視。\n\n\n\n  周澤承認自己和大多數男人一樣，喜歡長得漂亮的女人，只是，這一次，他有些害怕。\n\n\n\n  他的腦海中，難以想像出在自己家裡和林醫生一起生活一起坐在飯桌邊吃飯時的畫面。\n\n\n\n  這感覺，\n\n\n\n  就像是自己是一隻寵物貓，被主人寵幸，你的一切行為，包括反抗，也會變得更像是撒嬌。\n\n\n\n  「沒必要。」\n\n\n\n  周澤回答道。\n\n\n\n  然後夾了一口菜送入嘴裡，表情嚴肅，極為艱難地咽了下去。\n\n\n\n  「不好吃麼？」林醫生問道。\n\n\n\n  她看見周澤吃飯時很痛苦。 \n\n\n\n  「喂，徐樂，你這是拿捏上架子了啊，大爺！」\n\n\n\n  小姨子看不下去了。\n\n\n\n  在她看來，是徐樂在欺負自己姐姐。\n\n\n\n  放下了筷子，周澤決定還是不強迫自己吃了，轉而對著林醫生道：\n\n\n\n  「和我來一下，說一些事情。」\n\n\n\n  林醫生點點頭，放下了筷子。\n\n\n\n  「喂，你們有什麼事情不能當著我的面說啊！」\n\n\n\n  小姨子氣呼呼道，她感覺自己成了大燈泡，而她卻沒有淪為大燈泡的自覺。\n\n\n\n  周澤上了樓，林醫生也跟著上去了。\n\n\n\n  兩個人站在二樓的臥室門口，周澤沒有推門進去，他不想再看見那張婚紗照，總覺得婚紗照中的徐樂，在看著自己。\n\n\n\n  而徐樂，\n\n\n\n  其實和自己，\n\n\n\n  沒什麼區別。\n\n\n\n  大家都是工具，\n\n\n\n  一個是高級的工具，一個是低級工具，\n\n\n\n  沒必要五十步笑百步。\n\n\n\n  「你說吧。」林醫生看著周澤，微微低頭。\n\n\n\n  周澤猶豫良久，話在嘴邊，卻不知道該如何說出口， \n\n\n\n  是質問？\n\n\n\n  是求證？\n\n\n\n  是呵斥？\n\n\n\n  是怒罵？\n\n\n\n  又或者，是互相的傾訴？\n\n\n\n  其實，歸根究底，事情已經被做下來了。\n\n\n\n  該死的人，都死了，\n\n\n\n  被騰空的身體，也被自己進入了。\n\n\n\n  事情，其實已經進入了尾聲。\n\n\n\n  「我們就這樣結束吧。」\n\n\n\n  周澤開口道。\n\n\n\n  在說完這些話時，周澤一直盯著面前的女人。\n\n\n\n  仿佛眼前這個溫婉挺拔的女人，在下一刻會撕去一切偽裝，將自己壓在牆壁上，嘲諷自己的自不量力。\n\n\n\n  你只是我的玩偶，\n\n\n\n  我喜歡的玩具，\n\n\n\n  為了得到你，\n\n\n\n  我花費了那麼多的心思，\n\n\n\n  作為玩具，\n\n\n\n  你有說結束的權力？\n\n\n\n  人的腦補，\n\n\n\n  是最可怕的一種本能。\n\n\n\n  這裡面包含了太多太多的心理暗示，就像是上次周澤在王軻家裡一樣。 \n\n\n\n  王軻到底吃的是什麼肉，\n\n\n\n  誰知道呢？\n\n\n\n  哪怕他明確地和你分析了一遍心理暗示的事情，但這是開誠布公還是欲蓋彌彰？\n\n\n\n  說不清楚的。\n\n\n\n  正如周澤眼前的一幕一樣，\n\n\n\n  聽完了周澤的話，\n\n\n\n  林醫生只是笑了笑，然後點了點頭，周澤看見她的眼眶有些泛紅，仿佛帶著一種心碎，她花了很多很多的時間去調整自己的情緒，去開解自己。\n\n\n\n  在剛剛的飯桌上，她決定拋下之前的包袱，嘗試去和周澤相處，而周澤拒絕了，緊接著，她聽到了周澤真正的分手話語。\n\n\n\n  她失去了自己法律上的丈夫，哪怕她的丈夫還活著，她失去了自己喜歡的人，因為喜歡的人說不想再繼續這段羈絆。\n\n\n\n  她就像是一葉扁舟，在海浪之中不斷地浮浮沉沉。\n\n\n\n  聽自己父母的話，聽來自家庭的話語，聽周澤的話，聽導師的話，她堅強地活著，活得也很堅強。\n\n\n\n  命運，對她進行了捉弄，\n\n\n\n  有些東西，執著過，追求過，克服過，但終究，還是會錯過。\n\n\n\n  「離婚協議，我明天送來，你同意吧？」周澤看著林醫生。\n\n\n\n  就像是遊客隔著柵欄看著動物園裡的老虎。 \n\n\n\n  很複雜的情緒，\n\n\n\n  只要她沒有真正揭示自己的真面目，\n\n\n\n  這種複雜就會在周澤心裡繼續持續下去。\n\n\n\n  這畢竟，\n\n\n\n  是一個看臉的社會，\n\n\n\n  她又長得這麼好看。\n\n\n\n  對吧，\n\n\n\n  抽徐大川時，反正他一臉褶子，抽得沒有絲毫心理壓力。\n\n\n\n  但你讓周澤現在拿一個東西，抽林醫生，\n\n\n\n  還真下不去手。\n\n\n\n  「可以，我們離婚吧。」林醫生抬起頭，看著周澤，「你也可以開始你的新的生活。」\n\n\n\n  你同意了？\n\n\n\n  你真的同意了？\n\n\n\n  你真的真的同意了？\n\n\n\n  周澤看著林醫生，\n\n\n\n  生怕下一個瞬間，林醫生就直接翻臉，然後對自己出手，告訴自己，玩具就該有玩具的覺悟！\n\n\n\n  但林醫生的一切表現，都顯得那麼的自然，自然得讓周澤都覺得有些不真實。\n\n\n\n  她是導演，\n\n\n\n  同時，\n\n\n\n  也是演員？\n\n\n\n  「徐樂死了。」周澤開口道，「和你有關係麼？」 \n\n\n\n  該問的，終究是要問的。\n\n\n\n  林醫生點點頭。\n\n\n\n  在她看來，命運似乎是一場捉弄摩人的遊戲，是她的執念，釀造出了這場悲劇。\n\n\n\n  「其實，這一切，可能都是我的錯，是我異想天開了，才讓命運開了這樣子的一場玩笑。\n\n\n\n  你說得對，\n\n\n\n  現在是讓玩笑結束的時候了。」\n\n\n\n  「姐，你哭了？」\n\n\n\n  小姨子這個時候走上樓梯，看見自己的姐姐在哭。\n\n\n\n  「沒事，灰塵進眼睛裡了。」\n\n\n\n  林醫生不想讓自己妹妹看見自己這一幕，直接推開臥室門走入了臥室，小姨子瞪了周澤一眼，也跟著自己的姐姐進了臥室。\n\n\n\n  周澤長舒一口氣，\n\n\n\n  這一刻，\n\n\n\n  他感覺自己有些輕鬆，\n\n\n\n  像是卸下了一個很重的擔子。\n\n\n\n  她承認了，\n\n\n\n  她也同意結束了，\n\n\n\n  結束，就結束了吧。\n\n\n\n  自己反正回不到上輩子的生活了，該死的人，也都死了，除了這個女人。\n\n\n\n  但捫心自問， \n\n\n\n  真給自己機會去殺了她，自己能否真的下得去手？\n\n\n\n  而殺她的目的，僅僅是為了發泄怒火麼？\n\n\n\n  走入了衛生間，\n\n\n\n  周澤掬起一捧水拍在自己的臉上，\n\n\n\n  涼意襲來，讓人頭腦也變得清晰了一些。\n\n\n\n  結束了，\n\n\n\n  結束了，\n\n\n\n  終於結束了，\n\n\n\n  自己等會兒回到書店，不再去理會這個「徐樂」的身份帶給自己的任何紛擾，準備過自己的日子。\n\n\n\n  做鬼差，\n\n\n\n  轉正，\n\n\n\n  上輩子的自己當醫生能一步一步地往上爬，\n\n\n\n  這輩子，\n\n\n\n  無非是換了一個環境，\n\n\n\n  但卻是相同的職場。\n\n\n\n  抬起頭，\n\n\n\n  周澤看見鏡子裡自己身後還站著一個人，\n\n\n\n  是小姨子。\n\n\n\n  「你讓我姐姐哭了，她哭得很傷心。」\n\n\n\n  「這裡的事很複雜，不是你這種小孩子可以理解的。」\n\n\n\n  周澤拿起一條毛巾，擦著自己的臉。 \n\n\n\n  卻在這時，\n\n\n\n  周澤愣住了，\n\n\n\n  停住了自己現在所有的動作，\n\n\n\n  他看見鏡子裡的小姨子，\n\n\n\n  頭部向左側彎到一個極為誇張的程度，是一個正常人根本做不到的程度，\n\n\n\n  她的臉，和左肩膀緊緊地貼合在一起，整張臉傾斜了標準地九十度，但身子卻依舊站得比比直直。\n\n\n\n  「我知道我姐姐喜歡你，\n\n\n\n  我知道我姐姐不喜歡徐樂，\n\n\n\n  我知道姐姐不想讓爸媽傷心不願意破壞這個婚姻，\n\n\n\n  我為了讓姐姐開心，\n\n\n\n  讓徐樂死了，\n\n\n\n  讓你死了再回來，\n\n\n\n  讓你變成了徐樂。\n\n\n\n  我做了這一切，原本姐姐應該會開心的，\n\n\n\n  你，\n\n\n\n  居然又讓她傷心了，\n\n\n\n  呵呵……」",

    "content": "夜色朦朧，臥室里，剛剛一個人在臥室里哭泣的林醫生此時正側躺在床上，柳眉微蹙，已然入睡，不過在眉宇之間，仿佛有一團黑色的光圈籠罩。\n\n\n\n  她不想睡，也得睡。\n\n\n\n  她的妹妹，不想讓接下來的事情驚擾到她。\n\n\n\n  而在一牆之隔的衛生間裡，周澤手裡繼續拿著毛巾；\n\n\n\n  小姨子歪著頭，身子站得比比直直，繼續盯著他。\n\n\n\n  畫風，\n\n\n\n  在此時似乎凝固，而且沉重到仿佛水墨畫上墨跡嚴重已經開始有滴漏出來的趨勢。\n\n\n\n  周澤沒想過會是她，真的從沒想過。\n\n\n\n  在周澤看來，她只是一個涉世未深的孩子，帶著點驕橫，也帶著點天真爛漫，再加上，她之前曾在這個衛生間裡，因為打開門，撞見自己那次因為在醫院救人而遭受反噬的情形，直接被嚇尿了。\n\n\n\n  如果這也是演技的一種，\n\n\n\n  未免太拼了。\n\n\n\n  而且，她所說的理由，看起來很成立，實際上，卻很牽強，當然，可能有些人的腦迴路，就是這般的奇異獨特。\n\n\n\n  她只有自己單獨的世界觀，只在乎自己的感受，只體會自己所認知的對錯，\n\n\n\n  這個世界， \n\n\n\n  是有七十億人還是只有一個人，對於她來說，沒有任何的區別。\n\n\n\n  小姨子開始往前走，\n\n\n\n  周澤是她送給自己姐姐的禮物，是為了逗弄自己姐姐開心的禮物，而眼下，這個禮物，卻讓自己姐姐更加傷心了。\n\n\n\n  作為一個禮物，他不合格。\n\n\n\n  不合格的東西，\n\n\n\n  就得丟棄，\n\n\n\n  就得銷毀，\n\n\n\n  他也就沒有繼續存在的必要了。\n\n\n\n  周澤放下了毛巾，十指之間有黑色的指甲慢慢地長出。\n\n\n\n  「嗡！」\n\n\n\n  一聲顫音傳來，\n\n\n\n  周澤只感覺自己耳膜一陣劇烈的刺痛，視線也是一陣模糊，而後，那張歪著頭的臉，已經出現在了自己的跟前。\n\n\n\n  她歪著頭看著自己，帶著少女的天真爛漫，殘留著稚氣未脫的可愛純真。\n\n\n\n  「啪！」\n\n\n\n  胸口的衣服裂開，周澤整個人倒飛出去，撞碎了身後的鏡子，胸口位置更是出現了一條血淋淋的傷口，鮮血汩汩流出。\n\n\n\n  「為什麼，就不能好好過下去呢。」\n\n\n\n  小姨子喃喃自語，\n\n\n\n  而後， \n\n\n\n  周澤身上再度出現了一聲脆響，若非周澤下意識地側過身，可能自己的脖子已經斷落了下來，但饒是如此，在脖頸位置，也是出現了一道清晰的血口。\n\n\n\n  「為什麼，就不能好好在一起呢。」\n\n\n\n  小姨子嘴角含笑，\n\n\n\n  她像是在問周澤，\n\n\n\n  也像是在問自己，\n\n\n\n  但本質都是一樣，\n\n\n\n  那就是她根本就沒準備收到什麼回答。\n\n\n\n  「你是鬼差？」周澤有些不能理解，「如果你是鬼差，你怎麼可以肆意殺這麼多人。」\n\n\n\n  小姨子沒有理會，只是嘴角的笑容更加濃郁。\n\n\n\n  周澤瞳孔一縮，身體向前側翻出去，他身後的洗臉池和衛生間裡的所有玻璃在此時集體炸裂開。\n\n\n\n  「啪！」\n\n\n\n  四周，到處都是疾射而出的玻璃碎片，讓這個狹窄的衛生間，一下子變得美輪美奐。\n\n\n\n  血絲揮舞，\n\n\n\n  琉璃亂閃，\n\n\n\n  這是一個拍婚紗照的完美取景點，\n\n\n\n  只要新娘不要害怕被毀容。\n\n\n\n  「你們，事情怎麼就這麼多呢？」\n\n\n\n  小姨子舉起手， \n\n\n\n  也就在此時，\n\n\n\n  周澤的手也伸了過來，\n\n\n\n  鋒銳的黑色指甲直接刺向小姨子的掌心。\n\n\n\n  然而，原本鋒銳的指甲在此時卻一下子變成了「繞指柔」，小姨子的掌心皮膚吹彈可破，而周澤的指甲卻根本刺不進去。\n\n\n\n  「你們，就不能讓我省點心麼？」\n\n\n\n  小姨子手指一抓，在外人看來，是和周澤直接十指緊扣。\n\n\n\n  而後，\n\n\n\n  周澤體會到了一股鑽心的疼，\n\n\n\n  十指連心，\n\n\n\n  而眼下周澤的指甲蓋正在慢慢地翻離而起，就像是有人拿著一柄鉗子正在幫你拔指甲一樣，那種牽連自靈魂深處的疼痛，更是讓人絕望，完全超出了肉體折磨的界限。\n\n\n\n  一直以來，對於周澤來說，無往不利的指甲，在小姨子面前，徹底失去了往日的威風。\n\n\n\n  小姨子嘴角的笑意更加濃郁，\n\n\n\n  「居然用我給你的東西，來對付我？」\n\n\n\n  下一刻，\n\n\n\n  小姨子的指尖也長出了黑色的長指甲，並且直接刺入了周澤的掌心之中。\n\n\n\n  先是指甲剝離身體的痛苦，緊接著是自己被指甲刺入身體的酷刑， \n\n\n\n  這種以前是由自己施加給別人的懲罰，現在第一次落到了周澤自己本人身上。\n\n\n\n  「我沒錯，錯的，是你們。」\n\n\n\n  小姨子繼續喃喃自語，而後推著周澤往前。\n\n\n\n  「好好的日子，為什麼不過？」\n\n\n\n  「嗡！」\n\n\n\n  周澤整個人被彈飛出去，撞在了牆壁上，右手位置的五指上，鮮血淋漓，血肉翻滾，更是有五個指甲洞，觸目驚心。\n\n\n\n  「我費了那麼多的心思，為什麼你們，就不能好好過……日子呢？」\n\n\n\n  小姨子不停地在自我詢問著，\n\n\n\n  像是一個好奇寶寶，\n\n\n\n  但她此時的形象，真的一點都不可愛。\n\n\n\n  「咔嚓…………」\n\n\n\n  小姨子抬起手臂，\n\n\n\n  她距離周澤還有半米，\n\n\n\n  但周澤卻感知到仿佛有一隻手已經掐住了自己的脖子，將自己給提了起來，脖頸位置的刺痛和焦灼是那麼的清晰，而且自己也已經無法呼吸。\n\n\n\n  雙腳已經離地，自己就像是一隻被架在火刑架上的囚徒，等待著來自面前命運的審判。\n\n\n\n  歪頭，\n\n\n\n  微笑， \n\n\n\n  「又是誰，給了你勇氣，讓你在知道事情背後的影子後，依然敢過來質詢。\n\n\n\n  你只是我掌心裡操控下的一隻木偶，\n\n\n\n  誰給了你可以去反抗的幻想？」\n\n\n\n  「額…………額…………」\n\n\n\n  周澤想發出一些聲音，想說話，但因為脖子被死死地卡住，周澤根本發不出什麼清晰的音節。\n\n\n\n  作為一個死囚，\n\n\n\n  你連臨終遺言的權力，都已經被剝奪。\n\n\n\n  小姨子是在問問題，但她沒給你回答的資格。\n\n\n\n  「林憶，我盡力了，但這個遊戲，真的沒那麼好玩。」\n\n\n\n  小姨子自言自語，\n\n\n\n  而後，\n\n\n\n  她換了另一個方向，\n\n\n\n  繼續，\n\n\n\n  歪頭。\n\n\n\n  「你的姐姐還是不開心呢，你的姐姐，好煩呢。」\n\n\n\n  緊接著，\n\n\n\n  她又再度另一個方向歪頭，\n\n\n\n  「我們殺了他之後，再把你姐姐也殺了，我們就沒有煩惱了，\n\n\n\n  對不呢？」\n\n\n\n  周澤只感覺自己脖頸位置的力量陡然加重， \n\n\n\n  那種恐怖的窒息感鋪天蓋地般襲來，\n\n\n\n  肺部一陣灼痛，幾乎快要炸開。\n\n\n\n  他的眼睛，開始泛白，身體的痙攣已經無法克制，這是臨死的徵兆，是身體徹底走向死亡的預告。\n\n\n\n  而前方的小姨子，不停地換著方向九十度歪頭，自言自語，像是在和另一個人交流著什麼。\n\n\n\n  就像是兩個背著小豬佩奇雙肩包的小女生一起站在抓娃娃機面前，\n\n\n\n  商量著抓哪個娃娃，\n\n\n\n  哪個娃娃容易抓出來，\n\n\n\n  哪個娃娃看起來更可愛，\n\n\n\n  「咳咳…………咳咳…………」\n\n\n\n  咳嗽聲傳來，\n\n\n\n  小姨子有些意外地抬起頭，看向了上面的周澤，\n\n\n\n  她有些意外，\n\n\n\n  還沒死？\n\n\n\n  而後，\n\n\n\n  她臉上的笑容慢慢地凝重下來，\n\n\n\n  「你這是怎麼回事？」\n\n\n\n  是的，\n\n\n\n  你這是怎麼回事？\n\n\n\n  周澤的雙眸開始泛起綠光，身上古銅色的光澤開始慢慢擴散出去，右手之前被扳斷的指甲竟然重新長了出來。 \n\n\n\n  這一次，沒有之前的黑，但上上下下卻顯露出一種歲月滄桑的色澤。\n\n\n\n  周澤嘴唇張開，\n\n\n\n  兩顆獠牙慢慢地露了出來，\n\n\n\n  青面獠牙，\n\n\n\n  陰森可怖，帶著人憎鬼厭的氣息。\n\n\n\n  原本束縛住周澤脖子的力量在此時忽然消散，周澤慢慢地落地，蹲下，一隻手撐著破損的瓷磚，而後，慢慢地抬起頭。\n\n\n\n  那一雙妖異的綠色眸子，死死地盯著前面歪頭的小姨子。\n\n\n\n  「這是什麼意思？」\n\n\n\n  「這又是怎麼回事？」\n\n\n\n  她迷茫了，\n\n\n\n  因為她造就出的玩具，或者說她親自選擇打包好送給自己姐姐的禮物，竟然出現了她意想不到的變化。\n\n\n\n  一個，她始料未及的變化。\n\n\n\n  「啊…………」\n\n\n\n  沙啞的聲音自周澤的喉嚨里傳來，他雙臂慢慢地撐開，整個人也慢慢地站起來，\n\n\n\n  很慢，\n\n\n\n  但是很堅定，\n\n\n\n  和上次一樣，\n\n\n\n  周澤身上一半肌膚呈現出古銅色，另外大半的肌膚則開始破損和綻裂，鮮血開始慢慢地流出。 \n\n\n\n  歪著頭的小姨子看著周澤一步一步地走向自己，\n\n\n\n  她有些迷茫，\n\n\n\n  也有些無措，\n\n\n\n  「你是周澤？」\n\n\n\n  這一次，小姨子是需要周澤回答的，\n\n\n\n  而現在，周澤懶得給她任何的回答。\n\n\n\n  小姨子伸出手，但這一次周澤沒被彈飛出去，他依舊穩穩地一步一步走來，\n\n\n\n  就這樣，\n\n\n\n  走到了她的面前。\n\n\n\n  小姨子的指甲刺向了周澤的身體，\n\n\n\n  「噗！」\n\n\n\n  指甲刺入了進去，\n\n\n\n  然而，\n\n\n\n  指甲才剛剛刺入肌膚，頃刻間，傷口位置的肌肉開始瞬間收縮，將小姨子的指甲死死地固定在了體內。\n\n\n\n  她想要拔出來，\n\n\n\n  卻根本拔不動，\n\n\n\n  仿佛裡面有無數張小嘴正在吮吸著自己的指甲，\n\n\n\n  很緊，\n\n\n\n  很壓抑。\n\n\n\n  小姨子看著周澤，看著那一雙綠色的眼眸，她臉上露出了一抹明悟之色，喃喃道：\n\n\n\n  「你……你之前居然就是死人了……」 \n\n\n\n  而周澤伸手，\n\n\n\n  抓住了小姨子的腦袋，\n\n\n\n  小姨子想反抗，卻反抗不得。\n\n\n\n  「咔嚓咔嚓…………」\n\n\n\n  像是骨骼慢慢地挪動的摩擦聲響，\n\n\n\n  周澤的手抓住小姨子的腦袋，\n\n\n\n  沒有捏爆，\n\n\n\n  沒有刺入，\n\n\n\n  而是慢慢地把她歪著的臉，\n\n\n\n  給扳正回來。\n\n\n\n  呼，\n\n\n\n  臉正了，\n\n\n\n  看起來，\n\n\n\n  就舒服多了。",

    "content": "兩張臉，\n\n\n\n  對視著，\n\n\n\n  小姨子很想反抗，但是她的臉在周澤手掌之下，一點反抗的餘地都沒有。\n\n\n\n  這一刻，\n\n\n\n  她體會到了當初天台上青衣娘娘的感覺。\n\n\n\n  你縱有千般變化，也無處下口。\n\n\n\n  殭屍，是由死而生的一種存在，他之所以被神憎鬼厭，是因為他不在原本的遊戲規則里，是一個異數。\n\n\n\n  就像是大家都不剪辮子你卻已剪了辮子時，\n\n\n\n  就像是大家都剪了辮子你卻還留著辮子時，\n\n\n\n  和大家不同，自然就會被討厭和排斥。\n\n\n\n  周澤慢慢地張開嘴，\n\n\n\n  兩顆獠牙顯露而出，帶來森然的壓迫。\n\n\n\n  小姨子皺著眉頭，她的身體在顫抖，也在惶恐。\n\n\n\n  原本屬於自己的一場遊戲，卻走向了她不可控的方向，甚至，連她自己都得不得被捲入其中，現在，想拔掉電源關閉遊戲都不可能了。\n\n\n\n  她不知道自己到底放出了怎樣的一個怪胎，甚至，她也確信，周澤自己可能都不清楚他其實是一個怪胎。\n\n\n\n  這是一個美麗的誤會，也是一個讓人猝不及防的地雷， \n\n\n\n  很不幸，\n\n\n\n  她踩上去了，\n\n\n\n  而且還在地雷上跳了一段拉丁舞。\n\n\n\n  獠牙慢慢地下壓，已經觸及到了小姨子的脖頸肌膚，\n\n\n\n  那光滑的肌膚，\n\n\n\n  那柔嫩的表皮，\n\n\n\n  帶著少女的靈動，\n\n\n\n  孕育著青春的氣息，\n\n\n\n  多少少男渴望在這裡一親芳澤，\n\n\n\n  多少少男渴望在這裡留下自己的牙印；\n\n\n\n  「我是她，她也是我。」\n\n\n\n  小姨子開口道，\n\n\n\n  「你咬死我，她也死了。」\n\n\n\n  這是威脅，\n\n\n\n  一種迫不得已的威脅，\n\n\n\n  如果不是情況已經危急到急切的地步，小姨子不會開口這般威脅。\n\n\n\n  因為這等於是自己在向一個玩具低頭，在向一個玩具求饒，\n\n\n\n  她有自己的尊嚴，\n\n\n\n  但尊嚴在生命受到威脅的時刻，一下子又變得分文不值。\n\n\n\n  周澤愣了一下，綠色的眼眸帶著妖異的光芒在小姨子臉上掃了掃，像是在猶豫，像是在思考，也像是在盤桓。 \n\n\n\n  然後，\n\n\n\n  他抬起頭，讓自己的獠牙和其肌膚距離拉遠了一點，先前濃郁到令人窒息的壓迫感也一下子變淡了許多。\n\n\n\n  小姨子長舒一口氣，一種死裡逃生的感覺襲來，讓她有些眩暈。\n\n\n\n  然後，\n\n\n\n  周澤又猛地低下頭！\n\n\n\n  「噗！」\n\n\n\n  沒有任何的前戲，\n\n\n\n  也沒有給你過多的心理準備，\n\n\n\n  就這樣，帶著乾澀，帶著鋒銳，帶著粗壯，\n\n\n\n  帶著堅硬，\n\n\n\n  直接進入！\n\n\n\n  之前抬頭的動作，更像是一種玩弄，一種調侃，一種欲蓋彌彰，一種……**。\n\n\n\n  如同在說：\n\n\n\n  我只是在外面蹭蹭，不進去，放心吧，\n\n\n\n  然後，\n\n\n\n  剛猛地直入！\n\n\n\n  毫不憐惜，\n\n\n\n  也不懂憐惜到底是什麼意思。\n\n\n\n  獠牙刺入，\n\n\n\n  鮮血和體液開始迸濺，\n\n\n\n  人的身體，在這種時候會顯得很是脆弱。\n\n\n\n  小姨子的頭還是被周澤用手壓著，她臉上呈現出一種極為痛苦的表情，眼眸深處，也出現了慌亂和掙扎； \n\n\n\n  先前的淡定，早就無影無蹤。\n\n\n\n  之前，她在衛生間裡，\n\n\n\n  一邊自問自答，\n\n\n\n  一邊將周澤逼上了絕路，\n\n\n\n  現在，\n\n\n\n  出來混的，總是要還的。\n\n\n\n  殭屍其實不吃人，也不喝人血的。\n\n\n\n  早期的古人小說志怪記載里，鮮有提及殭屍吃人吃人血，而現代大家對殭屍的認知很多是來自港片時代的殭屍片，不過當時受到了一些歐美電影裡喪屍的影響，加入了這些設定。\n\n\n\n  周澤並沒有吮吸對方的鮮血，他只是很享受這種感覺，通過自己的獠牙，將自己的意志注入對方的體內。\n\n\n\n  這是一種主權的宣誓，這是一種最直接的報復，\n\n\n\n  讓自己的氣息，凌駕於對方之上，\n\n\n\n  折磨她，\n\n\n\n  撕咬她，\n\n\n\n  將她剛剛施加給自己的東西，\n\n\n\n  盡數奉還！\n\n\n\n  「啊啊啊啊啊啊啊！！！！！！！！！！！」\n\n\n\n  小姨子身上，忽然升騰出一縷黑氣，這些黑氣慢慢地凝實出一具黑衣女人的身形。\n\n\n\n  女人一出來，四周的溫度就開始降低，甚至還出現了白霜。 \n\n\n\n  你可以說這是大BOSS出場時的特效和排場，\n\n\n\n  但實際上，這是女人靈魂力量收不住在揮發的徵兆，她就像是一塊離開冰櫃的冰，雖然依舊散發著寒意，但根本支撐不了多久。\n\n\n\n  「吼！」\n\n\n\n  周澤撤開自己的獠牙，小姨子脖頸位置的傷口瞬間結疤，一滴血都沒流出來。\n\n\n\n  手鬆開，\n\n\n\n  小姨子的身體直接落在了地上，\n\n\n\n  摔得發出「咚」的一聲，\n\n\n\n  沒有任何的可憐，也沒有任何的顧慮，\n\n\n\n  哪怕這個女孩摔成一個智障，\n\n\n\n  也和周澤沒絲毫的關係。\n\n\n\n  女人的靈魂在慢慢地萎靡，她似乎很想再度進入這具身體，但周澤就站在下面，她不敢下去。\n\n\n\n  同一時間，在女人身邊，有一道冊子正在飛舞，那是和周澤身上所擁有的一模一樣的冊子，這枚冊子意味著女人的身份，\n\n\n\n  她也是一個鬼差。\n\n\n\n  不過，女人的冊子已經近乎泛白，破損不堪，乃至於在飛舞時，還不斷地掉落下碎屑，顯然早就不堪重負了。\n\n\n\n  「我也是鬼差，你不能殺我。」\n\n\n\n  女人戰戰兢兢地說道，她不是怕周澤到這種地步，而是她覺得無比的寒冷。 \n\n\n\n  脫離了肉身的她，\n\n\n\n  就像是一個普通人脫光了衣服站在南極冰川上一樣，\n\n\n\n  那種滋味，真的不是說靠精神意志力就能夠抵禦得了的。\n\n\n\n  周澤抬起頭，\n\n\n\n  看著她，\n\n\n\n  嘴巴微微張開，\n\n\n\n  像是在笑，\n\n\n\n  而後，\n\n\n\n  周澤慢慢地，\n\n\n\n  歪頭。\n\n\n\n  骨節不斷地發出著脆響，\n\n\n\n  但頭還是歪了下來，\n\n\n\n  嘲諷，\n\n\n\n  最直接的嘲諷。\n\n\n\n  女人的身上慢慢地開始浮現出淡藍的火焰，她的靈魂正在被冰化，漸漸地失去活性，她很冷，迫切地需要一個溫暖的港灣。\n\n\n\n  她等不及了，也沒辦法再等待了。\n\n\n\n  biu！\n\n\n\n  她身形向下，企圖再度進入小姨子的體內。\n\n\n\n  「吼！」\n\n\n\n  周澤手臂揮舞過去，沒之前顏色通透但看起來更富有滄桑感的指甲直接掃中了女人，女人發出了一聲厲嘯，最後被周澤強行抓住，拘在了面前。\n\n \n\n  女人的腰，是真的只手可握，不是說女人的身材有多好有多誇張，而是意味著女人的靈魂體在周澤的手掌鉗制下不停地被蹂躪翻轉。\n\n\n\n  「放過我，我是鬼差！」\n\n\n\n  女人咆哮道。\n\n\n\n  周澤把嘴張大，\n\n\n\n  然後手掌開始向嘴邊送，\n\n\n\n  女人的掙扎和咆哮更加地劇烈，她已經預感到了即將發生什麼，同時，她也明白過來一件事，眼前的這個男人，已經失去了所有的神智，現在的他，只是靠著一種本能在行事。\n\n\n\n  他餓了，\n\n\n\n  他身體很疼，\n\n\n\n  他軀體很破舊，\n\n\n\n  就像是一個人生病了，養傷時需要進補一樣，\n\n\n\n  他現在也需要進補。\n\n\n\n  這具身體，根本沒辦法承受他現在的形態。\n\n\n\n  「我是鬼差，無論做過什麼都只有陰司才能審判我，你不能，你不能！\n\n\n\n  你想好承受這種代價了麼，\n\n\n\n  你給我醒醒，\n\n\n\n  給我醒醒！」\n\n\n\n  這就像是《西遊記》裡面對猴哥的金箍棒，走投無路的妖怪開始自報家門讓自家菩薩或者仙尊領自己回去一樣，這是在表露自己的後台。 \n\n\n\n  然而，\n\n\n\n  在那之前，\n\n\n\n  周澤也是一名鬼差，雖然是臨時工，\n\n\n\n  但女人依舊是準備殺了他的。\n\n\n\n  殺了他，再殺了林醫生，\n\n\n\n  身體裡的另一個意志，就不會再干擾自己了。\n\n\n\n  周澤的手停下了，\n\n\n\n  沒有把對方的靈魂繼續往自己嘴裡送。\n\n\n\n  女人看著周澤，還是很緊張，有了之前的一次教訓，她不會再有自己逃出生天的幻想。\n\n\n\n  周澤捏著女人，開始移動，\n\n\n\n  他的腳步每次落下，都在地板上留下了一道經久不散的黑色印記，他走下了樓，他來到了廚房。\n\n\n\n  綠色瞳孔的眼眸在廚房裡逡巡，\n\n\n\n  然後，\n\n\n\n  他找到了，\n\n\n\n  一罐老乾媽。\n\n\n\n  他將罐子捏碎，裡面的辣醬全都遺留在手中，\n\n\n\n  先將辣醬送入自己嘴裡，\n\n\n\n  而後，\n\n\n\n  周澤再度舉起抓住女人的手，\n\n\n\n  張開嘴，\n\n\n\n  將女人的靈魂送入了自己的嘴裡。 \n\n\n\n  女人最後的慘叫和咒罵，\n\n\n\n  仿佛進餐時周圍音響里所播放的抒情樂曲，給人的進餐帶來了一種異樣的情調。\n\n\n\n  吞入腹中之後，\n\n\n\n  周澤撐開雙臂，\n\n\n\n  「嗝………………」\n\n\n\n  一個沉沉的嗝兒響起，\n\n\n\n  噓服了，\n\n\n\n  滿足了，\n\n\n\n  飽了，\n\n\n\n  但好想再吃一個啊。\n\n\n\n  ………………\n\n\n\n  「你之前怎麼不早說！」\n\n\n\n  白鶯鶯在車裡罵道。\n\n\n\n  唐詩沒搭理這頭接近暴走的女屍，而是繼續剝開大白兔奶糖的衣服送入自己嘴裡，\n\n\n\n  「他之前自己沒細問，不感興趣。\n\n\n\n  而且，\n\n\n\n  我怎麼知道通城另一個鬼差居然就在他老婆家裡？」\n\n\n\n  「好了，姑奶奶們，到了，到了！」\n\n\n\n  老道還是司機，\n\n\n\n  他回到書店後說起周澤的行蹤，\n\n\n\n  讓唐詩聽到了，\n\n\n\n  然後這個不是秘密的秘密才被公開，再接下來打周澤的手機打不通，眾人這才趕過來。 \n\n\n\n  許清朗坐在副駕駛位置，一臉陰沉。\n\n\n\n  車停了下來，\n\n\n\n  眾人下了車往裡走，\n\n\n\n  白鶯鶯走在第一個，\n\n\n\n  當她走到樓道口時，\n\n\n\n  白鶯鶯忽然停下了腳步，\n\n\n\n  她在前面不遠處，感應到了一種熟悉的氣息，仿佛自己體內的煞氣都因此受到牽引而開始顫慄起來。\n\n\n\n  「你怎麼了？」\n\n\n\n  唐詩見白鶯鶯不走了，問道。\n\n\n\n  白鶯鶯緊咬嘴唇，\n\n\n\n  裡面的那種呼應的氣息越來越明顯，而且似乎還提升到了一個巔峰，比之前更加地清晰和刺激。\n\n\n\n  這種血統和種族羈絆之間的聯繫，像是一道道電流不停地在她身上流竄。\n\n\n\n  她下意識地夾緊雙腿，\n\n\n\n  顫聲道：\n\n\n\n  「人家下面忽然，\n\n\n\n  好癢啊！」",

    "content": "叮咚……\n\n\n\n  像是石頭落入水裡的聲音，很清脆，也很悅耳，原本的平靜，也因此泛起陣陣漣漪。\n\n\n\n  周澤發現自己正躺在一座水潭上，身下，是水面，而這水面像是玻璃一樣，承載著他的身體。\n\n\n\n  周遭的一切，一開始有些模糊，但慢慢地開始變得清晰起來，清晰之後，就是熟悉。\n\n\n\n  遠處，\n\n\n\n  黃泉路上不管什麼時候都是人來人往，因為哪怕沒有世界大戰或者瘟疫，在這個世界上，每時每刻也都是在死著人的。\n\n\n\n  很多影視劇里常有一句台詞：我怕你黃泉路上太孤單，我（或者送誰）下去陪你。\n\n\n\n  實際上，這個根本就不用擔心。\n\n\n\n  當你下去時，你會發現黃泉路上很擠，而且，你身邊會出現很多白人兄弟黑人兄弟男女老少，都有。\n\n\n\n  環肥燕瘦，英俊風流，醜陋不堪，等等外相，不能阻止你會死這個既定規律；\n\n\n\n  王侯將相風光起，終究一個土饅頭。\n\n\n\n  不過，大部分人下了黃泉之後是感知不到寂寞這回事兒的，大家都像是沒有形體的行屍走肉，一點一點地往前走，隨著大流。\n\n\n\n  如果將陽間比作一個工廠的車間，而地獄，則是這裡的廢料收集和原料轉化的後續工廠，比起陽間的眼花繚亂，地獄更講究一種規則和秩序， \n\n\n\n  一種讓你絕望，讓你無奈，卻又如同鐵一般存在的秩序。\n\n\n\n  周澤慢慢地站起身，\n\n\n\n  這是夢吧，\n\n\n\n  自己，\n\n\n\n  應該沒有死。\n\n\n\n  腦海中沒有太多的記憶，只是記得自己在小姨子的面前差點死掉了，然後，就像是喝醉了酒，再度斷片。\n\n\n\n  就跟上次在天台上一模一樣，仿佛自己已經交託出去了身體，交託出了一切。\n\n\n\n  周澤不想死，尤其在這個時候，如果可以選擇的話，周澤寧願選擇和那些「行屍走肉」一樣，一直麻木地走下去，走到下一個終點或者起點。\n\n\n\n  但現在，他沒有麻木，也沒有渾渾噩噩，如果死了，就得在理智之中承受這萬般孤寂的痛苦折磨。\n\n\n\n  就像是要進行一場曠日持久的大手術，\n\n\n\n  而醫生告訴你，\n\n\n\n  對不起，我們沒麻醉了。\n\n\n\n  掌心，貼在水潭上。\n\n\n\n  水潭是空的，在上面可以一眼看到下方，四周，畢竟清澈見底。\n\n\n\n  無面女還沒回來，但那邊的事情，也快有結果了。\n\n\n\n  小蘿莉，無面女，蓉城，終究要有一個結果了。 \n\n\n\n  環視四周，\n\n\n\n  周澤沒看見上次夢回這裡時所見到的那個帶著貓的男子，其實，周澤倒是挺期待能夠再見一次他的。\n\n\n\n  不知道為什麼，那個男人像是有種特殊的魔力，和他在一起時，能夠讓人覺得心安。\n\n\n\n  或許，這就是人格魅力？\n\n\n\n  行走在水面上，四周開始升騰起一陣霧靄，迷迷濛蒙的感覺開始緩緩地襲來，將這一切慢慢地包裹。\n\n\n\n  故地重遊，沒有驚喜，也沒有意外，一切好像都沒有變化，但周澤清楚，有變化的，好像是自己。\n\n\n\n  比如這一次，自己再夢回這裡時，好像變得從容得多了。\n\n\n\n  當濃霧徹底將一切籠罩時，\n\n\n\n  周澤感到眼睛一陣酸疼，然後，他聞到了泥土的腥味。\n\n\n\n  該死，\n\n\n\n  又是這泥土的味道。\n\n\n\n  睜開眼，周澤看見自己正躺在書店二樓的臥室里，老道跟那隻猴子坐在那裡玩著泥巴，然後開始往自己身上抹。\n\n\n\n  「嘿嘿，這樣捏才好，你看好，我給他捏個大胸肌！」\n\n\n\n  老道一邊對著猴子吹著牛一邊捏出了一個饅頭，然後準備給周澤貼上去。\n\n\n\n  能夠把治傷變成一場低俗的玩樂，也就只有老道能做出這種事兒了。 \n\n\n\n  只是，當老道準備貼的時候，看見床上的周澤居然睜開了眼，當即嚇得一愣，然後雙手拿著那個泥饅頭有些不知所措。\n\n\n\n  「好吃麼？」\n\n\n\n  周澤開口問道。\n\n\n\n  不知道為什麼，\n\n\n\n  這次的傷，應該比上次輕了不少，雖然不知道到底昏睡了多久，但至少醒來後就能直接說話了。\n\n\n\n  好吃麼？\n\n\n\n  老道還是僵在原地。\n\n\n\n  「好吃麼？」周澤又問道。\n\n\n\n  老道苦著臉，低下頭，咬了一口土饅頭，然後含著淚點點頭。\n\n\n\n  「香，真香。」\n\n\n\n  周澤撇過臉，沒再去看他。\n\n\n\n  老道趕忙將嘴裡的土吐出來，然後獻殷勤道：「老闆，你醒了啊，你真是嚇死我了，昏迷了三天啊。」\n\n\n\n  才三天麼，\n\n\n\n  上次昏迷多久來著？\n\n\n\n  只是，為什麼每次都要給自己身上抹泥巴？\n\n\n\n  周澤看了看床上的骯髒污漬以及自己身上的髒兮兮，對於一個有著潔癖的人來說，實在是有些不能忍：\n\n\n\n  「叫白鶯鶯來。」\n\n\n\n  「老闆，你餓了？」老道問道。 \n\n\n\n  「我想洗澡。」\n\n\n\n  「我來幫你洗吧老闆，以前老道去浴室抓鬼拯救蒼生時，曾去浴室搓過澡，技術棒棒的！」\n\n\n\n  老道拍了拍自己的胸脯。\n\n\n\n  「…………」周澤。\n\n\n\n  一邊的猴子捂著自己的嘴，「吱吱吱」的笑。\n\n\n\n  周澤很想說，你看，連猴子都在笑你，\n\n\n\n  你這人怎麼這會兒一點逼數都沒有？\n\n\n\n  「叫白鶯鶯。」\n\n\n\n  「不用，老闆，來，我背你去衛生間，貧道保證把你搓得白白嫩嫩的。」\n\n\n\n  說著老道就殷勤地準備抱起周澤下床。\n\n\n\n  如果周澤現在還有力氣，估計指甲已經長出來，\n\n\n\n  然後在老道身上開出好幾個新的出氣孔了。\n\n\n\n  只可惜，現在的周澤只是一個病嬌。\n\n\n\n  好在，白鶯鶯這個時候正好推門而入，手裡端著茶水，見周澤醒了，白鶯鶯驚喜地放下東西走到床邊。\n\n\n\n  周澤長舒一口氣。\n\n\n\n  …………\n\n\n\n  有了上次的經驗，白鶯鶯這次幫周澤洗澡顯得很是自然。\n\n\n\n  「林家的事，怎麼樣了？」 \n\n\n\n  周澤問道。\n\n\n\n  「老闆，我們去的時候，你已經昏迷在地上了，林家姐妹沒什麼大事兒，不過人家家裡亂作一團了，尤其是衛生間，玻璃瓷磚都碎了。\n\n\n\n  我們把你帶出來了，後來，林家那邊也沒人過來問什麼，我知道你要問的，林家小妹已經正常上學了，林醫生也去上班了。」\n\n\n\n  周澤點點頭，看著鏡子裡，自己的頭髮像是有些長了，對白鶯鶯道：「幫我把頭髮理一下，剪短一點。」\n\n\n\n  「好嘞。」\n\n\n\n  白鶯鶯出去拿了剪刀回來幫周澤理髮。\n\n\n\n  等一切都收拾得清清爽爽後，周澤被安置在了一張輪椅上，輪椅還是新的，鋥光瓦亮，而且還是電動的，帶著搖杆兒，像是遊樂園裡開的碰碰車。\n\n\n\n  「誰買的？」周澤一臉黑線。\n\n\n\n  「老闆，喜歡不，這是貧道特意給你準備的，想著你以後估計得經常用到，\n\n\n\n  所以就乾脆給您整了一個。\n\n\n\n  老闆，你看這裡，這個按鈕可以按下去的！」\n\n\n\n  老道像是獻寶一樣給周澤按下了那個按鈕，\n\n\n\n  然後整個輪椅開始發光，五顏六色的光，\n\n\n\n  「嗚嗚嗚嗚嗚」\n\n\n\n  還有火車汽笛音效。 \n\n\n\n  老道覺得周澤肯定會很滿意，\n\n\n\n  殊不知如果不是現在周澤身體實在是太虛弱，\n\n\n\n  他今天已經夠死兩次了。\n\n\n\n  沒選擇坐輪椅，周澤選擇坐在書店靠窗的一個軟沙發位置。\n\n\n\n  許清朗不在店裡，好像是他家裡有什麼事兒，先回去了，不過留下了很多的汁水，\n\n\n\n  說萬一周澤醒來了，可以吃。\n\n\n\n  日子，似乎又恢復了熟悉的節奏。\n\n\n\n  一番折騰下來，到頭來，並沒有改變什麼。\n\n\n\n  真相，很可笑，卻又是真實發生了。\n\n\n\n  或許，\n\n\n\n  真正探究清楚小姨子身上那個鬼差亡魂的事兒，得等到小蘿莉回來才能清楚了，作為原本同在一個城市裡的鬼差，你說小蘿莉對那個鬼差一點都不清楚，顯然是不可能的。\n\n\n\n  當然，前提是小蘿莉還能回來。\n\n\n\n  周澤這個老闆就靠在沙發上隔著玻璃曬著太陽，白鶯鶯則負責招呼著客人，許清朗雖然不在，但普通的糕點和飲料白鶯鶯已經學會如何調配了。\n\n\n\n  在周澤隔壁桌，坐著兩個長頭髮的女人，不過聲音有點沙啞，也有點扭捏，兩個女人手裡一邊翻著時尚雜誌一邊聊著天，而且越聊越起勁。 \n\n\n\n  「我跟你說，我最近發現了一個很讓我擔心的事情。」\n\n\n\n  「說，你快說說。」\n\n\n\n  「上周，我注意到我放在家裡衛生間洗衣機上面等待洗的絲襪和罩子被動過了。」\n\n\n\n  「啊，誰動的？有人進你家的？會是小偷麼？」\n\n\n\n  「但家裡沒被偷東西啊，我一開始也以為是小偷來著，結果發現不是。」\n\n\n\n  「那是誰動的？」\n\n\n\n  「是小文，我那次注意到了，是小文，他在我洗完澡後，進了衛生間，然後等我再進去時，我發現我的絲襪和罩子以及其他內衣都被翻動過了，上面還有濕的痕跡。」\n\n\n\n  「啊。」\n\n\n\n  另一個女人捂住自己的嘴，\n\n\n\n  「小文怎麼會這樣？」\n\n\n\n  「我也很苦惱呢。」\n\n\n\n  「沒事啦，興許小文只是長大了，對女人的東西產生了一點好奇心，大部分男孩子都有這個階段的。」\n\n\n\n  「我上網查過，如果僅僅是這些問題也就算了。」\n\n\n\n  「也就算了？不能算啊，你得去嘗試引導他，讓他樹立正確的價值觀。」\n\n\n\n  「我原本打算和他開誠布公地談一談，但後來我又發現了一件事，那就是有次周末我提早下班回來，我看見在我的臥室里，小文在穿我平時穿的絲襪和文胸以及裙子，站在鏡子前照著鏡子。」 \n\n\n\n  「這…………」\n\n\n\n  「如果只是之前的事情就算了，我覺得我還能引導他一下，但現在事情已經變得很嚴重了，他居然穿我的衣服照鏡子，這顯然不是男孩子青春期的問題了。」\n\n\n\n  「哎，我兒子的電話，我接一下。」\n\n\n\n  女人接了電話，然後對閨蜜道：「不好意思，我兒子說餓了，我要回去餵飽他。」\n\n\n\n  「嗯，你快回去吧。」\n\n\n\n  「服務員，結帳。」\n\n\n\n  白鶯鶯走了過來，結了帳。\n\n\n\n  周澤看著那兩個長發女人走出店裡，若有所思。\n\n\n\n  「老闆，要給你再加點熱水麼？」白鶯鶯問道。\n\n\n\n  「不用了。」周澤搖搖頭，端起茶杯。\n\n\n\n  白鶯鶯一隻手叉著腰，另一隻手拿著錢，無奈道：\n\n\n\n  「剛那兩個男的真的是有病吧，明明是男的，結果把自己打扮成女人的樣子，還好老娘慧眼如炬。」\n\n\n\n  「咳咳…………」\n\n\n\n  正在喝水的周澤猛地嗆了起來。",
