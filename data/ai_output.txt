“Officer, excuse me, what’s my wife’s name again?” Zhou Ze merely thought this to himself. He wasn’t that stupid, but he genuinely didn’t know his “wife’s” real name. In this day and age, few people use their real names for QQ or WeChat.

The greasy man, however, gave Zhou Ze a resentful look. “Brother, that’s not cool. We said we’d be each other’s broken-winged angels, didn’t we?”

Zhou Ze returned a helpless glance. “I’m surprised too.”

The greasy man lowered his head, sighed, and murmured, “My dumplings are delicious.”

“Let’s go.” His “wife” said coolly, then turned and walked out.

Zhou Ze could only follow.

She drove a Porsche Cayenne and got straight into the car. Zhou Ze opened the car door and sat in the front passenger seat.

To be honest, it was a bit awkward. If that unfortunate guy, Xu Le, had a more normal marital and family life, then Zhou Ze wouldn't be in such a bind. Faced with his loving wife’s concern, he could have found excuses, like feeling dizzy and not remembering things. But this woman clearly had an ice queen vibe and seemed completely uninterested in him, even picking him up from the police station seemed like a mere formality.

It was like his dog got lost, was found by security, and he went to pick it up. That was the feeling.

The woman started the car. She was actually quite young, probably around the same age as himself (Xu Le), a few years younger than the original Zhou Ze. As the car drove onto the elevated highway, the woman finally broke the silence.

“Are you alright?”

“Oh, I’m fine,” Zhou Ze replied.

Then, silence again. The woman felt her husband was unusually quiet today, but she had no desire to explore why.

Just then, the woman’s phone rang. She put it on speaker, and the voice from the other end came through the car stereo: “Dr. Lin, there was just a school bus collision on Youth Central Road. Casualties are already being transported to our hospital. The director wants you to come back quickly.”

Zhou Ze was slightly stunned. So his wife was also a doctor, and her surname was “Lin.”

“I understand, I’ll be right back.” The woman hung up, exited the elevated highway at the next ramp, then made a sharp turn at the traffic light, heading towards the hospital. She didn’t ask Zhou Ze if he wanted to be dropped off at home or if he wanted to get out and take a taxi back himself. Instead, she drove the car straight into the Chuan District People’s Hospital parking lot.

Honestly, Zhou Ze was worried she’d tell him to get out and take a taxi home, imagining himself having to shamelessly ask, “Wife, where do we live again? I forgot.” He felt very silly.

The woman got out of the car, and Zhou Ze followed. The woman entered the hospital building and got into the elevator, and Zhou Ze followed her into the elevator. The woman entered the women’s locker room, and Zhou Ze... Zhou Ze sat down on a bench by the hallway.

Just then, the first batch of accident victims arrived. One was severely injured, and five other children also had serious injuries. Watching his “wife” change into a white lab coat and busy herself with treatment, Zhou Ze could only sit on the bench in a daze. It felt a bit like a mother bringing her son to work; the mother worked while the son watched and played by himself.

However, the unique smell of disinfectant in the hospital and the stuffy feeling of the central air conditioning were truly nostalgic—a familiar feeling.

The emergency room was ahead. The severely injured and critically ill patient seemed to be a girl. The accident involved a kindergarten school bus. Seeing children crying out in pain on the operating table, the scene was indeed heartbreaking. Zhou Ze pursed his lips. Usually, at this time, he would have already changed into his clothes and participated in the treatment. He was the most famous surgeon of the younger generation in Tongcheng, but now, he could only be a spectator.

This feeling was very uncomfortable, but he could only endure it. And this People’s Hospital was considered the best hospital on the surface in Tongcheng, with an unquestionable number and quality of doctors. They should be able to handle it.

Soon, the next batch of children was also brought in. Their injuries were lighter, only requiring wound treatment or simple bandaging. Traffic police officers were specifically guarding the entrance to this floor. Some parents who had been notified had already arrived, their emotions very agitated, but letting parents in at this time might interfere with the treatment work, so they could only be stopped.

Zhou Ze shook his head, stood up, walked to the innermost window sill in the hallway, reached out and propped open the window, then took out a cigarette from his pocket. He smoked, and Xu Le also smoked, so it was convenient at this moment.

“Uncle, you can’t smoke in the hospital.” Just as he bit the cigarette butt into his mouth, a clear little girl’s voice came from behind Zhou Ze.

Zhou Ze turned around and saw a little girl in a lily dress standing behind him, her mouth pouted, looking at him indignantly.

*Cough, cough*, a bit awkward. Zhou Ze could only put the cigarette away. No matter what, being lectured by a little girl about public morality was always a bit embarrassing.

“Little one, aren’t you cold wearing so little?” Zhou Ze bent down and asked.

The little girl’s skin was very delicate, with a touch of baby fat on her face and big eyes. She was very cute, like an enlarged Barbie doll.

“Not cold,” the little girl shook her head. “Uncle, you can’t smoke in the hospital anymore.”

“I know,” Zhou Ze nodded seriously.

“Are you alright?” Zhou Ze asked again.

“I’m fine. The other children are all injured, and they’re hurting a lot,” the little girl turned sideways and looked at the children behind her who were having their wounds bandaged. Most of them were crying, not necessarily because of unbearable pain, but because when one person cried, others followed suit.

Nurses were not only treating wounds but also coaxing the children, and the parents temporarily blocked by the traffic police outside were constantly shouting and swearing. In short, this floor felt chaotic.

“Then you are truly lucky,” Zhou Ze sighed.

The little girl had no scars on her body.

“Yes, I was sitting in the back row, so I’m fine.” The little girl nodded, then actively ran over to comfort her classmates, looking here and there, encouraging and comforting them. She was a very sensible and strong child.

Zhou Ze turned around, subconsciously took out a cigarette again, then thought better of it and put it back.

When he walked back to the bench and sat down, three nurses and two doctors came out of the emergency room ahead. One male doctor and one female doctor, the female doctor being his wife.

“It’s okay, we did our best.” The male doctor said, reaching out to put a hand on Zhou Ze’s wife’s shoulder to comfort her. As her husband, Zhou Ze was sitting there, but he wasn’t disgusted by this scene... The damned Xu Le had left him such a complicated mess: a live-in son-in-law, a very temperamental sister-in-law, and clearly ill-tempered in-laws. Zhou Ze wished his wife would cheat on him, divorce him, and then he could just be quiet by himself. Who, after just dying and being reborn into a new body, would want to bother with the complexities of a live-in son-in-law’s life in a modern city?

However, to Zhou Ze’s surprise, his wife directly blocked the doctor’s “salty fish hand” with her own hand and pointed at him, saying, “This is my husband.” There was no tenderness in her words, simple, stiff, like saying: this is my pet husky.

“Oh, hello, sir.” The male doctor’s expression was a bit awkward. No matter what, flirting with someone’s wife in front of them always felt a little lacking in confidence.

Zhou Ze smiled, greeting him. It seemed his wife was very virtuous... but he couldn't bring himself to be happy. It wasn't about being cuckolded; it was purely about how much better life would be if it were simpler.

“I’ll go check on the other children. They’ve all been treated, and they should be fine. You and your husband should go back and rest early,” the male doctor said before walking away.

Dr. Lin sat down on the bench next to Zhou Ze. She took off her mask and gloves, throwing them on the floor. Zhou Ze saw that her eyes were a little red, and she was gently biting her lip. Clearly, she was in a very bad mood, which meant that the severely injured child couldn’t be saved.

She looked utterly “pitiful and endearing.” Zhou Ze began to understand Xu Le a little. This live-in son-in-law at least earned a lot more than his peers, with the prerequisite that his in-laws’ financial conditions were better than his own. And then there was Dr. Lin; she truly was beautiful.

“Don’t take it to heart. You’ll experience a lot more in the future. Just seek peace of mind,” Zhou Ze, as an experienced person, comforted her. His experience was much richer than his “wife’s,” and his psychological resilience was naturally much stronger.

“Shut up.” The woman replied with these two words. If Zhou Ze had said this as her senior colleague, it would indeed be advice; but now Zhou Ze was Xu Le, and for him to say such words to Dr. Lin was purely speaking without understanding her pain.

“…” Zhou Ze shrugged, inwardly despising Xu Le again. *Look at how cowardly you are, your wife dares to tell you to shut up right outside.*

Dr. Lin, with red eyes, slowly stood up. “I’m going to change. Let’s go home.”

“Okay,” Zhou Ze nodded.

Just then, two nurses pulled open the curtain of the emergency room, revealing the hospital bed inside. A small body lay on the bed, covered with a white sheet. Zhou Ze glanced at it. He had seen many dead people; in all his years in medicine, he had saved many lives, but there were also many patients who died in front of him, for whom he could do nothing.

“Dr. Lin, is this your husband?” A young nurse asked teasingly. They knew Dr. Lin was married, but her husband was different from the boyfriends of other female doctors and nurses; he had never shown up at the hospital before. You couldn’t blame them for making a joke even in the face of death, just like you couldn’t expect those who post about their “purified” and “sincere” souls after one trip to Tibet to stay there for ten years—it’s unrealistic.

“Yes,” Dr. Lin nodded, her emotions having calmed down somewhat by then.

“Then you two should hurry back! Maybe you’ll have some activities tonight, don’t you think? I’m telling you, our Dr. Lin really loves children. You two should hurry home and…”

“Shit!”

“…” The young nurse. Zhou Ze saw the edge of a lily dress peeking out from under the white sheet. His mind exploded with a sudden realization: the unharmed little girl he had just seen, she wasn’t human!
