“Officer, excuse me, what’s my wife’s name again?”

This thought merely flickered through Zhou Ze’s mind; he wasn’t so foolish as to ask aloud. But he genuinely didn’t know what his “wife’s” real name was. In this day and age, few people used their real names for QQ or WeChat accounts.

The greasy man, however, gave Zhou Ze a resentful look. “Brother, that’s not cool. We said we’d be each other’s broken-winged angels, didn’t we?”

Zhou Ze returned a helpless glance. “I’m surprised too.”

The greasy man lowered his head, sighed, and murmured softly, “My dumplings are really good.”

“Let’s go.”

His “wife” said coolly, then turned and walked out.

Zhou Ze could only follow.

She drove a Cayenne and got straight in.

Zhou Ze opened the car door and sat in the passenger seat.

Honestly, it was a bit awkward.

If that unlucky fellow Xu Le’s marital and family life had been more normal, Zhou Ze wouldn’t be in such an embarrassing situation now. He could have found excuses to explain his wife’s concern, like feeling dizzy and not remembering things.

But this woman clearly exuded an ice-goddess aura, seemingly completely uninterested in engaging with him. Even picking him up from the police station felt like a mere formality.

It was like his dog got lost, the security guard found it, and he went to pick it up.

That’s what it felt like.

The woman started the car. She was actually quite young, probably around the same age as him (Xu Le), and several years younger than the original Zhou Ze.

As the car drove onto the elevated road, the woman finally broke the silence:

“Are you okay?”

“Oh, I’m fine,” Zhou Ze replied.

Then, more silence.

The woman felt her husband was unusually quiet today, but she had no desire to explore why.

Just then, the woman’s phone rang. She put it on speaker, and the voice from the other end came through the car stereo:

“Dr. Lin, there was a school bus collision on Youth Central Road just now. Casualties are already being transported to our hospital. The director wants you back immediately.”

Zhou Ze was slightly stunned.

So his wife was also a doctor.

And,

So his wife’s surname was “Lin.”

“I know, I’ll be right back.” The woman hung up, exited the elevated road at the next off-ramp, made a sharp turn at the traffic light, and drove towards the hospital.

She didn’t ask Zhou Ze if he wanted to be dropped off at home or if he wanted to get out and take a taxi back himself. Instead, she drove the car straight into the parking lot of Chongchuan District People’s Hospital.

Honestly, Zhou Ze was worried she’d tell him to get out and take a taxi home, thinking he’d have to shamelessly ask, “Honey, where do we live again? I forgot.”

It just felt so silly.

The woman got out of the car, and Zhou Ze followed. The woman entered the hospital building and got on the elevator, and Zhou Ze followed. The woman entered the women’s changing room, and Zhou Ze…

Zhou Ze sat down on a bench by the corridor.

Just then, the first batch of accident victims arrived. One was severely injured, and five other children also had serious injuries.

Watching his “wife” change into a white coat and get busy with treatment, Zhou Ze could only sit on the bench, staring blankly.

It felt a bit like a mother bringing her son to work, with the mother working and the son watching nearby, playing by himself.

However,

The unique smell of disinfectant in the hospital and the stuffiness of the central air conditioning were truly nostalgic, a familiar feeling.

The emergency room was ahead. The severely injured and critically ill patient seemed to be a girl.

It was a kindergarten school bus accident. Seeing the children crying out in pain on the operating table, the scene was indeed quite heartbreaking.

Zhou Ze pursed his lips. Usually, by now, he would have changed and participated in the treatment. He was Tongcheng’s most famous young surgeon, but now, he could only be a spectator.

This feeling was very uncomfortable, but he could only endure it. Moreover, this People’s Hospital was considered Tongcheng’s best on the surface, and the quantity and quality of its doctors were unquestionable. They should be able to handle it.

Soon, the next batch of children was brought in. Their injuries were minor, only requiring wound treatment or simple bandaging.

Traffic police were stationed at the entrance of the floor, and some parents who had been notified had already arrived, their emotions running high. However, letting parents in at this time could hinder the treatment work, so they had to be held back.

Zhou Ze shook his head, stood up, walked to the window at the far end of the corridor, pushed the window open, and then pulled out a cigarette from his pocket. He smoked, and Xu Le also smoked, which was convenient now.

“Uncle, you can’t smoke in the hospital.”

Just as he bit the cigarette filter, a clear voice of a little girl came from behind Zhou Ze.

Zhou Ze turned around and saw a little girl in a lily dress standing behind him, pouting and glaring at him.

*Cough, cough,*

A bit awkward.

Zhou Ze could only put the cigarette away. No matter what, being lectured by a little girl about public morality was always a bit embarrassing.

“Little one, aren’t you cold wearing so little?” Zhou Ze bent down and asked.

The little girl’s skin was delicate, her face slightly chubby, with big eyes, very cute, like an enlarged Barbie doll.

“Not cold,” the little girl shook her head. “Uncle, you can’t smoke in the hospital again, okay?”

“I know.”

Zhou Ze nodded earnestly.

“Are you okay?” Zhou Ze asked again.

“I’m fine. The other children are all hurt, and they’re in a lot of pain.”

The little girl turned sideways, looking at the other children behind her who were having their wounds bandaged. Most were crying, not necessarily from unbearable pain, but more because one person crying made others cry too.

The nurses were treating wounds while also comforting the children.

Outside, the parents, temporarily held back by the traffic police, were constantly shouting and swearing.

In short,

This floor felt chaotic.

“Then you’re really lucky,” Zhou Ze sighed.

The little girl didn’t have a single scratch on her body.

“Mm-hm, I was in the very back row, so I’m fine.” The little girl nodded, then actively ran over to comfort her classmates, checking on them here and there, encouraging and soothing them.

She was a very sensible and strong child.

Zhou Ze turned around, subconsciously pulled out a cigarette again, then thought better of it and put it back.

When he walked back to the bench and sat down, three nurses and two doctors came out of the emergency room ahead.

One male doctor and one female doctor, the female doctor being his wife.

“It’s okay, we did our best,” the male doctor said, reaching out to put a comforting hand on Zhou Ze’s wife’s shoulder.

As a husband,

Zhou Ze was sitting right there,

But he didn’t find this scene offensive…

That damn Xu Le had left him such a complicated mess: a live-in son-in-law, a notoriously short-tempered sister-in-law, and equally ill-tempered in-laws.

Zhou Ze wished his wife would hurry up and have an affair, dump him, divorce him, and then he could find some peace and quiet alone.

Who, after dying and being reborn into a new body, would bother with the myriad flavors of a live-in son-in-law’s life in a modern city?

However, what surprised Zhou Ze was that his wife actually pushed away the doctor’s “salty fish hand”* and pointed at him, saying:

“This is my husband.”

There was no tenderness in her words, just simple, bluntness, like saying, “This is my husky.”

“Oh, hello, sir.” The male doctor’s face was a bit awkward. No matter what, flirting with someone’s wife right in front of them always left one feeling a little unsure.

Zhou Ze smiled, acknowledging him. It seemed his wife was very virtuous… but he couldn’t feel happy about it. It wasn’t about being cuckolded.

It was simply that a simpler life would be so much better.

“I’ll go check over there again. The other children have all been taken care of, so there shouldn’t be any problems. You two should go home and rest early,” the male doctor said before leaving.

Dr. Lin sat down on the bench next to Zhou Ze. She took off her mask and gloves, throwing them on the floor.

Zhou Ze saw that her eyes were a little red, and she was biting her lip, clearly in a bad mood, which meant the severely injured child hadn’t been saved.

She looked utterly “pitiable.”**

Zhou Ze felt a bit of understanding for Xu Le now. This live-in son-in-law at least earned more than his peers, with the premise that his in-laws were better off than him. And then there was Dr. Lin; she really was beautiful.

“Don’t take it to heart. You’ll experience much more of this in the future. Just seek peace of mind,” Zhou Ze, as a seasoned veteran, offered comfort from the side. His experience was far richer than his “wife’s,” and his psychological resilience naturally much stronger.

“Shut up.”

The woman retorted with those two words. If Zhou Ze had said such things in his original capacity as a senior, it would have been guidance.

But Zhou Ze was now Xu Le, and for him to say such things to Dr. Lin was purely speaking without feeling the pain.

“…” Zhou Ze shrugged, mentally despising Xu Le again. *Look how much of a wimp you are, your wife dares to tell you to shut up outside.*

Dr. Lin, with red eyes, slowly stood up. “I’m going to change. Let’s go home.”

“Okay,” Zhou Ze nodded.

Just then, two nurses pulled open the emergency room curtain, revealing a hospital bed inside. A small body lay on it, covered with a white sheet.

Zhou Ze glanced at it. He had seen plenty of dead people. In his years of practicing medicine, he had saved many lives, but there were also many patients he had been helpless to save, who died right in front of him.

“Dr. Lin, is this your husband?” a young nurse asked teasingly. They knew Dr. Lin was married, but her husband was different from the boyfriends of other female doctors and nurses; he had never shown up at the hospital before.

You couldn’t blame them for making a joke in the face of death. It was like expecting those who post on social media after one trip to Tibet about how their souls were purified and how moved and pious they feel to live there for ten years—it’s unrealistic.

“Yes,” Dr. Lin nodded, her emotions having calmed down a bit by then.

“Then you two should hurry back! You might have some activities waiting for you at home, don’t you think so?

Let me tell you, our Dr. Lin really loves children, so you two should hurry home to….”

“F**k!”

“…” The young nurse.

Zhou Ze saw the lily dress hem peeking out from under the white sheet. His mind boomed, and he suddenly realized that the little girl he had just seen, completely unharmed,

She wasn’t human!
